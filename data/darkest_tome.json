      "description": "Power Limiter Coat [100CP] (Resident Evil) Sometimes you just need to go with style along with purpose. This large, black overcoat (or any color really, it’s your call) is usually given to the Tyrant series of B.O.W.s in order to control the mutations they may experience, and to keep them from going into a 'Super Tyrant' mode. But for you, it can be utilized to limit any abilities you may possess, even being altered to limit specific abilities and not others. As a bonus the coat is also extremely bullet-resistant, giving a great deal of protection to the wearer. Just watch your head. Should you desire it, this coat will also come with an exceptionally stylish hat which will release a small amount of your ability if someone’s stupid enough to knock it off. β Hetero Nonserotonin [100CP] (Resident Evil) Umbrella has done some pretty nasty things for the sake of creating and improving their bioweapons. For instance, take a special hormone secreted from the pituitary gland during the later stages of puberty. Using it on something like a B.O.W. would significantly increase its levels of ferocity and brutality and make them better weapons. Only problem is, it can’t be harvested from corpses and taking it from patients under anesthetics would dull the results. So Umbrella often just takes it from vivisections on conscious children. You however, have a nice supply of the stuff that replenishes itself when you run out. There’s a manual to dictate how to... procure it from people if you’re into that sort of thing, though. P30 Injector [100CP*] (Resident Evil) If you’re the type to simply want obedient soldiers who never question you, then you’re probably going to want this. A red device that’s surgically grafted onto the chest of the recipient, this device would continually subject said recipient to a chemical that not only improves the user’s strength and agility a little beyond peak human performance but also renders them very obedient and subject to control. In effect, this would make someone the ultimate super soldier so long as they had this device on their chest. It also comes with the formula to make more P30 and more Injector devices. Scarab: But for an additional +50CP it can be upgraded to a mobile ‘Scarab’ device which can latch on to a host by themselves and give the benefits above. Connection Chip [100CP] (Resident Evil) Not everyone wants to deal with nasty parasites in order to control their weapons of mass biological destruction. Sometimes they want a more stable solution. This computer chip can be planted in a B.O.W.'s brain, and as a result linked up to a computer through which to control your minions as needed, or even just to gather combat data. If you like, it can even just be used to feed additional data and help improve a B.O.W.’s combat prowess while leaving any sapience intact. Just beware they don't mutate to the point where it breaks the chip.",

      "source": "Fate Grand Order",
      "description": "It seems you’ve gotten hold of a peculiar goblet. Golden in both mundane and mystical glimmers, this little cup shimmering with magical energy is nothing more than a Holy Grail, an immensely powerful artifact, commonly held to be a wish-granting object due to its vast powers. Fundamentally speaking, Holy Grails are incredibly powerful generators of magical energy, and possession of one makes the usage of said energy easy even for those unskilled in magecraft. Perhaps some examples of their use should be presented. One of the foremost and most iconic powers of these Grails is the summoning of Servants, which also allows you to modify them slightly such as giving them the Madness Enhancement skill. If you do not have the time to gather the energy required for a Servant summon, you can still use it to quickly conjure a number of phantom Servants, little more than shadows of true Servants, useful as mooks if nothing else. Additionally, one of the major uses of them you might see in this world is the support of a Singularity, which shall be explained later in the Distortion In The Timeline section. Of course, the Holy Grail is called wish-granting for a reason, although the ‘wishes’ it can grant must still be relatively grounded in the physical world. Summoning endless amounts of nutritious and delicious food would be trivial, as would redecorating a room in seconds. They can also be utilized to reinforce magical effects and rituals, providing vast amounts of magical energy and mystical stability. The Holy Grails are the core of Goetia’s plan to incinerate history, and Chaldea will gather quite a number of them in the time to come. As such, you can also purchase additional Grails after this first one by spending an extra 200cp per Holy Grail. Should you have discounted this item, this extra surcharge will be reduced to 100cp per additional Holy Grail instead. And finally, your first Grail also comes with some knowledge on how to make more of them, as difficult as it is even while possessing one already. What shall you do with such power in your hands?",

      "description": "NE-α Type Parasite Sample [100CP*] (Resident Evil) Eugh, this is kind of creepy. Not satisfied with using viral agents, Umbrella designed a parasite which was capable of affecting the host's brain and enhancing its intellect while increasing susceptibility to suggestions... making the host a perfect soldier. At least, if it was compatible... if it wasn't, the host would die within twenty minutes. Beta: For an additional +100CP you may collect a NE-β Type Parasite instead, which is a larger spider-type parasite that increases the speed, intelligence, strength and durability of the 'host', be it zombie or human. Plant 43 Sample [100CP] (Resident Evil) It’s one thing to be worried about anything breathing, but once you start weaponizing the flora of the world then all bets are off. Enter this genetically engineered plant that Umbrella created based off of data from Plant 42. Not only does this plant attack others and feed off of their blood if given the chance, but it can also implant seedlings inside people or corpses to infest them, turning them into Ivy Zombies that only flame can truly eliminate. Such a parasitic nightmare will make one think twice before braving the outdoors. Las Plagas Parasite [200CP*] (Resident Evil) What is it with these people and parasites? Well, if you wish. The Las Plagas Parasite is a creature that attaches itself to the nervous system inside the body, ensuring there's no outward signs save for coughing, occasional bleeding, or reddening of the irises among other things. But once implanted and developed, the host gains a tremendous resistance to pain and damage along with increasing the strength of the host... to say nothing of potential mutations, voluntary or otherwise. As a bonus they also can form a hivemind via ultrasonic frequencies. Just watch out for that UV light weakness. Queen: For an additional +100CP, you may also gain a Queen Plaga sample, which allows one to produce both Dominant and Subordinate-type Plaga. Mold Sample [200CP] (Resident Evil) There’s been viruses and there’s been parasites. But this takes the ideal of biological warfare and turns nature itself against humanity, all in the name of advancing profit and control. This little item is a sample of the pathogenic fungus known as the Mold, and it is capable of helping the host regenerate as well as getting some strength. However, there is a price. Most infectees end up becoming monstrous creatures, while even the human infectees are controlled by the primary 'host' akin to a hive mind. It’s heinous, but extremely effective in skilled hands.

      "description": "Across these vast waters, strange fruits can be found, hidden in every nook and cranny. These strange fruits are known as Devil Fruits and once eaten, these fruits will bestow upon its eater an equally strange ability. But such power comes at a cost, a terrible curse. Once one eats a Devil Fruit, they will possess a weakness to Seastone and shall no longer be able to swim, their very strength sapped away once submerged in water. Needless to say, in a world such as this, such a weakness is paramount to defeat. Nevertheless, one cannot deny the might a Devil Fruit eater can possess and so, it is only fitting that you have a chance to possess your own Devil Fruit. And much like how not all men are equal, not every Devil Fruit is as mighty as others. As such, the Devil Fruits available to you will be split into three tiers, depending on how useful and powerful they are. You may purchase more than one Devil Fruit but remember that one can normally partake of only a single Devil Fruit. Ordinarily, any attempt to do so would cause the consumer’s body to tear itself to such a degree that only a little trace of their remains would be left. But, perhaps you can find a way around that. Or maybe you already have? Now, before you make a decision, it would be wise to know a few more things about Devil Fruits. For one thing, Devils Fruits are categorized into three separate groups. Those three groups being Logia, Paramecia, and Zoan. The Logia are the rarest among Devil Fruits and they allow to transform their body into that of a natural element such as fire or smoke. Zoan fruits allow their to eater to transform into an animal such as a bull, a leopard, or even something as ancient as a dinosaur. Finally, we have the Paramecia, the most common of the Devil Fruits. The abilities a Paramecia bestows are as varied as the life within the world itself. Devil Fruits - Tier 1 (-400CP) All Devil Fruits are an undeniably useful boon, regardless of the powers they grant. Each fruit only grants one ability, though they are often extremely flexible in their application. You can only have one Devil Fruit power, as any more would normally kill you. Additionally, eating one of these means that you will lose access to your ability to swim. With each purchase of this, you will gain your very own Devil Fruit, albeit a weak one. Most Zoan fruits would fall under this category, as would fruits like the Smooth-Smooth Fruit, or the Kilo-Kilo Fruit. Devil Fruits - Tier 2 (-800CP) All Devil Fruits are good to have, their benefits wide and varied, but ones of this tier are fairly average. Most Paramecia fruits would fall under this category, as would the Ancient Zoan fruits or Logias such as the Snow-Snow fruit. You will receive one of these fruits with each purchase. Devil Fruits - Tier 3 (-1200CP) While all Devil Fruits are valuable assets, these are among the most powerful in all the seas. Most Logia fruits would fall under this category, as would the Mythical Zoans, and fruits like the Tremor-Tremor Fruit or the Op-Op Fruit. You will receive one of these fruits with each purchase. (Editor’s Note: I’ve doubled each tier’s price. Mostly due to the fact of how Devil Fruit’s bend and develop more based on a user’s creativity, imagination, and understanding. Along with a willingness to try the ideas a user may perceive being possible for their fruit. This video here will probably explain it better, but I think it’s a good idea to go off.)",

      "description": "The Code Keys, seven relics of legend; each one tied to one of the seven wavelengths of the human soul known as Sins, and by purchasing this option you have become the bearer of one of them. Those who make use of these relics transform into an image of the Demon Lord of the corresponding Sin; allowing even humans to wield an emulation of their power. However, these forms don’t correspond to evolutionary stages, and neither are they strengthened by experience or hard work. Instead it is the strength of the Sin Wavelength in the user’s soul corresponding to the Code Key that fuels its strength; and while a Blazing Soul might find some use from them, it’s true power can only be achieved by those who fuel it with properly aligned D.N.A.; regardless of how weak their potential might be. In this sense an ill-suited user might barely be a match for one or two Champion level digimon; yet someone driven by the desperate desire for familial love might wield enough power to take on entire squadrons of Ultimate level digimon, or elite megas. However, there's a catch. As these relics are in truth traps set by Lucemon Falldown Mode after his defeat long ago; parasites meant to trap their users in a dreamlike world while an emulation of the Demon runs amok, driven by their host’s desires like a Renegade would. Even those rare few with wills strong enough to resistant that trap must struggle not to be overcome by their rampant Sin, and make themselves vulnerable to Lucemon’s influence. Ensuring that they will spread havok and weaken the land, even as they gather power for their creator’s release; the only exception being their use to enhance a partner digimon being enhanced by their human partner, the nature of their digivice’s link allowing the digimon to use their human’s Sin to fuel the transformation without risk of rampancy. While you could attempt to collect them the hard way, and risk playing into Lucemon Falldown Mode’s plot; obtaining them through here will allow you to align them to you, rather than their creator. Firstly their tie to Lucemon will be severed; preventing him from influencing you, or using your D.N.A. to free himself from his seal. Secondly, the Code Key will be better tuned to your own Sin; allowing you to wield power comparable to at least an ultimate level digimon regardless of your own Sin Wavelength, and removing the risk of rampancy. Moreover, such alignment may alter the transformation it provides, where before it might only affect the emulation’s persona; allowing it to transform you into a unique digimon form that truly embodies the nature and expression of your SIN, rather than a cheap copy of an existing demon lord. (Editor’s Note: The price above is the combined price of each individual code key (of which there are seven in total), of which I increased their individual prices from 300CP to 500CP each. And to add more to it, if you manage to get all seven, you are given knowledge on how to perform a ritual in summoning Lucemon: Falldown Mode. If you have the Data Link Digivice freebie, you could have him as your Digimon Partner. If you don’t, then you can simply have him act as a patron. Alternatively, you can be given knowledge to use each Code Key to make a Digiegg that hatches into the evolution line specific to the Sin used.)",

      "description": "Across these vast waters, strange fruits can be found, hidden in every nook and cranny. These strange fruits are known as Devil Fruits and once eaten, these fruits will bestow upon its eater an equally strange ability. But such power comes at a cost, a terrible curse. Once one eats a Devil Fruit, they will possess a weakness to Seastone and shall no longer be able to swim, their very strength sapped away once submerged in water. Needless to say, in a world such as this, such a weakness is paramount to defeat. Nevertheless, one cannot deny the might a Devil Fruit eater can possess and so, it is only fitting that you have a chance to possess your own Devil Fruit. And much like how not all men are equal, not every Devil Fruit is as mighty as others. As such, the Devil Fruits available to you will be split into three tiers, depending on how useful and powerful they are. You may purchase more than one Devil Fruit but remember that one can normally partake of only a single Devil Fruit. Ordinarily, any attempt to do so would cause the consumer’s body to tear itself to such a degree that only a little trace of their remains would be left. But, perhaps you can find a way around that. Or maybe you already have? Now, before you make a decision, it would be wise to know a few more things about Devil Fruits. For one thing, Devils Fruits are categorized into three separate groups. Those three groups being Logia, Paramecia, and Zoan. The Logia are the rarest among Devil Fruits and they allow to transform their body into that of a natural element such as fire or smoke. Zoan fruits allow their to eater to transform into an animal such as a bull, a leopard, or even something as ancient as a dinosaur. Finally, we have the Paramecia, the most common of the Devil Fruits. The abilities a Paramecia bestows are as varied as the life within the world itself. Devil Fruits - Tier 1 (-400CP) All Devil Fruits are an undeniably useful boon, regardless of the powers they grant. Each fruit only grants one ability, though they are often extremely flexible in their application. You can only have one Devil Fruit power, as any more would normally kill you. Additionally, eating one of these means that you will lose access to your ability to swim. With each purchase of this, you will gain your very own Devil Fruit, albeit a weak one. Most Zoan fruits would fall under this category, as would fruits like the Smooth-Smooth Fruit, or the Kilo-Kilo Fruit. Devil Fruits - Tier 2 (-800CP) All Devil Fruits are good to have, their benefits wide and varied, but ones of this tier are fairly average. Most Paramecia fruits would fall under this category, as would the Ancient Zoan fruits or Logias such as the Snow-Snow fruit. You will receive one of these fruits with each purchase. Devil Fruits - Tier 3 (-1200CP) While all Devil Fruits are valuable assets, these are among the most powerful in all the seas. Most Logia fruits would fall under this category, as would the Mythical Zoans, and fruits like the Tremor-Tremor Fruit or the Op-Op Fruit. You will receive one of these fruits with each purchase. (Editor’s Note: I’ve doubled each tier’s price. Mostly due to the fact of how Devil Fruit’s bend and develop more based on a user’s creativity, imagination, and understanding. Along with a willingness to try the ideas a user may perceive being possible for their fruit. This video here will probably explain it better, but I think it’s a good idea to go off.)",

      "source": "500CPx7)] (Digimon Data Squad",
      "description": "The Code Keys, seven relics of legend; each one tied to one of the seven wavelengths of the human soul known as Sins, and by purchasing this option you have become the bearer of one of them. Those who make use of these relics transform into an image of the Demon Lord of the corresponding Sin; allowing even humans to wield an emulation of their power. However, these forms don’t correspond to evolutionary stages, and neither are they strengthened by experience or hard work. Instead it is the strength of the Sin Wavelength in the user’s soul corresponding to the Code Key that fuels its strength; and while a Blazing Soul might find some use from them, it’s true power can only be achieved by those who fuel it with properly aligned D.N.A.; regardless of how weak their potential might be. In this sense an ill-suited user might barely be a match for one or two Champion level digimon; yet someone driven by the desperate desire for familial love might wield enough power to take on entire squadrons of Ultimate level digimon, or elite megas. However, there's a catch. As these relics are in truth traps set by Lucemon Falldown Mode after his defeat long ago; parasites meant to trap their users in a dreamlike world while an emulation of the Demon runs amok, driven by their host’s desires like a Renegade would. Even those rare few with wills strong enough to resistant that trap must struggle not to be overcome by their rampant Sin, and make themselves vulnerable to Lucemon’s influence. Ensuring that they will spread havok and weaken the land, even as they gather power for their creator’s release; the only exception being their use to enhance a partner digimon being enhanced by their human partner, the nature of their digivice’s link allowing the digimon to use their human’s Sin to fuel the transformation without risk of rampancy. While you could attempt to collect them the hard way, and risk playing into Lucemon Falldown Mode’s plot; obtaining them through here will allow you to align them to you, rather than their creator. Firstly their tie to Lucemon will be severed; preventing him from influencing you, or using your D.N.A. to free himself from his seal. Secondly, the Code Key will be better tuned to your own Sin; allowing you to wield power comparable to at least an ultimate level digimon regardless of your own Sin Wavelength, and removing the risk of rampancy. Moreover, such alignment may alter the transformation it provides, where before it might only affect the emulation’s persona; allowing it to transform you into a unique digimon form that truly embodies the nature and expression of your SIN, rather than a cheap copy of an existing demon lord. (Editor’s Note: The price above is the combined price of each individual code key (of which there are seven in total), of which I increased their individual prices from 300CP to 500CP each. And to add more to it, if you manage to get all seven, you are given knowledge on how to perform a ritual in summoning Lucemon: Falldown Mode. If you have the Data Link Digivice freebie, you could have him as your Digimon Partner. If you don’t, then you can simply have him act as a patron. Alternatively, you can be given knowledge to use each Code Key to make a Digiegg that hatches into the evolution line specific to the Sin used.)",

      "description": "Also known as the Bends o' the Bow or the Wizard’s Rainbow, this set consists of thirteen coloured spheres Maerlyn spun from the waters of the Prim into glass. Whispering secret words, he divided the white magic into twelve tainted magical strands. Finally, he rolled the strands into spheres. When nothing was left in his hands but shadow, Maerlyn rolled a black ball. The first twelve represent the Twelve Guardians of the Beams, each having the secret of a different form of magic; the last, Black Thirteen, represents the Dark Tower itself, which was filled with the evil of the monster-infested void that existed between worlds. Some of these magic balls look into the future; others look into the past or into alternative realities, and some have the power to transport the user to places as well as to show. They can pierce through all manner of wards and defences to show what they will, and are potent enough that any human with no talents in magic could use them. Other balls may summon things to them - perhaps from the demon infested worlds, or show only vile acts most people would wish kept secret. One is said to give the power of levitation, and another the secrets of telepathy. But all are cursed to bring despair and sorrow to those who wield them, and all of the balls are alive and hungry. A person begins by using them, but in the end, he or she is used by them and sucked dry - be it of their life, their youth, their soul or their will (it depends on the ball). Though magic is by nature neither good nor bad, these spheres bring only sorrow to their users, and the black contains only the evil of the void. The Thirteen colours consist of: Crimson, Orange, Yellow, Pink, Dark Blue, Dark Green, Indigo, Lime, Azure, Violet, Brown, Pearl Grey, and Black. Each allows their user to see things beyond the bounds of the world they live in, and assists in going Todash. If the viewer does not have anything in particular they desire to see, it will direct them to whatever they know will hold their attention, and so gain a hold over them. They are completely indestructible, and cannot be contained for long. They each represent a corruption of the pure energy of the WHITE. If the WHITE represents wholeness, and the best human beings can strive for in ideal and action, then the debased colours of the rainbow represent the baser emotions, or the fallen drives of a fallen world. For example, the pink (Maerlyn’s Grapefruit) resonates with sexual energy, but it is desire, possessiveness, and cruelty without the higher emotions that true love can instil.",

But the usage of incense has long been a part of ritual works, and their power holds true even outside of those undertakings. You have the knowledge required to create a variety of strange powders that, when burned, provide some utility in combat- slight as it may seem. Poisonous vapour, fumes that fortify the body, and gases that heighten agility. These powders may even have other uses; a volatile mix of gunpowder may explode when thrown to the ground, throwing off aim, and another may be applied to the body to increase resistance to a variety of ailments- at least until sweat washes it away.",

      "description": "To the Abyssals, the living essence of Creation is effervescent and cloying at the same time, making their skin crawl. Direct sunlight compounds this nauseating discomfort.To overcome these annoyances, most deathknights adopt the trappings of the dead and the Underworld when they venture into Creation. They wear funeral shrouds and adorn themselves with skulls and bones, whether actual articles of bone or skeletal images in their clothing and jewelry. When they travel as heralds for their Deathlords, they hire a train of mourners to follow and wail their misery. They dress all in black or all in white. They sleep in coffins. They wear leather plague masks with cruel beaks and staring crystal eyes. They cool themselves with folding fans made of bone and human skin. Any affectation or adornment that would remind an onlooker of death, the grave, the Great Contagion or the Abyss itself suffices. Such dreadful trappings help an Abyssal to center themselves and align his Essence in a more comfortable way. They do not allow him to respire Essence in Creation, but they do eliminate the annoying discomfort that being in Creation inflicts on him. Of course, adorning themselves with such paraphernalia of death can come across as trying a bit too hard for some deathknights. However, this is unacceptable for the Moonshadow Caste, as they must be the envoys and representatives of the Deathlords and the Neverborn themselves. Accordingly, you have been blessed with a wraithly sense of style and morbid presentation. Knowing exactly how to wear you funereal outfits, you will be a vision in black, looking absolutely amazing when adorned with bone, funerary shroud, and other trappings. But more than owning merely the gothic look, this will also aid you in adopting a properly dark demeanor and yet still be taken serious, and even the elaborate titles of the Abyssal Exalted will be given the trepidation and weight in the minds of onlookers they deserve, no matter how long-winded or pretentious they might be.",

      "description": "Pumpkin Pile [50CP] (Exalted: Abyssals) Some of Creation’s cultures have associated the carving of effigy-faces into pumpkins and gourds as a part of their traditional celebrations of the dead. Appropriately, you’ll be able to get into that too with this. Whether for celebrations, simply having them as food, or more sinister reasons, this supply of either pumpkins or gourds will last you at least until the Void swallows Creation. Perfectly sized and formed to be carved into a head-sized effigy, they are readily carved with just a bit more ease than other examples of their kind would be. Grave Goods of the Underworld [100CP*] (Exalted: Abyssals) The first and usually most important form of memoriam a ghost receives. When a ghost manifests in the Underworld for any length of time, even if they enter Lethe just hours later, any goods sacrificed in their memory as part of their burial rites also manifest as grave goods. To the benefit of ghosts, this manifestation is idealized rather than literal. Items of paper or cheap wood translate into gifts of exceptional quality. Objects covered in gold paint become real gold. Even sacrifices of food have value. A jug of wine buried with a dead body provides the ghost with a magical jug that never runs dry, while a simple basket of bread might become an Underworld artifact that is perpetually full of nourishing loaves. All grave goods have unusual properties. Such goods are almost always of exceptional quality, and all such goods are generally self-repairing so long as they remain in the possession of their rightful owner. However, like so much of the Underworld, grave goods are tied to the realm of the dead and disintegrate instantly and permanently if exposed to the light of Creation’s sun. Grave goods can endure sunlight while in the safety of a shadowland, however, or even in Creation during Calibration. These grave goods can also be given away or sold, and continue to grant their magical benefits to the new owner, provided they were given willingly. As such, you may purchase some of these grave goods for yourself here, at 100 cp for one of these humble offerings made into a significant items in the Underworld. While they are not truly artifacts, their fine make, unusual properties, and self-repair should still prove useful to one such as you. And just to sweeten this deal, should they be disintegrated by the light of the sunlit lands, they will be restored in your warehouse at dusk.",

Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. Armor [50CP] (Terraria) Sets of armored clothing that can provide a variety of benefits. Each set of armor comes with a headpiece, chest piece, and leg piece, and offers some sort of set benefit when all worn together. All backgrounds get a discount on the first Armor purchase. Accessories [50CP] (Terraria) A wide variety of helpful items that can provide various useful benefits to you. Unlike in the game, your only limit on using these is your ability to wear them all on your body. (Editor’s Note: The options for what you can choose and the added levels of purchases for higher items are in the Terraria Jump, that can be found in the Indexes of Part 1. Also, for all three, only those that fit with the theme of the Tome may be purchased.)",

When Macdonald Gargan, then the host of Venom, was on Osborn’s Payroll but Anti-Venom was giving him trouble, a bit of the Anti-Venom Symbiote injected into Freak produced this crime against humanity: A hyper-concentrated form of living abyss saturated with horrible, mutant forms of every disease and toxin Freak had in his system. One dose of this will heal and empower a symbiote or similar organism to a noticeable degree, will seriously mess up an Anti-Venom symbiote or similar organism (except yours if you have that perk,) or if properly diluted could horribly kill millions of people.

Savages carry things like medicine and ammunition more often, or even the rare weapon part, and even the mutants may carry things like good cloth from the scraps of their clothes or other remnants of their humanity- and perhaps they’ll even have swallowed something useful from one of their victims.

They do seem to respond very fervently whenever they’re in the presence of living beings – as the Kodama themselves seem to trip off some sort of reaction in them. Thankfully, the jar is sealed tightly enough that there’s very little risk of a containment breach. Exposed to a living being however, these worms latch onto them like a symbiote – or perhaps it would be better to call them a parasite instead. Though even a single worm alone can provide great strength to their host, it isn’t for free. The worms grow and thrive off of negative emotions, and while they can sap these emotions off of their host, eventually they’ll grow to a substantial enough size that they can develop a “will” of their own. Too many worms, and it may become a mental competition just for the host to retain control of their body. While it is pretty much impossible to miss the presence of these worms, once attached, nothing short of complete amputation will detach the parasite – and naturally, you’ll find that depending on what organ or body part the worm was attached to, amputation might not even be an option.",

Well don’t worry: this combination animatronic and wearable suit has been scrubbed of any potential lawsuit material. What, the springlocks were the concern? Don’t worry about it, the failure rate on these things is… low, let’s just leave it at low. If you wear this suit, which comes designed as any anthropomorphic animal you desire, you instantly gain an effect wherein children just adore you, and adults view you as harmless. Good for stealth! It can also go into animatronic mode, wherein it will automatically look after any small humans within earshot, taking care of them with whatever food and supplies are at hand, even playing a handful of pre-programmed songs. Only the best for the children! (Editor’s Note: Purchasing of the Mire In Misery perk and choosing to implement the Anomaly Drawback will cause this perk to be capstone boosted.

But it is also a treasure much desired by the Abyssal Exalted, as it is a way for one being to give their very life’s blood to another. Rumors persist that the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears holds it in her private collection, and that she permits her Abyssal Exalted to sanctify marriages with it. When it is held by a person who truly wishes to give of themselves for another’s sake, it slowly begins to fill with dark blood, and as it does, the holder loses blood and health. At any time, the holder may stop this process. If the blood in the cup is then given to a wounded person to drink, they will recover health in proportion to the blood they drink as they drink, until all the blood in the cup is consumed. It is possible for a person to drain themselves to unconsciousness and the verge of while trying to heal others with the cup, but on the flipside it also allows those on the verge of death to recover nigh-instantly as they drink of the red liquid.",

Once it does reach this point however, it’ll start spiritually enhancing all of the plants around it as well, until the entire forest becomes a nest of spiritual life. Kodama tend to pop up from this tree once fully grown and like other nature spirits, they seem happy to tend to plants around them. Just be wary that given enough time, the Kodama won’t be the only spiritual creatures around, so be careful of what settles within the forest.

Using the power of a behelit requires you to sacrifice someone dear to you. Someone sacrificed in this way is condemned to Hell, caught in a swirling maelstrom of tortured souls for all eternity. This behelit is intended for you. As such, even if it were to be stolen from you, it will inevitably find its way back to your possession, likely at the moment you finally intend to use it. Once used, the Godhand will be summoned and you will be given the choice to sacrifice someone dear to you in order to gain the powers of an Apostle. If you choose to go through with it, you will condemn that person to Hell, and be transformed. At said time, you immediately gain all of the standard abilities of the Apostle, and you can choose up to 100 CP in Apostle powers. If you so choose, when purchasing this item, you can spend more CP. Whenever you eventually use the behelit and become an Apostle, you will be able to choose an amount of Apostle powers equal to half the CP you spent on the behelit. Strange as it may seem, even an Apostle may utilize a Behelit to further increase their own powers. However, any time a Behelit is used, a suitable sacrifice must be made, and most Apostles do not possess the capability or desire to form the intimate bonds required to be used as a sacrifice. If the Behelit is used, and the Godhand summoned, a sacrifice must be offered and accepted; else the summoner themselves is torn from the mortal coil and sent to Hell. This item can be used at any time, even post-Jump. If used post-Jump, the members of the Godhand may not be the ones you remember, as they will reflect the setting you use it in. That said, the cost will always be the same. (Editor’s Note: The Apostle powers list can be found in the Berserk jump. And this item’s effect can be enhanced with an amount of CP of your choosing.)",

S/he can cure all your Madness, anything short of full metamorphosis into a Nightmare anyways. If you keep your sense of self together, you’ll find all your mental issues resolved.

Anything with a shard of the Laughing Mirror within them loses the ability to see the good in the world. Love shrivels on the vine; all altruism appears as naked grifting; and purity turns to naivete of the highest absurdity. This corrupts magic as well, turning scrying instruments into tools that can only reveal upsetting or lurid secrets. Blessings fester into curses; healing magic worsens wounds; and sentient things spawn a core of malice. Technically, the effects could be reversed if the microscopic shard were identified and completely purged. However, this is complicated by the fact that the corruption will simply appear natural to all magical scans and the wound rapidly heals around the original penetration site. Identifying this tiny sliver as the source of the problem would take extremely sensitive tools / magic / perks. If not removed, the effects are permanent.",

This tome holds instructions to further your understanding of any form of magic you may possess, but especially necromancy, curses, and other dark magics, and will accelerate your own rate of learning for such magics significantly. It never seems to run out of ways to instruct you, either, always having more to share. Additionally, it has a spirit within its pages, the source of the curse the necronomicon is known for, a powerful necromancer that can offer you personal instruction, provide access to his own necromantic power and abilities, and can possess an undead creature to give some personal attention to a project, though their time is somewhat limited as they must return to the pages of the necronomicon within a day and must spend ten times however long they spent outside the book within it. Finally, there is an internal storage of sorts that undead creatures can be placed into, which can then have copies summoned by spending magical power from the book or your own reserves, with necromantically inclined power being far more efficient. The more powerful the undead to be summoned, the more costly it is, but it requires nobody to summon and only needs the raw power to draw on.

Originally taken from a young girl who had been brought to a local clinic after surviving a homicidal attack, these cells exhibit the same invasive properties that the anomaly “Tomie” boasts. In an isolated environment, these cells are already dangerous enough due to their ability to undergo cellular division at rates far higher than anything known to man. Left alone under ambient conditions, the cells will be able to recreate a living human girl in days, with that time reducing down to hours if the cells are exposed to favourable conditions such as intense radiation or environments with a large concentration of nutrients. Unfortunately, this does mean that if the cells are transplanted onto a living being, they’ll transform that creature into something that resembles a human female. The lack of a complete transformation is a sign that these cells are “defective” to a degree. Whereas the original Tomie’s cells would never fail to recreate Tomie, the subjugation trait of these cells only extends so far as to create an approximation using provided “victim” sample. Thankfully, the “possessive” beauty trait that Tomie is known for is also expressed to a slightly less intense degree, so at least you don’t need to worry about people becoming homicidal maniacs because of your creations.",

Whether you want to roll the dice or not you’ll find that you are able to get more out of your mushrooms, strange meat, and other Essence sources- roughly double what you’d normally get. With the possibility that you’ll find more advanced ovens and tools to extract more Essence anyways, this ensures that you’ll have a rapid progression on your treatments. For better or for worse. Post-Jump you’ll find that this works on “experience”, as well as other similar forms of progression. Fewer Side-Effects [100CP] (Darkwood) You may wish to take away some of the anxiety that comes from injecting strange substances. With this, you’ll find that the side-effects of using Essence- and other drugs, such as alcohol if you’re the type that drinks moonshine from the bottle- have been reduced in severity. For example, it’s possible that others who inject Essence might find that their sensitivity to poison has doubled, which would make stepping on a mushroom patch a death sentence without medical aid. But if you were to gain the same vulnerability, the effect would be much less severe; you would still get hurt worse than a normal person would, but not as badly as someone with the undilute vulnerability. With alcohol, you might find yourself sobering up in just a half hour after getting drunk on moonshine.

If the Kodamas staying far away from it wasn’t a good enough sign, the strange fashion in which the bow seems to writhe and pulse should be more than enough to set off warning bells. The draw weight of this bow is immense, even if the actual effort required to fully draw the bow is much less in actuality – in essence the bow seems to amplify the effects of the draw, changing normal arrows into body splitting projectiles. The wounds from this bow seem to fester and become infected easily – so it would perhaps to wise to use this prudently. If you grow accustomed to using it, you might start hearing voices...voices that seem to come from the bow itself. A bow can’t be sentient right? The Cursed Flintlock [300CP] (Princess Mononoke) The people who went across the sea came back with weapons that spewed out fire and steel, but it was the people of this land who took those weapons and turned them against the old gods. This weapon has seen to the end of several such spirits and with each one that it devours, the weapon itself seems to grow more deadly, its reach seems to grow further. As it happens to be just a little bigger than a flintlock rifle, even a young child could wield this with practice. As a weapon that was made to take down any foe be it man or spirit, this weapon consumes spiritual energy for each shot, but also absorbs spiritual energy from its kills. By consuming larger amounts of spiritual energy, it can handily pierce not only magical barriers – but it can also render ineffective the natural regenerative abilities of magical and spiritual creatures. The curse itself seems to hold the projectile in place, rendering your aim true for longer ranges – and as the curse itself grows in strength, so too does the effective range of this flintlock. Be wary however, that the more you feed the beast, the more it will demand. As such, it is best if you remember to be a stern master and not yield to the flintlock’s thirst for death too often. Keep the flintlock’s hunger under control, and it should prove to be a useful asset. Let it run wild...and you may have a hard time controlling it from killing everything in its path. And of course, even if you’re confident that you can keep this murder tool under control – you should probably be wary of others, should you let them utilize this weapon.",

Well, maybe not the only sample. This strange soulsteel cylinder contains a green soup that reanimates any dead who touch its putrid vapors, and unlike its counterpart, does not have a small crack. Anyone who suffers a wound from a zombie infected with this plague is exposed, whereupon victims first feel the disease’s effects after a mere handful of hours. The victim’s skin grays. Necrosis of thin tissues occurs, and the skin starts to peel away. The victim grows hungry but cannot be satisfied. She grows frail and is increasingly easily fatigued. Eventually, the victim drops dead. No more than a minute later, she rises again as a zombie, hungrily attacking and consuming any living creatures it can find. Anyone whom such a zombie kills or who dies from the disease rises again, carrying the zombie plague themselves. Worst of all, there simply is no mundane way to treat this disease. Filling a victim’s body with the cleansing Essence of the Unconquered Sun, through magic, prayer or Solar anima, supplies an effective counter-agent; magical treatment usually revolves around that principle. Most of the time, the only way to stop this plague is to kill its victims quickly and burn the bodies before they can rise again to spread the disease.",

The shards of this meteorite were collected and forged into powerful artefacts by the volkan artisans of the fields, resembling nothing more than intricately carved spikes. You own five of these artefacts. By plunging one of these spikes into a person, animal, or even yourself, the spike will imbue them with power and causes no damage at all to the one affected (you could stab them in the head and they would function just fine). This causes the one stabbed to grow in muscle mass and size, bones to harden, and skin to thicken to the point of blocking common swords. More than that, the spikes imbue a supernatural awareness and swiftness. Using multiple spikes will amplify this boost, to the point someone using all five could hold their own in direct combat against several berserkers and gladiators from the Crimson Fields in direct combat using only what these spikes provide. However, this comes with a side effect, the spikes warp instincts to be more animal, increases the aggression of the recipient, and amplifies negative emotions, using all five without the will (or another defense against such) to hold this back could render the user a mindless rage monster. Pulling the spike out after using it leaves no wound, just a mark lighter than the surrounding skin, repeated use in the same spot leaving it pure white. You are able to remove the daggers with ease, but others trying to remove them by force find it incredibly difficult without considerable strength and proper leverage. You can choose whether this applies to the recipient of the spike.",

      "description": "The cornerstone of a gemcrafter’s power. The Orb of Presence is a single, perfect sphere of mana the size of a large house. It acts primarily as a mana battery and mana generator with synergistic effects on the mage that is connected to it, as well as the stable spells that are within range of it. Casting the spell that creates an Orb of Presence is physically and magically exhausting and takes several minutes of intense concentration, regardless of your power level or expertise. It starts out with a mana regeneration rate and mana storage limit similar to the caster, but it’s strongest power is that it is self improving. Any time the orb fills with mana, it collects the spillover into a spell of self improvement that will increase its capacity and regeneration by about a third. This improvement is permanent, and will compound with future improvements, until the orb is destroyed, or the wizard unlinks from the orb in order to create a new one or by traveling too far out of range. The secondary power of an orb is to act as a foci, allowing spells to be cast on a much larger scale than would otherwise be possible. While gemcraft is normally performed within about 100m of the wizard if they do not have access to an orb, connecting to an orb will grant the wizard an awareness and casting range boost of nearly 100 times their personal range. This boost applies to any magic cast through the orb, so any spell known by the wizard can be cast on the field of battle within range of the orb. The wizard can also safely store a few spells within the orb, ready to cast, and can re-absorb existing spells on the field into the orb. The most common use of this ability is to reposition the massive gems on the field of battle, but the wizard can also just absorb the mana from the spell directly into the orb in order to get most of the mana back. While the Orb of Presence is incredibly powerful, it is also quite fragile. Other than a single defensive ability called banishment, the orb remains unprotected from attack, and can be shattered by a single strong blow. Banishment is an automatic defence that teleports anything striking the orb to the outer edge of the field of battle at the cost of some mana. The mana cost scales with the strength of the soul of the attacker. Fortunately, this means that most ranged attacks are basically free to banish, but it also means that if a powerful enemy gets close to your orb, it can cost an exorbitant amount of mana to prevent destruction, and if you do not have that mana available, the orb shatters.",

It’s blood, it’s spinal fluid, it’s bile-all of them are unspeakably valuable as reagents for rites in the world of magecraft. A certain witch might find a particular use for its abdominal fat. Best of all, not only does the thing not rot but it regenerates it’s parts slowly when left alone-taking perhaps a month to regenerate a major organ. ...it’s probably dead, and whether or not that was a wink you saw just now it’s guaranteed not to move or resist unless you attempt to revive it with a greater magecraft ritual or something. It’s anyone’s guess what it would do if it was. The gods are fickle, not least when diminished into something technically less than one.",

Soon, deathroot will be seeded across the land. The dead shall rise twice as fast and surely as they originally had, whether as rotting corpses, ghosts or stranger things and in time may amalgamate or alter into things barely resembling the living they once were. This place is itself sacred to the mystic forces of death in this land, empowering your death-based magic greatly; even a dragon of this world could be corrupted in mind and nature by the intensity of the rot here, and this would be a fine place to enact rites like contemplating the dreams of a long-dead demigod in order to embed the principle of life within death back into the Golden Order. By the same token however, there is no place that Those Who Live In Death and similar undead beings would feel nourished both mystically and spiritually. There is no greater horror to be levied against the Golden Order, but perhaps that is your intent after all. In future worlds, if you wish not to unleash plagues of undeath you may choose for this to be confined as a property behind a door of damp, mouldy wood in your Warehouse.

      "description": "Dark beasts from beyond the planes, abominations are a threat that the demiplane actively fights, both for the threat they represent... and for the power held within the little bits of blood they shed when wounded. You possess a vial of blood harvested from an abomination. This blood has several uses due to the power held within it. When imbibed or injected as is, the blood has mutagenic properties that reinforces the body to the extent that even normally critical or mortal wounds can be survived long enough to heal, though instantly fatal wounds, such as the brain being destroyed, cannot be survived with this alone. However, this doesn’t improve the rate of healing, though it does prevent scarring and allow for a limited form of regeneration. This has a secondary effect of extending the lifespan of the drinker by several centuries. The blood can be distilled into a form of potion that augments the magical capabilities of the drinker. Those uninitiated in the use of magic are granted a sizable pool of mana and a basic instinct for its manipulation while those already possessed of mana will have their reserves expanded and improve their ability to manipulate mana. A treatment of abomination blood will greatly enhance the magical properties of materials, objects, or creatures, which only takes a few drops of the blood. Artefacts and potions created with alchemy are empowered to be nearly triple their normal power, permanently, though this can only be done once. Objects with inherent magical properties have those properties reinforced to the point they can be used with witchcraft without crumbling to dust. Creatures with inherent spell matrices have those spell matrices empowered to be doubled in power. Magical viruses, such as vampirism, therianthropy, and the ghoul virus, can similarly be augmented through the use of abomination blood, which can make even a weak vampire or therianthrope the equivalent of the oldest and strongest example of their kind. Finally, abomination blood can be used to fuel rituals, replacing any other material requirements, including any living sacrifices that would normally be necessary. The blood increases the power of the ritual as well, and can nearly quadruple the power involved if the blood is added rather than replacing the material requirements. You gain another vial of blood at the start of each year.",

It can either harden the body as-is, creating a statue or wall, or shape the flesh into structures, such as pillars and rafters to support a collapsing cave.

What you have here are approximately 1000 large tanks filled with green fluid, each containing a high-quality homunculus with large amounts of Magic Circuits in good condition.

For those concerned of moral implications, this is a bit of a Schrodinger situation – while they’re just being used as batteries they might as well be mindless and soulless husks, and you don’t even need them to look humanoid if that’s a problem.

Someone on these drugs think, and learn, better than usual. It’s as if it boosts your problem solving, how fast your brain works, and your ability to retain new information. You get enough that someone could keep a normal dose active for 8 hours a day for a year. And your ‘prescription’ refills what you’ve used yearly. It’s not safe but you could take more than enough to be active 8 hours a day. Keeping the drug active all the time isn’t really good for you, and can cause emotional and mental instability and insomnia. And that’s when you’re just keeping enough in your system to feel the effects. Higher doses provide larger boosts to intelligence as well as potentially unlocking telepathic and psychokinetic abilities, but also cause loss of empathy, feelings of god-like superiority, hallucinations, homicidal tendencies, and uncontrollable mood swings as well as being potentially addictive and causing a risk of brain hemorrhages. Even higher doses could cause stroke, heart attack, your brain outgrowing your skull, and a complete divorce from reality, but can provide increasingly powerful psychic might, and faster, better brain function.",

Normally stored in some distant tomb, it is always accompanied by two elite undead guards. The Casket of Souls, one of many of its kind, was used to store away the souls of all of a Tomb Kings’ enemies, though only the greatest and richest of Kings could afford such an artefact. Among the most powerful magical items in Nehekhara, you are one of the Casket Keepers and thus have the right to summon it and its guards to your aid. Whenever it is summoned you find your magical energies empower significantly, though only once you incant a short ritual to open the Casket’s lid does its’ true nature become clear. Once opened, countless thousands of tormented, angry spirits will race out to devour the life force of any of the Casket Keeper’s enemies, leaving no physical wounds and yet destroying the souls of all but the truly powerful warriors and monsters. Even witnessing the light emitted from within the casket is enough to burn away at a man’s face, even if he is spared from the furious spirits within. Another incantation is all that is required for the spirits to be recalled to the Casket and sealed again. You also know the rituals to seal more souls into the casket, though be aware that its wards cannot hold everything, whether that is measured in power or quantity.",

But beware, for demons are not meek, With claws sharp and bodies so sleek. They wreak chaos and destruction, Our mortal minds unable to function. Dark sorcerer beware, Lest damnation become your snare. Master the hellish powers, or be mastered instead, For the price of failing is eternal dread.

The vermin of hell upon their call, Empower attacks beneath the fireball, Of demonic guardians, fierce and bold, Whose wrathful strike will make foes fold. But the sorcerer's sight does not end there, For foul wisdom does its pages bare, Revealing secrets beyond the veil, To see the world through a darker tale. So heed this tome with caution and care, Lest ye fall to the grasp of despair, For the power it holds is not for the weak, But for those who dare to delve in the bleak.

Lemegeton [300CP] (GrimGrimoire) The tome of Solomon's lore, the power to summon devils galore With methods taught to bind and control, the hellish forces to behold Curses invoked and maledictions sent, the dark empowered with dark intent Magic twisted and warding spells set, the hellish imprisoned with no regret This ultimate tome of sorcery, a dangerous path with no mercy For even with its powerful sway, sorcery is not safe to play So heed its warnings and tread with care, for the Lemegeton will not spare Those who seek its power and grace, beware the devil's embrace.

The stones do have a limit, and will not endlessly absorb energy, but just like a sponge can both absorb and release water, they are able to release stored energy whether magical, emotional, or something else.

By the end of year 10 here, you will fully understand how to replicate the Slime Mold Nanomachines and to craft Dolls of your own from human and non-human body parts. Early on you start with the understanding on how to better repair them. Now if only you knew how to copy and download peoples’ minds.... Necromancy for Dummies: Volume 8 [200CP] (Nechronica) Waking up here, you find a partially burnt book titled 'Necromancy for Dummies: Volume 8'. It's mostly crusty pages, crayon scribbles, and reads like stereo instructions. Every day you spend reading it, you learn a bit more about how the basics of creating the undead works. It'll take years to figure any of this stuff out but should you dedicate yourself to it then you will learn how to copy minds and then download them into a suitable host or storage device. Now if only you could find the first 7 Volumes. The Anarchists Cook Book to Dolls [200CP] (Nechronica) Reinforcement Parts always breaking down? Running out of spares? Wish you could craft your own? One part Alchemy, four parts Science, and several parts things I can't mention on the internet without attracting attention from the Government. The first couple chapters is all about crafting Armaments. Most of them are fairly simple to make with the right ingredients and parts. Starts with Molotovs and ends with crafting Mono- filament wire. Next comes Enhancements which comes with a crash course in robotics, metallurgy and alchemy to create the fascinating mechanical Parts here. The last part of the book seems to have been crudely stapled on and written in crayon. Its filled with crawling script, obscene formulas and often indecipherable runes that seem to be cooking instructions for Mutations. Seems this section will take several years at least to figure out and require a well stocked laboratory. (Editor’s Note: There is a Special Notes section where the Drop-In perks are.

With this whirlpool of energy you can contact the gods of the local setting, communicate with them and if they agree even revive them. Should you have the power to do so you can revive them as well of course. The revived god will be a normal human however you can help them get back their memories and if they accept it they can return to their divine rank. You can import a dead god of the setting you are in, into this Item. Otherwise you may simply use this as a well of divine energy, holding power to craft a whole new Lovecraftian deity.",

The shaping of flesh, the twisting of dimensions, the cultivation and command of cosmic rot and nature’s rage as an engineer commands a river – and, perhaps most importantly of all, the secrets to crafting greater artifacts; not the mere trifles made in the modern age, but the treasures for which adventurers daily risk their lives beneath the boughs of Davokar.",

It might not contain every ritual of black or dark magic in this world, but if it does not it’s got the vast majority and enough you would be hard pressed to find a spell of black or dark magic not inside of it. It even has some spells of not-so-black magic. It doesn’t contain any specifically white or good magic, but it has some neutral spells. While it will take a skilled and natural practitioner to manage all the rituals and spells inside of this book even an ordinary individual could work a few spells with it. More because this book does provide a measure of magical power for its spells, providing a boost to the magic its caster is capable of when they are casting black or dark magic. It can also help to truncate certain rituals and spells, or replace the incantation and spell completely with this magical reserve, to make them more castable in the middle of battle or other hectic situations; though what spells this will work on depends upon the caster’s own magic and they’ll generally be a fair deal weaker for it. Finally this book will update itself in future jumps. While it will not remain the definitive book of black magic, it will remain a fairly good grimoire of black and evil magic in future worlds, adding new black, dark, and evil magic from the worlds you visit.",

Having the stone grants practically no need to refill your Ego-level or fuel. While giving it to a mentally constructed being in such a world, will grant them a form of immortality and a chance to come with you as a companion.",

      "description": "14 Words [200CP] (Jorge Joestar) At the beginning of every jump, a prophetic event will happen before your eyes. Some sort of special object will make its way to you, crashing down from the heavens or being mailed to you or even appearing out of nowhere in your pocket. Whatever this object will be, it holds a prophecy for your future time spent in that jump. This may be as little as 14 words or as long as several pages of writing but whatever form it takes, it will be obscure and confusing at first. By lengthy consideration of its contents, you will be able to realise its meanings one by one, giving you knowledge of the future and of things or events that will be important to you in this current jump. Great battles that placed you at risk will be revealed, opportunities to gain power and so on. You will not be totally aware of all that happens in the future but the prophecy will reveal to you several important points of your future, allowing you to properly take advantage. Arrow Quiver [400CP] (Jorge Joestar) The Bow and Arrows are a set of ancient artefacts able to grant the ability to use a Stand to those who have great wills and are pierced by the arrows. Those who are not sufficient, die instead. The set was lost for many years until being uncovered in Egypt but would be lost again soon enough, the arrows split up over the world. This however, was merely the story in one universe. In the others, bows and arrows abound. A set for every world, some believe. You do not have a Bow but you do have a quiver of four golden Arrows, each able to achieve the same function when stabbed into someone. They are also able to Awaken Stands by stabbing the Master with the Arrow again or Requiem Stands by placing an Arrow into the body of the Stand, a powered up state lasting as long as the arrow is within the stand.",

Object 60 - The Throne [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex) A mildly cognitohazardous green chair which makes those of lower mental fortitude believe it’s a precious tool. For you, however, it instead gives you a number of blessings while sitting on it, including clarity of mind, access to “secret” knowledge, a surge of courage and passion, increased mental capacity, and an expansion of the soul. The second and fifth blessings are kinda vague, so I’ll let you decide what that means. If you don’t like its design, you can make it look however you want. Modified Object 13 - Portable Terminal [200CP] (Adrift in the Complex) Object 13 is the Office Terminal, a computer device on Level 4 that lets you communicate with others via a chat room.

The Silicon Life answer to perhaps the Gravitational Beam Emitter as well as the Safeguard Sword, this Staff combines both close range combat capability with extended range striking capacity to make a final product suitable to be called “all-purpose weapon”. That being said, the staff’s sheer length – nearly seven feet – can make it unwieldy to an unpractised user, and it takes a fair bit of finesse to use the energy emission while striking with the staff. Though still trumped by the Gravitational Beam Emitter in terms of sheer destructive capacity, the Silicon Staff is a fair bit more flexible and hardly as energy intensive.

HATE is an extremely powerful and dangerous dark substance, generated by the accumulation of hate, the emotion, generated by an entire species. This substance attaches itself to a host and grows within them, while working as an enhancer to their soul. Now, you’re the host to a portion of HATE. The HATE increases your abilities, especially your magical and soul-based abilities, by a tremendous amount, up to 10 times your original power. The substance repairs any damage done to its host, you, capable of regenerating limbs in less than a minute. You can also generate and manipulate how the HATE manifests outside your body, being able to create barriers, domes, tentacles and weapons to be used for attack and defense. Your attacks can also be enchanted with a lightning-like darkness aura, giving the darkness element to them. If you have some way of acquiring the souls of those who died, you can use the substance to generate a body to create loyal servants from these souls. Your servants receive a weaker version of this perk while maintaining their original power. It’s possible that the loved ones of your servants make them purge the HATE from their souls, but doing it, they will just die again and you won’t be able to revive them again. HATE is also capable of absorbing the abilities of its host, if it totally consumes them. If you let this substance enter inside your own soul, your Soul Trait can be inverted. Such power isn’t free. The HATE inside you will try to take over your body and mind, influencing your actions. The more you use it, the more it will grow, the influence will become stronger and you will become more corrupted. Just willpower and love, the emotion, can help you counteract it. It’s also possible to use raw magical energy to maintain control over it, but this way isn’t very efficient. The HATE inside you isn’t the same that infected Chara and Betty and isn’t sentient or alive, but still has its own will. It won’t become sentient, unless you want, if you’re feeling suicidal. You must take This Horrible Substance drawback for no points. Don’t underestimate the HATE. Don’t make the exact same mistake that Betty made. Animosity [200CP] (Glitchtale) The power granted by the HATE isn’t without a price, but imagine having this power totally under your control. You managed to do this near impossible feat: you tamed it, putting your will over its goals. The “tamed” HATE inside you became a new thing: Animosity. This dark substance is totally under your control and won’t try to take over you again, without any of its downsides. As long as there is still Animosity in your soul, the dark substance will regenerate any damage done to your body, even if your body is completely destroyed. Your control over it lets you infect others with the substance to slowly take over their bodies and mind, transforming them into loyal servants, like your revived servants, or letting Animosity absorb them totally and creating a dark creature with any of the host’s power, under your control. The Animosity inside you protects your mind and your soul from external attempts of controlling them. Lastly, this perk negates the effects of This Horrible Substance, removing the requirement of taking it.",

Pointing this at an enemy with no physical form will render them vulnerable to physical harm regardless, making more direct methods viable against them. The power of Christ compels you.

Ritual Mask [200CP] (World of Horror) A mask worn frequently by those who wish to give praise to the Old Gods, this mask is frequently seen on the faces of cultists when they strike openly, which is rarely, although it is also worn during some ceremonies. Having this mask on can have a strange effect on your mind in that it helps you view horrors with less of a chance of damaging your sanity. Although it does not prevent it completely it will help you fare much better when you stare into the darkness.",

They don't just pop out of the ground like those plebeian zombies, and what if you need to make some adjustments? Upon purchasing this, you gain access to a sophisticated bio-tank which is filled with a special fluid. This will not only ensure the B.O.W. is docile and unconscious while immersed, but it also comes with the tools and devices to monitor and make adjustments to the subject inside as needed. Evil laugh not included. Viral Collector [100CP] (Resident Evil) What does a monster with power often seek? More power. Which in this world, means you need to find the right virus or parasite and start stuffing yourself like a potato sack stuffs itself with bugs... which, take it from me, it's not pretty. But everything starts somewhere, and with this special briefcase, you'll have the tools needed to extract and sufficiently store any biological viruses or parasites that you could desire, with keeping for a long time too! Keep in mind however, that mooks will not give the best results. If you want top dollar, you'll need to find the bosses or more powerful monsters for proper samples. B.O.W. Data [200CP] (Resident Evil) Umbrella has done a lot of work in regards to B.O.W.s, and their creation, to say nothing of their combat potential. They’re dangerous, and the viruses involved tend to make them all the more worrying when they’re on the field. This data file is a treasure trove of that work, containing lab work and loads of combat data for each of Umbrella’s monsters to be used and abused as you see fit. Maybe you’ll pull one over them with this, or succeed where they failed. Containment Room [300CP] (Resident Evil) It's not exactly proper to be working on a creation without some means to contain it... I mean, whoever heard of someone being killed by their own creation? That would just be silly! This room comes equipped with blast doors, various sterilization protocols in the event something goes wrong, and even a tank which you can drop your unwitting creation inside to monitor and alter as needed. You'll have to supply the medical tools yourself, but at the least you can try to keep something in if it tries to break out? Just be wary about making anything that can survive the protocols... Cloning Technology [300CP] (Resident Evil) You ever wonder how Umbrella managed to make so manyTyrants despite there only being one in ten million people having the potential? Or how they sometimes manage to get so many test subjects for their more unethical practices? Well, the answer is due to cloning. After all, a Tyrant plant was only successful due to the cloning of Sergei Vladimir who had the correct genes. You have six tubes here that can successfully create and gestate clones using whatever genetic material you place in the tube, and a helmet to scan for memories that you can program into the clones too... with any tweaks you may desire from those memories, of course.

This book seems to detail the history of this land, and yet, every time you open it, it seems to hold different passages. The name of this town comes from the legend of the people whose land was stolen from them. They called this place ‘The Place of the Silent Spirits’. By ‘spirits’, they meant not only their dead relatives, but also the spirits that they believed inhabited the trees, rocks, and water around them. This item acts as a capstone booster for items, and has the ability to hold secret or forgotten lore about the worlds you visit in the future. (Editor’s Note: Book of Lost Memories acts as a Capstone Booster for items from the Silent Hill Jump. Alternatively instead of the book holding secret/forgotten lore of the world you live in. You can change to hold information about a Silent Hill-esque area created from perks that create the user's very own Silent Hill. Detailing the importance of locations, as well significance of the Monsters there and what they represent.) Flauros [600CP] (Silent Hill) Excavated from ancient ruins deep beneath Toluca Lake, this triangular pyramid shaped object is a power artifact capable of both amplifying psychic power and neutralizing it. Upon its use, it splits into several pieces, Past, Present, Future, Falsehood, and Truth. If used to amplify, these pieces are drained and travel to sites connected to natural leylines, much like the ones that Silent Hill sit on to recharge. If they are used to neutralize, each piece contains a fragment of the power, converted into a monster that can be defeated to complete the nullification. Either way, it takes at least 6 months before it can be used again. Capstone Booster: True Flauros. The Flauros has been strengthened beyond its previous power by the Book of Lost Memories. Its recharge rate is now reduced to a day, and the pieces simply collapse in front of you. In addition, the Flauros can be used to completely seal something in its entirety ranging in size and power from a girl, to a demon, to a town. Stronger beings might be able to fight against this effect, causing a battle of wills to take place, but for the most part, it can be used to deal with even the most dangerous beings in this world. Just be ready to explain to everyone why an entire town in Maine just ceased to exist. It can only seal something away like this every 10 years, and it can only do so 5 times until you have to release one of the sealed things.",

After an extended period of them, it is possible to manipulate their bodies against their will. Incomplete Net Terminal Genes [200CP] (Blame!) A sample of the Net Terminal Genes, necessary if one wants to access the Net Sphere – though this doesn’t guarantee any level of control or coherence within the Net Sphere itself. With the Net Sphere having fallen into a state of utter disrepair, whoever can enter inside will have no way to predict what kind of environment they’ll find themselves in. Still though, these will facilitate interfacing with virtual domains for anyone bearing the genes, though different domains will likely take a longer period of time for authentication and adaptation before actual access.

A sample of the Net Terminal Genes, necessary if one wants to access the Net Sphere – though this doesn’t guarantee any level of control or coherence within the Net Sphere itself. With the Net Sphere having fallen into a state of utter disrepair, whoever can enter inside will have no way to predict what kind of environment they’ll find themselves in.

      "description": "The true source of the Darkwood. In 1975 a meteor brought the Being to Earth, where it soon took hold in the earth- spreading the white substance throughout the valley it landed in, forming roots which continued to grow throughout the soil, cloning themselves. That they appear tree-like is misguiding; if anything, the Being is more similar to a mushroom than a tree. To give an idea of how much it has spread, only 15% of the trees found in the Darkwood are “real”; the rest are merely clones created as a result of the Being’s growth. This same substance is what gave life to many of the monsters- and some of the people- found in the Darkwood. The Wolfman is the clone of a hunter who lived in the Old Woods, fused together with one of his old hunting trophies. The Mushroom Granny is a copy of an old woman who died after crawling into the woods in search of her family members. Even the Night Trader is a replica of the Stranger, created while the man was tied to a tree; his helmet is a part of him, for while the Being can duplicate the appearance of inanimate objects it doesn’t differentiate them from living beings. It was even able to broadcast radio signals, albeit spotty ones, by taking over an old radio tower. The motives of the Being- if any- are difficult to comprehend. It often takes the appearance of a young baby when it decides to create images of itself in the dreams and hallucinations of those infected with the Plague, and in some ways it appears that some aspects of its growth are unintentional- seen in the growth of the Talking Tree, which blocks one of the two avenues through which it is possible to reach the Being. On the other hand, when it does communicate through indirect means like dreams, hallucinations, or radio waves it does seem to have some awareness of what is happening, even asking questions. In any case, one thing that is known for certain is that it calls those infected with the Plague to it; making them wish to “return home”. Once they find themselves in the valley where the Being resides, most quickly succumb to a deep sleep and slowly waste away until they expire, a process which may take an untold amount of time due to the effects of the Plague. What benefit it receives from this is not known, if there even is one, but the people who come to rest beside it often have happy, peaceful expressions on their faces. Its control may be psychic in nature, due to the nature of its hallucinations sometimes showing the past of other people, or it might just be that the pathogens exert extraordinary mental effects upon others. In any case, you have a choice to make. The Being, if you ever even encountered it, has been placed into your hands: now with the size and appearance of an actual baby instead of the monolithic creature it once was. (Editor’s Note: This was originally an award for the Darkwood jump, but I’ve decided to make it a purchasable perk. There are other alternatives that you can do with it, with there being an explanation for what it will do. The first is to adopt it, and the second is to eat it and become similar to the entity.

      "source": "Children of an Elder God",
      "description": "Thorabonian Crystal [100CP] (Children of an Elder God) You have a replenishing shipping crate full of Thorabonian Crystals, the material used to create the dream-city of Thorabon. Unlike those crystals, yours will never start to mysteriously fade away. These crystals have the curious property of bending rather than breaking under pressure, and accept neither paint nor stain; instead, by focusing your will on them, you can make them change to whatever color or pattern you desire. Dr. Akagi’s Serum [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) When Ritsuko Akagi realized that she would be transforming into a Deep One, she devoted her life to studying biology to discover how to prevent or reverse the process. She never truly succeeded, but she did create several effective stopgap measures to slow down and resist the transformation. The serum has been refined, placed into an injector system, and delivered unto you; it is refilled twice daily. When injected into the body, this serum will halt any transformation the individual is undergoing, and will severely lessen the effect of any instincts the transformation would grant them. However, the serum must be taken on a daily basis; failure to do so will see you start to change, although taking the serum again will undo those changes. That said, the changes will be more and more rapid each time the medication is missed, and it cannot undo a completed transformation. Additionally, if this transformation is powered by something—such as a malign force actively trying to transform the subject—then it can eventually overwhelm the protection of this serum. Finally, taking this medicine will also put a halt to any sort of power growth the subject may be undergoing; that said, additional influxes of power from outside sources can overcome the effects of this medication, such as that experienced by the Children when they absorb the powers of an Angel. In addition to the medication itself, you also receive instructions to create more of this drug. Adam’s Biomass (Inert) [400CP] (Children of an Elder God) What you have here is a container from which you—or those designated by you—can pull a seemingly endless supply of Adam’s biomass. This biomass is of Adam’s body, but bears no connection to Adam’s soul; Adam cannot control it or influence it in any way. This means that it does not spontaneously create new life forms, but it still has a number of uses. Adam is the raw material used to produce LCL. LCL is an important component of piloting an EVA; it provides protection from the physical stresses of moving the EVA at incredible speeds and from suffering damage from the sheer distance the EVA can be thrown or fall from; it maintains the connection between the pilot’s mind and the Evangelion, allowing for synchronization; it is highly oxygenated, allowing the pilot to safely inhale it; it also has a host of medical purposes, as it prevents infections, soothes pain, kills bacteria, and speeds healing. Despite being liquid, you can speak while submerged in it quite clearly. However, it is also a putrid-smelling (and worse-tasting) black sludge that will drive insane or kill almost anyone who is submerged in it. If you apply LCL medicinally, it is recommended you lather it onto wounds, rather than immerse the patient in it. The MAGI [1200CP] (Children of an Elder God) You now possess a duplicate of the trio of super-bio-computers known as the MAGI. They are canonically known as Caspar, Balthasar, and Melchior, but feel free to name them whatever you like; the original MAGI are still in the Geofront, after all. The MAGI can calculate ludicrous volumes of information near-instantly, putting the supercomputers of the Earth you may be familiar with to shame. They are also capable of incredible levels of analysis on things they shouldn’t be able to understand, such as the differing materials each Angel is made of. Additionally, as the MAGI were shown to have precognitive abilities in Yui’s “perfect world”, your MAGI will also possess the ability to foretell the future; however, you can’t control what the topic of their divinations will be. These super-bio-computers will contain all the information currently stored within the pre-existing MAGI. You have “Divine”-level access to the system, putting you above all other potential users. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price of The MAGI perk from 600CP to 1200CP. Also there is a few more paragraphs for the Adam’s Biomass (Inert) perk.)",

      "description": "Y’glai Crystalline Rod [100CP] (Children of an Elder God) This is a weapon of from Xoth, from which hails the Angel Oannes, named Cthulhu. It fires blasts of Corgathic energy that pose a danger to even an Evangelion (if their AT-Field is down)… however, Xothians are also the size of a double-decker bus. Your Y’glai Crystalline Rod is sized to suit you, so may be significantly less damaging than that. Still, it makes for a potent weapon. Relic From 27,915 AD [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) This spear came from a dream of a possible future. It bears a smooth metal shaft with a sharply-edged head. Runes glow on its surface with a flickering reddish light, and a single eye is inscribed on the head with a glowing pupil. When this spear is thrown, it doubles in size—and then doubles again, and again, until it is large enough to pierce straight through an Evangelion. Spear of Orion [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) Orion the Hunter is the Elder God of the hunt, and this spear is a duplicate of his own. It will never miss when thrown, and will always strike true, piercing through all defenses. Its touch destroys illusions, but only in a localized area; in addition, a single blow from this spear will destroy most undead, although not one imbued with more power than normal, such as the revenant of King Genji. It answers to no touch but that of its owner, save for when it is gifted to a new owner; you are currently the owner of this spear. Any attempt to use this spear against your wishes, to raise it against you, or for someone to attempt to pull it out of their own flesh, will result in it burning off the hand of the offender. Something on the level of the Crawling Chaos could just destroy the spear, though. Sword of Karakal [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) Karakal is the Elder God known as the Lord of Flame, and this great bronze sword engulfed in flames is his. It comes with a sheath that temporarily quells the flames. It comes with but one boon, a very simple one; anything struck by the sword will burn. Unlike the sword Karakal gifted to Asuka, this one really will burn anything, even the likes of Nyarlathotep. But be aware that just because something has been burned doesn’t mean it’s dead, and some beings can simply destroy the sword. Shield of N’tse-Kaambl [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) N’tse-Kaambl is the Elder God known as the Shatterer of Worlds—although despite her lofty title, she has yet to successfully fight back against the Outer Gods. Still, she is the one who created the Elder Sign that protects against the eldritch, and this shield bears that Sign. This shield—unlike the one gifted to Asuka and Touji on their dream-quest to save Kensuke—genuinely is unbreakable, on top of featuring the eldritch-repelling effects of the Elder Sign. Something as powerful as Nyarlathotep would not be sent away, but even its power wouldn’t be enough to damage this shield. Jug of Oukranos [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) Oukranos is the Elder God of rivers, and this jug partakes of his essence; it will never run dry of water. And this water is more than a simple means to quench thirst; it holds the nature of giving life. Although it has no capacity to heal, the touch of its waters can grant life to dead earth, and cause grass to sprout and trees to grow. But this is slow; however, you can also break the jug. This will cause a swell of water—shallow, not something that brings destruction, but brings renewal. It spreads across the land, spreading life where there was none and purifying the tainted earth. Combined with the light of the Lantern of Ariel, and it could be used to cleanse an entire planet that had sunken into the corruption of the Great Old Ones. This water will fill empty lakes and streams, but will fade away when it has completed its purpose; you don’t have to worry about drowning a planet, for these waters were never meant to take life, only to spread it. If destroyed in this manner, it will not be restored until you pass on to a new jump, or until 10 years have gone, whichever comes first. Lantern of Ariel [400CP] (Children of an Elder God) Ariel is the Elder God of Truth, and when the hood on this lantern is lifted and the ever-burning light of truth is exposed, all things before its light will have all deceptions lifted, and the truth will be revealed. This is not the pale and weak truth humans know, but The Truth. You will see the true nature of people, their innermost selves, and should they be greater than mere humans—such as the Children—you will see their true nature, as Asuka was shown to be an entity of flame, the fire that both sustains life and destroys it, vast enough to destroy a city even before her journey as a Child was completed. Illusions will be burnt away, deception of all kinds will be thrown aside. Fortunately for the sanity of yourself and others, the mundane deceptions like human form will return after the light is hidden, although any illusions will remain dispersed. This light can pierce even the lies of Nyarlathotep. What’s more, its light can burn away unnatural transformations and curses; the Cherubim, also called the Byakhee, were freed and returned to their true forms, even when the lantern broke. And if you try to overuse it, it will break, especially if you infuse it with power to make it shine brighter—but even as it breaks, its pieces will fly forth like shards of light, and return that which is twisted into its proper form. By destroying the lantern in this manner and restoring life with the Jug of Oukranos, Asuka was able to restore the entire planet on which Hastur dwelled from a dark and distorted nightmarish hellscape into a beautiful land that was once more suitable for habitation. If broken, the lantern will not be restored until ten years have passed or you travel to a new jump, whichever comes first. Quinta-Trident [400CP] (Children of an Elder God) A five-pronged trident, such as those used by the Xothians and the mass-produced EVAs in R’lyeh, either crafted by the Deep Ones or by SEELE themselves. These tridents adjust to fit the grip of whoever tries to use them, so can be as small as a human or as large as an Evangelion, or even larger (or smaller). Their special property will only be noticed once at least one of the tines enters the flesh of an enemy; when this occurs, the inserted tine(s) will begin to extend themselves independently, like some manner of fluid serpent, and will travel along the target’s veins until they pierce a vital point like the heart or brain—or the pilot in the entry plug of an EVA. This can take time—particularly on sufficiently large enemies—but will still prove fatal to almost all enemies you manage to strike with it. Bullshit powers like the Children possess might be able to overcome this, however.",

      "description": "Artificial LCL Recipe [100CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The LCL, affectionately also called Tang by some people, is an amber-colored liquid with unique properties (like sharing some traits with the primordial ooze and the capacity of passing by a “phase shift” when an electrical current is run through it, which makes its density, opacity, and viscosity appear to approach that of air despite remaining in liquid state) that is also strictly the only thing a pilot absolutely requires to sync with an Eva. If you’re an Evangelion yourself (or purchased a Eva unit), you’ll already receive a self-replenishing supply of purified LCL, by taking this item, you’ll also receive a special file containing detailed instructions about how to artificially create more LCL, without needing to drain it from Lilith if you need more of it for some reason. Dead Sea Scrolls [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) What lies in front of you are the relics responsible for turning Seele into a group of religious fanatics obsessed in ascending into a godlike being by fusing with the entirety of humankind and that became their primary guide and philosophy, the legendary Secret Dead Sea Scrolls. The secret scrolls you’re receiving are a set of documents created by the First Ancestral Race to serve as a manual on the use and purposes of the contents of the Black and White Moons, the Seeds of Life and the Spears, and of the Impacts, as well as containing some prophecies about important future events. While the scrolls you’re receiving are the real ones, as Seele has already acquired all the knowledge from them that they could, and not only a copy, they’ll be repaired to their former glory but will still be written in a long lost alien language that will be up to you to discover how to translate them. In addition to the wealth of knowledge contained in the documents, new prophecies will be added in each future world you visit. The Virus of Terror [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) Ireul, the Angel of Terror and also possibly the Eleventh Angel, is a unique case among its siblings, due to being the only Angel to not needing an Evangelion to be defeated and also the only one that Nerv actively tried to hide its existence from Seele, as they would have another way to futurely attack the Geofront if they put their hands in the remains of this Angel. But, what if Seele managed to gain access to its remains? This is the result. You acquired a pen-drive containing a special program made by replicating Ireul’s data, being meant to be an extremely powerful malware programmed to serve you and developed to be able to invade and take control of any system it has access to, as well as even having some degree of adaptability to better interact with different systems and to avoid any attempt of reverse-engineering from any of your enemies. Fortunately, the mechanisms to limit its adaptability so you don’t need to worry about the virus evolving to the point of it developing some kind of self-awareness or you losing control over it. Nebuchadnezzar’s Key [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) Nebuchadnezzar II was a Babylonian king that is said to have attempted to make the Jews worship a golden statue of himself as a god. Even if the key is probably unrelated to the king, its myth became the inspiration behind its name. Somehow, you managed to acquire a backup copy of the Nebuchadnezzar’s Key, a device that looks like a stylized syringe attached in the neck of what resembles a miniature humanoid nervous system. The key’s function is to work as a recipient to contain the Angel’s physical data that allows a human (or another non-Angelic being) to abandon their humanity and ascend into a higher existence, as an Angel-like Entity, gaining abilities similar to Gendo after he used the key on himself, which includes a powerful AT Field (but still far weaker than an actual Angel’s AT Field), energy blasts and an inhuman durability. The key can be used just once due to it expending the transcendental data contained on it, but it’ll recharge and become usable again after a year. Corrupted Core [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The Nebuchadnezzar’s Key wasn’t the first artifact created with the function of containing physical data that transcends humanity to serve as a trigger for someone to ascend into a higher existence. In an alternative reality, an evil version of Dr. Katsuragi managed to survive the Second Impact thanks to the help of a Core-like object. You receive the same artifact used by him, which takes the form of a miniature Core, one that works similarly to the Nebuchadnezzar’s Key, but, while it also has the ability to turn those that enter in contact with it into an Angel-like Entity by injecting the Angels’ physical data into them, there is a key difference between these two, as the Angel-like Entities created by the key retain their original bodies, souls and minds intacts after the transformation while the entities turned by the Core end up being monstrous, giant creatures whose appearance resemble more the Angels than their original forms, with their minds being mostly lost due to being unable to support the process. Unlike the original Core, yours won’t permanently fuse with someone, as it’ll separate itself from them after the transformation is finished, but, after being used once, it’ll only become usable again after a year. Additionally, you don’t need to worry about accidentally turning someone into a monster if you don’t want it to happen and any Angel-like Entity created by the Core will also be instinctively loyal to you and, due to not being the true Angels born from the Adams, they will lack the compulsion to fuse with Lilith.",

      "description": "Thorabonian Crystal [100CP] (Children of an Elder God) You have a replenishing shipping crate full of Thorabonian Crystals, the material used to create the dream-city of Thorabon. Unlike those crystals, yours will never start to mysteriously fade away. These crystals have the curious property of bending rather than breaking under pressure, and accept neither paint nor stain; instead, by focusing your will on them, you can make them change to whatever color or pattern you desire. Dr. Akagi’s Serum [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) When Ritsuko Akagi realized that she would be transforming into a Deep One, she devoted her life to studying biology to discover how to prevent or reverse the process. She never truly succeeded, but she did create several effective stopgap measures to slow down and resist the transformation. The serum has been refined, placed into an injector system, and delivered unto you; it is refilled twice daily. When injected into the body, this serum will halt any transformation the individual is undergoing, and will severely lessen the effect of any instincts the transformation would grant them. However, the serum must be taken on a daily basis; failure to do so will see you start to change, although taking the serum again will undo those changes. That said, the changes will be more and more rapid each time the medication is missed, and it cannot undo a completed transformation. Additionally, if this transformation is powered by something—such as a malign force actively trying to transform the subject—then it can eventually overwhelm the protection of this serum. Finally, taking this medicine will also put a halt to any sort of power growth the subject may be undergoing; that said, additional influxes of power from outside sources can overcome the effects of this medication, such as that experienced by the Children when they absorb the powers of an Angel. In addition to the medication itself, you also receive instructions to create more of this drug. Adam’s Biomass (Inert) [400CP] (Children of an Elder God) What you have here is a container from which you—or those designated by you—can pull a seemingly endless supply of Adam’s biomass. This biomass is of Adam’s body, but bears no connection to Adam’s soul; Adam cannot control it or influence it in any way. This means that it does not spontaneously create new life forms, but it still has a number of uses. Adam is the raw material used to produce LCL. LCL is an important component of piloting an EVA; it provides protection from the physical stresses of moving the EVA at incredible speeds and from suffering damage from the sheer distance the EVA can be thrown or fall from; it maintains the connection between the pilot’s mind and the Evangelion, allowing for synchronization; it is highly oxygenated, allowing the pilot to safely inhale it; it also has a host of medical purposes, as it prevents infections, soothes pain, kills bacteria, and speeds healing. Despite being liquid, you can speak while submerged in it quite clearly. However, it is also a putrid-smelling (and worse-tasting) black sludge that will drive insane or kill almost anyone who is submerged in it. If you apply LCL medicinally, it is recommended you lather it onto wounds, rather than immerse the patient in it. The MAGI [1200CP] (Children of an Elder God) You now possess a duplicate of the trio of super-bio-computers known as the MAGI. They are canonically known as Caspar, Balthasar, and Melchior, but feel free to name them whatever you like; the original MAGI are still in the Geofront, after all. The MAGI can calculate ludicrous volumes of information near-instantly, putting the supercomputers of the Earth you may be familiar with to shame. They are also capable of incredible levels of analysis on things they shouldn’t be able to understand, such as the differing materials each Angel is made of. Additionally, as the MAGI were shown to have precognitive abilities in Yui’s “perfect world”, your MAGI will also possess the ability to foretell the future; however, you can’t control what the topic of their divinations will be. These super-bio-computers will contain all the information currently stored within the pre-existing MAGI. You have “Divine”-level access to the system, putting you above all other potential users. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price of The MAGI perk from 600CP to 1200CP. Also there is a few more paragraphs for the Adam’s Biomass (Inert) perk.)",

      "source": "Children of an Elder God",
      "description": "Y’glai Crystalline Rod [100CP] (Children of an Elder God) This is a weapon of from Xoth, from which hails the Angel Oannes, named Cthulhu. It fires blasts of Corgathic energy that pose a danger to even an Evangelion (if their AT-Field is down)… however, Xothians are also the size of a double-decker bus. Your Y’glai Crystalline Rod is sized to suit you, so may be significantly less damaging than that. Still, it makes for a potent weapon. Relic From 27,915 AD [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) This spear came from a dream of a possible future. It bears a smooth metal shaft with a sharply-edged head. Runes glow on its surface with a flickering reddish light, and a single eye is inscribed on the head with a glowing pupil. When this spear is thrown, it doubles in size—and then doubles again, and again, until it is large enough to pierce straight through an Evangelion. Spear of Orion [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) Orion the Hunter is the Elder God of the hunt, and this spear is a duplicate of his own. It will never miss when thrown, and will always strike true, piercing through all defenses. Its touch destroys illusions, but only in a localized area; in addition, a single blow from this spear will destroy most undead, although not one imbued with more power than normal, such as the revenant of King Genji. It answers to no touch but that of its owner, save for when it is gifted to a new owner; you are currently the owner of this spear. Any attempt to use this spear against your wishes, to raise it against you, or for someone to attempt to pull it out of their own flesh, will result in it burning off the hand of the offender. Something on the level of the Crawling Chaos could just destroy the spear, though. Sword of Karakal [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) Karakal is the Elder God known as the Lord of Flame, and this great bronze sword engulfed in flames is his. It comes with a sheath that temporarily quells the flames. It comes with but one boon, a very simple one; anything struck by the sword will burn. Unlike the sword Karakal gifted to Asuka, this one really will burn anything, even the likes of Nyarlathotep. But be aware that just because something has been burned doesn’t mean it’s dead, and some beings can simply destroy the sword. Shield of N’tse-Kaambl [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) N’tse-Kaambl is the Elder God known as the Shatterer of Worlds—although despite her lofty title, she has yet to successfully fight back against the Outer Gods. Still, she is the one who created the Elder Sign that protects against the eldritch, and this shield bears that Sign. This shield—unlike the one gifted to Asuka and Touji on their dream-quest to save Kensuke—genuinely is unbreakable, on top of featuring the eldritch-repelling effects of the Elder Sign. Something as powerful as Nyarlathotep would not be sent away, but even its power wouldn’t be enough to damage this shield. Jug of Oukranos [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) Oukranos is the Elder God of rivers, and this jug partakes of his essence; it will never run dry of water. And this water is more than a simple means to quench thirst; it holds the nature of giving life. Although it has no capacity to heal, the touch of its waters can grant life to dead earth, and cause grass to sprout and trees to grow. But this is slow; however, you can also break the jug. This will cause a swell of water—shallow, not something that brings destruction, but brings renewal. It spreads across the land, spreading life where there was none and purifying the tainted earth. Combined with the light of the Lantern of Ariel, and it could be used to cleanse an entire planet that had sunken into the corruption of the Great Old Ones. This water will fill empty lakes and streams, but will fade away when it has completed its purpose; you don’t have to worry about drowning a planet, for these waters were never meant to take life, only to spread it. If destroyed in this manner, it will not be restored until you pass on to a new jump, or until 10 years have gone, whichever comes first. Lantern of Ariel [400CP] (Children of an Elder God) Ariel is the Elder God of Truth, and when the hood on this lantern is lifted and the ever-burning light of truth is exposed, all things before its light will have all deceptions lifted, and the truth will be revealed. This is not the pale and weak truth humans know, but The Truth. You will see the true nature of people, their innermost selves, and should they be greater than mere humans—such as the Children—you will see their true nature, as Asuka was shown to be an entity of flame, the fire that both sustains life and destroys it, vast enough to destroy a city even before her journey as a Child was completed. Illusions will be burnt away, deception of all kinds will be thrown aside. Fortunately for the sanity of yourself and others, the mundane deceptions like human form will return after the light is hidden, although any illusions will remain dispersed. This light can pierce even the lies of Nyarlathotep. What’s more, its light can burn away unnatural transformations and curses; the Cherubim, also called the Byakhee, were freed and returned to their true forms, even when the lantern broke. And if you try to overuse it, it will break, especially if you infuse it with power to make it shine brighter—but even as it breaks, its pieces will fly forth like shards of light, and return that which is twisted into its proper form. By destroying the lantern in this manner and restoring life with the Jug of Oukranos, Asuka was able to restore the entire planet on which Hastur dwelled from a dark and distorted nightmarish hellscape into a beautiful land that was once more suitable for habitation. If broken, the lantern will not be restored until ten years have passed or you travel to a new jump, whichever comes first. Quinta-Trident [400CP] (Children of an Elder God) A five-pronged trident, such as those used by the Xothians and the mass-produced EVAs in R’lyeh, either crafted by the Deep Ones or by SEELE themselves. These tridents adjust to fit the grip of whoever tries to use them, so can be as small as a human or as large as an Evangelion, or even larger (or smaller). Their special property will only be noticed once at least one of the tines enters the flesh of an enemy; when this occurs, the inserted tine(s) will begin to extend themselves independently, like some manner of fluid serpent, and will travel along the target’s veins until they pierce a vital point like the heart or brain—or the pilot in the entry plug of an EVA. This can take time—particularly on sufficiently large enemies—but will still prove fatal to almost all enemies you manage to strike with it. Bullshit powers like the Children possess might be able to overcome this, however.",

      "source": "Rebuild of Evangelion",
      "description": "Artificial LCL Recipe [100CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The LCL, affectionately also called Tang by some people, is an amber-colored liquid with unique properties (like sharing some traits with the primordial ooze and the capacity of passing by a “phase shift” when an electrical current is run through it, which makes its density, opacity, and viscosity appear to approach that of air despite remaining in liquid state) that is also strictly the only thing a pilot absolutely requires to sync with an Eva. If you’re an Evangelion yourself (or purchased a Eva unit), you’ll already receive a self-replenishing supply of purified LCL, by taking this item, you’ll also receive a special file containing detailed instructions about how to artificially create more LCL, without needing to drain it from Lilith if you need more of it for some reason. Dead Sea Scrolls [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) What lies in front of you are the relics responsible for turning Seele into a group of religious fanatics obsessed in ascending into a godlike being by fusing with the entirety of humankind and that became their primary guide and philosophy, the legendary Secret Dead Sea Scrolls. The secret scrolls you’re receiving are a set of documents created by the First Ancestral Race to serve as a manual on the use and purposes of the contents of the Black and White Moons, the Seeds of Life and the Spears, and of the Impacts, as well as containing some prophecies about important future events. While the scrolls you’re receiving are the real ones, as Seele has already acquired all the knowledge from them that they could, and not only a copy, they’ll be repaired to their former glory but will still be written in a long lost alien language that will be up to you to discover how to translate them. In addition to the wealth of knowledge contained in the documents, new prophecies will be added in each future world you visit. The Virus of Terror [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) Ireul, the Angel of Terror and also possibly the Eleventh Angel, is a unique case among its siblings, due to being the only Angel to not needing an Evangelion to be defeated and also the only one that Nerv actively tried to hide its existence from Seele, as they would have another way to futurely attack the Geofront if they put their hands in the remains of this Angel. But, what if Seele managed to gain access to its remains? This is the result. You acquired a pen-drive containing a special program made by replicating Ireul’s data, being meant to be an extremely powerful malware programmed to serve you and developed to be able to invade and take control of any system it has access to, as well as even having some degree of adaptability to better interact with different systems and to avoid any attempt of reverse-engineering from any of your enemies. Fortunately, the mechanisms to limit its adaptability so you don’t need to worry about the virus evolving to the point of it developing some kind of self-awareness or you losing control over it. Nebuchadnezzar’s Key [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) Nebuchadnezzar II was a Babylonian king that is said to have attempted to make the Jews worship a golden statue of himself as a god. Even if the key is probably unrelated to the king, its myth became the inspiration behind its name. Somehow, you managed to acquire a backup copy of the Nebuchadnezzar’s Key, a device that looks like a stylized syringe attached in the neck of what resembles a miniature humanoid nervous system. The key’s function is to work as a recipient to contain the Angel’s physical data that allows a human (or another non-Angelic being) to abandon their humanity and ascend into a higher existence, as an Angel-like Entity, gaining abilities similar to Gendo after he used the key on himself, which includes a powerful AT Field (but still far weaker than an actual Angel’s AT Field), energy blasts and an inhuman durability. The key can be used just once due to it expending the transcendental data contained on it, but it’ll recharge and become usable again after a year. Corrupted Core [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The Nebuchadnezzar’s Key wasn’t the first artifact created with the function of containing physical data that transcends humanity to serve as a trigger for someone to ascend into a higher existence. In an alternative reality, an evil version of Dr. Katsuragi managed to survive the Second Impact thanks to the help of a Core-like object. You receive the same artifact used by him, which takes the form of a miniature Core, one that works similarly to the Nebuchadnezzar’s Key, but, while it also has the ability to turn those that enter in contact with it into an Angel-like Entity by injecting the Angels’ physical data into them, there is a key difference between these two, as the Angel-like Entities created by the key retain their original bodies, souls and minds intacts after the transformation while the entities turned by the Core end up being monstrous, giant creatures whose appearance resemble more the Angels than their original forms, with their minds being mostly lost due to being unable to support the process. Unlike the original Core, yours won’t permanently fuse with someone, as it’ll separate itself from them after the transformation is finished, but, after being used once, it’ll only become usable again after a year. Additionally, you don’t need to worry about accidentally turning someone into a monster if you don’t want it to happen and any Angel-like Entity created by the Core will also be instinctively loyal to you and, due to not being the true Angels born from the Adams, they will lack the compulsion to fuse with Lilith.",

      "description": "A regenerating (once monthly) supply of devil flesh chunks with an amount that depends on the power of the devil you choose. Primal-tiers will have only a tennis ball worth and the bottom tiers will give enough to fill a room. You can choose which devil’s parts are generated each year. Consuming the flesh will empower you and your abilities in a way related to the concept the devil represents, with abilities that were already related to said concept getting the greatest buff. At the start of each Jump you have the option to adjust the effects of this perk to the setting or opt to keep things how they were in this world. For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas. First Tier Devil [100CP] (Chainsaw Man) The first tier allows you to choose any obscure fear to represent such as the fear of tomatoes or pillows. You will be strong enough to take on most civilians and have a few unique characteristics related to your name but little in the way of supernatural powers or abilities. Any Devil Hunter worth their job title will be able to make short work of you, at least if they’re semi-prepared. Second Tier Devil [200CP] (Chainsaw Man) The second tier grants you a more significant fear and one or two useful and decently powerful abilities on the physical side. Things like the fear of bats or leeches are included. You can bring down small buildings with your best attacks and are a tough fight for inexperienced Devil Hunters. Third Tier Devil [400CP] (Chainsaw Man) The third tier is when you start becoming a true threat. You represent either a universally understood fear or a more local and potent one. You are sought after for contracts from people all around your country seeking to gain a portion of your power in exchange for life and limb. Includes things like the fear of ghosts, snakes, and curses. You have either one or two extremely potent abilities or an assortment of lesser ones. You might be able to devour other devils and regurgitate them as minions later or cause instant death to those who you pierce a few times. It would take a team of experienced and prepared hunters to take you on with no sacrifices, and you can easily bring down skyscrapers and then some. Fourth Tier Devil [500CP] (Chainsaw Man) The fourth tier puts you on the scale of a global threat. You can bring cities to ruin within the hour or travel across the world in minutes. You represent something that humans struggle to confront and cause real terror in the minds of people spanning the globe. Includes things like the fear of nuclear bombs, guns, technology, the cosmos, failure, and betrayal. Fifth Tier Devil [800CP] (Chainsaw Man) The fifth tier makes you an unimaginably powerful ancient entity that even the strongest Devil Hunters cannot hope to match. You either embody a primal fear or have abilities that within time allow you to match or surpass them. Includes things like the fear of control, death, or darkness. You have abilities on the scale of hemorrhaging living beings to death with a glance or mentally dominating any beings you consider lower than yourself on the lower end. Physically, you could devastate countries on a casual walk leaving tens of millions dead. It’s recommended you start in Hell for this. (Editor's Note: Originally this item was 400CP, but I changed it a bit to incorporate the descriptions from the [Embodiment of Fear] perk from the Chainsaw Man Jump. Which tells you what kind of power a devil conceptual at each tier would be and could do. I gave the third tier the original price of the item so that all tiers can have a price on them. If the Author wishes, they can remove the monthly and or regenerating parts of the item itself to make it more scarce and important.)",

Scar Sample [200CP] (Amnesia) This sealed vial contains a stabilized sample of the fleshy growths associated with the guardians of the Orbs. This flesh retains the Shadow’s ability to violently absorb vitality. This also effectively makes it the perfect poison to Vitae or similar forms of vital essence. However, be careful that it doesn’t grow out of control and trigger a chain reaction of apocalyptic proportions. Kaernk [200CP] (Amnesia) An aquatic species native to The Dark World. Whether due to its default nature or a mistake in transporting it here, this creature exists partially outside of this dimension, rendering it invisible. You receive two of these. While you could just use them as guards for any submerged location, their saliva is actually a potent potion ingredient that greatly expands your alchemical options.

      "description": "Elixir of Emmerysh [200CP] (Amnesia) This potion was initially discovered by the Dark World alchemist known as “The Apostate” in order to maximize Vitae collection by erasing one’s memory to render their fear fresh for each round of torture. This potion induces amnesia when orally consumed. You receive the recipe to brew more of the elixir, as well as a replenishing garden for the core ingredient: Damascus Roses. Scar Sample [200CP] (Amnesia) This sealed vial contains a stabilized sample of the fleshy growths associated with the guardians of the Orbs. This flesh retains the Shadow’s ability to violently absorb vitality. This also effectively makes it the perfect poison to Vitae or similar forms of vital essence. However, be careful that it doesn’t grow out of control and trigger a chain reaction of apocalyptic proportions. Kaernk [200CP] (Amnesia) An aquatic species native to The Dark World. Whether due to its default nature or a mistake in transporting it here, this creature exists partially outside of this dimension, rendering it invisible. You receive two of these. While you could just use them as guards for any submerged location, their saliva is actually a potent potion ingredient that greatly expands your alchemical options. Occult Acquaintance [400CP] (Amnesia) This severed head has been animated by magic and appears to belong to one of the legendary occultists of history. Their knowledge of mystical forces puts their contemporaries to shame, even though they can’t do much with it in their current state. Even more impressive than their knowledge is their ability to maintain a jovial attitude in the darkest or most revolting situations. Forgotten Idol [400CP] (Amnesia) The religion that forged this idol has been swallowed into the abyss of history, but this relic has very real power. This idol can be used to make psychic contact with powerful interdimensional entities. These beings will very often be willing to strike some kind of deal for you, but there’s no guarantee that their terms will be in your favor, or that they’ll react gracefully to rejection. Compound X [400CP] (Amnesia) Compound X is highly toxic, flammable, and corrosive, particularly when exposed to intense light. It has several more esoteric effects, such as interfering with electrical devices, fusing the flesh of different species on a molecular level, and even reanimating dead flesh, or even just chunks of flesh. You receive directions to produce this compound, with or without Vitae Brennenburg Wine [400CP] (Amnesia) Somebody extremely powerful either owes you a favor or wants you dead. These barrels of wine originate from Castle Brennenburg itself. I’d strongly advise against imbibing it. Those who drink this wine will find their bodies agonizingly deformed beyond recognition, before resurrecting as simple-minded drones enslaved to your will. Any used or lost wine is replenished each Jump.",

      "source": "Resident Evil",
      "description": "T-Virus Sample [100CP] (Resident Evil) This... are you sure this is what you seek? It's a bona fide sample of the t-Virus, the first successfully mass produced derivative of the Progenitor Virus (and easily the most prolific version out there). Highly mutagenic (and hardly leaving anyone looking human), this is what causes the usual mass zombie outbreaks with extremely few candidates ever naturally becoming a 'Tyrant'. Choose your actions wisely with this. G-Virus Sample [100CP] (Resident Evil) Ho boy, I'm starting to wonder if this is a bad idea. This sample of the G-Virus is different from the t-Virus, working with trying to spread from the primary infectee by implanting embryos in people using an organ on its hand. Compatible hosts lead to assimilation, and rejection... well, you've seen 'Alien', right? I'm sure it won't be bad. Just be mindful of all the eyes that tend to grow as a result, but at least the impressive regeneration properties you get could be a good trade-off. Maybe. T-Abyss Sample [200CP] (Resident Evil) I'm not sure if this is a good idea to offer to you, but... if you insist. This virus is a testament to potential cross-species infection vectors, infecting mammals just as efficiently as aquatic forms of life. A mix of the t-virus along with a seaborne viral agent that could let fish survive intense pressures, this mutagenic virus heavily corrodes those who it infects, turning them into aquatic themed monstrosities. Just one dose is terrifying enough, but multiple doses can lead to the victim becoming completely unrecognizable. A-Abyss Sample [200CP] (Resident Evil) Perhaps a symbol of how biotech and viral weaponry has come in this world, the Animality Virus is a devious virus that has mixed the deadly aspects of the t-Virus and mingled it with the horrid genetics of the Las Plagas parasite. Together it has created a multi-stage virus that allows for easy infection through the first stage, and then actual activation of the virus the second stage. The third stage is a vaccine to actually cure the infected or make them invisible to zombies made by it. Creepy, huh? T-Phobos Sample [200CP] (Resident Evil) Out of all the different viral agents I've seen in this world, this is one of the most unusual. Being infected does not mean an immediate transformation, but instead it reacts to the mind of the victim. So long as the victim is calm and composed, everything is fine... but when they start feeling intense fear and stress, the virus begins to activate and spread within seconds, turning them into grotesque creatures that seem right out of a nightmare. Those with strong mental strength are capable of overcoming this effect, but everyone has their breaking point. ...do be careful. T-Veronica Sample [300CP] (Resident Evil) For when you really need to heat things up. This viral strain was a combination of the Progenitor virus and an ancient retro-viral strain found in fossilized queen ants, and it shows with all the arthropodic themes that sprout out in the various mutations. On the plus side, it grants tremendous strength and combustable blood which allows you to spread fire all over the place. On the downside, it severely degrades the mental state of the host unless the virus is forced to spread very slowly over a number of years and bond with the host as a result... such as cryogenic suspension. C-Virus [300CP] (Resident Evil) When it comes to adaptation, you won't want to look further than this. A mixture of a custom t-Veronica virus and the G-Virus has lead to this mutagentic agent capable of allowing B.O.W.s to mutate and transform to what the situation demands, and even regenerate wounds quickly. However, if one takes too much damage, their bodies will heat up and even set ablaze as they die... not to mention the eye problem the G-Virus has. But hey, random chance of a chrysalis forming and letting the B.O.W. to come out stronger than ever! Even if the heat is still a problem. If dispersed through the air however, it will merely turn anyone it infects into a simple zombie, so keep that in mind. Uroboros Sample [300CP] (Resident Evil) This really isn't a good idea. Out of everything else, this is one of the worst ideas. I won't stop you, but I'm just giving fair warning. This extremely advanced Progenitor-strain virus was further enhanced with powerful t-Virus antibodies, and as such suffers the problem of extremely few candidates. Anyone who it rejects will die and turn into a tentacle-filled monster, but the few that bond with the virus will become quite superhuman... so long as you don't mind heat vulnerability and tentacles. Prototype Sample [300CP] (Resident Evil) Are you sure about this? This isn't a good… alright, whatever. Your call. This prototype viral strain is an engineered, experimental Progenitor offshoot that comes with some rather curious abilities. This virus increases the metabolism of its host, giving them incredible superhuman strength, speed and agility to the point of temporary strong bursts, increased endurance, and even a healing factor. However it has the issue of requiring a serum in precise doses at precise times to keep it from atrophying, so there's a concern you’ll need to keep in mind when you’re stomping everyone down. Progenitor Sample [300CP] (Resident Evil) The original virus that kicked this whole damned nightmare off, and the one thing a majority of this world's viral agents are derived from. This ancient West African virus is quite deadly, killing off anyone who doesn't have the correct, extremely rare genes required for the virus to bond to its host. But once the virus finds a proper host, they were rumoured to become quite powerful and even rule over the local culture as a legendary King... even for centuries, but this is unconfirmed. There's a reason why it was used as the basis for the t-Virus. Unlike the version found in the Stairway of the Sun, this sample can be replicated. So do be careful.",

      "description": "A golden trumpet signifies the apocalypse. Its sound resonates across the globe, and once you play it, seven additional trumpets will follow, heralding a series of catastrophic events. Once the trumpet is played, hail and fire mixed with blood will rain, devastating one-third of the world's nature. After this, a second trumpet will sound, and a burning meteor crashes into the ocean, turning one-third of its waters into blood, resulting in the destruction of a third of all sea life and ships. The sound of the third trumpet announces another meteor's descent, poisoning one-third of the planet's freshwater sources, and rendering it undrinkable and lethal. The sound of the fourth trumpet's call darkens one-third of the light from celestial bodies, plunging the world into complete darkness for a third of the day, even during nighttime. Before the fifth trumpet sounds, an angel will appear to warn of the impending calamities from the last three trumpets. Upon the fifth trumpet's sounds, another meteor crashes, creating a massive pit that emits endless dark smoke, obscuring sunlight. This smoke summons monstrous locusts that torment the living without killing them. The sound of the sixth trumpet summons four angels and commands a force of two hundred million mounted troops whose horses emit deadly plagues. The plagues from the horses will kill one-third of humanity. Finally, the seventh trumpet sounds, bringing forth a blinding white light that will destroy the world. You are immune to the effects of the calamities that the trumpets bring and can control the beings summoned by the trumpet. This trumpet is unbreakable and can only be played by you. You can only play this trumpet again once the effects of the seventh trumpet have finished. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 600CP to 2400CP due to its purely destructive nature.)",

It is a unique weapon of daunting destruction capable of vanishing anyone who opposes its bearer and vanishes after a single use. But to be more direct in its specific usage. It is the only weapon in the setting capable of killing divine beings. And considering Angels are immune to all forms of physical damage. The inclusion of Gods will be just as affected. In setting it will be a single use, but after the gauntlet, it can be used more than once without vanishing. (Editor’s Note: Buying both the Sapioma and Red Communion will grant you access to buying a Primordial Vessel from an additional 200CP. Also buying either one first will grant a discount for the other. All three items I used to enact a process called “Soul Transposition”, you can learn more from this by going to the Godhusk jump and reaching the source material linked at the Notes section of the Jump.)",

      "description": "Seven Star Sword [400CP] (One Piece) What a beauty this is... It is no wonder then why this sword is considered by many to be the world’s most beautiful weapon, a treasure beyond so many others. With its baleful emerald glow, few could ever deny the beauty of this sword, even in the midst of the most frantic of battles. And beyond beauty, the sword itself contains power. By draining the blood of others, the blade can strengthen itself along with its wielder. And while strengthened, the sword shall capable of healing its wielder, even fixing a broken arm in only a scant few minutes. More than that, the sword can wreathe itself in emerald flames, unleashing green fire and even solidifying it to resemble snakes. Finally, your blade is a sentient thing, one with a mind of its own. And yet, this mind is loyal to your will and to you and those you deem worthy, its curse might as well not even exist. Dyna Stones [1000CP] (One Piece) Perhaps the greatest weapons the World Government has at their disposal, Dyna Stones are even said to rival the Ancient Weapons in the power. Stored within thick metal cases and suspended in a translucent purple liquid, once exposed to the air, they shall react violently, and unleash their true might. A single Dyna Stone can destroy an entire island and you get to have three! These stones will replenish monthly and who knows? Perhaps you can find a different way to use these stones beyond mere weapons. Fantastic Orb [1200CP] (One Piece) A round, shiny blue gem covered in moving white specks, this small orb has a truly wondrous power that few could ever match. The ability to give shape to the desires of its wielder. From turning a wasteland into a paradise fit for kings, projecting the memories of its wielders, to bringing life to one’s creations, to sealing away foes and more, this orb is fantastic and mighty indeed. Using it is based on one’s lifeforce and so, the mightier one is, the more they will be able to utilize this orb’s capabilities. And should you not be strong enough, you could very well meet your end while using this orb for your own purposes. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the prices of Seven Star Sword from 200CP to 400CP, Dyna Stones from 600CP to 1000CP (they’re comparable to nuclear bombs without the fallout), and Fantastic Orb from 600CP to 1200CP.)",

      "description": "Memetic Hazard [100CP*] (SCP Foundation) This has nothing to do with magic compulsions or ESP. These anomalies are spread by cultural information, and interacts with the mind in ways that can create dangerous results through new behaviour or perceptions. Memetic Hazards have to be understood to be effective and many are only be effective when used on certain people with compatible experiences that allow them to be understood. They are often language-based; a common example of a non-anomalous meme being how one might read text with certain internal voices if it matches a known catchphrase. Learning about these kinds of hazards often inspires desire to share the experience with friends and family which compounds the potential danger of memetic hazards. They’re not inherently lethal and may even be enjoyable, but can be seen like contagious ideas that spread person-to-person. As a Memetic Hazard, you can design a single custom effect of your choosing. The limitations above affect what kind of meme you can unleash. Memetic Hazard: Five: For 200SCP more, this means becoming a Sentient Memeplex on top of spreading a contagious idea. Your true form in this world is the memetic hazard, becoming metaphysical instead of physical. Your influence is limited by thoughts of sapient culture who need to meet some predesignated criteria before you can act. You might only be real to people with certain mental conditions (SCP-870/-1261), only by those who start to grasp your true nature (SCP-3125), or only appear around certain people who lack key information about your true form or personality (SCP-4352). As such noospheric forms are at least partially imaginary, you have a lot of wiggle room to decide your appearance, though it won’t be inherently powerful without other perks. Cognitohazardous [200CP] (SCP Foundation) While technically all memetics fall under this umbrella term, these have far more broad utility. Where memetics cause ideas to take root and spread cognitohazards may go further and create tangible effects. Their triggers are instantaneous, merely sensing this anomaly will cause someone to their effects without need to understand it. Any sense may be the vector for a cognitohazard; some are visual while others are auditory or even olfactory. The wide variety of potential effects covered by these are not limited to mental effects, and can do physical harm (as dramatic as having their lungs fill with seawater, being hunted by illusory monsters that can hurt them, or even anthropomorphizing animals) as well. To be cognitohazardous you must first pick a perceivable feature or ability of yours to carry the effect. You can modify it whatever natural states if desired (unnatural appearances, sounds, scent, textures, etc.). This could be something as deadly as basilisk’s gaze or as subtle as entrancing targets into obedience. Infohazard [300CP] (SCP Foundation) An immediate danger in many cases. This is a piece of information that is anomalous. It is no less dangerous for not being observed, and many infohazards can be entirely unable to be comprehended by humans in some cases. This class of anomaly can present a danger in some or all information about it. They may react and adapt when details are shared, automatically destroy some types of information, or unleash even more esoteric effects if the wrong information about them is presented. This extends to information stored in living beings, though some infohazards only deal damage when presented in certain ways. You can decide if the anomalous information is about you, your abilities, or is not specifically tied to you but is just information you possess. You can also decide to what extent this information is able to affect those who know it. Some specific examples of abilities that could be chosen through this are: having information can never be denied or forgotten, all perceptions or descriptions of you match how you want to be recorded, or even knowing about an afterlife you own ensures you get claim on the unfortunate soul.",

As such a person, you have the ability to hear the spirits and ghosts of the world and whatever might be the afterlife, listening in on the ambient spirits in your location or searching for specific ones, such as the ghosts of someone who has died near where you are or who has an important connection to that place. You can communicate clearly with spirits, though they do not often communicate clearly back, and you even have a natural sense for the presence of other paranormal beings or events, like how a human might feel the heat from a fire.",

But if you stare at a spiral in motion for long enough, sometimes it feels like eternity is within reach. As the spiral continues to spin, even elements such as time appear to bend under the spiral’s influence, breaking away from its normal flow as you get closer and closer to the center. Stay in the spiral for long enough and you’ll find that your own sense of time becomes equally distorted and whimsical. The longer you remain in this state, the more substantial the warping of time will become, to the point that as long as you’re in the proper mindset, you can distort the flow of time around you, slowing it down in places, speeding it up in others. Those nearby will be drawn into the flow as the spiral sucks them in indiscriminately. The first several times that the spiral sucks you in may be disorienting, but it affects everyone else equally – at least you have the chance to get used to it. Once the spiral stops spinning, it won’t take long for the world to shift back into normal gear. So if you come to rely on the spiral’s influence on others, you should remember to never let your concentration break – as that will be enough to break the spiral’s hold on those nearby.

You’re quite talented in imbuing magic into objects, whether to enchant a crossbow with the power of the full moon or to create a key that permits entry through a specific magical barrier. Autonomous construct sentinels of great strength and mobile vehicles with a will of their own are also possible for your hands to construct. However, your greatest talent lies in the area of crystalline prosthetics. Arms, legs-and perhaps even greater portions of the human body can all be replaced with crystalline duplicates that amplify and refine control over all magic associated with the stars above. Curiously your knowledge base also carries with it an exceptional background in making dolls. Not only are you able to expertly construct, maintain and modify doll bodies for disembodied souls in need of one to inhabit, but you also know how to brew potions that can slay the drinker-and enslave their soul to be bound into a puppet of your design. Thus bound, they can be summoned and commanded at will like any spirit save with far less volition of their own. Whatever you could intend with such an art?",

You are also a skilled parent to not just natural children, but also to any creature you may create, allowing you to shape them into functioning people despite whatever they may truly be. In particular, intelligent forms of undead you care for seem to develop their own morality, one that is molded by you over the course of your care for them, even if they’d normally be inherently evil and destructive. This can even grant a soul to the soulless, even if it is a weak one. Secondly, your necromantic abilities are far more subtle in nature, becoming difficult to notice or detect in a variety of ways, at least if you choose to take it slow. This also makes any attempt at healing using your necromantic abilities more effective.

The senders are the people most skilled at channelling this energy, and you can count yourself among their number - though of course being strong in ‘the Shine' is also useful for travel (hardly necessary, however). You may either astrally project (by dreaming or in a drug-fuelled state) - in which you will be drawn back to the world you came from by ‘the chimes’, or actually cross over, in which case you will be physically transported to the world. Both methods of travel are extremely dangerous. Unlike a Planeswalker Spark, this will not give you free access to the entire Multiverse, but it will let you reach a few worlds that overlap or touch upon your current location, separated by only a little - and somehow there will always be other worlds, layers of reality or dimensions, or new places to explore, even if the setting would be assumed to lack a pseudo-multiversal nature, and even if there wouldn’t normally be.

As you know, they possess the same qualities of emitting ‘presence’ and completely erasing it. Allowing you the same immunity to all forms of physical damage through an unearthly intangibility. However, you cannot hone it to only select parts of you to make intangible. It’s a full body off and on deal.

Dead Apostles already possess the ability to create things like The Dead or control animal familiars using their blood, even possessing them directly as an extension of their will and receiving sustenance from all they consume. Now, that extends to all things you create by your own hands - any undead or artificial being you create is incapable of disobeying or turning against you, you possess full awareness of their thoughts and an ability to control their minds with a simple act of will, and all things they consume or absorb are sent directly to you, even if you were miles away during the act. In case you’d rather not starve them, you may decide how much you take from them at will, whether some or all or none of what they devour. Blood, meat, magical energy - whatever they devour, the spoils are given as tithe to the true Lord of the Castle.",

You're exceptionally weak and vulnerable in this form compared to your old body due to it lacking the training or biological abilities you once had. While in this form you have the power to shunt your soul into other beings and steal their body, but this is exceptionally difficult due to them having the home field advantage.

His cults lie to people, tricking them into leaping into Oblivion. They argue that life is pain and suffering before dying, only to reincarnate into new beings who lived lives equally full of pain and suffering. They say the comforting embrace of Oblivion will erase all pain, end all unhappiness, scourge all regret. Sins will no longer exist, for there will be none alive to commit them. The rich man and the poor man will be as brothers, for there will be no wealth to hoard or covet. All will be at perfect, infinite peace. All will be one with Oblivion. All will be good. And taking the core of his doctrine to heart, you may take a more proactive approach to enter all life into the Void, willingly or not. You may infuse your attacks with the all-consuming void, making it so that whatever you slay can never be brought back. Things wounded or broken by you can never be healed or mended. If you snapped a sword in half, not even a master artisan could put the sword back together from its pieces, for it is forever broken, it’s wholeness consigned to the Void. You may consign the souls of your victims to Oblivion, never to leave a ghost. Only things too mighty to ever truly die are exempt from this, as they instead form tomb-bodies like those of the Neverborn, doomed forever to the agony of the dreaming dead.",

While the warping of time fundamentally involves warping the subject’s senses, this ability is a blatant violation of reality, as it forcefully joins inanimate objects together. Buildings, machines, anything that isn’t alive can be forcefully melded together to form a congruous chain...just like a spiral. When the functions of the contributing components don’t interfere with one another, generally the final product will retain the properties of the original. But because the spiral can slowly blend entities of different natures together as one, when the contributing components don’t mesh very well, the resulting object probably won’t function as you’d expect it to. Making a long chain of row houses will work fine – but trying to create a massive centipede out of different human corpses and construction parts won’t work all that well.

Due to this magic this way is fairly draining but also capable of many great things. As an example this form of magic could when used with the right books even revive the dead. Using a book medium uses roughly 25% of the energy required for a speech-only version of this magic though the book method is more rigid and restricted to what's written.

They can quickly spiral out of control, especially the spiral-class hermeneutic ones. Threats that immediately begin warping the mind and body just because they have been perceived are extremely hard to counter. Luckily for you – you aren’t in the business of countering them but creating them. Why cast a spell when you can make it a smell? Any of your existing powers can be adjusted to operate through the same mechanisms as cognitohazards. Sight-based, sound-based, etc. You can alter how your abilities target by changing them into any form that can be perceived. When you make such a hazard, you can also create/specify the unique kind of sensory experience required to trigger it. These new tastes or textures can’t be anything anomalously harmful on their own but take as much energy to make as the original ability would have drained. The main limit is this won’t make powers take effect any faster than they would before. It just provides endless new methods of targeting by giving your abilities the ability to target based on new cues you make for them.",

A Mononoke’s physical body reflects both the years that they have seen, as well as their spiritual strength. Time isn’t necessarily a factor you can control as a Mononoke except by continuing to survive, but you can affect your spiritual strength through direct means. As the pool of spiritual energy that you possess grows, the limitations of your physical form will lift, allowing you to grow even larger in size. As you’ll come to understand from other Mononoke however, it is possible to influence the size of those around you as well. A strong Mononoke willing to spread a bit of their strength around can enhance the rest of their tribe. Nowadays though, faced with the humans threatening extermination on their doorstep, there are few Mononoke who can spare the time or energy to such pursuits. Beyond simple growth, few Mononoke are capable of directly manipulating their size – but that is not to say that it isn’t possible. With a high level of control over your spiritual powers, it is possible for you to shift your size between that of your maximum and your original base before any growth took place. Perhaps if you could find the Forest Lord, he could enlighten you further as to how shifting your form works – but few have ever earned an audience with that legendary beast.",

If you are skilled in divination magic, scry at will through any sigul of yours. With enough exposure, a certain percentage of people in any area will fall under your thrall. If they never meet you, they will merely dream of you and try to behave in ways that seem akin to your will. If you have dream magic, exposure to your sigul creates a conduit in their sleep that you may exploit to more fully bend them to your will. If you make your physical presence known, all of those affected by this perk will immediately form a cult around you. The sigul can also be emblazoned across the sky in a chilling display of raw power.

Similarly, you can convert a physical object into an object in the Dreamlands. This can affect living beings, but it takes more effort and becomes physically and mentally draining. They must also be either willing, or lack intellect capable of giving consent to your actions. In future worlds, there probably won’t be a Dreamlands for you to access; however, you can now pull things out of ordinary dreams.

      "description": "Life in the City is not for everyone, or anyone really. But for a few people, it breaks their resolve completely and utterly, drowning them in despair until they simply hyper-fixate on a single desire of theirs. Those seeded with the Light who go through this process become Distortions, monsters of the mind, and failures of the ego. Perhaps for a certain fee we could make you have gone through this process, but not lose your mind (at least not, from Distorting). A chef desiring to bring new flavors to his failing restaurant might gain the ability to pull the thoughts from people's minds and cook them into delicious ones, more ready to appreciate his work. A gunman who lost faith in humanity might gain the ability to test people by firing bullets that force the victim to relive their trauma, and will surely destroy them if they fail to overcome it. A lonely photographer, shaken by the thought that none may remember them, might gain the ability to draw in and take photos of people that slowly cause all their connections to wither away along with their will to live. An aspiring professional pianist... well, you’re not getting power on his scale just yet, but suffice to say, the Distortion can cause all sorts of calamities regardless of the original focus. As you feed deeper into your despair and fulfill the one remaining desire left, you will gain more and more esoteric abilities, as well as the ability to warp the very scenery around you into a representation of your mindset. (Editor’s Note: This perk does have a capstone boosted effect, it can be found in the Library of Ruina jump. The perk EGOtistical is the capstone booster)",

This could be a blessing similar to that given by the Mer-Line to Magikrab, granting it a large boost in intelligence and significant magical power. It could be a power based on the way that the archangel would break the rules in battle, perhaps giving you the power to puppet someone’s actions or alter your size, depending on which archangel has blessed you. Whatever shape this power takes, the nature of the archangel makes the power ‘more real’, giving it an additional potency when competing with abilities in the same area.

See, lacking a body means phase through solid matter with nary a twinge of discomfort. For a small amount of mana, you could even phase through energy barriers or magical defenses. If you happen to have a body, well, that’s no real detriment, since you now know how to temporarily convert your body to that of an Apparition, though that process takes a small amount of mana. Incidentally, the same process can be reversed by those without a body to transform an Apparition into a Wraith temporarily. Same ghostly appearance, but made of flesh. You may, at will, cause a localized disturbance in any remote viewing device aimed your way, or even aimed at an area you’re currently heading towards. The strength of this disturbance depends entirely on how much energy you put into it, but at the very least it will appear as static, and could simply black out all but the most powerful of scrying methods entirely. Greater Shadows [400CP] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath) The Forgotten can be said to be the Queen of Shadows, for her most powerful servants are known only as Shadows. Shadows possess many terrifying abilities, and this perk unlocks them for you. Not only can you now liberate a gem controlled by another Wizard from its socket, but you can craft projectiles and even pseudo-demons out of pure shadow (and mana). These Shadow Projectiles and Shadow Spawn will always head directly for the most powerful energy source in the area and attack mindlessly, but they’re incredibly cheap to produce, so what do you care if they die in droves? However, this is not the limit of your power, for you possess a trio of unusual abilities. First, you can expend some of your energy to disperse yourself into a cloud of shadow that is immune to all forms of direct damage. In this form you can rapidly travel long distances, but the longer you maintain this form the more draining it is. Second, you can collapse into a tight, virtually undamageable, ball of shadows in which you rapidly recover from damage you’ve suffered, but you’re unable to take any action or move while in this form. And last, you can use your shadow powers to “possess” any soulless creatures around (such as demons) and grant them increased health, boosted defenses, and speed... plus potentially shields, regeneration, or other buffs that you might know how to grant. You can control those you've possessed, but it is a clumsy control and requires a constant application of will.",

      "description": "For centuries, the people have been worshipping the Mononoke, respectfully yielding to their demands and making sacrifices in their honour. But if this land is to change, then these antiquated traditions must be done away with, along with the spirits that they’re tied to. Even a God can be taken apart, once the people realize that they aren’t as omnipotent as they seem. If humans were capable of empowering these spirits with offerings and sacrifices, then humans will be capable of taking them down with their own techniques or technology. Many of the Mononoke and spiritual beings in general possess an amazing resilience towards the weapons which were brought over from across the sea. Despite the sheer power of these weapons, which are capable of blowing men apart, the spirits seem to be able to endure many shots off of willpower alone. This is especially prominent when it comes to spirits that have seen decades come and go. But where there’s a will, there will be a way, and you have a means to penetrate these formidable defences the spirits possess. It won’t be pretty or merciful by any means, but then the Mononoke have never bothered to spare the humans any quarter either. Regardless of whether you channel this through the weapon in your hand or through the techniques that you bring to bear on your target, you can infuse the anger or hatred that you feel for your mark and inflict upon them a lingering curse. While the wounds that you inflict can be treated, even recovered from in time, they will grow in intensity and spread through the victim’s body should the victim submit to the anger or hatred that you infused into the blow. Naturally, if they harbour thoughts of retribution or resentment, this would only accelerate the process. Even old wounds can open up again, the more they fixate on these negative sentiments. Without ridding themselves of the mental influence from the curse and banishing the thoughts completely, neither the curse nor the wounds will vanish. If the mind succumbs before the body, the victim risks becoming one of the vengeful spirit of old. The humans from decades past called these spirits the Tatarigami, and they existed as entities stripped of reason and logic – driven only by a destructive desire to act out whatever negative emotion overwhelmed them in the first place. Tatarigami aren’t all too common, given that most will succumb to their wounds before their mind is overwhelmed. But considering that your curse works just as well on mere men as it would on the Mononoke and other spirits, it isn’t completely out of the realm of possibility for a human to become a vengeful spirit in this fashion. I don’t think we need to warn you to exercise temperance when considering whether to inflict such a curse upon a target.",

Should you essentially ‘die offscreen’, and perhaps leave a corpse that could plausibly be you, others will genuinely believe you are dead and cease any further attempts to track you down. Any direct recordings of your demise or survival will ruin this deception, so you may need to ensure anyone with a camera is suitably distracted before you ‘die’.

      "description": "You possess the ability to infuse your being into a place or object. When you do so you no longer physically exist, merely being a spirit inhabiting the location and using it as an anchor for your existence. In this state you may be exorcised, forcing you to no longer haunt the object or location, and making it so you cannot haunt another for a period. You require an emotional attachment to the place or object to haunt it, and beginning to haunt a location or object requires a fair commitment of time and effort. While haunting an object or location you may use your spiritual and psychic powers, or any supernatural power that doesn’t inherently require a body, out from it, and possess the ability to project your senses through it. You will also be able to perform limited psychokinesis, create illusions and hallucinations, and even reality warping around the haunted object/place, though the strength of this effect will be based on your emotional attachment; you could stretch a hallway so that it was longer on the inside than the outside for a time, teleport objects, or with a stronger attachment rearrange rooms, or even influence the flow of time around the location. This reality warping cannot directly affect a living being. Capstone Boosted: w/ Harbinger of the End - Resentment Curse: Your haunting is contagious, able to spread to objects left within the haunted location, or close proximity of a haunted item, and to even linger on people who enter or leave it. It can even spread from these secondary haunted objects or individuals, spreading like a disease. It’s much easier to remove the haunting from these secondary recipients, and your powers are weaker when manifested from them, but you may spread further and further. Your haunting will also automatically follow to any copies made of a haunted object or location.",

      "description": "Like a Fish to Water [100CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) With all the time you have spent in the sea, it is practically a second home for you. You might not be a fish, but the degree of comfort and finesse you exhibit while working underwater can fool anyone into thinking that you were born in the ocean. Conditions can change rapidly while you are out at sea, but as long as the shift is gradual you can quickly acclimatize yourself to your surroundings, so regions where the waters may be colder or aphotic zones will not pose much of an issue to you, but anoxic regions will remain a threat. Scavenger of Blue Water [200CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) In the years following the disastrous global flooding, many people had no choice but to take to the waters and test their fortunes. Trawling the ocean floor for necessities and treasures became a common practice for those looking to turn their fortunes around. Scoring a good find could give an impoverished man the opportunity to live “the good life”, at least for a while. But the lifestyle is not for everyone – it is dangerous and profits are never a guarantee. You are a bit of a peculiarity in this regard, scavenging for you will always provide you with the basic necessities to get by. Other scavengers will recognize that your skills in the field stem from “natural talent”. You may venture to places where others have dove and found nothing, yet as long as there is something hidden away, your senses will alert you to where you can find the goods. By relying on your talent you should have no problem turning a profit in this business, but practice does make a difference: the experience will give you insight into figuring out where a dive may turn out to be dangerous, and what precautions you need to take to reduce the risks. Resonance Harmonics [400CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) Communication poses one of the most significant challenges out at sea. Even communication between different vessels and different nationalities can already pose a challenge, but throw in all the various species of Hybrids and the whole situation only becomes more complicated. But many of the Hybrids are effectively sea creatures, and many sea creatures are no strangers to parsing their environment through the use of sound. You might not be able to speak fluent whale or fish, but if you concentrate on a single “message” while hitting a creature with bursts of sound (any sound will suffice), you will be able to get your intentions across to them. The method is not foolproof and you will benefit from throwing in body motions and gestures if the option is available, but at the very least the creature you are trying to speak to will understand the general gist of what you are trying to convey. Persistence is key to success here – even if the initial message is not fully understood, as long as you repeat it, they will eventually come to understand you, and strangely enough, most creatures you encounter will stick around during the course of your perhaps one-sided conversation. If you are quick enough, you may even be able to stop them from attacking you. Because this is so dependent on sound, some creatures which are naturally deaf will be difficult to communicate with using this method (This also means that land animals who can pick up sound can also be communicated with using this method). Other creatures which are incapable of producing sound, such as sharks, will have issues when it comes to communicating back to you. You will have to figure out how to establish a dialogue on your own. That said, if you can hold the exchange for long enough or with enough members of their species, learning how they communicate with one another and adopting their “language” is a plausible avenue for you to take. Specifically when it comes to individuals, you may find that if you communicate with the same creatures frequently using this method, they will quickly bond to you – like whales in a pod.",

      "description": "Like a Fish to Water [100CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) With all the time you have spent in the sea, it is practically a second home for you. You might not be a fish, but the degree of comfort and finesse you exhibit while working underwater can fool anyone into thinking that you were born in the ocean. Conditions can change rapidly while you are out at sea, but as long as the shift is gradual you can quickly acclimatize yourself to your surroundings, so regions where the waters may be colder or aphotic zones will not pose much of an issue to you, but anoxic regions will remain a threat. Scavenger of Blue Water [200CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) In the years following the disastrous global flooding, many people had no choice but to take to the waters and test their fortunes. Trawling the ocean floor for necessities and treasures became a common practice for those looking to turn their fortunes around. Scoring a good find could give an impoverished man the opportunity to live “the good life”, at least for a while. But the lifestyle is not for everyone – it is dangerous and profits are never a guarantee. You are a bit of a peculiarity in this regard, scavenging for you will always provide you with the basic necessities to get by. Other scavengers will recognize that your skills in the field stem from “natural talent”. You may venture to places where others have dove and found nothing, yet as long as there is something hidden away, your senses will alert you to where you can find the goods. By relying on your talent you should have no problem turning a profit in this business, but practice does make a difference: the experience will give you insight into figuring out where a dive may turn out to be dangerous, and what precautions you need to take to reduce the risks. Resonance Harmonics [400CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) Communication poses one of the most significant challenges out at sea. Even communication between different vessels and different nationalities can already pose a challenge, but throw in all the various species of Hybrids and the whole situation only becomes more complicated. But many of the Hybrids are effectively sea creatures, and many sea creatures are no strangers to parsing their environment through the use of sound. You might not be able to speak fluent whale or fish, but if you concentrate on a single “message” while hitting a creature with bursts of sound (any sound will suffice), you will be able to get your intentions across to them. The method is not foolproof and you will benefit from throwing in body motions and gestures if the option is available, but at the very least the creature you are trying to speak to will understand the general gist of what you are trying to convey. Persistence is key to success here – even if the initial message is not fully understood, as long as you repeat it, they will eventually come to understand you, and strangely enough, most creatures you encounter will stick around during the course of your perhaps one-sided conversation. If you are quick enough, you may even be able to stop them from attacking you. Because this is so dependent on sound, some creatures which are naturally deaf will be difficult to communicate with using this method (This also means that land animals who can pick up sound can also be communicated with using this method). Other creatures which are incapable of producing sound, such as sharks, will have issues when it comes to communicating back to you. You will have to figure out how to establish a dialogue on your own. That said, if you can hold the exchange for long enough or with enough members of their species, learning how they communicate with one another and adopting their “language” is a plausible avenue for you to take. Specifically when it comes to individuals, you may find that if you communicate with the same creatures frequently using this method, they will quickly bond to you – like whales in a pod.",

And you’ve learn how to make it so. You may impose this ‘inner world’, usually but not always representative of your personality and desires, upon the physical world around you, changing its laws to match those of the world within. Unlike Marble Phantasm, which is reshaping the world according to your will and its existing laws, your Reality Marble has a set ‘world’ and ‘rules’ behind it chosen when you purchase this perk. Perhaps your body is a collection of various lives and familiars that count towards your own, or you create a fog that feeds off the fear of those within it and making those fears a reality. Either way, you may manifest this world and impose it on The World, keeping it manifested so long as your magical reserves could sustain it before the World re-asserts its normal rules - though a Reality Marble that is only imposed on your own body could be sustained indefinitely, as the World itself does not see it as a contradiction to its own laws. While most Dead Apostles develop this trait naturally after some time and research, the benefit to purchasing it is worth noting. First, you suffer no degradation (physical or mental) from your chosen Reality Marble - one that requires a particular sort of insanity wouldn’t afflict you in any sort of way, nor would your personality be lost in a sea of various beings contained within it. Second, you may create your own or recreate a Reality Marble belonging to someone else in this world, though practice and effort would be needed to create something akin to TATARI and be able to sustain it for more than a short amount of time with what you start with. Third, it is based entirely on your experiences - so a ‘collection’ Reality Marble such as Unlimited Blade Works or Ionian Hetairoi would be based on only what you have seen or experienced first-hand one way or another. Lastly, you may decide the suitably thematic incantation (if any) for the Marble yourself.",

For Meisters, this means easily being able to adjust their wavelength so they may become compatible with and wield nearly any Demon Weapon. Those without this who are incompatible with a Demon Weapon wouldn't even be able to lift them. This also works in reverse though, as Demon Weapons with this perk can adjust their own wavelength and allow themselves to be wielded by anyone. Utility Meister can also be used to resonate with people besides meisters and weapons, forming a link between souls as long as the wielder of the perk wishes. Resonance with non-Meisters or Demon Weapons normally just grants an emotional link letting all parties involved more easily feel what the other is feeling. Those with Anti-Demon Wavelength and Utility Meister are able to use them together to pull others from madness though, while those baring souls aligned with madness are able to use resonance to corrupt others. This ability requires close proximity, but grants an instinctual understanding of how to adjust your wavelength to resonate with others. While it is easy to resonate with willing allies, it can be forcefully resisted by the other party and stressful emotional states like rage or fear can make it more difficult to Soul Menace [400CP] (Soul Eater) By purchasing perk, you have gained the immense proficiency and skill required to manipulate your soul wavelength and perform the special move known as \"Soul Menace\". Soul Menace is a form of \"self-resonance\" with one's soul, meaning that the user's own soul temporarily becomes powerful enough that it is not restricted to using the amplification of a weapon in order to attack. By resonating with one's own soul the user can drive their own soul wavelength directly into an opponent's body through a physical contact. The incompatible wavelength and strong concussive force generated can cause strong direct and internal damage, bypassing most defenses due to the soul based nature of the attack. Your proficiency with the technique allows you to perform it at a moment's notice, throttling the opponent's bones, organs and even their soul if it's exposed. Just be careful, repeated use over a prolonged period of time can become taxing.",

It is you... You are now capable of emitting a constant stream of corruption, an invisible madness, half metaphorical and half real. If you stay in a place long enough, your corruption will start to take root in the world around you, slowly spreading until it completely saturates the location. First to go will be the mindless creatures, from the smallest insect to the largest beast, they will warp and mutate. Next will be the flora, growing increasingly strange and unnatural. Then the humans, and such sapient beings, will become more and more twisted and depraved. Eventually the madness will seep into the very ground, soaking the stones in its otherworldly effect. The effect your corruption has on the world will entirely depend on what powers you possess, on what desires you carry, consciously or otherwise, and what emotions you are feeling. A man who dearly loves butterflies might see all bugs and beasts growing wings reminiscent of them, or the flowers growing in such familiar shapes. A man with great power over fire might see the ground growing molten, and the trees blackening in to coal- like material. A man who is depressed might see the human inhabitants of his garden growing gloom and gaunt. The effects of this Perk are infinitely cumulative, growing stranger and stranger with time. You will gain a sense akin to proprioception of your domain, sensing the twisting streets or never-ending stairs as if limbs and appendages. Once the place is sufficiently saturated, enough that the very stone feels like your own skin, or such, you will become immortal. Being able to endlessly resurrect yourself, as long as you perish inside your zone. This effect can be turned on and off at will, as well as have its progression halted at a certain point. If you leave your domain, the effect will slowly start to disappear. Taking exactly twice as long as it was applied to fully dissipate. Living creatures transformed by your effect will not revert to normal, even if you or they leave the corruption zone or if the zone dissipates. Structures transformed into unnatural shapes by this Perk will become normal materials again and crumble, once reality reasserts itself.

More importantly you can create small illusions which can affect reality to a small degree causing real effects and sensation though no bigger than a horse in scale of effects.

Foggy Dreams [600CP] (Silent Hill) Silent Hill has been described before as a dream, with the Fog World being the lighter layer of sleep, and the Otherworld being the deeper layer of sleep. Whether this is true or not isn’t fully understood. Regardless, you have an innate power to you. Psychic power. This innate power manifests as telekinesis, astral projection, and telepathy. This is simply due to how deeply connected to the land you are. These powers are not that strong outside of Silent Hill, or outside of other areas where mind and matter meld, but inside they are boosted to immense power. Telekinesis can become enough to break bones or throw large objects, mental projections can become physical. Capstone Boosted: Oh, I see. Your power has reached its height. Your own mind is able to meld with the matter around you. Your powers are always at full strength, and you gain the ability to wield divine lightning much like the Incubator that the Order wished to use to birth God.",

      "description": "Key Genes [100CP] (Resident Evil) A majority of these viral agents are very deadly, yes. But at the same time, many of these viral agents are based on Progenitor... which requires a specific gene to fully bring out its potential. Problem is, it's really rare, to the point where 1 in 10 million people have this trait! Thing is... now you have it too. You will find yourself successfully bonding with Progenitor-derived viral agents, bringing out unusual traits. As a plus, your ability to accept genetic splices, grafts, or modifications while mitigating complications have increased significantly, which means augmentations will have a greater effect on you. Just don't let Umbrella find this out… Hypnos Gene [300CP] (Resident Evil) That which does not kill you, makes you stronger. Of course depending on who you talk to this could easily be a load of bullshit, but some seem determined to prove it right. This is an incredibly rare gene, rarer than even the genes that bond the host with Progenitor and its derivatives. It works by killing the weaker cells through natural selection, leaving only the strongest to keep the organism ongoing and encouraging the reproduction of the better cells. However, keep in mind that this is an extremely slow process, so don't expect to take on giants for a good long time... but one day you could. Time will be your greatest ally with this... a very slow, but steady ally. Mutational Mastery [600CP] (Resident Evil) You are your own master. Sure, they can try to stick you with needles or graft things on you, but at the end of the day it is your mind that controls the body. Not theirs. Your sense of self has an iron-clad hold upon your form, and as a result your body has obtained an odd quirk. When willingly being given mutagens or genetic splices, you can determine what physical traits even appear on your body, and where they go. Virus that gives giant shoulder eyes but grants amazing regen? Move the eye to the chest, or even just make a tiny third eye on the forehead. It's your call, now.",

      "description": "Madness Wavelength [200CP] (Soul Eater) Purchasing this gives you the ability to switch on and off a mild \"Aura of Madness\" with some special properties. This aura causes radios and other electronics within its area of effect, which is approximately the size of a large house at first, to start emitting sound blurring static. It will also (very) slowly wear away at the sanity of any sentient beings within its area of effect, besides you of course. Those who are INCREDIBLY stressed out will even start experience vivid, realistic and horrifying hallucinations. Interestingly, if you stay in the same general area with your Madness Wavelength on for a few months, you can slowly \"corrupt\" and control this area. The scenery will become more broken up and chaotic with time, and you will even gain some influence over it with enough \"corruption.\" Things like making faucets spray blood, causing doors and windows to rapidly open and close or make shadows dance at your leisure. This can allow a homebody Jumper to really give themselves the home field advantage. Upon purchasing this, you may choose a \"theme\" for you Madness Wavelength such as \"Order\" or \"Power\" that influences the effects. For example, someone who chooses \"Fear\" for their wavelength will have an easier time inducing panic and warping their surroundings, while someone who picks \"Greed\" may corrupt their surroundings to become more lavish instead of spooky and twist those around them to become more selfish. As with most other Soul Wavelength based abilities, the potency of this ability scales with the strength of the wielder's soul. This specific ability also relies on the depth of the wielder's madness to grow in strength though, making it a bit trickier to train. As the ability grows though, a few months can be dropped to weeks, possibly even days, though this would require an extremely powerful soul or a truly insane individual, or both. Big Top [800CP] (Soul Eater) When Madness accumulates, it pools like some primordial spawning bit, and the things that crawl out of accumulated Madness, personifications of Madness itself, are known as Clowns. You now have the ability to spawn servile Clowns from the Madness found within your Soul. Clowns have nonsense biology and vary dramatically in appearance from one to the next, even having differing special abilities from one to the next. They do have a few things in common, like sharing the same Madness Wavelength as the one who spawned them, and they're not shy about outputting it to spread it either as part of their nature. They can also feed on your Madness to heal themselves, even from death as long as their body wasn't completely destroyed and they're given plenty of time to soak it in. The strength of your Madness Wavelength also influences how fast they can heal, so in an ideal situation they would be both nearby and your soul would be real strong. Clowns you spawn would view you like a god, serving with the loyalty of a religious zealot. One must be careful exactly what tasks are assigned to them, as while personalities and personal desires can vary, the Madness they're born from can give them certain shared inclinations. A Clown born from Madness of Fear will often look and act in unsettling ways and wish to inspire fear in whatever way they can think of to plant the seeds of fear and doubt far and wide. A Clown born from Madness of Knowledge however would often be much more inquisitive and enigmatic, acting in ways that encourage others to ask or answer questions. These are just two of innumerable examples, and they may still surprise you in the end as they are by nature unpredictable beings. You would only be able to summon one or two Clowns at first, with the default power of your soul, and they wouldn't be tooooo terribly strong. Give it enough time though and you'll be able to spawn whole armies of powerful personifications of Madness with unquestionable loyalty!",

Now he’s no longer the only one capable of granting that sort of knowledge. You’re capable of placing concepts you can understand like love, evil, good or even death and place them in a fruit. When someone who doesn’t understand or have that concept consumes the food they will become able to understand that concept. Blessings, Curses, and Miracles [600CP] (Genesis) This is a world of promises, tests, trust, faith and the relationships between humans and beings much more powerful than them. Using the faith humans had in God and the trust he had for them, many circumstances that should not have happened were able to be realized thanks to the power of miracles. You have gained the ability to make miracles come true, either in the form of blessings or in the form of curses. For miracles to be able to take effect you will need to take into account three things; how much energy you will use, what you want to achieve with the blessing and lastly the relationship you have with the one you want to bless. A strong relationship between you and the person you want to bless is needed for the result you want to be effective, whether the relationship is a romantic one, a long-lasting friendship or blind faith and devotion to you doesn't matter as long as the bond itself is strong. What you want to achieve basically refers to how difficult and impossible is for the end result to happen, blessing someone with good luck is easier and than making the offspring of an old person as numerous as the stars. This connects to the last thing to take into account: your own power. The more difficult the end result is, the more energy you will need to spend for it to come true, this energy can be mana, ki, lifeforce, it doesn’t matter what the energy is as long as it comes from you. Curses work on almost the same principles as blessings, with the exception that curses work by completely severing the relationship with the person, most of the times being a one time use with the cursed target because of that. As with blessings the stronger the relationship the more powerful the curse will be, even more so if the intended effect has some malicious or negative effect on the target.",

      "description": "Forbidden Fruit [600CP] (Genesis) Humans are said to be created in God's likeness and are not equal to him, this is shown in how they lacked knowledge of good and evil, which was given to them in the form of a fruit by God. Now he’s no longer the only one capable of granting that sort of knowledge. You’re capable of placing concepts you can understand like love, evil, good or even death and place them in a fruit. When someone who doesn’t understand or have that concept consumes the food they will become able to understand that concept. Blessings, Curses, and Miracles [600CP] (Genesis) This is a world of promises, tests, trust, faith and the relationships between humans and beings much more powerful than them. Using the faith humans had in God and the trust he had for them, many circumstances that should not have happened were able to be realized thanks to the power of miracles. You have gained the ability to make miracles come true, either in the form of blessings or in the form of curses. For miracles to be able to take effect you will need to take into account three things; how much energy you will use, what you want to achieve with the blessing and lastly the relationship you have with the one you want to bless. A strong relationship between you and the person you want to bless is needed for the result you want to be effective, whether the relationship is a romantic one, a long-lasting friendship or blind faith and devotion to you doesn't matter as long as the bond itself is strong. What you want to achieve basically refers to how difficult and impossible is for the end result to happen, blessing someone with good luck is easier and than making the offspring of an old person as numerous as the stars. This connects to the last thing to take into account: your own power. The more difficult the end result is, the more energy you will need to spend for it to come true, this energy can be mana, ki, lifeforce, it doesn’t matter what the energy is as long as it comes from you. Curses work on almost the same principles as blessings, with the exception that curses work by completely severing the relationship with the person, most of the times being a one time use with the cursed target because of that. As with blessings the stronger the relationship the more powerful the curse will be, even more so if the intended effect has some malicious or negative effect on the target.",

This one is a power similar but superior, and you are probably a way better wielder for it than that sorry excuse of a superdevil. What this does is to negate the powers born from any item or artifact, including Sacred Gears, Holy Swords, and similar. Something that might seem like a small thing, but it’s far from useless when you see how many powerful beings are only so because of the items they have on them. Imagine the face of Odin when his spear proves itself worthless in the middle of a battle, or some Longinus user being stripped from his unearned power right before victory. While there are some limits to what you can negate, both in how long you can keep it up, or how many artifacts at the same time, it will be improved over time and use of the ability.

      "source": "Over the Garden Wall",
      "description": "I Can Smell Them [100CP] (Over the Garden Wall) You possess the ability to smell (the souls of) children. You could track them by scent like a bloodhound. And this gives you a touch of a sense for their psychological state, especially in regards to despair. You could tell how close a child was to despair, and notice changes with relative ease. You can smell other emotions in children, but the information will be more vague and general, though may improve with experience. This is still olfaction, and it is possible to confuse it with other scents, such as the black oil of the Eldelwood Trees, or even have it be overpowered by them. Wander Through the Darkness [200CP] (Over the Garden Wall) You seem to be able to control and manipulate darkness and shadows. It is easy to casually wrap yourself in darkness, so you can be perceived as nothing more than a shadowy figure cloaked in it, though when you do this your eyes have a tendency to glow or at least catch and reflect light like those of a dog or cat. With a little bit more effort you can deepen the darkness and shadows around you, making light seem to illuminate less and less. With time and practice you might even be able to animate shadows and make them move. Unfortunately bright enough light can end this all. The direct light of the sun will banish it all, and a sudden flash from a floodlight might as well, and even indirect sunlight - such as that filtered through the trees of a thick wood - will stop you from doing more than just cloaking yourself in darkness. Likewise magical light is hard to suppress and risks banishing your black shroud even around your body. Light for the Lost and Meek [400CP] (Over the Garden Wall) Your words are oddly charming to those who are in the grips of darker emotions. This doesn’t apply to anger, or even sharp terror and panic, but things like guilt, shame, dread, and despair; those emotions which lead to a feeling of listlessness, depression, and powerlessness. And the more deeply someone falls into them, the more your words seem to charm, persuade, and convince more and more. When someone is deep in personal darkness, and you present a light for them, even if they know you’re an evil creature who seeks only the destruction of others it will take a strong will’s conviction and resolve - or the fiery heat of overwhelming anger - to avoid listening to your words. Come Wayward Souls [600CP] (Over the Garden Wall) You possess the power to turn those who give in to despair, exhaustion, or even illness into Eldelwood Trees. This transformation isn’t instant, and it’s possible for them to be hacked free from the tree, but the more despair they feel the harder it is to break through this tree, meaning if they are lost in the depths of despair even the strongest will be unable to free themselves. But even those with boundless optimism could fall to this if they were weakened enough, the exhaustion of their body less effective to fuel the strength of the growing wood, but still capable of doing so. There is a range limit - they seem to need to be nearby to begin the process but it can be done without directly revealing yourself as well, and will continue on its own even if you leave unless you willingly stop it. This can even affect those beings who’d normally be able to resist curses if they are weak enough or claimed by sufficient Despair. Once fully transformed they will be trapped in mind, body, and soul. It might be possible to undo this curse somehow, but they should be quick, as the souls of those affected can be extracted fairly easily as black oil, and if the black oil is burned away or destroyed they will cease to be completely.",

      "description": "Insight [300CP] (Bloodborne) “You’ve seen things, heard things, learned things, fairly strange things at that. There’s something more going on here than a plague of beasts growing out of control. These experiences have given you insight into existence beyond most, allowing you sense that which others cannot. Dolls may appear to move, babies heard crying in the distance, and beings that some would call divine can be clearly seen clinging to the buildings all throughout Yharnam. Even beyond this world, in the ones that follow, your senses may now perceive that which mundane folk cannot. Beware, for even though awareness is a boon in preparing one’s self against the unknown, some truths may be too great for the human mind. Your learned nature does provide a boon in dulling your baser instincts, or in other words, your inner beast now has a tougher time influencing you.” Vileblood [600CP] (Bloodborne) “Years ago, Castle Cainhurst was visited by a scholar of Byrgenwerth, one who had smuggled something most forbidden into the hands of the nobles there. Blood that Byrgenwerth found beneath Yharnam, but not the kind the Healing Church held up on a pedestal, it was forbidden blood. Descending from these decadent lunatics, who have been nearly wiped out in retaliation for their grisly hunting of man, you have qualities reminiscent of the forbidden blood that flowed through their veins. Curious, most curious, at first glance it is simply decent for blood ministration. Continued research shows that it behaves as a stimulant however, rapidly recovering the stamina of yourself, and those it’s administered. The true nature of your blood is what it does to Great Ones, their kin, and other beings of an eldritch nature, causing them to take a keen interest in you. Most will be more receptive to your calls for aid, and protective of you. It is as if you inspire a kind of parental urge, most likely due to the fact that so many Great Ones lose their children. Beware, for certain beings of this persuasion cannot be influenced from their true nature, and their interest can be more threatening than desired. Great Ones are notably sympathetic, others not.” Bloodborne [400CP] (Bloodborne) “Before the healing church was founded, there was a man named Laurence. Laurence, a scholar of Byrgenwerth, had the same ambition of ascendance as his fellow scholars. The only difference was the desired path, one placing faith in the power of the old blood. Laurence never found the means to evolve by way of blood, never uncovering the hidden depths of the old blood’s miraculous qualities. In you, is a trait unseen in this world, one you alone will acquire if you so choose to pay appropriately; a trait that awakens latent potential in your blood. The effects of Bloodborne are variable and many depending on the kind of blood you possess. As a hunter however, no matter what other choices you made, you will find your innate abilities relating to Blood Bullets to be vastly improved. Instead of being limited to a hand full of bullets at a time, you could make four times as many. Instead of just bullets, you could make caltrops and knives that could handle combat. Instead of just the creation of objects, you can enhance weaponry, extending the edges of blades or faces of hammers. The Bloodborne trait also enhances your latent healing qualities somewhat, Good Hunter. It is nothing you would notice day to day, but you will recover lost blood far faster. The losses incurred from making blood bullets may be healed up in a matter of minutes with no external aid. If you have some other form of special quality in your blood, even something small, previously hidden or dormant facets of those qualities will come to the surface. It is because of that power, that Bloodborne acts as a ‘Booster.’ As a ‘Booster,’ Bloodborne will unlock new powers relating to any Tier 3 Talents you purchased. Those of ‘Vileblood’ may gain near magical qualities relating to their forbidden blood, while those with ‘Beast’s Strength’ could gain more wretched traits. For full details, see the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom.” Bloodborne + Vileblood: “You've been gifted with two very strange abilities. The first allows you to make functional clones of yourself out of blood, though the amount of blood this costs means you should only be able to make one or two at a time. These can use any of your blood related abilities, but are much less sturdy compared to yourself. The other allows you to summon giant spears of your blood via self-inflicted damage, causing them to shoot up from the ground somewhere nearby at the location of your choosing as a means of attack. The more visceral the damage you inflict on yourself the bigger, faster, and stronger the spear summoned will be. Gutting yourself would produce a stronger spear compared to slicing your wrist, as an example. Spears recede into the ground and dissipate after a few seconds after doing their job.”",

      "description": "Inhuman Decadence [200CP] (OFF) This is a grotesque attack of nonphysical nature, dealing only middling immediate damage upon an opponent, but sickening them and dealing continual internal damage using a potent Poison effect. This attack does not have the immediate effect of [Home Run], but allows you to get a single hit in and use defensive tactics to stall for time. As is typical, this attack grows more powerful, but at the cost of greater usage of your Competence Pool; however, the Poison aspect grows at a greater rate than the immediate physical damage. Immediate Sclerosis [200CP] (OFF) An attack of middling immediate damage, but which inflicts the devastating status effect Palsy, causing the target to become paralyzed and unable to attack you. This leaves your opponent vulnerable to further, riskier attacks, without having to worry about being defensive. You get the deal at this point; it gets stronger with use, but uses more energy as a result. However, be aware that some enemies kick the effects of Palsy quicker than others; there’s no need to be careless. Dramatic Crescendo [400CP] (OFF) This is a potent attack that drains from the Competence Pool of an opponent, weakening them and potentially rendering them unable to use their most powerful abilities. Doing this drains from your own energy as well, but you only need to expend about a tenth as much energy as is removed from the possession of your opponent; as this ability grows stronger, the maximum amount of energy that can be destroyed increases, completely draining weaker enemies and forcing them to go into melee. Outside of this Jump, this ability adapts to other forms of esoteric energy, such as magic. Immortal Anderssen [600CP] (OFF) Not a full Competence on its own, this ability grants the user the power to extend any single-target attack into a multiple target attack spanning a maximum of four targets. The energy cost of this increases exponentially with both the number of targets and the power of the attack, meaning that attempting to use the most powerful abilities is impossible due to the costs outstripping your capacity. This ability is best used to extend any esoteric effect to multiple targets, such as Curses or Status Effects that can otherwise not be used in this fashion. (Editor’s Note: Will require the Competence Pool Freebie Perk to use any of these moves with the probable exception of Immortal Anderssen.)",

It is completely devoid of people however there may be the strange stick dolls and hostile demons lurking in this realm. You’re Mine Priest [200CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity) Demons primarily enter the world through possession of a host, but most are able to be repealed through will or exorcism. You are however an unusually powerful demon and can dominate other's spirits, mind, and bodies significantly faster and easier. Additionally you know demonic rites that allow for easier possession of a strong willed host. God is Not Here [400CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity) The faith of mortal man is but ash and eggshells beneath your feet. You are unaffected by mortal holy magics and you are able to deconsecrate areas with your mere presence. Finally you have a significant resistance to divine magic. Antichrist [800CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity) Perhaps you are not the Antichrist themself but you would make a nearly indistinguishable second. Every demonic ability, form, or power you possess is doubled in power. Almost no mortal can resist your corrupting influence, quickly turning even the most strong willed servant of god into mindless servants from your prolonged corruption. Unfortunately this further increases the difficulty of entering into the physical world and you will require a perfect host, which may take decades to find should you lose your current one, which would require another Profane Sabbath to even attempt the possession of a new host. which will most definitely come to the attention of the vatican. (Editor’s Note: These are the demonic abilities of the Demon Perkline from the Faith The Unholy Trinity Jump.)",

      "description": "Powerful summoners are said to thin the barrier between worlds, allowing phenomena to leak through from one reality to another, others claim to act as a stabilizing force for reality as a whole. You are both. Within the range you can summon, you have the capacity to reinforce or thin the barriers between realities. Thickening the barrier acts to isolate from other realities, blocking summoning attempts while making reality more stable and harder to influence around you. Thinning the barrier, however, makes it easier to summon, such that some summons may be able to cross the barrier uncalled, and can allow for phenomena and physical laws from one reality to leak over into the current one. Given extensive practice, you could do both at once and be selective in how this is applied. This can be especially helpful in the summoning of extremely powerful creatures, ones that are too metaphysically heavy for reality to normally allow to exist, causing dangerous feedback that can break localized reality or harm the summons in a way that can be permanent. With this, you could summon an elder god in its true incarnation and not immediately have reality buckle and rip apart at the seams. This can also be used to permanently kill creatures that would otherwise just return to their home plane on death, in fact, allowing you to kill any creature in a permanent manner despite their efforts to circumvent their own death as you destroy their very essence and soul.

      "description": "No Good, it’s Impossible [600CP] (Yume Nikki) Rather than relying on violence, when you’re face to face with an enemy, you can simply teleport them away to the nearest inescapable location in your surroundings. “Inescapable” meaning it has no physical exits. Those trapped can still find other ways to get out, and this location isn’t any more durable. If no such enclosure exists, it will simply appear in a random location nearby. On the Air, in the Air [400CP] (Yume Nikki) You have the ability to isolate people physically in a nearby location. Doing this causes an acidic effect to slowly melt away all physical points of entry to the surroundings, like bridges and stairs. The more connections there are, the slower this is. This Way Mr.Demon [600CP] (Yume Nikki) You have the ability to set up traps in locations that, when triggered, pull the one that triggered it into another location. This can warp space to a very limited extent, such as shrinking them to enter a tiny location, or taking them far away in a short period of time. Traps take a great deal of time to set up, and require you to have been to both locations. You also need to set trigger conditions. Any changes made to the target of the trap are undone once they leave.",

      "description": "Absorb [100CP] (World of Horror) With the power of your own will, you may steal the lifeforce of your enemies or even just random passerby to heal your body and repair your wounds. It is an immediate exchange that cannot be visually seen except by seeing your wounds heal or by being able to see spirits. Cauterize [100CP] (World of Horror) With a touch, you can quickly seal a wound to stop any bleeding and accelerate the healing process. The effect is immediate and while it will probably leave a rather garish scar it may save your life. You can only use this ability once per week. Costs no sanity to use. Void [100CP] (World of Horror) At will, you can open a portal to another totally random dimension. You are guaranteed to not be put somewhere where you would immediately die, but these realms may be as dangerous as the situation you were trying to escape. You may remain in this realm one day before being forcibly returned back to your own. These realms often have the remnants of ancient civilizations worth a look. Some possess powerful magical artifacts and knowledge… Thread of Fate [100CP] (World of Horror) Massively taxing on the mind but equally potent, this spell grants you the ability to cut the threads weaving one human foe to this existence. Projecting your mind to the cosmos beyond and severing this thread causes the enemy to instantly drop permanently comatose to the ground...not quite dead, but no longer really alive either. Certainly no longer a threat in any case. Usable once a week. Skin Removal [100CP] (World of Horror) Starting with the face, upon casting this spell the skin of your foe will begin to peel and fall off in disgusting chunks, causing extraordinary bleeding should it be something that does so. Most human enemies will panic when they realize what is happening, although more otherworldly foes may not be so easily deterred. Third Eye [100CP] (World of Horror) An ability that directly benefits the capabilities of your mind, casting this spell will immediately make your mind somewhat sharper and faster albeit temporarily. Your special and situational awareness increases as well, making you more capable overall. Ashen Contract [100CP] (World of Horror) You dangerously cut a deal with the image of an Old God in your mind, making the entity that threatens your world come faster in exchange for snuffing out the existence of one enemy of your choice. This can include human or eldritch enemies, for nothing is safe from their grasp. Can be used once per month. Shadow Shroud [100CP] (World of Horror) Your mind fragments briefly and spreads its presence over a more general area, throwing off any eldritch entities that may be hunting you and allowing you to remain relatively undetected. Even human enemies seem slightly baffled, their assumptions of your location usually being incorrect. Enthrallment [100CP] (World of Horror) Upon casting you may immediately compel one human within physical reach to follow your every command as well as be compelled to help you to the best of their ability permanently. This requires only an initial charge of your sanity with no upkeep, meaning you now possess an entirely loyal minion. Seal of Savvesh [100CP] (World of Horror) Placing an invisible seal on your body and sealing some of your own sanity inside of it boosts the physical capabilities of your body slightly. This is primarily in regards to the strength of your muscles, and can be a visible change or not. There are no upper limits to how much you may use this spell barring having the sanity to cast it. Seal of Bram’el [100CP] (World of Horror) Similar in application to the previous Seal, the Seal of Bram’el instead boosts the abilities of your mind permanently in exchange for sealing away some of your sanity. There are no upper limits to how many times this can be casted so long as you are careful about spending every bit of reason you have. Expel Evil [100CP] (World of Horror) Frequently used by organizations of the past hoping to combat the inevitable coming of the Old Gods, maidens were occasionally forced to painfully “vomit” away their corruption so that their coming to this world could be stalled. You are now capable of recreating this grisly feat, hurting your own body somewhat to mislead the entity just enough to buy some precious time. Costly on the body, not the mind. Regeneration [100CP] (World of Horror) A direct transfer from the mind to the body, this spell allows you to spend some of your mental wellbeing to heal some of your wounds without the need for any kind of rest or medical assistance. A very handy ability if you don’t have the funds or time to seek out more traditional assistance. Flesh Regrowth [100CP] (World of Horror) A sort of transference of flesh, you will be able to seal wounds on a whim at no cost to your mind, but at another cost - your body. You may seal wounds and even regrow lost body parts at a cost of your overall body. Growing back every limb on your body would leave you frail and sickly for years, but growing back a finger would leave you a little weaker for a couple of weeks. Multiply Wound [100CP] (World of Horror) Ancient humans created the concept of an eye for an eye, and apparently some eldritch entity of old had to be amused by it enough for this spell to come into existence. Taking the old law and turning into a more immediately applied matter, you can willingly worsen your physical wounds in order to transfer them 1:1 onto your enemy’s body, their flesh suddenly tearing in horrible wet sounds that makes them feel every little bit of pain that you do. Grow Teeth [100CP] (World of Horror) A painful ability that nonetheless may have its uses, you may upon casting grow a secondary set of extremely sharp teeth that are suitable for tearing the flesh off of your intended victim. Causes injuries in your mouth after the teeth finally disappear. Mind Drain [100CP] (World of Horror) Your head may be pounding, but with the help of your victim you’ll finally have some peace of mind. You can spend a bit of your lifeforce to drain the sanity from your enemy to supplement yours, keeping you from finally plunging off the deep end or simply giving you more resources to cast your magic. Invisibility [100CP] (World of Horror) Hidden from mortal and monsters alike, you can hide away your physical vessel which will allow you to more easily stay hidden and avoid violent encounters entirely or escape from them easily. A very useful ability to go about your investigations unimpeded. The effect fades after a day of continuous use. Midasu Touch [100CP] (World of Horror) At will you may make small bits of gold seemingly grow from your hand! These can be easily sold for a nice chunk of change, but they must be painfully extracted from your hand and leave wounds from where they protruded which you will need to tend to. Costs no sanity to cast. Ithotu Flame [100CP] (World of Horror) Perhaps the most direct combat spell at your disposal, a small cost of your lifeforce and sanity will cause your enemy to combust into horrible eldritch flames which will cause horrific burns in a matter of seconds before going out, leaving burnt flesh and intense agony in its wake. Memory Extract [100CP] (World of Horror) Some memories are simply too traumatic to move past. The only way left to recover is simply to remove the memory forever. You may cast this spell to willingly purge some of the worst memories of your eldritch encounters in order to recover some of your sanity, but some of those memories might be useful in your battle. K’npha Ritual [100CP] (World of Horror) Human sacrifice is considered by the mad to be an easy path to great power, but do they sacrifice because they are mad or because the slippery slope of power made them so? Regardless, the practice has its uses, as this ritual will show you. Once per week, you may sacrifice a bound human in a grisly manner to boost a random trait of yours. Whether you become slightly stronger, smarter or faster is not up to you but with enough sacrifices it will not matter much, will it? (Editor’s Note: The spell Void can, if you choose, teleport the user to any dimension within any of the jumps/worlds in the indexes. If you wish for more variety.)",

      "description": "Devourer [600CP] (Little Nightmares) You developed the same ability used by our dear hungry little girl. Maybe you’re another candidate to become the vessel of an Entity or maybe you inherited this power from someone. You’re capable of stealing the abilities of those that you devour their flesh, turning their abilities yours. While you don’t necessarily need to devour at least half a limb worth of flesh to maybe be able to steal the victim’s abilities, but, by killing them, you’ll be granted to acquire their abilities. If you prefer to keep them alive and still manage to steal some of their abilities, they’ll lose access to these specific abilities, but not their raw power. While you can choose which you want to steal, you won’t be able to steal all of their abilities, just their main ones. This perk is limited to superhuman abilities, being unable to steal skills, talent, knowledge, memories, genetic information and/or specific traits. Control the Signal [600CP] (Little Nightmares) The transmission is the cause of all the chaos that infected and corrupted the Pale City and its inhabitants. And you, like Mono, seem to have a very special connection with it. You’re able to control machines at will, like televisions and computers, up to a few meters of distance from you. For now, you’re able to just turn them on and off, as this power starts weak, but, with training and experience, you’ll become stronger. It’s harder to control advanced and/or sentient technology, due to them being able to resist your control, but it isn’t an impossible feat. As a simple sign of the true power within you, you’re capable of opening portals through using two machines with some kind of screen (like televisions for example), turning into a gateway. The two machines must be within the range of your control and the portals will remain active up to a few minutes before breaking. Lady in the Shadows [600CP] (Little Nightmares) Like the Lady, you somehow managed to attract the attention of a very powerful being existing among the shadows, an Entity. Even if you aren’t the vessel/host of them, they offered you their special powers and your Benefactor, usually Jump-Chan, turned them fiat-backed, especially to you. You can manipulate shadows and darkness itself, letting you use it to camouflage yourself in the darkness, to attack your enemies and even vanish in a cloud of smoke-like shadow that can be used as a way of mid-range teletransportation. You acquire the power of telekinesis, being able to control matter, up to something or someone with the size of an adult human in this world, with your own mind. This ability can also be used on yourself, letting you hover or even fly at will. but overuse of this power may tire you. Lastly, you become able to use your power to rearrange the anatomy of humans and other defenseless targets to turn them into nome-like creatures. In this form, they’ll be greatly weakened, but they’ll retain their minds and it’s possible for a powerful mage to heal them. The Broadcaster [600CP] (Little Nightmares) You learned a special technique from the Transmission’s Entity: how to use your own power to create a signal that works very similar to the Transmission, capable of slaving the minds of the weak-willed people and even some irrational beings. Initially, you’re able to spread this signal with enough range to affect an entire small house, but this can be enhanced through training and experience and by using equipment with your power to send the signal, like a transmission tower to greatly increase its range. Due to your influence being dispersed into the signal, those with strong wills are mostly unaffected by it. The more powerful you become, the stronger the signal becomes, increasing its range and becoming more powerful, but, the more the signal spreads, the weaker it becomes. Once someone is under your control, they’ll become loyal to you and it’s extremely hard to make them recover their free will, as long as you don’t want it to happen. (Editor’s Note: All four perks possess Capstone Booster effects (that can be found in the Little Nightmares jump) from purchasing the Chosen Vessel perk.)",

      "description": "Covered in Ash [500CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) All Grimm dissolve into black smoke upon death, making it more than a little difficult to dissect or collect trophies from, but there are also those like the Geist that leave a trail of smoke wherever they go. You can now coat yourself in a thin layer of this black smoke, both to slightly hide the specifics of your body as well as giving you a more frightening appearance, like something straight from a nightmare. Tainted Light [500CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) People see the light as their ally, a symbol of all that is good and pure. It is only natural, then, that the Creatures of Grimm would pervert this aspect of the natural world as well. You may now glow with light, emanating from either an appendage or through new markings found all across your body. The light you emit will be equal to that of a torch, and is useful for luring unsuspecting prey right to your maw. Empathetic Monster [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Humanity is not limited to just negative emotions, also possessing love, hope, contentment, and so on. You are no longer limited to only perceiving the darkness within them, but also their light, capable of sensing their positive emotions with just as much accuracy as you can sense the negative. Love and hate are closely intertwined, the only true antithesis of emotion being apathy. Elemental Breath [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Ever since man learned to harness the elemental powers of Dust, it has been an integral part of their arsenal when it comes to combating the Grimm, yet they are not the only ones who can control the elements. From your maw, you can let loose an elemental attack of your choice, from fire to lightning to water. Each one has their own uses, with ice breath being able to freeze opponents solid. You can take this option multiple times. Sonic Screech [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) The sound of the Creatures of Grimm alone is enough to send the common person running away in terror, their dark chorus inspiring fear ingrained into them since before recorded history. To have weaponized it, releasing sonic blasts that can shatter glass as easily as it can push back the more durable of your foes, is a terrible thing to think about. Mysterious Monster [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Scientists have long been driven mad or despairful at how they only are faced with more and more questions the more they discover about the Grimm. In a similar vein anyone that hopes to study you will find their efforts be for naught. All undesired attempts to study and understand you or your abilities will find no progress beyond the basics. Only with your permission could anyone glean the truth about how your powers work. Leech [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Is this natural, to feel so hollow and empty inside? Is that why the creatures of darkness prey on those who carry light within them, in an effort to fill that which cannot be satiated? Regardless of the philosophical quandary, you possess a truly dreadful ability, one that is sure to keep others awake at night. Simply by being around you, you can slowly drain away a target’s willpower and emotions, using them to heal yourself from whatever wounds you may have. This process is greatly sped up should you be able to actually touch them, leaving them as empty, still husks compared to the bright and lively people they were once before. Possession [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Who said a Grimm only has to rely on what they themselves have been gifted with? It is a preposterous notion, especially since a Grimm like you could turn the very world against your enemies. You share a similar ability to that of the Geist, being able to take control of inanimate objects like rocks or trees and using them like extensions of your body. With time, power, and practice, you may even learn to possess individuals, so long as you can overpower them in both will and strength. Conversion [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) There is nothing more antithetical to modern sensibilities than people willing to look to the Grimm as allies, and yet there are a few twisted minds who have done just that and so much more. Whether they are willing or not, you may coat others in the black tar inherent to all Grimm, transforming them fully or just giving them the abilities of one, should you want them to retain their minds. They may start off as powerful as a typical newly spawned, but time and experience will change that. At the very least, you can mark them as people the Grimm should ignore or assist. Darkness [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) For as much light as there is within humans and faunus, so too is there much darkness hiding within their hearts. It is that darkness which draws the Grimm towards them, and it is what will give you power. By drawing upon ambient negative emotions and similarly dark energies, you can use these to fuel your growth in power, rising above what you once were. This can either be a temporary boost which offers more power, or a smaller but permanent boost. Light [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) An impossibility, one that goes against everything that the inhabitants of this world knows. Within you is not the typical dark void inherent to all Grimm, but instead the light of a soul, manifest as Aura! Though it may only be on par with that of a Huntsman Academy initiate, you can access the strength and protection of Aura to help assist you in any number of ways, and can even awaken a Semblance in time. For a soulless creature to possess the power of a soul, and if they were capable of spreading it to the other creatures of darkness...",

      "description": "Covered in Ash [500CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) All Grimm dissolve into black smoke upon death, making it more than a little difficult to dissect or collect trophies from, but there are also those like the Geist that leave a trail of smoke wherever they go. You can now coat yourself in a thin layer of this black smoke, both to slightly hide the specifics of your body as well as giving you a more frightening appearance, like something straight from a nightmare. Tainted Light [500CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) People see the light as their ally, a symbol of all that is good and pure. It is only natural, then, that the Creatures of Grimm would pervert this aspect of the natural world as well. You may now glow with light, emanating from either an appendage or through new markings found all across your body. The light you emit will be equal to that of a torch, and is useful for luring unsuspecting prey right to your maw. Empathetic Monster [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Humanity is not limited to just negative emotions, also possessing love, hope, contentment, and so on. You are no longer limited to only perceiving the darkness within them, but also their light, capable of sensing their positive emotions with just as much accuracy as you can sense the negative. Love and hate are closely intertwined, the only true antithesis of emotion being apathy. Elemental Breath [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Ever since man learned to harness the elemental powers of Dust, it has been an integral part of their arsenal when it comes to combating the Grimm, yet they are not the only ones who can control the elements. From your maw, you can let loose an elemental attack of your choice, from fire to lightning to water. Each one has their own uses, with ice breath being able to freeze opponents solid. You can take this option multiple times. Sonic Screech [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) The sound of the Creatures of Grimm alone is enough to send the common person running away in terror, their dark chorus inspiring fear ingrained into them since before recorded history. To have weaponized it, releasing sonic blasts that can shatter glass as easily as it can push back the more durable of your foes, is a terrible thing to think about. Mysterious Monster [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Scientists have long been driven mad or despairful at how they only are faced with more and more questions the more they discover about the Grimm. In a similar vein anyone that hopes to study you will find their efforts be for naught. All undesired attempts to study and understand you or your abilities will find no progress beyond the basics. Only with your permission could anyone glean the truth about how your powers work. Leech [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Is this natural, to feel so hollow and empty inside? Is that why the creatures of darkness prey on those who carry light within them, in an effort to fill that which cannot be satiated? Regardless of the philosophical quandary, you possess a truly dreadful ability, one that is sure to keep others awake at night. Simply by being around you, you can slowly drain away a target’s willpower and emotions, using them to heal yourself from whatever wounds you may have. This process is greatly sped up should you be able to actually touch them, leaving them as empty, still husks compared to the bright and lively people they were once before. Possession [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Who said a Grimm only has to rely on what they themselves have been gifted with? It is a preposterous notion, especially since a Grimm like you could turn the very world against your enemies. You share a similar ability to that of the Geist, being able to take control of inanimate objects like rocks or trees and using them like extensions of your body. With time, power, and practice, you may even learn to possess individuals, so long as you can overpower them in both will and strength. Conversion [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) There is nothing more antithetical to modern sensibilities than people willing to look to the Grimm as allies, and yet there are a few twisted minds who have done just that and so much more. Whether they are willing or not, you may coat others in the black tar inherent to all Grimm, transforming them fully or just giving them the abilities of one, should you want them to retain their minds. They may start off as powerful as a typical newly spawned, but time and experience will change that. At the very least, you can mark them as people the Grimm should ignore or assist. Darkness [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) For as much light as there is within humans and faunus, so too is there much darkness hiding within their hearts. It is that darkness which draws the Grimm towards them, and it is what will give you power. By drawing upon ambient negative emotions and similarly dark energies, you can use these to fuel your growth in power, rising above what you once were. This can either be a temporary boost which offers more power, or a smaller but permanent boost. Light [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) An impossibility, one that goes against everything that the inhabitants of this world knows. Within you is not the typical dark void inherent to all Grimm, but instead the light of a soul, manifest as Aura! Though it may only be on par with that of a Huntsman Academy initiate, you can access the strength and protection of Aura to help assist you in any number of ways, and can even awaken a Semblance in time. For a soulless creature to possess the power of a soul, and if they were capable of spreading it to the other creatures of darkness...",

Whatever it is, it creates an unusually strong fear response in any opponents you may have. While you may not really be that strong or durable, you will find that those you face will largely try to flee or cower in abject terror rather than fight back. Only the very bravest and those without the fear response found in humans will be able to combat you directly. Capstone Boosted: Are you forgiven for your actions? It seems that something is shielding you from the backlash of your bloody crusades. You do not seem to face any repercussions for killing others in terms of automated responses, dead-mans switches or any sort of spiritual backlash. Legal consequences and the direct actions of others are not affected, as you may still go to prison or be attacked for killing someone if any dare face you, but the indirect and less obvious consequences don’t seem to occur. (Editor’s Note: The Capstone Booster requires the possession of The Walrider perk.)",

      "description": "“Let me share with you the terrible wonders I have come to know...” An arcane ritual; a pact with something from beyond time and space. Having struck a bargain with some fickle entity of the abyss, you now have the ability to direct it in battle; summoning tendrils- an insignificant portion of the beast’s true form- from hellish portals to batter your enemies into submission, pull them from their ranks, and flatten them with the eldritch force imbued in each grasping limb. Or, if this servitude is unagreeable then you can set yourself as a master of the living dead instead. Although your necromantic powers will have yet to grow to maturity you can still cause the dead to burst forth from the ground to grasp the ankles of your enemies, pulling them out of line or simply tearing them limb from limb… with enough time to “negotiate” or further your studies, you may conjure even greater things to do your bidding- or even make them fight alongside you autonomously, rather than merely following your commandments. Lastly, you may commune with this being- or the spirits of the dead- to petition them in warding your camp, strengthening an ally, or even bringing one back from death’s door... at increasing cost to both the light of your campfire and the sanity of yourself and your fellows, as a price for their meddling in mortal affairs. So long as they don’t differ from these principals, you may choose something aside from the eldritch or the undead to command, as well- perhaps plant-life that grows and wilts with unnatural speed, or swarms of rats to gnaw your foes to death?",

And you get a power boost for it though small, about 0.1% for every deal made. But in turn, as long as you have the raw power, skill, tech, or whatever else needed to fulfill a wish, even if it would normally take years, you can do it instantly and with no prep, if it’s for a Deal, though you’d have to have enough time left in Jump to do it. After Spark though, it’s “As long as you could eventually do it with the power and skills you currently have”. And these deals do not lower your power in any way. If you can make/reproduce something within the time you can create it instantly for the purpose of the deal and it doesn’t drain or take it from you in any way, such as money or a potion. The deal is not fiat-backed or forced on either side, Demons and those in deals with them constantly try to one-up each other. This gives you some freedom though, such as if someone was, to say, ask to be rich, you could maybe change their name to Richard, or turn them into yogurt or something. Look, my point is that you can twist that wish into something fucked up and not at all what that person wanted if you really wanted to. Maybe for kicks, maybe it’s funny, maybe you hate that particular person, whatever reason you have to fuck up their wish, you can fuck it up so long as it was technically what they wanted. Oh yeah, and the person who wants the Deal actually has to want it.

Your intellect is such that your involvement in someone's affairs can easily prove to be life changing for them if you put some effort in, and your planning capabilities are so good that if a plan fails or something goes wrong, it's probably because you wanted it to, rather than an event or person actually stopping you. Unlike a certain other man on this level, this intellect will not make you detached from humanity. Additionally, this perk acts as a capstone booster, as seen further below. Manipulator [600CP] (Monster) Your understanding of the human mind jumps right over the line of normalcy and into the eerie. Just looking into someone's past or interacting with them for a couple minutes or so gives you a near complete understanding of their psyche, what drives them, and how you can manipulate them. Your charisma also skyrockets, enough to easily make use of what you now know. For example, you could easily convince addicts to go sober, cure someone’s depression, become a trusted confidant to powerful people, or if you're less moral, convince people to kill others or themselves for you, if they’re mentally vulnerable enough. [Perfection Boosted] A True Monster: Your understanding of the human psyche is now in the realm of the superhuman. By simply talking to people in certain ways, you can gradually cure otherwise incurable mental disorders, such as dementia, schizophrenia, sociopathy, etc. Additionally, your manipulative abilities are now so advanced you could probably get an entire town to kill each other if you really wanted to.",

You have similar command over events you involve yourself in. Actions you take leave a lingering impression on people so your threat is felt to those who would oppose you even if your actual appearances and encounters with them are few. And if your acts are impactful enough, the legacy you leave could linger on down through the ages and survive in legends and myths. Arranged Confrontation [100CP] (The Ocarina of Time) At some point Ganon decided he was going to fight The Hero and settle things once and for all mano-a-mano and set the stage for that confrontation. You might not be as boneheaded about destroying your enemies but you have all the chops to set up your encounters to be suitably epic and act the part for it. Perfect place, dramatic lighting, ominous weather, some intimidating flair to your speech and grand sweeping gestures...even if you have to create a few of these things yourself, you can still time it so it comes together to strike fear into even those who have seen it all before. Your gravitas just holds attention that way such that they won’t interrupt. Be rather rude after all that work. Swear False Fealty [200CP] (The Ocarina of Time) Ganon's victories were in half, luck, and the other half, good con artist skills. His whole plan would've fallen apart if Zelda just brought Link to her father to tell him how the Great Deku Tree died, or if the Gorons and Zora sent envoys about his actions in their territories, or perhaps if the king had contacted them himself. But in the face of Dragmire's pretty lies it didn't seem to occur to anyone to talk to each other until it was far too late. Likewise, you have skill at con-artistry to fool kings into believing you're sincerely swearing loyalty to them and while you're pulling the wool over their eyes, communications that could unveil your deceitfulness just don’t reach their ears until it's too late for them to stop you. This works against any factions in future jumps or specific people you attempt to fool. Sealed Sworn Oath [600CP] (The Ocarina of Time) Before he was destroyed for good, Demise made an oath to curse the lines of those who had defeated him so that an incarnation of his wickedness would never be far behind whenever the Princess or Hero were reborn. Centuries to millennia after that time, Ganondorf made a similar oath as he was sealed away. He promised to break free and destroy Link and Zelda and the Sages, and centuries later he actually did. If you swear an oath, you can brand it with a similar weight that becomes a curse upon your enemies. And it will come true. Like a Death Curse and Generational Curse combined, you can declare the future ruin of your enemies or even the prosperity of your people and make it stick so that the events of the future are altered until it comes to pass, but it must be possible too. You cannot just declare your people will become the greatest wizards if there is no magic to be found in the world, unless you use a loose definition of wizard. You can also only make such declarations and oaths when you are either close to death or are defeated, but you will be given time to make your oath even if you never see it fulfilled.",

His whole plan would've fallen apart if Zelda just brought Link to her father to tell him how the Great Deku Tree died, or if the Gorons and Zora sent envoys about his actions in their territories, or perhaps if the king had contacted them himself. But in the face of Dragmire's pretty lies it didn't seem to occur to anyone to talk to each other until it was far too late. Likewise, you have skill at con-artistry to fool kings into believing you're sincerely swearing loyalty to them and while you're pulling the wool over their eyes, communications that could unveil your deceitfulness just don’t reach their ears until it's too late for them to stop you. This works against any factions in future jumps or specific people you attempt to fool. Sealed Sworn Oath [600CP] (The Ocarina of Time) Before he was destroyed for good, Demise made an oath to curse the lines of those who had defeated him so that an incarnation of his wickedness would never be far behind whenever the Princess or Hero were reborn. Centuries to millennia after that time, Ganondorf made a similar oath as he was sealed away. He promised to break free and destroy Link and Zelda and the Sages, and centuries later he actually did. If you swear an oath, you can brand it with a similar weight that becomes a curse upon your enemies. And it will come true. Like a Death Curse and Generational Curse combined, you can declare the future ruin of your enemies or even the prosperity of your people and make it stick so that the events of the future are altered until it comes to pass, but it must be possible too. You cannot just declare your people will become the greatest wizards if there is no magic to be found in the world, unless you use a loose definition of wizard. You can also only make such declarations and oaths when you are either close to death or are defeated, but you will be given time to make your oath even if you never see it fulfilled.",

      "description": "Sales & Marketing [100CP] (SCP Foundation) Of course you have 10 years’ experience in emerging market trends. You can sell anything, especially yourself. You’ve got great people skills a keen sense for presentation. You can appraise values of things not just by a sense of market prices, but by evaluating the key features that make it appeal to specific customers. You know how to promote something to give it the highest perceived value. You know how to pick your customers to find those that find the greatest appeal in your products. Yes, this discerning eye works on your customer’s too, helping you figure out their values to compare them with your stock and how it could advance their lives. You know how to read a customer, avoiding terms that might create discomfort like “slaves” when you could just say “staff included with purchase”. You easily feel out how to cater to special interests too, creating an atmosphere where the most deplorable customers can feel comfortable asking for what they’re really seeking. Middleman [200CP] (SCP Foundation) Supplying demands. Your customers will be as sophisticated and educated as they are depraved. You’ll need to have a solution to every request that might come from such a demanding clientele. A distribution service is nothing without something to distribute. If it exists, you can find any good or service. If it doesn’t exist, you can find someone with the capacity to make it exist. As long as you have the ability to invest, you can find a trail to follow. People respond well to money, and for you adding these cash incentives to cooperate with your search is unnaturally effective. Wealth goes a lot further than it logically should. A refund plus store credit a customer receives after suffered horribly from malfunctioning products might be enough to satisfy most of them. But cash is at it’s most powerful for you when it comes to finding and securing supplies. Tracking down a source of raw material, refined goods, specialty services, or even anomalous artisans. Some people believe they can’t be bought. For those majority of those people, you’ll now find all it takes is adding a couple more zeroes to the price. UnLtd. [400CP] (SCP Foundation) Quality over Quantity. Some tend to treat Marshall, Carter, and Dark as this sort of massive faceless corporation. But in actuality the workforce is implausibly small. They’re running a worldwide cabal that controls the world’s wealthy with less than a hundred people. They’re anomalously streamlined - and you can be too. It’s as if you ascended as the very embodiment of your company, able to individually perform as many tasks as an entire rival corporation. Limited employees is no obstacle to your operations, in fact it helps things run smoother. Fewer moving parts makes it vastly easier to run your worldwide business operations as you gain the time to micromanage every part of your business. A chef could personally cook in every franchised location, a lawyer could handle every case for an international firm with thousands of clients. There’s no risk of burnout or overworking when you’re doing a job you enjoy. Whenever you handle a job personally the chance of any operational risk drops to near-impossible. Every tool and resource your business has will always be at your disposal. Anomonopoly [600CP] (SCP Foundation) A finger in every pie. When you deal in magic and miracles the buyers seem willing to pay any price. Like MC&D, you can maintain near-total control of the magic market. You can charge exorbitant markups and never run out of potential buyers. There’s nothing supernatural about this kind of capitalism though. Street anartists will continue their craft, and the cults and churches will keep their magic, but you get a special relationship with any organizations looking to sell. You’ll become everyone’s first choice for business partner as long as you can afford their wares. Anyone who knows about you and wants to distribution anomalies comes to you first. Play your cards right and you’ll be swimming in cash and almost any impossible anomalous tool you could ask for. The biggest problem you might face is too many interested parties.",

You find it far easier to obtain followers and aids, and those who pledge their loyalty to you and your movement will remain loyal. A New Testament [400CP] (Outlast) You are skilled at creating religions and cults, with teachings and mythology created entirely by you or by incorporating features of those present within the setting. In such groups, you can create rules and practices you want and back them up with religious or spiritual reasoning, and can encourage your followers to participate in various activities as well as avoid actions that your movement practices against. You do not necessarily have to follow such rules yourself and can easily manipulate such organisations so that your own actions are not called into question. You could ban the use of something but use it yourself as a ‘study aid’. Higher Calling [600CP] (Outlast) Perhaps you actually want to worship something rather than pretend to do so. You are now able to direct yours and those of your allies towards beings that could be considered deities, even if they are not. This allows you to avoid their wrath and occasionally be rewarded for your reverence, so long as you are not working against them. Capstone Boosted: Perhaps those to who you proclaim your faith sense that there is more to you? You receive further blessings and protection from entities you worship and can even be given some of their power so long as you follow their teachings and instructions.

Not only does this let you mentally pick apart a social scenario, but it works just as well in combat - you can read your opponent’s movements and quickly gauge their fighting style in seconds, knowing them even better than they know themselves. That said, this isn’t as good as actual mind-reading - you can still be caught off-guard or blindsided by something you didn’t expect, and well-hidden details about the individual won’t come to light by staring at them all day.

      "description": "No Nonsense Nemesis [100CP] (DC Fourth World) There is no mirth or joy in the dread planet Apokolips, and you carry that particular lesson with you wherever you go. In your presence, all light-heartedness dies...the comedy relief finds their jokes dying in their throat, encouraging speeches from heroes tend to be tinged with an uphill struggle to maintain morale, and you are taken absolutely seriously regardless of what you happen to be doing or how you appear to others. No light will be found where you walk. This can be toggled on and off. Twisting the Knife [100CP] (DC Fourth World) It’s not enough to simply defeat your enemies. No, it is far more satisfying to absolutely crush them and any hopes they had, and see them wail in despair as they lament ever being born into a world you exist in. You know just how to hurt someone on a personal level, whether with biting insults towards their biggest weaknesses or regrets or utterly placing them in physical agony with your abilities, possibly shattering their will to live if your will overcomes theirs. This does little in any practical sense besides giving them a reason to hate or fear you...but it’s oh-so-satisfying to perform on those who dare defy you. Or just those who irritate you. This is Great Darkseid? [200CP] (DC Fourth World) How like the humans of Earth and even so-called ‘heroes’ across the galaxy to underestimate the biggest threat of them all. Even if you carry a reputation fit for the embodiment of evil, few initially suspect your dealings or consider you an active threat...a distant one, surely, on a far away planet. Your schemes have a better chance of going unnoticed, your violent squashing of your enemies seen as one-time affairs. And when indisputable evidence of your dealings become apparent and your enemies finally unite to defeat you? Something as juvenile as one of your weaker avatars being defeated is often enough to satisfy them. Only someone who absolutely hates you to your core will likely resume the hunt afterwards. What was it they said about good men and evil in the world...? It doesn’t matter. Taken Off The Board [200CP] (DC Fourth World) Of course, obvious betrayals and simple murder are the products of hungry beasts and the simple-minded. You’ve learned how to move the board of intrigue in more intricate ways. You know how to advance your own standing and plans through misdirection, assassination, along with just the right amount of slander directed at your foes and know how to do it well. This doesn’t cover the world-spanning schemes or the long-term efforts of years or centuries...but if you need to get ahead and remove someone from the equation? You can certainly do that. Lord of Terror [400CP] (DC Fourth World) Fear is an inadequate description of the feelings you inspire in others. No, terror has a much better ring to it. Your presence is suffocating, quickly draining the morale of those who look upon you and causing those weaker-willed than you to be reduced to gibbering terror. Is it deserved? Perhaps, perhaps not. But it is useful. You find it almost effortless to intimidate others, even if you happen to be doing something as mundane as sitting in someone’s couch or making petty taunts in their direction. Naturally, it’s even more potent when you do or say genuinely terrifying things, which you are very good at. The weak-willed lose their sense of self and their resolve crumbles, leaving them tempted to abandon their values and good sense just to spare themselves. Even those who match or surpass you in strength give you a wide berth and avoid you if they can help it...though they’ll be much harder to bring into line with fear alone. Glorious Gab [400CP] (DC Fourth World) It’s all their fault! You know, Them. Your enemies are the enemies of all – They will steal from you, kill your family, and unleash hell. But Jumper is your salvation, the force from beyond that will redeem you and remove Them from the world forever! All you ask is for a little something in return. You’re an excellent public speaker, especially when it comes to evangelizing your particular dogma or cause...even if that cause is just ‘obey Jumper’ or ‘hate what Jumper hates.’ You know how to stoke the base instincts, fears, and hatred of others and direct them towards whatever purpose you have for them, whipping them into a frenzy and committing acts they would otherwise abhor in the name of what they consider a higher calling. What’s more? You know how to perfectly twist your message in a way that worms into foreign or alien cultures, effectively hijacking any existing or imagined narrative to your liking. With just a small-time radio show, you can inspire riots, cults, or just some good-old-fashioned neighbor against neighbor. Glorious, isn’t it? A Blight Upon The Universe [600CP] (DC Fourth World) It never gets any better. The constant humdrum of daily life, the suffering of the innocent, the slow grind towards entropy and the ever-escalating villainy of those with great ambition. It is always there...and you will it to be so. Your mere presence creates a greater likelihood of worst-case scenarios for the good or those foolish enough to oppose you – weapons jam, beneficial advancements in science or magic turn on their users or into horrific plagues, and more. This is paltry compared to when you actively wound or tear down others. Your actions snowball into greater and longer-lasting ramifications that wound the world forever – killing a great hero causes friction and even in-fighting among their allies in grief, enslaving a country makes all but the strongest-willed heroes accept the outcome and even seek to profit from it, and throwing an entire civilization into the slaughterhouse will compel others to follow your example on their own enemies they were at peace with previously just from how easy it looked. With each victory, each atrocity, you make the world a little worse and full of more evil. You lead with a skip in your step to the very bottom of hell, and the world follows your example. Should you feel...whimsical or merciful, this can be toggled off and back on at will.",

      "description": "Heart Rending Whisper [100CP] (Digimon Data Squad) What an odd talent you have; being able to carry two very different conversations with the same set of words. Despite projecting such a lovable and affable demeanor you’re able to say incredibly vicious, sarcastic and backhanded things without anyone other than your intended target realizing what you’re saying to them. Why you could rip someone a new one throughout an award ceremony dedicated to them, and the audience will cheer at how greatly you exalted them; making it so their inevitable indignation will seem senseless and out of line to those not in the know. Slime Drizzling Grin [100CP] (Digimon Data Squad) It’s amusing how people think they know you; proclaiming your virtues as such an upstanding and polite soul, while completely ignorant of the darkness and venom hiding just below the surface. Why these people wouldn’t know genocidal megalomania if it bit them in the ass, and if things go to plan it certainly will! All the better for you, though you can always choose to let certain individuals peak at what lurks beneath; leaving them horrified as they realize the kind of viper their allies have welcomed with open arms. Oh sure, they might try to act on what they saw, but it’s not like anyone will believe them. Felonious Funding [200CP] (Digimon Data Squad) Building secret armies and performing crimes against both man and digimon isn’t cheap! Even you need to keep a day job to get things done; you’re just lucky enough to find gigs that fit your tastes, get you closer to your goals, and pay you enough that you can funnel it into your personal projects without raising any red flags. This luck even covers your minions employees and structures; allowing you to take care of all the nitty gritty details without leaving a questionable paper trail in the process Devil’s Deal [200CP] (Digimon Data Squad) Everyone has a price, from the maddest killer to the noblest of white knights, and you can always root it out in the end. With a bit of digging and observation you can figure out exactly what you need to offer someone, and how to offer it, to get whatever you want from them regardless of their own ideologies or opinion of you. With this kind of skill, you could accrue a massive number of assets in a very short time; though this doesn’t guarantee they’ll stay on your side. But hey, so long as they do their jobs who cares what they do afterwards? Disaster Artist [400CP] (Digimon Data Squad) It’s just so funny, how everyone seems to run around like headless chickens with you around. A little whisper over here, a frame job over there, and suddenly everyone is at each other’s throats even with the answer right in front of them. Really, nothing compares to the giddy feeling you get after causing the public and government to label their once glorious heroes as crazed terrorists; even denying them the chance to defend themselves, not that they have any hope of doing so if you did things right. Though the funniest part must be how you always come out of it smelling like flowers; no doubt leaving you as the one everyone will turn to for help against those “fiendish villains”. Demonic Appraiser [400CP] (Digimon Data Squad) So honest, so pure in spirit, so terribly predictable. It’d be amusing how you can set a clock to the idiocy around you, if it weren’t so frustrating. All these monkeys prancing about and patting each other on the back, as if it’ll ever change who they really are. They can tell themselves all the pretty white lies they want, but to a true connoisseur of deception such as yourself they’re painfully transparent.

      "description": "Heart Rending Whisper [100CP] (Digimon Data Squad) What an odd talent you have; being able to carry two very different conversations with the same set of words. Despite projecting such a lovable and affable demeanor you’re able to say incredibly vicious, sarcastic and backhanded things without anyone other than your intended target realizing what you’re saying to them. Why you could rip someone a new one throughout an award ceremony dedicated to them, and the audience will cheer at how greatly you exalted them; making it so their inevitable indignation will seem senseless and out of line to those not in the know. Slime Drizzling Grin [100CP] (Digimon Data Squad) It’s amusing how people think they know you; proclaiming your virtues as such an upstanding and polite soul, while completely ignorant of the darkness and venom hiding just below the surface. Why these people wouldn’t know genocidal megalomania if it bit them in the ass, and if things go to plan it certainly will! All the better for you, though you can always choose to let certain individuals peak at what lurks beneath; leaving them horrified as they realize the kind of viper their allies have welcomed with open arms. Oh sure, they might try to act on what they saw, but it’s not like anyone will believe them. Felonious Funding [200CP] (Digimon Data Squad) Building secret armies and performing crimes against both man and digimon isn’t cheap! Even you need to keep a day job to get things done; you’re just lucky enough to find gigs that fit your tastes, get you closer to your goals, and pay you enough that you can funnel it into your personal projects without raising any red flags. This luck even covers your minions employees and structures; allowing you to take care of all the nitty gritty details without leaving a questionable paper trail in the process Devil’s Deal [200CP] (Digimon Data Squad) Everyone has a price, from the maddest killer to the noblest of white knights, and you can always root it out in the end. With a bit of digging and observation you can figure out exactly what you need to offer someone, and how to offer it, to get whatever you want from them regardless of their own ideologies or opinion of you. With this kind of skill, you could accrue a massive number of assets in a very short time; though this doesn’t guarantee they’ll stay on your side. But hey, so long as they do their jobs who cares what they do afterwards? Disaster Artist [400CP] (Digimon Data Squad) It’s just so funny, how everyone seems to run around like headless chickens with you around. A little whisper over here, a frame job over there, and suddenly everyone is at each other’s throats even with the answer right in front of them. Really, nothing compares to the giddy feeling you get after causing the public and government to label their once glorious heroes as crazed terrorists; even denying them the chance to defend themselves, not that they have any hope of doing so if you did things right. Though the funniest part must be how you always come out of it smelling like flowers; no doubt leaving you as the one everyone will turn to for help against those “fiendish villains”. Demonic Appraiser [400CP] (Digimon Data Squad) So honest, so pure in spirit, so terribly predictable. It’d be amusing how you can set a clock to the idiocy around you, if it weren’t so frustrating. All these monkeys prancing about and patting each other on the back, as if it’ll ever change who they really are. They can tell themselves all the pretty white lies they want, but to a true connoisseur of deception such as yourself they’re painfully transparent. With a single conversation you can easily profile all but the most stoic and secretive of souls, and even they wouldn’t be able to hide the fact they’re hiding something.

This growth is immune to the disadvantageous nature of the square-cube law, and you will retain the proportionate strength of your original size (that is if you could lift 5 times your weight at your normal size you can lift 5 times your weight at this increased size). Since you’re paying so much for this you can reverse this growth, though it will take twice as long to shrink as it did to grow (minimum of 96 hours from full size to normal size). If you want to be able to grow even larger you may add 5 times your normal size to the maximum growth for each additional (undiscounted) 100 CP you pay to a maximum of 25 times normal size (roughly the height of daikaiju of this era for a normal human; this would cost 300 extra CP).",

This gives you abilities similar to both a werewolf and a revenant. You possess strong spiritual energy comparable to a corn maiden, are superhumanly strong and fast, durable enough to survive having your limbs shot off by a shotgun and a bullet blown through your head, and have the individual limbs animate and crawl back to you while healing the wound. These are all secondary powers, though. You are the spirit of Halloween, and while acting in this role you possess a great variety of magical capabilities: off screen teleportation, covering a room in menacing writing, creating candy mixed with razor blades, and more. Of course these powers are tied to your role as spirit of Halloween and function best on Halloween and when enforcing its rules; not that they will be completely lost at other times. Of course as the spirit of Halloween, you will find that wherever you go Halloween will exist; it might not be identical, or have precisely the same traditions, but you will find a version of the holiday - a day celebrating the day where the barriers between the worlds of the living and dead are at their weakest - existing in any culture or world you visit. This also gives you a Halloween themed alt-form, something monstrous; you could match Sam as the pumpkin child, or you could perhaps create another of your own, maybe a skeletal figure representing death, a headless horseman, a witch, or something else.

By purchasing this you can define whether you are a biped or a quadruped, and you also gain two of the following: Terror from the Deep [200CP*] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon) You are a creature of the deep. Your form is streamlined for swimming, your senses attuned to an amphibious life, giving you senses like a shark or other deep sea predator, your body capable of surviving great changes of pressure. You can breathe both water and air, able to survive in both salt and fresh water as well as retaining the ability to survive on land. This also gives you piscine scales across your body if you desire. Alternatively you may be adapted to life underground. Your hearing reaches into echolocation, olfaction similar to a dog’s, and your night vision is similar to an owl’s. You are able to burrow through the ground at relatively great speed; you won’t be keeping up with yourself running on the ground when digging tunnels but you will be a natural digger. This also gives you some armoring plates to avoid damaging yourself when burrowing through rocks. Terror from the Deep: Subterror: May pay an additional 100 CP to get both. Outside of Physics [400CP] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon) The creatures of these films exist outside of nature and physics as humans understand them, defying it in various ways. Select an ability from the list below, or create one of a similar power level. Monster Blooded [400CP] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon) Being able to deter human interference is well and good, but you will be dealing with things far stranger than man. With this they will be easier to deal with. Perhaps there is something monstrous in your background that they find kinship with, perhaps it is something else, but you will find monstrous creatures tend to view you with a certain kind of affection or fondness almost as if you were their kin or a pet. This works best on the more otherworldly horrors which stray furthest from humanity, and will do less to those who actively prey upon humans. Mutated [400CP] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon) But perhaps you show more signs of a monstrous heritage than their kinship. Whether born human or not, you seem to have been changed or twisted. By taking this perk you gain an alt-form which you can change into and which exists as a combination of any or all of your alt-forms, defined as you desire. At the start of each jump you can redefine this alt-form. You also gain 1 free purchase of Abnormal Appendages, or 2 if you have the Monster Background (for a total of 3 free purchases as a Monster). Cthulhu-lite [600CP] (Lovecraft Midnight Movie Marathon) Perhaps you have no desire to be a common individual of whatever monstrous species you are a part of. Perhaps you wish to stand above them. You are now a creature similar to Cthulhu to his Starspawn or Dagon to the deep ones, something more and greater than the common example of your kind. Your size is increased, to roughly 35 meters, making you substantially larger than a human if you weren’t already. But this is not merely an increase in mass. Besides possessing the physical power you’d expect from a titanic monster, you will find your powers seem to scale somewhat with your size, their range and even area increasing proportionate to your new body. Just by having this you will also find a minor general increase to your mystical, spiritual, or psychic powers even when not in the alt-form this perk creates, and they will all increase further with size, though (unlike the area and range) they will not double with a doubling of your size but you will find that bigger is better.

First let's talk about the Vessel option, the one that costs -200CP, by buying this you officially become a vessel, what this means is that you have the capability of eating cursed objects to become a reincarnation of a sorcerer. Thankfully they won't overwrite your will, though they are certainly capable of it if you give them the opportunity. So why would you ever eat a cursed object you ask? Because if you do let that sorcerer take control, they will be able to use their abilities such as their innate technique. So maybe try to find a kind sorcerer?

The only exceptions would be the effect of water and sea prism stones if you have the abilities of a Devil Fruit, or a resistance to Devil Fruit abilities.

On the plus side, for some reason or another it failed to gain entry, and it was forced to consume and replace one of your limbs instead, or maybe a section of your torso, or even part of your lower face. Over the last day, it has revealed its intelligence to you, and you have come to an uneasy truce with it: it needs you to live, so it must protect you, and in this world of bodily horrors, you too may have to depend on it for your life. Multi-Parasyte [200CP*] (Parasyte) There are more parasytes attached to your host (or your body, if you are the host) than the usual one. Each parasyte takes up a different body part. No more than five parasytes in total may inhabit one human host body. They must not take up your brain if you are a Human Host, but may take up part of your head, or the front or back of your torso, though they can’t replace the organs in your torso – they need these to live. They may be imported companions at no further cost (if they are imported companions, they must remain in separate companion slots). The parasytes may be Cranial or Body types (you can have any mix – Cranial parasytes can occupy limbs or Body Parasytes can occupy the head, in this arrangement) with 400cp to spend on perks each. Multiple-parasyte hosts may have coordination issues: your body will have at least two or three minds, each may have slightly different ideas of how to move. Body Snatcher [400CP] (Parasyte) Despite maturing in one body, parasytes can transfer to a new host if their current one becomes wounded. You do this easily; adapting to different nervous systems, blood types, body types or genders. A new human host body rejecting your parasyte form would be quite odd indeed. You can attempt to transfer to the body of another near-human species like an elf or Vulcan, but the more divergent the genetics, the more likely rejection is. Sharing your blood and body with a host may grant them an array of your biological advantages, such as being a Hybrid if you have it. These advantages leave once you stop being connected to them. As a human (or in human form) you are both a universal donor, as well as a universal recipient when it comes to organs and blood. Hybrid [600CP] (Parasyte) Your parasyte has sent tiny fragments of itself throughout your human body, which have incorporated themselves into your muscles and nervous system. You can draw on the extreme speed and strength that parasytes exhibit, allowing you to exceed human limits - moving faster than a blink to dodge or attack at parasyte speeds, running at speeds which can match cars, leaping much higher even than an Olympian, gain incredible sensory perception, and the strength to smash concrete walls and throw cars. These cells also provide your human body with the durability and regeneration to survive things that would pulverise a normal person, and incidentally correct any natural flaws your body might have (like near-sightedness). (Editor’s Note: Human Host was originally one of the backgrounds, but because there isn’t a perk option for it. I’ve decided to just make it one. You may choose to have it anywhere except the heart, neck, and head. The parasyte will most likely be only 24 hours old. There is information on its traits on its Jump. For Multi-Parasyte, you must already have the perk Human Host.)",

Use of this power is accompanied by circuitry-like growths all over the user’s body. Baby 6 [Gashadokuro] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) The power of Baby 6 is limitless bone development. In other words, you’re able to generate an infinite number of bones of any shape or size from your body. You can only generate bones so fast, and stronger bones take longer, but you can grow and regrow bones without any limit, it doesn’t even take nutrients from your body to do so. You don’t seem to feel pain from sprouting countless bones outside of your body either. You can freely control your bones and the form they take.

You can control them all individually as powerful limbs, but there is more to them. Each tail has mouth at the end, and long prehensile tongues. The saliva of the tails can reconstruct the molecules of whatever it touches. These tongues let you mold matter like clay, like sculpting a stone into a sword, or licking someone’s face smooth to watch them suffocate. Baby 3 [Red Devil] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) Use of Baby 3’s powers is accompanied by an eye in the middle of your chest, and various demonic traits. The power of Red Devil is to create Demonic Gates, portals that can connect two points in space, letting you traverse immense distances in an instant, or use them to teleport shorter distances in battle. Baby 2 [The Big Tengu] [700CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) From the palms of your hands, you can generate a strange black substance with properties that enhance gravitational vectors, allowing you to control gravity. In short, you can cause objects to fly, or force it in the direction you desire. You can even cause small buildings to levitate without your presence, or exert enough force to tear through steel. This can also be applied to create mini black holes called Unlucky Stars, that annihilate everything in their path until enough matter has been consumed. Using these powers to their full potential will cause two furry “wings” to sprout from your back. Baby 1/0 [Mermaid] [800CP*] (Amalgam of Distortion) You have the power of agelessness and immortality. Your body can regenerate from anything short of complete disintegration, and any foreign substances in your body are ejected over the course of 24 hours. You can even control severed body parts. Your regeneration also continuously replenishes your bioenergy, and without the risk of death or disability, can force high-risk medical procedures to succeed through trial and error. True Mermaid: For an additional 100CP, you are not the spawn of the first mummy, but a human who dined upon the flesh of an actual mermaid. This allows you to give birth to monster children, akin to the ones used to make the Amalgams. They will always be stillborn, but their cells can be used to create abilities just as strange and potent as those of the Amalgams. You can decide whether you give birth to a monster or an actual living baby at conception. (Editor’s Note: Check the Notes Section about Baby 3 & 5.)",

      "description": "Blood Curdle [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) This ability allows you to paralyze individuals by consuming their blood. The amount of time they remain paralysed will vary based on blood type. As long as the user's tongue touches the blood that is enough to activate the paralysis ability. The blood will still be effective regardless of where it is from or how it was taken. It is unknown how it would affect other species or those with divine properties however. Transforming Arms [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Transforming Arms allows its user to shape-shift their arms, allowing the user to have long-ranged, elastic attacks. The user can also split their arms apart to surround their target and launch multiple attacks at once. Depending on the user's fighting style, it may not be compatible with the intentions of the Quirk. For example complex martial arts can easily conflict with the elastic shape shifting effect. As a result this can create lag in the users' attacks. Vitality Stealing [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) By making physical contact and then inhaling, the user can absorb the vitality of others, not only giving themselves more stamina, but also gaining an increase in size and strength. If the user is unable to make physical contact with his targets, then this Quirk is rendered ineffective. Anivoice [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Anivoice allows the user to communicate with and command animals through speech. This grants you a versatile suit of powers due to the diversity of abilities found within the animal kingdom. For example, bugs with their small size and burrowing capabilities are able to perform sneak attacks from underground, birds are useful for reconnaissance due to being flying creatures with great eyesight, and so on. Also this grants you an innate sense of what animals are saying. You will be able to understand animal language to some extent or receive information from the animals you command, but you can't communicate with any animal through intricate dialogue. Larceny [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Larceny allows the user to take any object that their target possesses, instantly bringing it into their hands. The objects that can be \"stolen\" include even manifestations of others' Quirks. Because of Larcenies effects, it grants a natural advantage against weapon users, such as armed policemen. There is a size limit to what you can steal from one's person, with large enough objects being impossible to take away. You are also unable to use the Quirk on objects that are outside of your line of sight, meaning that you would be left completely defenseless if your eyes become blinded. Multiplication [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) This Quirk allows the user to grow and duplicate parts of their body all over themselves, giving them a multiplied increase in power depending on how many duplicates there are. Overusing this quirk though can make your body too bulky and greatly lower your mobility Binging Ball [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Binging Ball allows the user to release small floating spheres with mouths from their body. These spheres can be used as projectiles, moving at very high speeds. The spheres are also capable of ingesting materials, such as ice shards. Forcible Quirk Activation [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Forced Quirk Activation allows the user to forcefully activate someone's Quirk against their will. Whether the target is conscious or not, the Quirk will work without fail, thus giving the user a method to use their allies' Quirks without having to worry about their state. It also would be useful for screwing with your opponent if you wanted to. Rivet Stab [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Rivet Stab allows its user to generate black tendrils that have red prominent cracked lines that extend from the users' fingers, although they can also emerge from other parts of the body such as the spine. I would recommend buying this alongside Forcible Quirk Activation if you want to mimic All For One’s ability. Multi-Quirk [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) While most of them are the result of very special circumstances it is possible for someone to have multiple quirks. This perk makes it so that later on as long as you can afford it you’ll be allowed to purchase multiple quirks. How they interact will be up to you. Also to clarify this will give you the ability to hold any amount of quirks. You just need to figure out how to acquire them whether you purchase them here or acquire them in a jump. Mummification [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Mummification allows the user to manipulate the red bandages they are wrapped in to ensnare inanimate objects that get caught in them and turn them into humanoid red mummies that they can control at will and make them fight for them. Although the limit number is unknown, the user should be capable of controlling a few dozen mummies at the same time. Black Whip [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Black Whip allows the user to produce tendrils made of energy from any part of their body and command them mentally. They can be used for a variety of purposes from restraining your enemies or to swing around like a discount spiderman. Gas [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Gas grants the user the ability to generate a poisonous, sleep-inducing gas from their body. The user is capable of producing a large amount of purple-colored gas, enough to completely fill The Beast's Forest. Anyone who inhales the gas directly will immediately fall asleep and remain that way until the toxin is treated. In addition, the presence and movement speed of anyone within the gas can be sensed by the user thanks to its fluctuations. The gas' concentration is highest at its center and loses potency in lesser affected areas away from the user. The gas swirls in a typhoon, completely centered around the user. Navigating through the gas is also very difficult, similar to a very thick fog. Hydra [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Hydra allowed the user to summon gigantic sea snake-like creatures from their back that they can control at will. The creatures are large enough to crush a person in their jaws. The amount of heads summoned will depend on the user’s capabilities. A weaker individual may only be able to summon a single head, but a more powerful individual could summon a dozen at once. Transformation [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) With this Quirk, the user can shape-shift into another person's appearance after consuming some of their blood. It gives them the full ability to copy a perfect image of them, including tiny details. They can even replicate the voice of the person they've transformed into. This Quirk can only aesthetically transform its user into a perfect replica. The user cannot replicate their target's personality, knowledge, or other such details. These details must be discovered separately by the user if they wish to mimic their target exactly. The amount of time the user can utilize a particular transformation is proportionate to the amount of blood that is consumed. One cup of blood equates to roughly one day's worth of being able to be transformed into that person. If the blood of multiple people has been ingested, then the Quirk user can transform into any of them, and without having to return to their original shape between transformations. After undergoing an Awakening, Transform also allows the user to duplicate the Quirk of the person they transformed into, provided they have enough prior knowledge of said Quirk through studying and researching. Brainwashing [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Brainwashing allows the user to put their target in a state where they are forced to obey all of their commands. In order to activate their power, they need their target to verbally respond to something they say. Brainwashing does need to be willingly activated by the user, who can otherwise hold normal conversations with other people without brainwashing them. It is possible for the user to brainwash multiple individuals, but controlling multiple people at once makes it exponentially harder. The quirk does have a variety of weaknesses though. You cannot order brainwashed targets to perform orders that require complex brain activity, such as talking or thinking, meaning it is impossible to make them write down information from their memory. You must keep his commands simple for them to be followed. Second, it will only work if the target verbally responds to you. Meaning it can easily be countered by someone who is aware of your abilities. Dark Shadow [300CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Dark Shadow grants the user a shadowy, monster-like being from within his body that he can materialize and dematerialize at will. Dark Shadow effectively acts like the user’s personal guardian, functioning as a living appendage that follows all of its master's commands. It is sentient, capable of speech, and loyally protects its host, regardless of the state it finds itself in. Dark Shadow is always connected to the user and unable to truly leave their presence. Dark Shadow appears to possess the ability to change shape to some extent, as it can apparently extend the length of its arms and neck if so desired. It's said to be made of \"dark energy\", despite being a solid entity that can interact with the material world, but said energy has a limit, and Dark Shadow will retract into the user’s body when said limit runs out. Certain actions can make this energy drain out faster, like making Dark Shadow take too many opposing hits or having it distance itself too much from the user’s body. To recharge Dark Shadow, you must keep it shrouded from any source of light. Erasure [300CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Erasure allows the user to cancel out the Quirk of anyone they look at. When Erasure is activated, the user is able to disable a person's Quirk Factor until they close their eyes. Shota only needs one part of the target's body to be within his sights for Erasure to take effect. Since most people in the world rely on Quirks for combat purposes, this makes you an extremely bothersome opponent for anyone to deal with. In addition, as shown at the start of Tamaki Amajiki's fight with Toya Setsuno, Soramitsu Tabe and Yu Hojo, Erasure can be activated on multiple targets at once, and stays in effect even if the user looks elsewhere, as long as their eyes stay open. Due to your nature as a jumper you can extend this ability to any type of biological enhancement such as an X-gene. Warp Gate [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) This quirk allows you to generate warp portals allowing you to teleport to various locations. The amount and size of the portals will depend on your skill and endurance. Optionally you may transform your body into a misty form similar to Kurogiri. Otherwise by default you will simply gain the ability to create portals. Decay [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) The power is capable of rapidly decaying anything the user attacks causing it to crumble to dust. Whether the target is organic or not, Decay will work without fail. As such, this Quirk is extremely lethal against living beings, having their flesh rot away if hit by it. The speed of the disintegration has developed from slow to almost immediate, eventually spreading through their whole body if a victim doesn't amputate the decaying body part (Eraser Head was able to avoid this by erasing Decay before it could cause further damage to his flesh). It is also possible for the effect of Decay to spread beyond what the user has touched, creating a domino chain of disintegrated victims. At the peak shown so far it is possible to decay an entire hospital and everyone inside at once, even spreading to affect an entire city. The user can also prevent decay from affecting something if they don’t wish to target it. Overhaul [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) This quirk allows you to manipulate and control matter. This can be used to rearrange and alter anything you are touching. Once the user takes a target apart, he has the option of either leaving it destroyed, restoring it to its original form or shaping it into something new. This process happens instantly and is effective on living and nonliving things alike. The user only needs one finger to make contact with something for his Quirk to activate, with the choice of whether Overhaul should affect only one select part of his target or its entirety being left solely to the user's wishes. The user can recombine two different objects or beings into a single entity that possesses components of both subjects (including Quirks). This is performed by holding both elements they want to merge with each separate hand. It's possible for a combined entity to further transform as well, as long as the user merges it with additional objects. If Overhaul is utilized on a person, it can heal any injuries or ailments they once had by reconstructing them to a biologically perfect state. This can be used mid battle to essentially give the user a healing factor. Cremation [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) The user can ignite blue fire anywhere on their body with minimal effort or movement almost instantaneously. They can also combust anything they touch almost instantly, including robust minerals and living creatures alike. For example, by touching a single tree in The Beast's Forest, Dabi was able to set the majority of the forest ablaze, trapping everyone there in a ring of fire. The flames of this Quirk are extremely hot, burning at a temperature of at least 2,000°C (3,632°F), which is higher than that of lava and normal fire, signified by its blue coloration. Dabi's flames were hot enough to burn an entire group of villains into ash in mere seconds. They're also quite bright, making them effective against Dark Shadow. The flames are powered by the user’s emotions, particularly rage, so the greater your anger, the hotter your flames burn. As a final bonus to prevent you from ending up like Dabi your body will be improved to the point that you will be able to safely use the flames. Zombie Virus [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Zombie Virus enables the user to produce a pinkish gas that, when inhaled, temporarily transforms victims into zombies. Those infected gain the endurance of a zombie, increased strength, and the ability to pass along the virus via a bite. If a hero is infected by the gas, they can still use their Quirk and retain aspects of their personality. Their brains' function is a total zero when affected. They also moan and have bluish-gray skin. The only weakness is that normally the user is not immune to it. Meaning that the zombies created can attack and infect the user. Also anyone who has a zombie-like appearance will be ignored by the transformed individuals. For example All Might’s weak form was ignored when the zombies found him during the attack. Super Regeneration [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Super Regeneration grants the user the ability to regenerate any sort of injuries on their body, such as missing limbs, at incredible speeds. It is considered an incredibly rare and dangerous Quirk, thanks to its capabilities of making any of its users near invincible, able to recover from nearly any attack. There are some weaknesses however, the Quirk can not heal injuries that have already been cauterized by the time the Quirk is received or activated. In addition the regeneration can also become null if the user is beaten by their opponent faster than they can regenerate, whether that's through punches, fire, or disintegration. Lastly, if the user's body is not properly prepared, the regeneration process can also become a lot slower as a result. Double [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Double allowed the user to create a copy of anything, two at a time, through touch. With Double, the user can produce replicas of anyone to provide support in numbers. They do this by creating a dark-coloured, viscous fluid from his hands that forms into the person in question. In order to conceive a perfect clone, you are required to have knowledge of precise measurements and physical features of the person or object he was replicating. Doubles possess the same personality and abilities as the original, making it hard to distinguish them from the real person at a first glance. The copies only recall the memories of the last time they interacted with the user. Also the doubled clones are very weak physically. A single good blow can cause the clones to dissolve. Sharingan [400CP*] (Generic MHA Fanfic) The Sharingan is a powerful dojutsu possessed by the Uchiha clan. Purchasing this grants you it and optimally you may receive their bloodline. The main abilities it gives the user are the ability to see chakra, powerful perception, skill in illusion techniques, and the ability to instantly learn anything they observe. This does not extend to copying other abilities, but skills such as martial arts are an example of what can be learned. This is what you receive for choosing the 400QP option. Mangekyo Sharingan: The 600QP option will evolve your eyes into the Mangekyo Sharingan. These possess similar abilities to the normal version, but to an enhanced degree. In addition it grants the user some powerful new abilities. There will be two unique powers based on the Individual such as Amaterasu, Kotoamatsukami, or Tsukuyomi. You may choose the two abilities or allow them to be generated based on your unique capabilities. This would also allow for the possibility of a new ability to emerge. Lastly they will gain access to Susanoo. This is both an incredibly powerful offensive and defensive ability. The only restriction is that without the Eternal Mangekyo, using these unique abilities will eventually lead to blindness if overused. To gain the Eternal Mangekyo you must either take the eyes of a blood relative ideally a sibling who also possesses the Mangekyo or purchase the option below. If they aren't in the right crossover world the first option may be impossible. Eternal Mangekyo: The Eternal Mangekyo is offered for an additional 200QP for a total of 800QP. This will allow you to use your abilities to the fullest without worrying about blindness. You may also select an additional unique ability for your eyes. If those still aren’t enough then there are two more options. First you can pay for additional Mangekyou abilities including custom ones for 200QP each. Rinnegan: Second, you may choose to receive the Rinnegan instead for 1000QP. This will not grant you the abilities of the Sharingan, but offers its own unique powers. There will be a link in the notes providing detailed information on the Rinnegans' powers. Rinne Sharingan: Third, is the final option, should you purchase both sets of abilities then you may merge them into the Rinne Sharingan. To merge them you would need to buy them separately for a total of 1800QP. This will allow you to utilize all of the powers possessed by both eyes. In addition the abilities will be enhanced in strength even further. Lastly this will grant the user access to techniques such as Infinite Tsukuyomi and allow the user to travel to a personal pocket dimension. If you do not possess chakra then this ability will be powered by your stamina or any other energy sources you possess. (Editor’s Note: I’ve removed the bonus of Multi-Quirk allowing you to have multiple of their abilities such as Stands for balancing at this price. The High-End perk will let you have this perk for free. Also all Quirks will be considered genetic abilities, as such will be classified as such rather than just abilities. Sharingan can, if you wish, be considered not a quirk.)",

      "description": "This perk is divided into two versions, and you can only buy one of them. First let's talk about the Vessel option, the one that costs -200CP, by buying this you officially become a vessel, what this means is that you have the capability of eating cursed objects to become a reincarnation of a sorcerer. Thankfully they won't overwrite your will, though they are certainly capable of it if you give them the opportunity. So why would you ever eat a cursed object you ask? Because if you do let that sorcerer take control, they will be able to use their abilities such as their innate technique. So maybe try to find a kind sorcerer? Either way, due to the nature of souls, having another one inside of your body will make you aware of them, what this means is that your strikes will then directly harm someone's soul. That isn't all however, because eventually the techniques of your little parasite will be engraved upon your body, and then you will no longer need them. This option can also make you into a Star Plasma Vessel, making you capable of listening to the assimilated victims of Tengen when in close proximity.

      "description": "Strong Resistance [100CP*] (One Piece) There are many more dangers out there than you’d think, but it helps to be resistant to a few of them. You are heavily resistant to some kind of damage or effect, be it blunt force, blades, fire, poison, or something weirder. The only exceptions would be the effect of water and sea prism stones if you have the abilities of a Devil Fruit, or a resistance to Devil Fruit abilities. This option can be taken multiple times for multiple resistances. Body of Steel [400CP] (One Piece) You were broken, once, but through the miracles of SCIENCE you have been rebuilt! Yes, you are now a cyborg, with all that entails! Regardless if you were crafted in the labs of Vegapunk, or a product of your own genius, your steely exterior is especially resistant to damage, all while possessing numerous hidden tools and weapons built into your body. You will need to manually repair yourself, but at least you can add in upgrades that are guaranteed to become fiat-backed! Germa Genetics [400CP] (One Piece) Through the combined efforts of Vegapunk and Germa 66, it is possible to create superhumans through manipulating the Lineage Factor of fetuses, and you are living proof of its success. You've got a crazy durable exoskeleton, heal at a greatly increased rate, and are much more physically capable than you should be. This strength of yours is capable of growing quickly through training. As a child, you could already outperform trained soldiers with ease, and as you grow, there's no telling how strong you'll become. Thankfully, you won’t have that nasty side effect of suppressed emotions, allowing you to enjoy the full spectrum of your passions.",

      "description": "Human Host [300CP] (Parasyte) You are a human, but have had a parasyte larva attempted to enter and consume your brain. On the plus side, for some reason or another it failed to gain entry, and it was forced to consume and replace one of your limbs instead, or maybe a section of your torso, or even part of your lower face. Over the last day, it has revealed its intelligence to you, and you have come to an uneasy truce with it: it needs you to live, so it must protect you, and in this world of bodily horrors, you too may have to depend on it for your life. Multi-Parasyte [200CP*] (Parasyte) There are more parasytes attached to your host (or your body, if you are the host) than the usual one. Each parasyte takes up a different body part. No more than five parasytes in total may inhabit one human host body. They must not take up your brain if you are a Human Host, but may take up part of your head, or the front or back of your torso, though they can’t replace the organs in your torso – they need these to live. They may be imported companions at no further cost (if they are imported companions, they must remain in separate companion slots). The parasytes may be Cranial or Body types (you can have any mix – Cranial parasytes can occupy limbs or Body Parasytes can occupy the head, in this arrangement) with 400cp to spend on perks each. Multiple-parasyte hosts may have coordination issues: your body will have at least two or three minds, each may have slightly different ideas of how to move. Body Snatcher [400CP] (Parasyte) Despite maturing in one body, parasytes can transfer to a new host if their current one becomes wounded. You do this easily; adapting to different nervous systems, blood types, body types or genders. A new human host body rejecting your parasyte form would be quite odd indeed. You can attempt to transfer to the body of another near-human species like an elf or Vulcan, but the more divergent the genetics, the more likely rejection is. Sharing your blood and body with a host may grant them an array of your biological advantages, such as being a Hybrid if you have it. These advantages leave once you stop being connected to them. As a human (or in human form) you are both a universal donor, as well as a universal recipient when it comes to organs and blood. Hybrid [600CP] (Parasyte) Your parasyte has sent tiny fragments of itself throughout your human body, which have incorporated themselves into your muscles and nervous system. You can draw on the extreme speed and strength that parasytes exhibit, allowing you to exceed human limits - moving faster than a blink to dodge or attack at parasyte speeds, running at speeds which can match cars, leaping much higher even than an Olympian, gain incredible sensory perception, and the strength to smash concrete walls and throw cars. These cells also provide your human body with the durability and regeneration to survive things that would pulverise a normal person, and incidentally correct any natural flaws your body might have (like near-sightedness). (Editor’s Note: Human Host was originally one of the backgrounds, but because there isn’t a perk option for it. I’ve decided to just make it one. You may choose to have it anywhere except the heart, neck, and head. The parasyte will most likely be only 24 hours old. There is information on its traits on its Jump. For Multi-Parasyte, you must already have the perk Human Host.)",

      "description": "Loud and Proud [300CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) Implanted into the palms of your hand is an experimental sonic weapon. Fueled by your own bioenergy, you can release massive sonic blasts that can annihilate half a forest in one shot. Be mindful of controlling the output. Baby # [???] [300CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) The power of Baby 5 involves the control of brain waves, allowing them to rewrite one’s memories freely. This also comes with the ability to manipulate electrical currents, and detect moving objects within a massive range of yourself. Use of this power is accompanied by circuitry-like growths all over the user’s body. Baby 6 [Gashadokuro] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) The power of Baby 6 is limitless bone development. In other words, you’re able to generate an infinite number of bones of any shape or size from your body. You can only generate bones so fast, and stronger bones take longer, but you can grow and regrow bones without any limit, it doesn’t even take nutrients from your body to do so. You don’t seem to feel pain from sprouting countless bones outside of your body either. You can freely control your bones and the form they take. The physical changes that come with this power are the bones which jut out of your body when in use. You may also end up substituting lost body parts with bone. Baby 5 [Gogou] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) The power of Baby 5 involves the control of brain waves, allowing them to rewrite one’s memories freely.

Use of this power is accompanied by circuitry-like growths all over the user’s body. Baby 4 [Nine-Tailed Fox] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) The power of Baby 4 comes in the form of nine furry tail-like tentacles sprouting from your back. You can control them all individually as powerful limbs, but there is more to them. Each tail has mouth at the end, and long prehensile tongues. The saliva of the tails can reconstruct the molecules of whatever it touches. These tongues let you mold matter like clay, like sculpting a stone into a sword, or licking someone’s face smooth to watch them suffocate. Baby 3 [Red Devil] [600CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) Use of Baby 3’s powers is accompanied by an eye in the middle of your chest, and various demonic traits. The power of Red Devil is to create Demonic Gates, portals that can connect two points in space, letting you traverse immense distances in an instant, or use them to teleport shorter distances in battle. Baby 2 [The Big Tengu] [700CP] (Amalgam of Distortion) From the palms of your hands, you can generate a strange black substance with properties that enhance gravitational vectors, allowing you to control gravity. In short, you can cause objects to fly, or force it in the direction you desire. You can even cause small buildings to levitate without your presence, or exert enough force to tear through steel. This can also be applied to create mini black holes called Unlucky Stars, that annihilate everything in their path until enough matter has been consumed. Using these powers to their full potential will cause two furry “wings” to sprout from your back. Baby 1/0 [Mermaid] [800CP*] (Amalgam of Distortion) You have the power of agelessness and immortality. Your body can regenerate from anything short of complete disintegration, and any foreign substances in your body are ejected over the course of 24 hours. You can even control severed body parts. Your regeneration also continuously replenishes your bioenergy, and without the risk of death or disability, can force high-risk medical procedures to succeed through trial and error. True Mermaid: For an additional 100CP, you are not the spawn of the first mummy, but a human who dined upon the flesh of an actual mermaid. This allows you to give birth to monster children, akin to the ones used to make the Amalgams. They will always be stillborn, but their cells can be used to create abilities just as strange and potent as those of the Amalgams.

Transforming Arms [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Transforming Arms allows its user to shape-shift their arms, allowing the user to have long-ranged, elastic attacks. The user can also split their arms apart to surround their target and launch multiple attacks at once. Depending on the user's fighting style, it may not be compatible with the intentions of the Quirk. For example complex martial arts can easily conflict with the elastic shape shifting effect. As a result this can create lag in the users' attacks. Vitality Stealing [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) By making physical contact and then inhaling, the user can absorb the vitality of others, not only giving themselves more stamina, but also gaining an increase in size and strength. If the user is unable to make physical contact with his targets, then this Quirk is rendered ineffective. Anivoice [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Anivoice allows the user to communicate with and command animals through speech. This grants you a versatile suit of powers due to the diversity of abilities found within the animal kingdom. For example, bugs with their small size and burrowing capabilities are able to perform sneak attacks from underground, birds are useful for reconnaissance due to being flying creatures with great eyesight, and so on. Also this grants you an innate sense of what animals are saying. You will be able to understand animal language to some extent or receive information from the animals you command, but you can't communicate with any animal through intricate dialogue. Larceny [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Larceny allows the user to take any object that their target possesses, instantly bringing it into their hands. The objects that can be \"stolen\" include even manifestations of others' Quirks. Because of Larcenies effects, it grants a natural advantage against weapon users, such as armed policemen. There is a size limit to what you can steal from one's person, with large enough objects being impossible to take away. You are also unable to use the Quirk on objects that are outside of your line of sight, meaning that you would be left completely defenseless if your eyes become blinded. Multiplication [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) This Quirk allows the user to grow and duplicate parts of their body all over themselves, giving them a multiplied increase in power depending on how many duplicates there are. Overusing this quirk though can make your body too bulky and greatly lower your mobility Binging Ball [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Binging Ball allows the user to release small floating spheres with mouths from their body. These spheres can be used as projectiles, moving at very high speeds. The spheres are also capable of ingesting materials, such as ice shards. Forcible Quirk Activation [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Forced Quirk Activation allows the user to forcefully activate someone's Quirk against their will. Whether the target is conscious or not, the Quirk will work without fail, thus giving the user a method to use their allies' Quirks without having to worry about their state. It also would be useful for screwing with your opponent if you wanted to. Rivet Stab [100CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Rivet Stab allows its user to generate black tendrils that have red prominent cracked lines that extend from the users' fingers, although they can also emerge from other parts of the body such as the spine. I would recommend buying this alongside Forcible Quirk Activation if you want to mimic All For One’s ability. Multi-Quirk [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) While most of them are the result of very special circumstances it is possible for someone to have multiple quirks. This perk makes it so that later on as long as you can afford it you’ll be allowed to purchase multiple quirks. How they interact will be up to you. Also to clarify this will give you the ability to hold any amount of quirks. You just need to figure out how to acquire them whether you purchase them here or acquire them in a jump. Mummification [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Mummification allows the user to manipulate the red bandages they are wrapped in to ensnare inanimate objects that get caught in them and turn them into humanoid red mummies that they can control at will and make them fight for them. Although the limit number is unknown, the user should be capable of controlling a few dozen mummies at the same time. Black Whip [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Black Whip allows the user to produce tendrils made of energy from any part of their body and command them mentally. They can be used for a variety of purposes from restraining your enemies or to swing around like a discount spiderman. Gas [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Gas grants the user the ability to generate a poisonous, sleep-inducing gas from their body. The user is capable of producing a large amount of purple-colored gas, enough to completely fill The Beast's Forest. Anyone who inhales the gas directly will immediately fall asleep and remain that way until the toxin is treated. In addition, the presence and movement speed of anyone within the gas can be sensed by the user thanks to its fluctuations. The gas' concentration is highest at its center and loses potency in lesser affected areas away from the user. The gas swirls in a typhoon, completely centered around the user. Navigating through the gas is also very difficult, similar to a very thick fog. Hydra [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Hydra allowed the user to summon gigantic sea snake-like creatures from their back that they can control at will. The creatures are large enough to crush a person in their jaws. The amount of heads summoned will depend on the user’s capabilities. A weaker individual may only be able to summon a single head, but a more powerful individual could summon a dozen at once. Transformation [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) With this Quirk, the user can shape-shift into another person's appearance after consuming some of their blood. It gives them the full ability to copy a perfect image of them, including tiny details. They can even replicate the voice of the person they've transformed into. This Quirk can only aesthetically transform its user into a perfect replica. The user cannot replicate their target's personality, knowledge, or other such details. These details must be discovered separately by the user if they wish to mimic their target exactly. The amount of time the user can utilize a particular transformation is proportionate to the amount of blood that is consumed. One cup of blood equates to roughly one day's worth of being able to be transformed into that person. If the blood of multiple people has been ingested, then the Quirk user can transform into any of them, and without having to return to their original shape between transformations. After undergoing an Awakening, Transform also allows the user to duplicate the Quirk of the person they transformed into, provided they have enough prior knowledge of said Quirk through studying and researching. Brainwashing [200CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Brainwashing allows the user to put their target in a state where they are forced to obey all of their commands. In order to activate their power, they need their target to verbally respond to something they say. Brainwashing does need to be willingly activated by the user, who can otherwise hold normal conversations with other people without brainwashing them. It is possible for the user to brainwash multiple individuals, but controlling multiple people at once makes it exponentially harder. The quirk does have a variety of weaknesses though. You cannot order brainwashed targets to perform orders that require complex brain activity, such as talking or thinking, meaning it is impossible to make them write down information from their memory. You must keep his commands simple for them to be followed. Second, it will only work if the target verbally responds to you. Meaning it can easily be countered by someone who is aware of your abilities. Dark Shadow [300CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Dark Shadow grants the user a shadowy, monster-like being from within his body that he can materialize and dematerialize at will. Dark Shadow effectively acts like the user’s personal guardian, functioning as a living appendage that follows all of its master's commands. It is sentient, capable of speech, and loyally protects its host, regardless of the state it finds itself in. Dark Shadow is always connected to the user and unable to truly leave their presence. Dark Shadow appears to possess the ability to change shape to some extent, as it can apparently extend the length of its arms and neck if so desired. It's said to be made of \"dark energy\", despite being a solid entity that can interact with the material world, but said energy has a limit, and Dark Shadow will retract into the user’s body when said limit runs out. Certain actions can make this energy drain out faster, like making Dark Shadow take too many opposing hits or having it distance itself too much from the user’s body. To recharge Dark Shadow, you must keep it shrouded from any source of light. Erasure [300CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Erasure allows the user to cancel out the Quirk of anyone they look at. When Erasure is activated, the user is able to disable a person's Quirk Factor until they close their eyes. Shota only needs one part of the target's body to be within his sights for Erasure to take effect. Since most people in the world rely on Quirks for combat purposes, this makes you an extremely bothersome opponent for anyone to deal with. In addition, as shown at the start of Tamaki Amajiki's fight with Toya Setsuno, Soramitsu Tabe and Yu Hojo, Erasure can be activated on multiple targets at once, and stays in effect even if the user looks elsewhere, as long as their eyes stay open. Due to your nature as a jumper you can extend this ability to any type of biological enhancement such as an X-gene. Warp Gate [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) This quirk allows you to generate warp portals allowing you to teleport to various locations. The amount and size of the portals will depend on your skill and endurance. Optionally you may transform your body into a misty form similar to Kurogiri. Otherwise by default you will simply gain the ability to create portals. Decay [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) The power is capable of rapidly decaying anything the user attacks causing it to crumble to dust. Whether the target is organic or not, Decay will work without fail. As such, this Quirk is extremely lethal against living beings, having their flesh rot away if hit by it. The speed of the disintegration has developed from slow to almost immediate, eventually spreading through their whole body if a victim doesn't amputate the decaying body part (Eraser Head was able to avoid this by erasing Decay before it could cause further damage to his flesh). It is also possible for the effect of Decay to spread beyond what the user has touched, creating a domino chain of disintegrated victims. At the peak shown so far it is possible to decay an entire hospital and everyone inside at once, even spreading to affect an entire city. The user can also prevent decay from affecting something if they don’t wish to target it. Overhaul [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) This quirk allows you to manipulate and control matter. This can be used to rearrange and alter anything you are touching. Once the user takes a target apart, he has the option of either leaving it destroyed, restoring it to its original form or shaping it into something new. This process happens instantly and is effective on living and nonliving things alike. The user only needs one finger to make contact with something for his Quirk to activate, with the choice of whether Overhaul should affect only one select part of his target or its entirety being left solely to the user's wishes. The user can recombine two different objects or beings into a single entity that possesses components of both subjects (including Quirks). This is performed by holding both elements they want to merge with each separate hand. It's possible for a combined entity to further transform as well, as long as the user merges it with additional objects. If Overhaul is utilized on a person, it can heal any injuries or ailments they once had by reconstructing them to a biologically perfect state. This can be used mid battle to essentially give the user a healing factor. Cremation [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) The user can ignite blue fire anywhere on their body with minimal effort or movement almost instantaneously. They can also combust anything they touch almost instantly, including robust minerals and living creatures alike. For example, by touching a single tree in The Beast's Forest, Dabi was able to set the majority of the forest ablaze, trapping everyone there in a ring of fire. The flames of this Quirk are extremely hot, burning at a temperature of at least 2,000°C (3,632°F), which is higher than that of lava and normal fire, signified by its blue coloration. Dabi's flames were hot enough to burn an entire group of villains into ash in mere seconds. They're also quite bright, making them effective against Dark Shadow. The flames are powered by the user’s emotions, particularly rage, so the greater your anger, the hotter your flames burn. As a final bonus to prevent you from ending up like Dabi your body will be improved to the point that you will be able to safely use the flames. Zombie Virus [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Zombie Virus enables the user to produce a pinkish gas that, when inhaled, temporarily transforms victims into zombies. Those infected gain the endurance of a zombie, increased strength, and the ability to pass along the virus via a bite. If a hero is infected by the gas, they can still use their Quirk and retain aspects of their personality. Their brains' function is a total zero when affected. They also moan and have bluish-gray skin. The only weakness is that normally the user is not immune to it. Meaning that the zombies created can attack and infect the user. Also anyone who has a zombie-like appearance will be ignored by the transformed individuals. For example All Might’s weak form was ignored when the zombies found him during the attack. Super Regeneration [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Super Regeneration grants the user the ability to regenerate any sort of injuries on their body, such as missing limbs, at incredible speeds. It is considered an incredibly rare and dangerous Quirk, thanks to its capabilities of making any of its users near invincible, able to recover from nearly any attack. There are some weaknesses however, the Quirk can not heal injuries that have already been cauterized by the time the Quirk is received or activated. In addition the regeneration can also become null if the user is beaten by their opponent faster than they can regenerate, whether that's through punches, fire, or disintegration. Lastly, if the user's body is not properly prepared, the regeneration process can also become a lot slower as a result. Double [400CP] (Generic MHA Fanfic) Double allowed the user to create a copy of anything, two at a time, through touch. With Double, the user can produce replicas of anyone to provide support in numbers. They do this by creating a dark-coloured, viscous fluid from his hands that forms into the person in question. In order to conceive a perfect clone, you are required to have knowledge of precise measurements and physical features of the person or object he was replicating. Doubles possess the same personality and abilities as the original, making it hard to distinguish them from the real person at a first glance. The copies only recall the memories of the last time they interacted with the user. Also the doubled clones are very weak physically. A single good blow can cause the clones to dissolve. Sharingan [400CP*] (Generic MHA Fanfic) The Sharingan is a powerful dojutsu possessed by the Uchiha clan. Purchasing this grants you it and optimally you may receive their bloodline. The main abilities it gives the user are the ability to see chakra, powerful perception, skill in illusion techniques, and the ability to instantly learn anything they observe. This does not extend to copying other abilities, but skills such as martial arts are an example of what can be learned. This is what you receive for choosing the 400QP option. Mangekyo Sharingan: The 600QP option will evolve your eyes into the Mangekyo Sharingan. These possess similar abilities to the normal version, but to an enhanced degree. In addition it grants the user some powerful new abilities. There will be two unique powers based on the Individual such as Amaterasu, Kotoamatsukami, or Tsukuyomi. You may choose the two abilities or allow them to be generated based on your unique capabilities. This would also allow for the possibility of a new ability to emerge. Lastly they will gain access to Susanoo. This is both an incredibly powerful offensive and defensive ability. The only restriction is that without the Eternal Mangekyo, using these unique abilities will eventually lead to blindness if overused. To gain the Eternal Mangekyo you must either take the eyes of a blood relative ideally a sibling who also possesses the Mangekyo or purchase the option below. If they aren't in the right crossover world the first option may be impossible. Eternal Mangekyo: The Eternal Mangekyo is offered for an additional 200QP for a total of 800QP. This will allow you to use your abilities to the fullest without worrying about blindness. You may also select an additional unique ability for your eyes. If those still aren’t enough then there are two more options. First you can pay for additional Mangekyou abilities including custom ones for 200QP each. Rinnegan: Second, you may choose to receive the Rinnegan instead for 1000QP. This will not grant you the abilities of the Sharingan, but offers its own unique powers. There will be a link in the notes providing detailed information on the Rinnegans' powers. Rinne Sharingan: Third, is the final option, should you purchase both sets of abilities then you may merge them into the Rinne Sharingan. To merge them you would need to buy them separately for a total of 1800QP. This will allow you to utilize all of the powers possessed by both eyes. In addition the abilities will be enhanced in strength even further. Lastly this will grant the user access to techniques such as Infinite Tsukuyomi and allow the user to travel to a personal pocket dimension. If you do not possess chakra then this ability will be powered by your stamina or any other energy sources you possess. (Editor’s Note: I’ve removed the bonus of Multi-Quirk allowing you to have multiple of their abilities such as Stands for balancing at this price. The High-End perk will let you have this perk for free. Also all Quirks will be considered genetic abilities, as such will be classified as such rather than just abilities. Sharingan can, if you wish, be considered not a quirk.)",

You will not age past your prime. Even with the decline through history there are those who act as living legacies today. This gift was not restricted to the ruling class, even some slaves within the empire such as Ab-Leshal and Qayin carry this blessing (but perhaps view it as a curse). Depending on your preferences, many of your descendants might live on into modern times as adherents to your ancient philosophy and culture. Blood ties offer great power in any magic you have, so you can use descendants as relays for any of your spells. Geomancy, herbomancy, animancy... the daevites used many magics but none without the key ingredient: blood. You may not have magic yet, but even still there’s power in the blood. Spilling the blood of foes as part of an attack empowers the next. Offering your own blood (or that of sacrifices) in a ritual empowers it greatly. Ritual sacrifice is enough to allow some level of necromancy even if you’re an untalented thaumaturge. Whatever action you undertake, the more blood the better.",

      "description": "Like mentioned in the beginning, humans aren’t the only species in this world and now due to the experiments done to copy the sealed beast and make the Books like Serpent you have been changed by them. Unlike Serpent you're not naturally a book and instead a human turned into a Book Entity, similar to the original beast in a way. What this does is give you several abilities and forms. First of all you now have 3 base forms you can switch between at will, a purely human form with will typically be who you where before becoming a book entity, a Book form with is effectively just normal book made of paper, metal and leather work for an intricate design that evokes who you are, though the book form can’t move on its own, it can perceive the world around it and is roughly 200 times more durable than it should be even with the weakest part of your book form the paper is actually a metallic paper composite as flexible and textured like real paper but as durable as titanium even before the durability boost. Lastly you have a beast form which will initially be a form that is beastly yet evocative of your own personality though typically having a set of wings and second set of arms. You can change your form at will somewhat but your default beast form is what you start with and will instinctively be one you are comfortable with. The beast form isn’t as powerful or large as Serpent when he’s freed but you can grow over time and by feeding overtime to match and even exceed the beast that started the Apocalypses scale. You’d only be the size of a 2 story building at first but like I said that can change. Your abilities will seem to scale to your size as well so people will be shocked at you being as fast as you are strong when in beast form. Now for abilities, you first gain the ability to absorb beings into you and break them down entirely into information and power which allows you to improve as well as gain all their powers, skills and abilities added onto your own as well as increase your size proportional to the absorbs strength and your own(Any entity not stronger than 10% your full power). It only took Serpent 666 normal humans to be free and the size of a multistory building. Unlike Serpent you have the unique capability of expending energy to release those you have absorbed, temporarily weakening you to before you absorbed them(for a few hours), but also freeing them to live their own lives again as if you had effectively destroyed everything that made them who they are. You have no limits to how long you can wait to revive someone only if you have absorbed them and are willing. (Editor’s Note: There is a few more paragraphs about this perk in its original Jump.)",

Since its primary function is to make whoever it infects into a Kishin, the Black Blood induces insanity in the person who is infected by it. This insanity varies, and your specific insanity is of your choice and can be anything from demented euphoria to hearing constant \"tempting\" voices in your head. A Black Blood bearer can mitigate these effects a great deal with enough willpower and/or help though. If a person manages to control the Black Blood, he/she has full control of the abilities the unique substance offers. One of these supernatural properties is that it can hyperdensify at the user's will, allowing them basically form an incredibly durable armor right under their skin. This \"solidifying\" ability can quickly seal open wounds and heal them just as fast. Any of the bearer's blood outside the body can also be mentally controlled, hyperdensified, sharpened and projected at enemies as a form of counter attack. Do note that none of these secondary abilities are automatic and, while exceedingly difficult, the bearer can still be hurt or even killed when they are, especially if targeted by attacks that ignore physical defenses and directly target the soul like Soul Menace.",

It is something that will look, cosmetically at least, inhuman, and will possess slightly superhuman physical capabilities in all regards, being somewhat stronger, faster, and more agile than a human with somewhat improved senses or one greatly improved sense perhaps it can smell like a dog, echolocate like a bat, or see and hear a wider range of wavelengths/frequencies. Your immune system will be better, you will have more stamina, you will be able to survive more damage, etc. While your cognitive and mental abilities are not improved by this, in all physical regards other than cognitive capabilities of the brain you are improved over human, and over whatever race(s) you purchased here. It may also incorporate elements from any other alt-forms you possess, combining any and all of them (even mechanical ones with biological ones or mixing undead and living forms; somehow they will mix to function properly). As with races purchased here you will also see a small improvement to all physical capabilities; if you’re not particularly fit you might fall behind a top tier athlete, but with generally equal training your physical capabilities are noticeably better. If a body part is needed for an ability - i.e. if it has a core that it can regenerate from or winged flight - you still must have the body part, the final form will look distinctly inhuman, and your size cannot be significantly smaller than your smallest alt-form or larger than your larget, but beyond that you may customize this alt-form as you see fit, and may change it at the start of each new jump. Capstone Boosted: w/ Harbinger of the End - Thing from Beyond: You possess the ability to rapidly change your form, growing or altering your limbs and flesh as needed. This tends towards more monstrous changes - looking like an ordinary human or animal while using this ability is difficult, and imitating a specific individual likely impossible - and you are limited in overall mass to your normal mass, though as you kill and expand this power through Harbinger of the End you may add to your mass, and even store away your increased supply of mass, growing in size, or ability to sprout new limbs and structures. Normal appendages - tentacles, claws, teeth, organs you’d already have - are easy to grow, as are any parts of your various alt-forms though they will generally have an uncanny and unnatural look to them when mixing them from multiple sources, though it might be possible for you, with difficulty, to grow something that you designed yourself if you had the biological knowledge to do so. This shapeshifting ability also allows you to change the exact makeup of the form granted by the base perk within the perk’s limits; this change isn’t instant, and the time will vary based on breadth of changes (changing skin tone will be quicker than growing to daikaiju size while making yourself a cyborg by mixing a robot alt-form in that), but it is doable.",

But for a few people, it breaks their resolve completely and utterly, drowning them in despair until they simply hyper-fixate on a single desire of theirs.

Perhaps for a certain fee we could make you have gone through this process, but not lose your mind (at least not, from Distorting). A chef desiring to bring new flavors to his failing restaurant might gain the ability to pull the thoughts from people's minds and cook them into delicious ones, more ready to appreciate his work. A gunman who lost faith in humanity might gain the ability to test people by firing bullets that force the victim to relive their trauma, and will surely destroy them if they fail to overcome it. A lonely photographer, shaken by the thought that none may remember them, might gain the ability to draw in and take photos of people that slowly cause all their connections to wither away along with their will to live. An aspiring professional pianist... well, you’re not getting power on his scale just yet, but suffice to say, the Distortion can cause all sorts of calamities regardless of the original focus. As you feed deeper into your despair and fulfill the one remaining desire left, you will gain more and more esoteric abilities, as well as the ability to warp the very scenery around you into a representation of your mindset.

But when we’re talking about spiritually enhanced parasites, or cursed ridden diseases...the consequences of such an “experience” generally isn’t anything pleasant at all. Thankfully though, you have a leg up on most folks as far as handling these unpleasant circumstances go, and something that might normally take a person’s life will have a distinctively reduced effect on yours. Keep in mind, you’ll still probably notice if there are worms latched onto your skin, but the speed at which they can spread or the damage that they can cause to your body will be far reduced. Without the effects necessarily looming over your head like a reaper’s sickle, you’ll find that you can draw a fair bit of strength from them – especially if these external nuisances happen to possess some measure of life force. Though we can’t speak for other places, there are some parasites here which can feed off of your life force – well now you can return the favour, and use their life force as strength. In a way, you’re turning parasitism into symbiosis really. Just be wary though, normally having one parasite is already bad enough if you can tolerate it – if your body becomes burdened with far too many parasites, curses, or other harmful influences, it is very likely that your body will be overwhelmed nonetheless. The moment your resistance breaks down...well there’ll be nothing to hold the other maladies back. If you are going to harbour some afflictions, you should at least ensure that they don’t grow out of check.",

Walking through the world is enough to cause plants to rot, water to be befouled and the weak to grow sick and die. This evil presence has also translated into powers of warping the world around you, allowing you to twist people into terrifying monsters and defile the world around you into a hellish landscape.

Your power right now is limited, you are naught but a baby after all, but in time it will begin to grow.

By some quirk of your biology, you are immensely durable. The shells of a fleet of battleships would do little more than enrage you. 300,000 volts of electricity is nothing more than an irritant. You are all but immune to most conventional weaponry(that would exist in the 50’s.) Atomic Abomination [600CP] (Gojira) The atom. One of the most fundamental building blocks for nearly all that is. Humanity thought it could harness this power, control this power, weaponize this power. Sadly, they were right. You’ve absorbed immense amounts of radiation from the nuclear testing that has occured in the world above water. This has left you even more deadly than before. You’ve mutated. You now produce a large amount of radiation in a field around you. This amount of radiation is enough to give people severe radiation poisoning very quickly(You may toggle this field.) You are also able to breathe this radiation out as superheated extremely radioactive mist. More than just this, your physiology is incredibly odd. If you ever find yourself inundated with large amounts of energy, that you are able to survive, your body may take it in and begin to produce it in small amounts.",

      "description": "Adaptive Camouflage [200CP] (Jurassic Park Books) A rather terrifying ability that some of the dinosaurs such as the Raptors and Carnotaurs possess is adaptive camouflage. This ability is very similar to a chameleon's ability, only much more terrifying. This camouflage allows the user to actively mimic their environment to the point of invisibility. The only way to see through it is rapid changes in light such as turning a flood light on and off rapidly. This would disrupt the camouflage as their bodies attempt to rapidly adapt. Purchasing this perk grants you this ability. We Had to Fill the Gaps [200CP] (Jurassic Park Books) As you may already know most of the dinosaurs required modern DNA to completely restore their DNA. This had some unforeseen effects granting them unique abilities. Each time you take this you may select one natural ability belonging to any animal that exists within this jump or any of your previous jumps. The only requirement is that this ability must be biological. This means that choosing the ability to breathe through your skin is acceptable, but choosing any technological abilities would not. This can be purchased multiple times if you want to gain additional abilities. Multiple purchases will be discounted to dinosaurs. The Deadliest Predator Known to Man [600CP] (Jurassic Park Books) Dinosaurs are considered to be some of the most dangerous to ever live. You are a deadly specimen even when compared to other dangerous species of dinosaurs. You were practically built for combat and possess a number of advantages making this abundantly clear. First you are significantly larger than a normal member of your kind. This bulk can provide a significant edge on its own. Second, you will gain powerful authority over other members of your kind. They will be subservient to you and willing to obey any command even if it seems suicidal. Lastly, is the mentioned combat upgrades. All of your combat features such as teeth, claws, your tail, and any other weapon you possess will become deadlier. For example your claws will be noticeably sharper than other members of your species.",

      "description": "Nobody Knows [400CP] (SCP Foundation) Abyss Physiology You’re a void. When one gazes into the abyss, the abyss has a way of gazing back. You are keenly aware of anyone observing you. This is effective for in-person interaction as well as through any form of surveillance. Even notes they take or strong thoughts they have about you can’t be kept secret. Being perceived by someone lets you immediately understand by what method they’re watching you, and it provides information as if you were present with them. You are not present with them, just able to view details as if you were. Even something as small as being thought about gives you a means to investigate your observers. No matter the circumstances when you’re noticed, you notice. But that’s not all. Even those watching your current moment from past or future can be noticed. The more people consciously aware of you, the more tangible you become. This doesn’t give raw power, but improves overall extent of your abilities. Range and area grow, to the point enough people paying attention from other areas will let you act there. Pattern-Screamer [600CP] (SCP Foundation) “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.” You are not. You are not real. You are a figment, a pattern that can be spotted in voids due only to human cognition creating patterns where none exist. Despite this, you hear. You feel. You think. You scream. Though no longer burdened by non-existence you still benefit from it. You may not exist but you can still interact with the world at your full power. Since you don’t exist nothing real can harm you. Some things can still be perceived as harming you (at least by sapient minds), if that’s to your benefit. In the same way these real things can be perceived as benefiting you and you can elect to keep any benefits you might otherwise miss out on by not being real. In the end though, reality can’t forcibly exert effects on unreality. You have to accept it for the real forces to interact with you. Both physical and conceptual attacks are unable to cause any tangible change on you. Only paradoxical and abstract sources of harm pose any danger to you.

Many Husks have adapted to their punishments in this manner. Stalkers for instance have shifted and warped limbs to suit carrying heavy loads while their skin and muscles have dried to allow them to contact the Greed Layer’s searing gold dust without combusting. You too now share this adaptive trait. A long time spent on a searing hot plane may see you able to naturally endure such temperatures, and in the cold what heat you may have may be preserved within, creating a near perfect homeostasis. Perhaps immense time spent running may strengthen and lengthen your legs, or excess time spent chopping trees could nullify the shock from hitting such objects. While not perfect, these adaptations allow you to thrive where others may shrivel and die. Supreme Form [400CP] (ULTRAKILL) It seems your form as a Husk has been massively upscaled. A form representative of those remembered for thousands of years after their deaths. You tower over buildings, bringing a watchful gaze to the layers you inhabit. Your strength is that to shatter skyscrapers, even demonic parasites that may refuge in your now enormous form bend to your immense will, providing numerous ways of bringing great amounts of Hell Energy to bear for those who might oppose you. Only the Angels might threaten to bring you down now, or the swiftest among machines able to nimbly dodge past your earth shattering strikes and movements. This is the true strength of a ruler, but whether you aim to be that of a peaceful guiding hand or a force to be reckoned with is up to you. Prime Soul [600CP] (ULTRAKILL) This is... rare. Feared, in fact. As it is known, Husks are translations of the damned’s soul into physical form. But some particular souls are so powerful that they no longer need a vessel to manifest physically, forming themselves from pure will and the power of their own soul. Such beings are extremely powerful, and you now find yourself among them. This is the power that brought fear even to the Angels, who seek to prevent the formation of these at all costs. While you may be smaller than the likes of a ‘Supreme’ Husk, you are like a condensed sun in terms of the power you can bring to bear. Movements fast enough to seem like teleportation, strength enough to rend apart great demons and angels alike, manipulation of hell energy adept enough to cause your bolts to move with immense speed and tracking, and all with the constant will of a man possessed by purpose. Your very presence invites the Angels to act, but let them come and break themselves upon your will. Show them the true potential of mankind.",

The sight of you normally drives most humans insane but with great amounts of time, you’ve learnt the subtle ways of altering that. You’re able to control the effects your looks have on others, even without actually changing your appearance. Despite appearing to be the same monster as normal, you won’t need to break the minds of those that see you unless you want to. You could even make yourself look non-threatening despite being the hideous creature you are. From Beyond The Stars [400CP] (Saya no Uta) Your species isn’t just some random predatory race. They’ve become incredibly advanced in the study of biotechnology and even as an average member of that species, you can do things far beyond the understanding of human beings. You have superhuman mental capabilities, many times beyond any human, and have the ability to alter and twist the flesh of any biological being that you touch. This body warping is quite slow, taking a few minutes to heal most wounds and several hours to cause total body changes but there are few limits provided you have the time and requisite biomass to make the changes you like. Perhaps you could even forcibly convert some humans to be new members of your own species. Dandelion [600CP] (Saya no Uta) Those of your race were originally meant to be seeded onto new worlds and to spread the species further through the act of childbirth, turning their entire bodies into new members of the alien race by spreading an infectious spore across the world. You share that ability, though at a more controlled level, allowing you to turn parts of your body into spores that you are able to sense through and can interact with anything the spores touch as if they were touching your body. If you have the ability to alter the flesh of those you touched, for instance, you would be able to alter the bodies of any in contact with your spores. Your spores can spread over great distances, even hundreds of kilometres, but without changes you make on your own you will have little control over their direction. Converting large parts of your body would create a significant amount of spores but strangely enough, beings of your race that become pregnant are able to create vastly more spores because of that.",

The flood was a success and all Nephilim perished in it, yet their spirits remained on Earth unable to interact with the physical world on their own, but able to possess animals and men alike to use as tools to do their bidding. These spirits would no longer be referred to as Nephilim and instead they would be called Demons. When possessing a human or animal body apart from fully controlling the body you can passively torment their existence, like some sort of parasite, capable of cursing your host with sickness, paranoia, madness, lack of senses like blindness or deafness, suicidal behavior, leper and other sorts of painful and tormenting ailments or simply speak with them. When controlling your host completely you can grant them strength above normal men, making them capable of resisting a couple of strong men trying to restrain them. While normally you would be wrong in thinking that every human soul will be an open house, that you can freely and easily enter, you have enough power to possess most humans with a big exception on those who are completely good at heart. Likewise the words of God will pull you away from the body of your host, burning into your spiritual form; but you are strong enough to need hundreds of men praying, a high ranking angel or a Messiah. In future jumps the words of God will be replaced by prayers/spells or other holy beings.",

There is some kind of parasitic plant/creature/concept nested in your body, and the sticky little bastard does not want to leave. But good news now! It has a vested interest in you staying alive until… Well, staying alive for a while longer, suffice it to say. So from now on, anytime you would be put in danger due to not paying attention (distracted, unaware, asleep), your friendly little bodymate will briefly take control and help you avoid the hazard! Thankfully, it only takes control in this and no other situations. Definitely. One of Us [200CP] (Generic Analog Horror) So, you’re infected. That’s the bad news. The good news is you’re not the only one, and people tend to be sympathetic about these things. From now on, anyone who is considered by the general populace to be “corrupted”, “monstrous”, or “infected” by something will just let you go about your business unless you draw a lot of attention. Titans will assume you’re short, mysterious beings that your mutation was relatively benign, and zombies that you haven’t gotten, uhhh… “ripe”, yet. This only works if being one of them would reasonably prevent aggression, however, and ceases applying when you’re aggressive back. Cohabitation [400CP] (Generic Analog Horror) You want to know what sucks? Having the flu. You want to know what double-sucks? Having a head-cold and the flu. So we decided to prevent both! From now on, so long as you are infected by your little friend, anything else that tries to invade your body is getting some good old fashioned Southern Hospitality, and by that we mean it is not surviving long. Viruses, bacteria, corrupted mana, poison, parasites of a different breed: nothing, and we mean nothing, is getting to you. Mire In Misery [600CP] (Generic Analog Horror) We’ll warn you now, we’ve officially crossed the threshold for what is considered anything close to “safe” science. It’s not a question of “if” anymore but “why”, why we decided to make this perk, why we thought it was a good idea, why we were somehow allowed by the powers that be to create this abomination. Anyway, we’ve created viral airborne disadvantages. At the beginning of each jump, select up to 600 CP worth of disadvantages which form the infection: these disadvantages are now the symptoms of a virus that can be spread selectively through touch or blood. Your companions are immune, and we should really stress that it only spreads to someone else from you when you choose to spread it. Because that would be a complete disaster otherwise, right? (Editor’s Note: Drawbacks can be found in the Generic Analog Horror Jump, and some more details about the Mire In Misery perk can be found at the bottom of the jump. If the Anomaly Drawback is used in the creation of the virus, the perks One of Us, Cohabitation, and Mire In Misery will be capstone boosted. Do be warned that the Anomalous Alterations can be overwhelming. Also while there isn’t any customization for the thing possibly granted by the Shared Occupancy perk, you can go ahead and just come up with one.)",

You can metabolise almost any organic material; there are no evolutionary ‘mistakes’ in your form like vestigial parts you have no use for or allergic reactions that might kill you; your internal reserves (such as internal stores of energy or oxygen) are kept more efficiently and are used much more wisely, allowing you to hibernate for long periods in hostile conditions. This structural perfection greatly enhances your durability and environmental tolerances; meaning it’ll take a lot more bullets to gun you down. Eyeless Stare [400CP] (AVP) Even without any visible visual organs, the Xenomorph maintains a constant awareness of its surroundings. Your non-visual senses – hearing, scent, detecting vibrations etc. – are all heightened to the point where you can identify individuals by scent or follow someone from the vibrations of their footsteps on the ground.

Metamorphosis [600CP] (AVP) The facehugger is the smallest of the Xenomorph’s life cycles, but is perhaps the most feared for its singular purpose. You gain a facehugger altform, and when you use this form to infect someone with a Xenomorph embryo, you are transferred to the embryo, and the expended shell of the facehugger dies in the transferal process. You will then gestate inside the host – the exact gestation period is roughly a half-day, but varies considerably – until you mature as a chestburster, and erupt through the chest of your victim. During the gestation period, you are more or less helpless, but will acquire a number of biological traits of the host to serve you well as an adult drone. As your chestburster form matures over the course of another day – the speed depending how much nutrition is available to consume – you will finally become an adult Xenomorph drone, a hybrid, combining the various traits of Xenomorphs – chiefly, the type of Xenomorph you picked as your species - and the host’s species, which becomes a new altform for you. You might find your new drone form has acquired tremendous strength after gestating within a particularly strong host, or has acquired unusual new mutations like wings or venom, or a genetic memory or hunting instincts if those traits were coded into the DNA of your host. If you wish, you may develop into a type of Xenomorph lower on the hierarchy than your original xenomorph form. These hybrid traits are inheritable by your spawn.",

Regardless you can easily kill a mortal man should they be unprepared. Hybrid [200CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity) Usually the only way to become a demon-human hybrid is for a human to be possessed by a demon, which usually transforms the body into a horrific monstrosity. However you have fused almost seamlessly with a human host. You will have the abilities of a Lesser Demon while still possessing a human body. But due to your corrupting influence there will be a minor demonic flaw on your human disguise such as 3rd eye, fangs, or dimly glowing red eyes. Greater Demon [400CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity) You now possess a demonic form akin to power to beings such as Malphas or Alu. You will possess supernatural strength, constitution, and demonic magical ability. Unfortunately at this power your pool of potential vessels (should you be exorcized) has been reduced. You will require an exceptionally strong willed host such as a priest to maintain permanence in the material world. While you still can possess regular humans they will not be able to handle your demonic influence long. THE UNSPEAKABLE [800CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity) The greatest form of demon that exists besides perhaps the Antichrist themself. Your form is completely indescribable beyond a massive ball of writhing flailing limbs and a massive bloodshot eye. As a demonic deity you are nigh-unkillable by non divine means (It would take a small nuke to kill you for reference). Your strength is near undepletable in both physicality and magic. However this power limits your methods of returning to the physical world should you be exercised. No human body can contain the entirety of your power and in order to enter into the material world you must pass through a host who has succeeded in the rite of second death.",

      "description": "Klyntar Symbiote [200CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes) This is what you’re here for, you have your very own Klyntar Symbiote. It starts relatively weak, able to make an ordinary human slightly stronger than Spider-Man with proportionate enhancements to speed, healing, and toughness, as well as the ability to generate a handful of thick tentacles or dozens of thinner tendrils for a variety of purposes. Your symbiote can produce fangs and claws as well, as well as simple melee weapons like blades or bludgeons. Additionally, your other both feeds on and sustains you: As long as you’re bonded, you can go without food and water indefinitely and your symbiote can exchange oxygen with the environment for you and recycle the CO2 you produce back into oxygen, letting you breathe underwater, go without having to manually breathe if need be, and last months without breathing at all in a pinch. Your symbiote can protect you from all but the strongest of supernatural diseases, can help regulate your body chemistry, and slows your aging to a crawl. However, it can’t keep you alive forever and is highly vulnerable to extreme heat and loud noises. A heat wave or a fireworks show isn’t going to do more than make it uncomfortable, but anything legitimately dangerous is far more so to it. The good news, however, is that heat is pretty much the only way to kill it, barring exotic effects. This perk can be freely merged with other perks representing symbiotic entities attached to your body unless such a perk has an import fee. Finally, you gain access to the following Perks while bonded to your symbiote, though upgrades must be purchased for the listed price and you are permitted to opt out of ones you don’t want or need. Grendelkin [400CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes) Your symbiote isn’t a modern one. Yours is an offshoot of an ancient and primordial Symbiote Dragon. While an ordinary symbiote would make a normal human a match for Spider-Man, yours makes one a worthy foe to an entire team of superhumans and able to one-on-one briefly with the likes of Thor and The Hulk. While it can still be killed by fire, it’s not particularly vulnerable to it. and sound hurts it if and only if it’s a specific frequency that is especially harmful to symbiotes. Additionally, you can manifest wings powerful enough to allow for winged flight at many times your running speed. In general, there are only two things that can kill your symbiote: Extreme heat and light-aligned cosmic or mystical energy. However, the trade-off for this power is an increased vulnerability to electrical attacks. This also serves as a Capstone Booster. Supreme Talent [400CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes) Symbiotes can feed on magic, but they also empower it. Especially dark magic. Any spells you cast are at least twice as powerful as they’d otherwise be, while any magical enhancements you possess are magnified to a similar degree by the presence of your symbiotes. Any energy you use to fuel these spells goes further as well, being twice as efficient in usage. This goes double for anything that would be considered “dark” magic. Red Slayer [600CP] (Marvel Comics: Symbiotes) A Cult of Chthon found a prophecy within their copy of The Darkhold describing a Red Slayer who would assist in Chthon’s emergences into this reality. Right next to a detailed drawing of Carnage. Drawing the logical conclusion, they sacrificed him and he was then revived with enhanced powers by the Darkhold. These enhanced powers included not only being able to mass replicate his symbiote to take over and empower others but resistance to fire and sonics strong enough to negate the symbiote race’s normal vulnerability. You too have been touched by Chthon’s power, and your symbiote gains the same effects when bonded to you. Note: Your symbiote doesn’t have to be red. Capstone Booster: Carnage didn’t lose that upgrade when he and Chthon had a parting of ways, and when he became Knull’s Avatar, Knull’s power had a synergistic effect and a touch of Knull’s power resides in your symbiote. You could generate enough offshoots to empower or control thousands of people over an area the size of Manhattan and your resistance to fire and sonics is great enough that you could shrug off a point-blank blast of literal Hellfire from Mephisto’s heir. You could even bond your offshoots to corpses, as long as there are at least most of the bones left, to create zombies under your control with the memories and personalities of the original. (Editor’s Note: I’ve decided that you can get the Klyntar Symbiote perk both here and in the freebie section. However, buying it here will let you spend an additional 200CP exclusively on the other Symbiote perk additions on the Jump. Basing the pricing off the Symbiosis companion option from the original Jumpchain. Now if you do buy the symbiote, there are additional free addons you can take if you wish, just go on the jump. As well as paid additions, though that's for you to decide. The Grendelkin perk is a capstone booster for 600CP perks of the Jump. And all other perks here are meant to be effective only if you so happened to possess/purchase a symbiote of your own.)",

The 72 terrible demons that would together form a demon of unimaginable power, who could act as an instrument of Solomon’s will. But the demon was never truly ordered to act, certainly not for humanity’s sake, and as the 72 demons were forced to watch their creator do nothing to aid the suffering humanity around them, they grew to despise their king. Their hearts burned to help humanity and once Solomon died, they possessed his corpse and decided that they would make a new destiny for mankind. But what if something changed? What if, this time, there were 73 Demon Pillars created by King Solomon. A 0 th Demon intended to rule over the rest, give them agency as a collective and unite them together. That would be you, the first and greatest of the demonic collective. You are now a collective being, a hivemind of 73 separate existences, each a unique and mighty demon. When together, your power is terrifying indeed. That combined body could blast it’s way through entire countries with physical force and do much the same with magical power. Each of the demons within you also has a unique mind, personality and magical powers or focus, allowing each part of you to bring something to the table. The Pillars are quite loyal to you and believe that you are their rightful leader, though their sometimes vastly different personalities may still mean that getting everyone to agree on courses of action and work together at their best is very hard. Still, your nature as a hivemind means that communication, even lengthy debates between all 73 parts, happens near instantly. The pillars can be split off from the whole of you, though that will prevent the collective from utilising the portion of your power that they represent, but they may then act independently while keeping in mental contact with the rest of you. Should they be slain or destroyed, they will slowly regenerate with you, so long as you still live. As long as one of the pillars remains alive, the others can be resurrected in time, including yourself. The more pillars remain, the faster this is, lost aspects of the hive appearing at one of the other still living pillars. It is possible, with extremely powerful or advanced magic, to permanently destroy and kill pillars. (Editor’s Note: I’ve changed the price from 800CP to 1600CP.

Through some truly terrible rituals and events, you have been shaped into becoming the perfect vessel and master of that very concept. You are All The World’s Evils. And because of your nature, maybe not just this world either. As the incarnated form of the concept of evil for this world, you gain many abilities. The core trait of this is the ability to transform yourself into a vile black and red mud-like substance.This black mud is the physical form of all the sins that make up your being. It is able to drive all but the greatest of men mad in seconds of contact and can be used to defile and corrupt other beings, turning them into blackened versions of themselves and ensuring their loyalty to your great evil. You can rapidly produce this mud, enough to cover the entire world in just days, and the amount and speed with which you can produce it will grow as the amount of evil and sin in the world you are in does, as well as each new world you go to afterwards. You can freely control this mud all around the world and possess awareness through it, even shaping it into fleshy structures and beings or turning it into animated shadow, such beings of flesh or shadow being immensely powerful in their own right. As well, so long as evil and sin continues to exist as a concept in your current world, you will be unable to die or be destroyed. Your mud will be destroyed...and then begin to reappear quite quickly. With time, you may even learn how to draw forth your dark substance from within the hearts of those who sin. As your nature is that of Evil itself, you will find that you are unaffected by abilities that are purely evil, as well as being able to effortlessly control or enhance such things when you use them for yourself. You can reach into the hearts of those around you and manipulate any darkness that you might find there, making it easy to tempt heroes into becoming monsters and making you all that much stronger.

The second purchase gets your limbs as long as Mommy Long Legs. Bigger Bodies Initiative [200CP] (Poppy Playtime) You are unnervingly bigger than most other specimens of your type, if you are a toy, you are human-sized or slightly bigger than one. If you are a human, you are around 7-9 feet in height with a muscular body type. This can also apply to future races or forms, if you are however bigger than a human, your size gains a minor boost, otherwise, if you are of a smaller race you can adjust it to human size…unless you don’t want to for whatever reason you might have. Extra Parts [400CP] (Poppy Playtime) You don’t actually need any of those bodily organs, to be clear you may still have blood and organs, but they're essentially dead weight and just occupy space inside of you. You don’t need to breathe, blood is just there as an optional lubricant and doesn’t carry any necessary life processes, though you can also decide not to have any blood or organs at all in the first place and instead be filled with something like stuffing or just empty space. This also means that you do not suffer from “critical hits”, you cannot be one-shot in the head for example. But you can still be destroyed of course with enough of your body being crushed, torn, etc. A True Monster [400CP] (Poppy Playtime) You have the power to alter your form to be far more frightening than you were ever meant to be, as I very much doubt the razor-sharp teeth were ever intended for Huggy to have, although some do have the potential to do it naturally like Mommy’s finger stretching. Basically, you can shift your form to look very horrific, and can massively inspire fear and panic in your target, even if the target is fearless or simply too stupid to be afraid, this will at least cause them to flinch back at the mere sight of you. Expect a ton of screams when you utilize this perk, you also can choose what changes happen to you, otherwise, the form you take will typically be what the intended target/s would find scary. A Supernatural Toy [600CP] (Poppy Playtime) You as a toy, or an experimented human, have a unique ability about you, this can range from horrifying steel-bashing strength, unnatural body parts that can stretch in meters, or simply being able to attach other parts of things onto yourself with no negative consequences. You can think of any other ability, the only limit is the fact it has to in some form make sense, no matter if it is illogical or not, like how “Huggy is built to give strong hugs” or “Mommy is made up of Stretchable Plastic”. You also gain a few minor things alongside this, stronger strength, durability, better control of your limbs and senses, etc, though minor compared to the full thing.

      "description": "Abominable Transformation [300CP] (Darkest Dungeon) “The man is slave to the beast, and the beast is slave to the moon.” Through twisted experiment or daemonic possession your body may undergo a stressful transformation into a half-beast, half-man creature. Like the Abomination the decision to transform is yours- barring the onset of madness- but although the act itself will actually heal minor wounds, the transformation may incur stress not only on yourself but on any compatriots who witness the monstrous shifting of flesh and muscle. Luckily, you may also partially transform while retaining your mostly human body in order to defend yourself, which is far less taxing. The form you take on when fully transformed will be similar to that of the Abomination, featuring rending claws, teeth and inhuman strength, as well as caustic bile- the differences, if any, being limited to cosmetics. If you purchase one of the seven “disease” perks below you will have the opportunity to design an entirely new form, with its own set of benefits and demerits. Just be aware that, regardless of form, the superstitious souls of the Hamlet may not be too happy about your presence here- and those of a religious sort may even refuse to adventure alongside you entirely. Should you wish, you may also choose to make your “transformed” state permanent instead- this will eliminate the penalties related to transforming, but you will lose the ability to take on a different form for the duration of the Jump. Needless to say that being stuck as a monster will do little to endear you to those who distrust or hate your kind, too. Raised Dead [200CP] (Darkest Dungeon) “Back across the Styx- Boatman be damned!” Intelligent undead are not unheard of; the Necromancers who haunt the Ruins are but one example. Even the skeletons have those among them who are capable of more strategic thinking. And, through some foul necromantic ritual- similar to what was done to give the Necromancers their eternal unlife- you have been raised from the dead with your intelligence intact. Though, unlike most undead you feel no enmity towards the living that you did not possess in life. More similar to a ghoul than the skeletons that wander the halls your unliving vitality nonetheless makes you far more resilient to physical damage. Bleeding and blight is still a concern, however diseases no longer affect you (though you may still carry them). And while you still require sustenance you do not need to sleep, making you an easy choice to keep watch during the night. However, the downside of being undead is that the Light has become anathema to you. Prayer, meditation, and flagellation offer no relief, and the blessings of those aligned with the Light burn your flesh rather than mend it- if you can even convince the religious to adventure alongside you. Instead you must look to more surgical or eldritch methods of healing during expeditions; thankfully, the fell energies animating you will heal most non-lethal wounds after a week. Though keep in mind that dismemberment, decapitation, organ damage, etc. still count as “deadly” for you despite your undead nature. Fungal Growth [200CP] (Darkest Dungeon) “There is method in the wild corruption here. It bears a form both wretched and malevolent.” A pestilence has spread throughout the nearby woods; a spreading plague of spores and mushrooms that take control of the body, turning living beings into infested ghouls that seek only to propagate the spores further. This parasitic fungal infection would normally be deadly- or would be a fate worse than death, if the poor souls are still alive despite the growths overtaking their body- but as you might expect they’ve taken on a more symbiotic bent after hosting in your flesh. Mushrooms have begun to sprout up across your body, and you’ll soon find that they lessen the effect of poison and disease drastically. Although they won’t provide much more protection than that, you will also gain the ability to unleash a cloud of spores upon your foes- blighting them with the same eldritch fungus, which will have decidedly less friendly immediate effects on their body. Poisoning is the least of what will happen as the spores cloud the air, making it harder for them to see and certainly making them vulnerable as they gasp for untainted air. However, do be careful about friendly fire- the spores you emit aren’t exactly discriminating in terms of who they will infect, and while the mushrooms aren’t immediately lethal they do tend to spread unpredictably- and having one sprout from your face isn’t at all pleasant should your allies inadvertently become infected with your spores. Pelagic Embrace [200CP] (Darkest Dungeon) “At last, wholesome marine life can flourish- if indeed there is such a thing.” One of the terrifying secrets of the fish folk lurking in the cove is that some of their number were not born from the ocean, nor their abyssal matriarch. No, although it is little known- or understood- some of these pelagic beings were once men; twisted in body and mind by the festering bite of one of their fellow fish men. Despite being bitten or otherwise infected in a different manner the sea’s voice does not call to you, though you’ve still started to undergo some lesser changes. Beneath your first few layers of skin is a silvery scaled membrane, which not only provides a bit of protection from blows but is also resistant to being bled. Gills have appeared somewhere on your body through which you can breathe underwater, and your fingers have contorted into talons strong enough to peel human flesh- and yet are still just human enough to clutch a weapon. However, breathing is harder on the surface than it is in water or in the damp, salty air of the Cove, making it harder to move with as much finesse and speed. This can be mitigated by carrying a supply of salt water to wet your body and gills with, but although free (aside from the cost of flasks) an extra provision may prove troublesome on longer expeditions. You are also more vulnerable to the poisons, acids, and other blights of land due to your physiology. Swine Snout [200CP] (Darkest Dungeon) “Life... the greatest treasure of all.” The Warrens; a festering pit of malevolent flesh and horrific disease, overrun by the Ancestor’s attempts to beckon beings from beyond the Outer Spheres. Somehow, something from this ancient network of tunnels and aqueducts has... changed you. Not mentally, but even now your body has taken on more porcine features. A snout-like nose and an abundance of insulating, protective body fat over thickened muscles are the most obvious changes, but despite your decidedly unhealthy appearance your altered body actually has a fair bit of resistance to toxins and disease- although being bled out might be a bit easier now due to your body’s increased girth. Your weight may also make you less nimble, and the appetite of even a half-swine is far harder to sate than that of most humans- assuming that you’re pickier than they are at mealtime. Crimson Curse [300CP] (Darkest Dungeon) “There is power in the Blood, for those with the fortitude to pay the price.” In the Ancestor’s younger years- before he was committed so earnestly to the excavation of what lay beneath his estate- he threw lavish and decadent parties hosted in the vast expanse of gardens and stone terraces that were so lovingly attended to by his servants. But after a bewitching encounter with a pale beauty the courtyard became host to a different celebration; a wild feast and orgy of blood. Like the nobles he once called his peers, you have contracted the Crimson Curse- a sickness that pulses through your veins, weakening the humors and making it slightly easier to bleed in exchange for advanced speed and a thirst for blood- and particular, the vintage brewed from the progenitor of this plague. Starving yourself of blood will make you waste away and die, but when your cravings are sated you will enter a zealous frenzy, attacking with inhuman strength and speed and resistance to poison and stunning effects as befitting your changed nature. Thankfully, even if your self-control matches that of the Viscount your actions will remain your own. Refracted Husk [300CP] (Darkest Dungeon) “No rest, no peace for this wretched soul.” After the Comet arrived those unfortunate enough to be bathed in its cosmic colors found themselves shattered, and refracted across time and space- made a slave to the Comet’s will, and forced to serve it for all eternity. These unfortunate souls, now only husks of their former selves, have become vessels for the Comet’s power. Even the heroes sent to stem the tide are not safe; those that succumb to madness or death there often return to the Hamlet, gibbering nonsense about cosmic lights and the hateful hues found therein. But as overwhelming as the Comet’s influence may be, there are still some who find the strength to fight its influence- even in the utter depths of its embrace. Consider the poor miller himself; a slave he may be in his twisted unlife, but even he can still recognize the face of his beloved. And Mildred, the woman in question, seems to have retained enough of her sanity to avoid attacking people entirely. And like those two, you have resisted the worst of the Comet’s influence. Caught between life and death, the lights you have seen have revealed many truths to you both great and terrible. As a result, while your mind may be more susceptible to trauma you’ll find that enemies will always fail to escape your notice- no matter how well they hide, so long as they’re close enough to be a threat you will see them. Additionally your encounters with otherworldly energy has made it easier for you to bleed and poison your enemies. Your innards have started to harden, granting you protection from attack but also slowing your movements considerably; your eyes glow with blue, eldritch light thanks to the crystal shards gestating inside of you, though they don’t illuminate much. Eldritch Flesh [300CP] (Darkest Dungeon) “The flesh is fluid! It can be changed, reshaped, remade!” For the cultists who flock to the manor there can be no higher honor than this- to be taken into the warm, tenebrous depths of the earth to emerge changed- and made part of the whole once more. Remade in the Thing’s image, they consider their hideously mutated bodies a blessing- a reminder that madness takes many forms, just as they do. Tumorous pink flesh, tentacles, beady black eyes, protrusions of teeth and bone, and other eldritch additions can be found on their form. And, like them, you have taken up some of these traits yourself. Although still recognizably human overall, you may have teeth-lined tentacles in place of arms, or a mass of them for legs; you may have gained something similar to a scorpion’s tail, injecting the foulest of acids into your prey or possibly launching shards of bone like an organic crossbow. The downsides are few- for you, at least- and in fact, your mind has been hardened greatly. But the sight of your body is so horrific that few townspeople will tolerate your presence- and even those brave enough to accompany you may lose their nerves when they see you fight. (Editor’s Note: Each perk receives a bonus if you purchase or already possess the Abominable Transformation perk. You can check the perks on their original jump if you wish to read what they are.)",

      "description": "This purchase grants you the powers of a devil. All devils can regenerate from anything short of death by drinking blood. The rate at which you regenerate depends on your race, with hybrids having the fastest and fiends the slowest. You can design your general powerset, appearance, and otherwise around your tier or make the choice to sacrifice some aspects for others, such as forgoing the parameter boosts in exchange for more potent abilities. First Tier Devil [100CP] (Chainsaw Man) The first tier allows you to choose any obscure fear to represent such as the fear of tomatoes or pillows. You will be strong enough to take on most civilians and have a few unique characteristics related to your name but little in the way of supernatural powers or abilities. Any Devil Hunter worth their job title will be able to make short work of you, at least if they’re semi-prepared. Second Tier Devil [200CP] (Chainsaw Man) The second tier grants you a more significant fear and one or two useful and decently powerful abilities on the physical side. Things like the fear of bats or leeches are included. You can bring down small buildings with your best attacks and are a tough fight for inexperienced Devil Hunters. Third Tier Devil [400CP] (Chainsaw Man) The third tier is when you start becoming a true threat. You represent either a universally understood fear or a more local and potent one. You are sought after for contracts from people all around your country seeking to gain a portion of your power in exchange for life and limb. Includes things like the fear of ghosts, snakes, and curses. You have either one or two extremely potent abilities or an assortment of lesser ones. You might be able to devour other devils and regurgitate them as minions later or cause instant death to those who you pierce a few times. It would take a team of experienced and prepared hunters to take you on with no sacrifices, and you can easily bring down skyscrapers and then some. Fourth Tier Devil [500CP] (Chainsaw Man) The fourth tier puts you on the scale of a global threat. You can bring cities to ruin within the hour or travel across the world in minutes. You represent something that humans struggle to confront and cause real terror in the minds of people spanning the globe. Includes things like the fear of nuclear bombs, guns, technology, the cosmos, failure, and betrayal. Fifth Tier Devil [800CP] (Chainsaw Man) The fifth tier makes you an unimaginably powerful ancient entity that even the strongest Devil Hunters cannot hope to match. You either embody a primal fear or have abilities that within time allow you to match or surpass them. Includes things like the fear of control, death, or darkness. You have abilities on the scale of hemorrhaging living beings to death with a glance or mentally dominating any beings you consider lower than yourself on the lower end. Physically, you could devastate countries on a casual walk leaving tens of millions dead. It’s recommended you start in Hell for this. (Editor's Note: I used the descriptions from Embodiment of Fear for the Devil Parts items due to its lack of description. But both here will be essentially the same with the exception of the reader actually becoming the Devil of the Fear chosen.)",

      "description": "Twisting Tendons Shape Anatomy [100CP] (Carrion) You have evolved your biomanipulation, allowing for more precise control over your biomass. Being stronger grants you several new abilities, such as Strengthening your tentacles to be Stronger than the rest of your body with skeletal armoring plates that, when not necessary, can be manipulated back into your body. You can also use this armor plating by turning it into spikes to pierce your enemies or creating longer tentacles that launch at them longer than should be possible with the current biomass you have stored. You can also use the DNA you have gathered to use Echolocate by sending out a roar to sense if humans are nearby and even detect hidden paths. Invisibility [200CP] (Carrion) You have evolved to be able to turn yourself invisible and bend light around yourself, creating a sort of invisibility cloak that hides you from the sight of anything, even advanced machines that can detect beings that are hidden or humans who have been augmented by science to have better vision. However, it costs biomass and energy to use this ability, and moving while using this ability massively drains energy. Arachnoptysis [200CP] (Carrion) You have evolved by absorbing the dna of spiders and can now shoot out a stored jet of cobwebs in any direction. This web dissipates after a little time. This allows you to trap enemies in a web or even grab things that are beyond the reach of even your further expanding tentacles. Bones Will Harden, Skin Will Slough [400CP] (Carrion) You have evolved your Biomanipulation to unprecedented levels, allowing you to control your biomass at a higher level than with basic biomanipulation. Creating spears out of your biomass that can puncture even the hardest of materials You gain more endurance and durability the more beings that you eat, allowing you to tank damage that you couldn't previously handle. You can also transform yourself into a smaller version of yourself, which should be possible with the biomass you have acquired and allow for passage into areas that would otherwise be unavailable. You can also absorb electricity via your tendrils and gain more resistance to fire, which is the only thing that can harm you more than anything else. Parasitism [600CP] (Carrion) Using a tendril of flesh, you can manipulate the dna of another being by burrowing your tentacles into a nearby biological organism and turning it into a puppet of your will. However, this only works on biological beings; a biological being does not need to be alive for you to control them. You can also use this to teleport by sending your biomass through the Tendril and forcing yourself to reappear in the spot of your puppet, killing them in the process. Tyrant of Evolution [600CP] (Carrion) Were you a test subject jumper? Did you get exposed to some mysterious virus of unknown origin? Somehow your body has started evolving at a rapid pace, allowing you to gain abilities and defenses based on attacks thrown at you, gaining resistance to them as your body evolves to adapt to the danger. With time, your body does not need to experience danger in order to undergo evolution, as it is slowly evolving on its own. This makes you immune to all your current Biological weaknesses.",

This is what allows some humans to become Nahobino since they have the knowledge of a God within them. However for you there seems to be a bit of extra knowledge. You are the perfect Vessel for higher powers to channel their abilities through and will as such be highly desirable for these beings. You can easily take these beings into you and be in full control of their power, without your personality being influenced by this new host, even able to form an unlikely friendship with them. Be the Herald of the Phoenix Force or the Avatar of a Warp God it matters little as their Knowledge is yours. Even better should such a connection be broken somehow, you can still keep around half of the power these beings granted to you. Nahobino [1500CP] (Shin Megami Tensei V) True Gods, born from Knowledge, restored to their greatness. You are a Nahobino, a being that has the right to claim the Throne of Creation and one of the most powerful beings in Da’at. If you are a Human you hold the knowledge of divinity within you and if you are a Demon you were lucky enough to find the one bearing your knowledge. You get 800 CP to be used exclusively on whatever Demon you create via the Demon origin. You are now that demon with its knowledge restored, making you vastly more powerful in the process. As a Nahobino is a combination of a Human with knowledge and a Demon you can chose to either get the Demon you create or the Human you bonded to as a Companion OR be a singular entity without a second voice in your head. If you opt for the company you may split up at will. This has a variety of effects: -First as mentioned you are one entity but born from two origins. As such you will count as both human and demon for discounts. -From now on you may pick two origins for a Jump to take the applicable discounts from. -You get a +2600 DP Stipend for the Demon customization section. If you choose to have a partner instead of being a single entity, you may also have an option to separate from them at will after this Jump has concluded. Doing so at the beginning of a Jump has the following results: -Your Partner gains a Stipend of 800 CP which they can spend how they please at the beginning of a Jump and are Imported for free. -HOWEVER: Doing so at the beginning of a Jump will NOT allow you to pick a second Origin for Discounts.",

      "description": "Marker Physiology [600CP] (Dead Space: Necromorphs) You're not a necromorph at all, you're a marker! Markers are the backbone of a necromorph outbreak and serve as both commander and powersource for necromorphs in it’s area, a marker is an immobile construct that generates an electromagnetic field in a radius of a planet and its atmosphere around itself, this field alters dead cells in order to create necromorphs.. In addition markers are insanely durable and able to withstand anything short of total disintegration. The only other way of destroying a marker is for someone with a strong will to reach a marker and to battle the marker’s consciousness, if they are successful they will be able to render the marker inert therefore stopping the infection. Marker’s are able to exert a telepathic influence on anyone in it’s electromagnetic range, growing stronger the closer they are to it. At the farthest away it would only be able to create vague discomfort however if a subject were to be extremely close they could be forced to kill themselves in seconds. Personal Electric Field [200CP*] (Dead Space: Necromorphs) Necromorphs require and rely on the electrical field created by a marker in order to survive, without it they instantly turn into mush. The free version of this perk guarantees that you alone will always have the required field powering your altforms allowing you to take your scourge to new universes. By paying 200cp your field now encompasses the area of a small town allowing you to start an outbreak of your very own. (Editor’s Note: You can get this perk for free, and pay 200CP for the upgraded version. Alternatively, you can take this perk as a degraded version of the Marker Physiology perk.) Pattern Signal [400CP] (Dead Space: Necromorphs) All markers have the ability to telepathically implant instructions on how to build additional markers into the subconscious of living beings that come into contact with them. The lesser known side effect of this is that as the patterns propagate around the subjects brain they will quickly begin losing sanity before death. You have had this ability expanded in two ways, first you can input patterns to do not relate to the propagation of markers, secondly you are now able to put in patterns that propagate around a subjects head much quicker killing them in days instead of weeks. The effects of patterns can be delayed unfortunately through the use of amnesia causing properties. Make Us Whole [600CP] (Dead Space: Necromorphs) The ultimate goal of markers is to achieve convergence, part of the process of doing this is to merge with the marker's creator. This allows the marker to gain all the knowledge of the now deceased human. This ability expands this somewhat, when you absorb a human's psyche you gain a small fragment of psychic power, this power is proportional to the willpower of the subject. Do be aware that the user can fight back while you are absorbing them and if your projection is killed then you will also be killed. Black Marker [600CP] (Dead Space: Necromorphs) You are a marker made by the brethren moons themselves and are thus the most powerful form of marker. This confers a huge boost to all your psychic abilities. In addition you can exude raw beams of psychic power calling all necromorphs to your side and causing massive damage.",

      "description": "Keeper of Ghostflame [200CP] (Elden Ring) Once, the cold flame in which death was burned was solely in the keeping of the Deathbirds. But others, through desperation or innovation, have discovered it can be wielded-and you have a special bond with this force. You are a vessel for Ghostflame, able to spread it, incorporate it into your attacks or magical abilities, and ignite your weapons or armour with it. Make no mistake-unnatural seeming though it may be, Ghostflame burns no less fiercely than fire of mundane character can potentially be empowered through symbolic rites of death. Or give substance and form to the souls of the dead-and even with the will of an untrained individual, direct them into vicious hexes. Scarlet Blossom [400CP] (Elden Ring) You have been cursed-no, blessed, though perhaps in ways you abhor. Though not necessarily to the extent of an Empyrean with this alone, a great deal of the Scarlet Rot has taken root in you, and whether by chance or dark design has left your body unravaged while imbuing you with it’s terrible power. You are well-versed and gifted in the various incantations of the Rot: Releasing poison mists, imbuing weapons with its foul taint and scattering sticky threads to slow your enemies among others. Your most devastating incantation is the Scarlet Aeonia: Blooming a gigantic flower around you suffused with the Rot. With it, you may spread its aberrant principle of death begetting life to other worlds and accelerate the development of its power where it has taken root in others. In time, you may be able to find other, more ritualised uses for the principles of rot. Perhaps with enough Rot and experimentation, you may even be able to taint or spawn others like it in the image of Malenia herself. But as you are now, you have inherited one of Malenia’s most potent advantages: The power to seamlessly and near-instantly mend your wounds by shedding the blood of your foes, letting an agile fighter prevail against terrible odds by inflicting death with a thousand cuts-and clawing back from the brink of death with every blow. Bloody Bedchambers [400CP] (Elden Ring) Mohg, Lord of Blood, is by and large content to rot like the filth he is with his captive Miquella. You are now heir to, if not his warped divinity, the legacy of his ambitious carnality. Malign forces cannot break you, rot you, drive you mad like other victims so easily-no, far more often they enter a grotesque symbiosis with your body as a sort of seedbed, empowered by their propagation and infestation of you while in turn becoming a beacon for whatever it is that has bonded with you to spread and strengthen itself. It is even possible for you to develop new, perverse spells based on whatever force infuses you; though Mohg’s invention of blood magic was likely expedited by both his divinity and the pact he struck with the Formless Mother, roll around in the Scarlet Rot enough and instead of festering in ruin you could create spells or incantations capable of channelling it’s power. Or channel it into your body instead, controlling how much you deign the corruption to manifest upon it or granting yourself useful mutations such as wings and claws infused with its power. No doubt with greater power of your own and/or a superb partner like his you too could one day create a full school of magic to call your own. Most disturbingly of all, carnal gratification bolsters your might and spellcraft. As if your sordid soul rejoicing in the suffering you inflict on the world lends strength to all your efforts to enact it. A Dance With Serpents [400CP] (Elden Ring) Long ago, an abyssal serpent bereft of light was sealed within you. It writhes painlessly beneath your skin, inexplicably existing in perfect symbiosis with your physiology and though it stands as an atrocity to the Golden Order the creature is nothing but a boon to you in battle. When you unleash it, the creature’s coils vastly extend your range of movement-letting you strike from uncanny angles or dodge in motions beyond what a body should endure. Furthermore it infuses you with a great darkness associated with yet never acknowledge by the Golden Order, granting you greatly enhanced reserves of magical energy for sorceries and miracles invoking such forces. Even now, you can manifest a great snake many times bigger than your own body form your own shadows to devour your foes, channel any other supernatural powers you have-and let you cross short distances rapidly by fading into shadow and manifesting where it goes. Perhaps more such power awaits your discovery and experimentation, should you wish to further profanethe Golden Order. Rooted in Death [600CP] (Elden Ring) Godwyn the Golden’s body gave rise to the Deathroot that brings movement and a semblance of life to Those Who Live In Death. And it seems in you at least, the roots have taken on a life of their own for you have the ability to spread and control the Deathroot embedded in your body to a short distance around you. Snap it off, and in time you may bring about more undead beings in other worlds. These new undead will instinctively regard you as their progenitor, and feel a strong compulsion to submit to you and serve your wishes even if they lack sentience. Retain your physical connection to it, and you can impale or block attacks with it as tendrils steeped in death’s power. Though not particularly sturdy compared to steel, the tendrils and your body permit you to spread Death Blight: A corruption with a significant chance of inflicting instant death on any living target, and severely corrupting even those powerful enough to resist it. Even dragons should fear prolonged exposure to your presence, unless your remains are thoroughly purged with flame or other elemental power-for it holds the potential to remake them into creatures of death themselves, and scour their minds of thought over time. Let every grave be made unquiet, as new life germinates within it. A Song of Fire and Darkness [600CP] (Elden Ring) But worse even than the serpent is the flame that took root in Messmer. A crimson blaze you now share, a curse as intrinsic to your being as a bloodline. All attempts to seal or deprive it from you-even your own-are so difficult that Messmer found no such means before and after his own banishment. Even if you had no training in sorcery or miracles, you could crudely coat your weapons in this dread flame or hurl orbs of it at others. With such training, rains of fire or homing serpents made of its foul incandescence are possible to refine. And whether because of a shadow of Messmer’s own resentment towards his own mother or a hint that Marika has some unwanted connection to her hated enemies the fire giants, this flame is particularly damaging and corrosive towards all manner of divinity. Charring godly flesh as if it were mortal fat, and potentially even weakening their immortality and resurrective measures. As if a shadow of Destined Death writhes between your hungry flames, yearning to sink it’s fangs into the necks of gods.",

Even if you had no training in sorcery or miracles, you could crudely coat your weapons in this dread flame or hurl orbs of it at others. With such training, rains of fire or homing serpents made of its foul incandescence are possible to refine. And whether because of a shadow of Messmer’s own resentment towards his own mother or a hint that Marika has some unwanted connection to her hated enemies the fire giants, this flame is particularly damaging and corrosive towards all manner of divinity. Charring godly flesh as if it were mortal fat, and potentially even weakening their immortality and resurrective measures. As if a shadow of Destined Death writhes between your hungry flames, yearning to sink it’s fangs into the necks of gods.",

These mutated drones are known as Zombie Drones, and the AbsoluteSolver first manifested in one such zombie drone, Cyn. The scientists at Cabin Fever Labs on Copper 9 later intentionally infected various Worker Drones with the AbsoluteSolver in order to study it, allowing the drones to manifest the AbsoluteSolver while keeping their docile Worker OS rather than becoming malevolent Zombie Drones. You are one of these drones, like Nori and Yeva, or perhaps one of their offspring who had their corrupted programming passed onto them, like Uzi and Doll. The AbsoluteSolver offers drones limited control over the laws of physics and matter, though it is limited by the drones’ hardware, causing them to overheat with continued use. You will be forced to resort to cannibalism to prevent overheating and dying, and if you aren’t cured, you are cursed to become a host for Cyn, who will attempt to use you to consume the world. You should also use this power sparingly, as using the Solver makes possession by Cyn much more likely. Additionally, these powers cannot be used to directly attack another drone infected with the Solver (you can still kill them by using the Solver to manipulate the environment around them, using weapons, hand-to-hand fighting, or by using [NULL]). When you try, your targeting systems will glitch out and you will receive the error message -// ERROR absoluteSolver_trn [like object non-interactive] on your OS. However, the same applies to other drones, in that they will not be able to use their Solver to directly interact with you. Post-jump, overheating, and possession will no longer be an issue for you. Solver Mutations (Murder Drones) With the purchase of Ungodly Eldritch Genetics, you will be able to unlock all of these abilities with enough time and effort. Purchasing these simply allows you to get them immediately. Higher-level abilities demand more energy, generate more heat, and make possession more likely. (You can find them on the Murder Drones jump under the Ungodly Eldritch Genetics perk.) (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 600CP to 3000CP. While usually this would be for AI, there will be an exception where you will receive a version that can be hosted into an organic being like yourself. Though it is restricted to the target demographic as detailed in the perk, so you can’t go affecting biological lifeforms. Alternatively however, you may instead receive a very special flash drive containing the AbsoluteSolver program if you wish, so then you can either implant into your possibly robotic self in the future or a robot of your choosing. Or the third option, the perk will simply not take effect until you possess the physiology to be infected by it.)",

      "description": "Big Ears [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) My, what big ears you have. All the better to hear your prey with. You will find that your sense of hearing has been improved beyond even the best in the animal kingdom. From the breaking of twigs in a dense forest to the beating of someone’s heart, even the slightest whisper can be picked up by you, though it may leave you sensitive to exceptionally loud noises. Large Teeth [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) My, what big teeth you have. All the better to eat your prey with. You are a finely honed machine of death and destruction, and as such must have the proper tools for the job. Your teeth and claws, should you have them, will be sharper than before, cutting through ordinary steel like warm butter, to say nothing of what it could do to a person. Padded Feet [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) If sight is the sense most relied upon by humanity and their warriors, then hearing is a close second, and it is just as easily fooled as the first. You will find your movements have been muffled, making less noise than you should. Even if you were the size of a Goliath, you could quite regularly get the drop on your enemies so long as they didn't see you coming. Wide Eyes [50CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) My, what big eyes you have. All the better to see your prey with. Your eyes are that of a true predator, well suited for catching all within your gaze. Not only can you see clearly a mile away, as though it were right in front of your face, but your sight is not at all hampered by the absence of light. An underground cavern is just as clear to you as a sunny plain. Bone Armor [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) As the Creatures of Grimm age, they will slowly grow more bone-like plating across their bodies, offering them greater protection from the warriors of light and their weapons. Not only do you have similarly advanced protrusions, but they are more durable than they should be, making you quite the difficult opponent to harm, especially if they are lacking in firepower. Extending Limbs [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) They believe that if they run far enough, get high enough, they will be able to escape your grasp. Oh how wrong they are, much to their horror. You now find that all of your limbs possess an elastic quality, allowing them to stretch up to three times their typical length. This can also be applied to the tongue as well, if you cannot wait to get a taste of your prey. Death from Afar [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Your prey may think your reach is limited, determined by the length of your arms and maw, but they are mistaken if they think you are limited to just those. Whether it be spikes from your back or razor sharp feathers, you can launch a part of your body as a high-speed projectile, moving with enough force to make some bullets jealous. They will fully replenish over the course of a day if used, so there is no fear of ever running out. Inhuman Might [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Many foolishly believe that possessing strength is the key to victory, and yet it is only one small part of the equation, though undoubtedly an important one. Your muscles are filled with a terrible power, making it so then you are nearly three times as strong as before. Even smaller Grimm would find no difficulty breaking boulders or trees, to say nothing of the devastation a larger specimen would be able to inflict. Swift Footed [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) They may think themselves capable of hiding from you, but they will never be able to outrun you. You move with a speed that belies your bulk, being nearly twice as fast as before. This affects not only your movements, but also your attacks, raining down a flurry of blows upon all those who would stand in your way. Winged Beast [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Look to the sky and despair at the shadowed form above, like death from on high carried by malicious winds. You may now claim to be one of those airborne terrors that plague the sky, whether that be with avian or insectoid wings, it matters not, as either way you are capable of flying at speeds equal to your sprint. Should your form already possess wings of some sort, then this will instead enhance your level of control, more akin to the flight of a hummingbird than any raven. Amphibious Beast [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Even as man begins to conquer the land and still struggles to keep its territory, few would dare to wonder what horrors lurk in the deep, unknown depths of the blue ocean. You're one of these aquatic terrors, immune to the immense pressures of the ocean floor and capable of swimming speeds equal to your sprinting on dry land. Should your form already be capable of such surviving under the oceans, than your speed underwater has instead been tripled. Chameleon Skin [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) It is always the unseen threat that poses the most danger, for how can you predict where they will strike from if you cannot see them? You are one of these trickier enemies, capable of changing your form to achieve a state of near total invisibility, blending in with the background. There may be tricks around this ability, but that would require them to even know that you’re there in the first place. Deadly Venom [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Though it is the claws and fangs that pose the immediate threat, it can be easy to overlook how debilitating poison can be in the heat of the moment. You are now quite venomous, capable of producing either a deadly poison that can kill the average person within the hour if left untreated, or spit out globs of acid capable of eating through stone as easily as flesh. Nature's Curse [200CP*] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Dust has been one of the most important weapons of humans and faunus when it comes to fighting against the Grimm, yet it can so easily be turned against them like so many of their other tools. Like the giant Grimm known as Monstra, your body has been implanted with a single type of Dust, granting you elemental powers. For example, implanting Gravity Dust could allow you to fly. This option may be taken multiple times for different Dust infusions. Alpha [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) It is a precious fantasy that all are created equal, though reality has hammered in time and time again how unfair it truly is. You are a prime example, though for the better, as you stand above your kin as a paragon of what they could have been. Regardless of what subspecies of Grimm you are, you are considered the ideal of that, such that if you were to be an Ursa fighting another Ursa, there is no doubt that you would emerge as the victor. This will also apply to any other race you are a part of in the future, a true alpha amongst the mediocre. Elder [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Welcome to a world where only the strong endure, and strength is only gained through time and patience. Just as the strongest Grimm, you can get more powerful as you age. Among your kin your age will also be felt as will be your power, earning you respect and obedience from Grimm and similar monsters if you are old enough. If they will not learn to respect their elders, give them a reason why. Hybrid [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) The Creatures of Grimm have shown to be able to combine with others in a demented mockery of symbiosis, granting them new abilities. From the skeletal black arm owned by the newest Fall Maiden to the repurposed corpse known only as the Hound, there is now another example. You. You are now capable of fusing your various forms with that of a Grimm, not only granting you the capabilities of your Grimm form, but combining them to create an even stronger abomination. You would be a true monster, one feared by all who gazed upon the twisted mockery of light you have become. Merged [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Some Grimm are not alone in their existence. The Nuckelavee is one such example, being a nightmarish mixture of a horse and an imp fused together at the waist. A second consciousness is now inside of you, one that is obedient to you and your goals, working in seamless harmony with you to achieve them. As such it can move your body to react to things you didn't notice, such as sneak attacks or an enemy striking you while you're blinded, and could potentially use your body in its entirety when you are unconscious. Mutated [400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) There are those rare few madmen that think the Grimm are something to be controlled, with one in particular having caused the downfall of an entire city in this mad pursuit, but it is madness that has yielded results, you being the prime example. Green crystals and markings are on your body, as a sign of how you surpassed your brethren, though you are not limited to just those colors. Even as a normal Beowolf, you would be stronger than an Alpha of your kind, one capable of firing these crystals as spiked projectiles. Lastly you can even self-destruct should you be defeated, though it is perhaps for the best to have some way to come back if you want to make real use of this. Adaptation [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Humanity believes that it is their ability to adapt to new situations that is one of their greatest strengths, yet it is something that is shared with their dark enemies, albeit on a more physical level. You, though, are the paragon of that ideal, possessing an adaptive regeneration that not only closes your wounds right before your eyes, but also makes it so then whatever harmed you beforehand will have less of an effect, and in some cases developing an immunity towards it. So long as you survive, your bloody evolution will appear limitless, no matter what you may end up facing. Tarnished Silver [1000CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) The Silver Eyes, the gift by the God of Light, are legendary in their ability to destroy the Creatures of Grimm, though only a handful of them seem to exist at any given time. How terrifying would it be if Grimm managed to surpass such weaknesses, to render humanity’s greatest weapon all but useless? Through some way you have become highly resistant to the power wielded by the Silver Eyes, to the point where it would harm you no much better than any normal wave of energy. This kind of resistance also applies to any other racial weaknesses you may possess. Curse of Immortality [1000CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) So the Black Queen was not the only one who received this terrible curse from the God of Light. Like her, you have become ageless and immortal, capable of restoring yourself to your prime no matter how much damage you receive. Bullets, explosives, Dust, Semblances, magic, even destroying your entire body at once won’t be enough to keep you dead, as you would simply return with a shimmering golden light. Additionally, your mind won’t let you forget anything, retaining all that you experience like a steel trap. Only those with the strength to match The Brothers, divine beings capable of wiping out all life on the planet with a wave of their hand, are capable of bypassing it. Another way would be through completely destroying your soul, as even a single remaining shred would see you return once more. This is a truly lonely existence, one that would drive most to any deplorable means in order to be rid of it. Are you sure you desire to willingly embrace such a fate?",

You have the talent and the training to become a nationally famous artist in a style found here in Japan. Writing and poetry, weaving, calligraphy, some of the varieties of traditional painting or even more modern arts not yet created in older Japan. While you have the ordinary skill to create emotionally moving and lasting pieces of art, you also possess a magical side to your style. You can naturally enchant your works with magic, enabling it to have a more direct influence on the minds and hearts of those who experience it. Simplest to just direct the emotions of readers but with time, you can plant ideas and even commands to be later activated in the minds of others. Art that is similar to your chosen style is easy for you to expand your skill into, a painter will quickly master other styles of painting, and your art is never boring or bothersome for you to focus on. More, it is calming and enables you to re-centre yourself no matter the situation Traditional Japanese Art: Eldritch: For 200 points instead, you can attain a connection to an eldritch being through the medium of your art. This effectively turns your artform into a form of magecraft, casting spells by creating your artworks. This magic will be broadly related to whatever unnatural source you call your patron, a dweller in the depths letting paintings of the ocean summon actual torrents of the sea. Your power in these acts is that of an experienced magus, despite not expending magical energy yourself but adding your own power to your art or delving deeper into eldritch secrets could see your potency grow. As could seeking the attention and favour of your dark benefactor, whatever their desires could be.",

A wizard versed in it could draw all the water from a man’s body by desiccation, unleash blasts of biting and tearing sand or boiling heat, enhance his warriors with many protective spells and buffing magics or, of course, raise and control the dead. More than any other, the Lore of Nehekhara has incredible powers to be gained over the dead, with great wizards being able to raise thousands upon thousands of undead warriors on their own. There is a vast amount of power to be discovered in this lore, especially around the dead or in the desert. Purchasing this option grants you a fair amount of knowledge and training in this magic, enough that you could competently cast many low level spells and even some of middling power, as well as have a wide range of knowledge on Nehekharan legend and rituals. Liches gain this option for free and gain much more out of it, having had decades of training under other wizards in the magic. For an extra 100CP each, those who buy or gain this perk for free may purchase similar levels of training that they gained from this perk in the Lore of Light and the Lore of Death, both styles with many offensive, defensive and esoteric uses, though the Lore of Death would combine best with the undead magics of Nehekhara.

      "description": "Among the most structured and ancient styles of magic in Japan is the Onmoyuji’s work. This Japanese magecraft is a mix of science and occultism, containing both many ordinary spellworkings but focusing primarily on working with tools and charms. Most famous are the paper charms and familiars that a Onymouji can easily create, imbuing them with magic long term to achieve a wide variety of goals. Wards, enchantment or cursing of others, creating powerful Shikigami warriors and more. You are a master of these arts, with a above average amount of magical energy to channel into them. However, an Onmyouji finds that raw power is worth less than skill and materials, as you can potentially do battle and seal even a great youkai like Tamamo no Mae despite lacking in power with the right set up. Onmyoudo performs superbly well with preparation, seeing rituals of incredible power becoming much easier than many other magecraft forms. In particular, you are familiar with the secret technique of Life Continuation. With this, you are able to engrave your very being onto your Shikigami, making them as much a part of you as your original body. Your human form being destroyed hardly matters when a thousand paper familiars hold your essence still, allowing you to control them all at once. Onmyouji: Singularity: For an additional 200, you can learn the vast repertoire of curses, hexes and foreign magics that would let the dreadful Ashiya Douman compete with Abe no Seimei. With enough power gathered, you should be able to replicate the feats of summoning and creation that Douman achieved intheHeian-Kyo Singularity.",

In addition to giving you a natural immunity to corrupting or mind control effects, the Equation settled within you like a parasite becoming symbiotic and you have tailored it to your own use. By repeating the Anti-Life Equation through technology, your voice, or your abilities, those caught within it will almost immediately collapse to its will and see their consciousness and souls extinguished, turning into little more than hollow extensions of your will that you have full awareness of and work in perfect concert with. Only those with truly godlike power or hope for life can hope to resist, and that’s a small number even in this universe.

From a purely erudite perspective you know the precise content of all scriptures for your religion. The word of god is ever with you. Each passage is part of you, not to be forgotten even under the influence of amnestics. Your shrewd memory for the faith would no doubt be of value to the religion. You may not be guaranteed any place in an afterlife for this knowledge, but within this world you can be recognized as a spiritual leader in your congregation. For prophets of your own, you can permit people to speak in your voice for a time. Or allow them to communicate however you do, considering you may have inhuman physiology that allows for unusual communication.",

Thankfully you seem to already have put in the work to acquire and memorize a fair deal of this lore. While the underlying rules which govern spell creation have been lost, and this perk will give you no knowledge of how to actually cast spells, you have an excellent grounding in what effects they may have, and in recognizing magic you see in use. This extends beyond spells to the demons which invade from other worlds, gods sometimes made from human belief, and monsters made by (often lost) sorcery. This unfortunately only applies to the magic of this world and will not update for future ones. But the memorization ability to acquire this knowledge will remain. You are highly skilled in memorizing texts and information, and with a naturally excellent memory especially for lore, facts, and minutiae, able to remember small details of a book you read years, even centuries ago... as a prolific reader who spends centuries reading over moldy tomes of arcane matters. This naturally expands how many spells you can hold in your memory concurrently, despite their complexity and tendency to escape the mind after use.",

Forging soulsteel is difficult for even the best smiths. Soulforging is the process by which the souls of the dead are melted down and then shaped into useful items or are used to produce soulsteel. First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking. Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith’s hammer. Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords.

Even before the Underworld existed, people wanted to show respect to the dead, and a funeral gave them a means to do so. The annals of Heaven say that as each Primordial fell, the Sijanese performed funeral rites specially designed for each component soul, urging the dead cosmogon to rest in peace. The annals of Heaven do not describe these rites, however, by express command of the Maiden of Endings. If any records survive, no one knows except the most senior members of the Morticians’ Order. Before the Lawgivers of the Old Realm even thought of exploring it, the Morticians’ Order had already contacted the Underworld and knew how to house and appease the dead. Sijan, therefore, rather than Stygia, claims the honor of the first city of the Underworld. The East holds hundreds of tribes and nations, with at least a thousand different ways of celebrating, venerating or mourning a loved one’s passing, and almost as many for the death of an enemy. The professional funerists of Sijan serve them all. Sijan’s jet-black funeral galleys ply the rivers of the Scavenger Lands unmolested by brigand, pirate or robber baron. The silver bracers of the Morticians’ Order are a common sight in most cities. Members of the Morticians’ Order spend their entire lives serving the dead and training for their postmortem careers. But these days, it sometimes occurs that their best and brightest join the ranks of the Abyssal Exalted instead of their colleagues in the Underworld. As one of the foremost experts of the Morticians' Order, you have all the knowledge and skill you need for practically all the funereal rites in Creation, being a master of ceremony and ritual, or embalming and tomb-design, and many more things besides. Such mastery could even be used to create new burial rites, so as to appease the dead and ghosts that don't fall under the existing ceremonies. And of course, you are also a trained exorcist, with the skills to deal with more troublesome ghosts.",

A woman who always acted by her heart may have to tear her own heart out. Whatever it is you must sacrifice it will be thematic to who you are and quite the severe, if reversible, loss. It is however also draining to do repeatedly, especially outside of the underworld and do it too often and you may risk being destroyed. In return your power will increase by drastic levels. A mere Pharaoh and incarnation of the Skygod could gain power rivaling that of the great Anubis and a mighty Goddess like Ereshkigal, when pushing herself to the absolute limit of her being, could even be compared to the power of the White Titan.

Abandon it so you are prepared for the final battle to save the world because in letting go of what you are great power awaits. You now are aware of the ritual to undergo Alterization. Alterization is a form of rebirth, one that according to a certain Pharaoh, can only be done in the underworld, at least within Mictlan. You however can do this process at any time. Now in regards to what you need to do to become an Alter... that is entirely dependent on who you are as a person. A Goddess who wishes for flowers in a peaceful underworld may have to burn these same flowers down and commit herself to be cruel and selfish. An innkeeper who doesn’t want to grow up will have to embrace her adulthood with all its responsibilities. A giant who years for love must become obsessed with strength. A woman who always acted by her heart may have to tear her own heart out. Whatever it is you must sacrifice it will be thematic to who you are and quite the severe, if reversible, loss. It is however also draining to do repeatedly, especially outside of the underworld and do it too often and you may risk being destroyed. In return your power will increase by drastic levels. A mere Pharaoh and incarnation of the Skygod could gain power rivaling that of the great Anubis and a mighty Goddess like Ereshkigal, when pushing herself to the absolute limit of her being, could even be compared to the power of the White Titan. A worthy trade isn’t it? You are able to teach this ritual to others so they can do it to themselves as well. If you don’t have the patience however, using a large amount of magical energy and a command spell can make you force others through alterization.",

A living being with no heart in her chest falls limp and useless, but the same creature reanimated can move and fight and kill.

In these violent times, swords are often more useful than hands to wield them. From this understanding comes the field of building and maintaining creatures, built of dead and inorganic parts, the art and science called necrotech. Craftsmen who study and perfect necrotech are known as necrosurgeons. Knowledge lies at the heart of necrotech. Necrosurgeons must learn through observation and experimentation. They make progress through scientific investigation and deduction. Yet necrotech is also the highest of arts. When mortals run in panic from the spiked monstrosity with a hundred screaming faces, they know the glory of the Void. For this reason, most necrosurgeons take great pride in the hideous beauty of their creations. As an expert necrosurgeon, you have a firm grasp of the science of necrotech, and the mundane skills in medicine and crafting that underlie it. You may create meat puppets and bonestriders, yoroi ogres and exoskeletons of bone and metal, and you could just as easily practise more standard medicine or forge weaponry. But you have a possibly even greater mastery of necrotech as an art, allowing you to create things of macabre beauty and exquisite hideousness. Delicate constructs of bone-clockwork, beautiful youths perfectly preserved and turned into bladed weapon-champions, or the horrific mother of suffering. Whether you wish to evoke beauty or horror, you have the skills to do both. And the aptitude to apply this slant of the gothic and the horrific to all your other creations besides.",

You have gained considerable knowledge, both practical and theoretical, on the workings of ritual magic and, by extension, sacrificial blood magic. This allows you to create far reaching and incredibly powerful spell matrices that can be supplied over time by anyone, or fuelled by the life force of sacrificed creatures or blood.

Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes. This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years. You and your companions will automatically recover at the start of each new jump. As a Denizen, you start knowing the ritual for your race, otherwise you must learn or design them from scratch.

The method by which Altered Items can be created, and how they can be transformed into Objects of Power. You can construct a ritual, a blending of technology and mysticism that will take an object, and focus belief and thought about the object onto it, bathing it in raw paranatural resonance. Eventually, the item will transform into a true Altered Item, with a strange power somehow linked to its nature and the ideas that people have about it. A postage stamp could gain the capacity to ‘send’ ideas into the heads of those nearby. A traffic cone would give those who approach it a looming sense of danger. A clothes hanger might gain the capacity to cause items to vanish into a ‘storage space’. Once an item has been ‘Altered’, you will then need to take steps to link it to the Astral Plane, forming a channel between the object and the collective unconscious. This is a delicate process that can destroy the object if you are not careful, but once complete, a parautilitarian or similarly psychically empowered individual can connect to the object and borrow its power, gaining some skill such as Telepathy, Danger Sense, or Storage. To start with, it would likely take several weeks of effort to make a single item, but as you explore the process, you can discover shortcuts and improved methods to speed up the process. Altered Items and Objects of Power you create are immune to corruption by the Hiss or similar powers, and while anyone with psychic power can bond with them, you are able to purge bonds you disapprove of, as well as storing them in a space like your Warehouse and still accessing their power.",

Is it any wonder how he so easily stole The Triforce out from under The Hero and Princess Zelda's noses? Granted it's probably not difficult to outwit two ten-year olds but Ganondorf didn't get his title by stealing golden candy from children. You have in you the makings of a King of Thieves. You have exemplary talent at every skill a thief could be purported to have; lock picking, sneaking, pickpocketing, sleight of hand, staking out locations, planning heists and getaways, etc. But you also have leadership qualities and a head for banditry tactics that could see you leading your own company of raiders. And they won’t be two bit cowards who only win against soft targets, no, you turn your forces into warrior thieves who are able to contend with the likes of trained soldiers and earn both the respect and fear of kingdoms. Snatch Away Victory [400CP] (The Ocarina of Time) Zelda truly thought her plan to keep the Triforce safe from Ganondorf couldn't fail, but ten year olds aren't great planners. Perhaps, had she the foresite to realize what things could go wrong, her plan B would've had Link take the stones and ocarina outside Hyrule and stay on the move to keep them safe, but her inexperience and naivety blinded her from anticipating their enemy. This isn't an issue you have. When you have goals you want to see fulfilled, no matter how small or large those goals, you are able to make the best plan possible based on what you can do, your resources, what your allies and opponents can do, their resources, anticipate what they'll likely do to disrupt your plans, and where your plans can go wrong in general. This isn't a magic ‘everything according to keikaku’ button, your plans rely on the information you have, but you'll always make the best plan you could have for that moment allowing you to stay steps ahead of the heroes (or villains) if you're meticulous enough.",

Living in an environment surrounded by machines, it’s hardly strange that you’ve gained a fair bit of expertise in deciphering and working with technology. With plenty of opportunities to hone your skills as you move through the City, you’ll find that the techniques you use here to determine the functions of foreign machinery and the techniques you use to develop new machinery are applicable elsewhere as well. Malleable Form [100CP] (Blame!) All Silicon Life appear to be much more receptive to “strange additions” to their bodies, and it isn’t too strange to find that many Silicon Life cyborgs have cybernetic implants which are visually apparent and seemingly harmless. Adopting the same practices as them also means you learn a bit about their methods, and consequently, any penalties you have for shape shifting, transplants, and implementations reduce substantially – allowing your foreign components to harmonize with your natural components. With the knowledge gleaned here, your work on others also improves slightly. Why not improve other people with the same improvements you have? Access Privileges [200CP] (Blame!) It’s nice when your work is not impeded by nosy people who insist on dropping in and asking questions. You’ve come to learn that hacking goes a long way to making sure these people don’t ever get the opportunity to come and pester you. Not only have your hacking abilities improved, but people also instinctively believe that you belong – and consequently most people will overlook the nature of your work unless it interferes with them substantially. AI Synthesis [400CP] (Blame!) Perhaps it isn’t exactly wise to delve into the fields that caused this whole mess to begin with, but the stories of the Net Sphere AIs causing a massive society collapse have yet to be proven – so in the meantime it should be safe to develop more AI, for the sake of research of course. You’ll start off with simple AI of course, perhaps enough to only manage and direct a local city block, but as time progresses, the AI you build will grow in both scope and capacity. From one AI to a cluster, from a cluster to entire networks...if you dedicate enough of yourself into the process, you may well develop the beginnings of sapient AI.",

At The Top [400CP] (Overlord: PJ Edition) That is where you truly belong, Master, with everyone and everything bowing to you. Now, though, you need to run it.

Virologist [600CP] (Prototype) Looking at it from a technical standpoint, viruses are just devices that carry genes, they enter the nucleus, insert their genome, and then the host cell does everything else for them. This characteristic makes viruses one of the most favored device in genetic engineering, as they can go and infect multiple cells. The folks at Gentek know this, and focus solely on them, but you have a leg up on them. By extensive study (but still far less than s computer could) you can decode the entire genome of a lifeform, and decode and isolate the genes responsible for any and every trait that they possess.

Spells and runes are built upon its power and codified according to a great underlying mosaic of magic. The design of this mosaic wizards cannot surmise; their knowledge is didactic, empirical, arbitrary. He who discovers the pattern will know all of sorcery and be a man powerful beyond comprehension. You have not fully discovered its pattern, but you are well versed in the nature of mathematics and have a deep understanding of them, enough to be a professional mathematician. More than that you find that, like Phandaal, you have a glimpse at the pattern by which it governs sorcery and as such are particularly capable of creating new spells or changing existing ones. You’ll be able to apply this mathematical understanding of the creation and modification of spells and magical effects to magic from other settings as well making it easier for you to change or create new spells, or other magical effects. If not taken with Vancian Magic, this will not allow you to cast spells from this world in future settings, nor will it give you a particularly form grasp of magic to begin with. It will still aid you with other forms of magic you may possess. Vancian Magic [600CP] (Dying Earth) You are actually a magician, fully trained and versed in the use of the magic of this world. By studying grimoires and workbooks you are able to force spells in your mind, keeping them there until you cast them and they escape your memory. These spells are many and varied, able to vibrate and twist space changing it in accordance with the mystical code you have placed into reality. Some of the greatest mages can even traverse time itself, negate gravity to stand on neutron stars, and survive indefinitely in the void of space. You however begin merely at the level of Turjan of Miir before his training under Pandelume. This makes you no weak mage, able to hold four spells of great power simultaneously within your mind, and perhaps more if you choose lesser spells, or possibly 5 with great effort, but there is still the possibility to learn more and grow further in power. This will ensure you may still use this magic in future worlds as you could here, and that you may, through trial and error, even possibly event further spells though it will give you no special aptitude or capability in this dangerous art.",

Indeed, you seem almost destined for it. You are more bold, more cunning, and more powerful than your attributes imply, and since you have the mind, body, and spirit of a true warrior, they imply quite a bit. You have the Luck to shape your own destiny, your actions have increased historical impact, and you can reach comparatively ridiculous heights of power through training and adventure, which never traumatizes you. Fame is also helpful, but martial achievement will allow you to develop great strength and wisdom, often in defiance of social and magical conventions. For double points, you have a unique, Sybil-like connection to the Heroic Spirit you have not yet become, and may call upon the Noble Phantasms and Skills you have already earned, from your own linear perspective. Once a Century (600CP) (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files) You are a rare magical prodigy, with talent and potential that appears only rarely. Not only are you a natural innovator, you can become exceptionally skilled in any branch of thaumaturgy with a fraction of the usual time and effort. Additionally, you have already gained access to a rare or totally unique mystery, on par with Fragarach or a Kaleidosword. Quite Grand [300CP] (Lord El-Melloi II Case Files) Frankly, you are a literal genius, especially with thaumaturgy, wherein you rival Touko Aozaki. You learn and innovate with blinding speeds. Your potential is no lesser, and within a decade or two, you could be recognized as one of the greatest magi to ever live. Additionally, because of magecraft’s imitative nature, you yourself are a swift and natural copycat. Regardless of what system you use, you can magically reproduce or duplicate everything from technology and mystic codes to faeries and Flat Escardos, once you’ve studied them a little. Events are harder, but not by much. Once you’ve emulated something, it is surprisingly easy to refine or expand on their principles. There are limits, but yours are far beyond your peers’. Naturally, it would be easiest to replicate Fragarach with Irish Ogham or Norse Runes than Numerology or alchemy, but don’t let that stop you, especially if you’ve got the sword on hand.

And yet, it is eager, almost alive (or possibly even literally so, like that of the L Corp before Lobotomy), With research seeing it expand and grow, happy to integrate new technology and exotic stimuli. Perhaps your expansion of space might develop into swords that can cut nearly anything,by simply creating space along the edge of the blade. Regardless of what precisely you make, it can be readily and relatively simply mass produced, or at least the end results can. However, the basic expansion and extreme eagerness to integrate technology of this strange and miraculous technology you’ve found pales in comparison to its thirst for blood and suffering. For the Wings of the World throw countless bodies into their everyday research, and it appears that your nature as a Jumper has crystallized that into a law for your own Singularity. Cruelty excites your insight into the strange mix of magic and technology you’ve found yourself the master of, causing it to grow entire new branches to follow down. Perhaps by unsafe experiments with unstable fields, you can make spaces where physical laws are altered. Or begin to expand time as well as space, inserting moments into the course of events. The greater the depravity, the more potent the end results, and if carried out on someone possessing their own supernatural powers, your singularity may grow its own mockeries of them, a blood fiend may see your fields become self sustaining by consuming the vitality of those within it, or that bring those within them under your thrall. Perhaps, with enough time and lives sacrificed on the altar, you might be able to create something that truly changes the face of the City, akin to Lobotomy Corporation’s Seed of Light plan. Finally, it appears that your origin title is no longer quite accurate. You’re no longer a mere employee of a Wing, instead being the head of one, other than A, B or C Corp. Countless employees are now yours to command, all dedicated to ensuring that your Singularity derived inventions are produced and distributed across the City.

The only scenario in which you take nothing away from an incident is if you actively choose not to take anything away and pretend like it never happened. Science Excuses the Means [200CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) Morals are a good guideline to stand by for many things in life. But when it comes to science and progress, there are times when sacrifices must be made, and morals become more of a hindrance than a benefit. But as long as your experiments can produce tangible results, as long as the ends you achieve in the pursuit of science has a clear benefit, people will know better than to inquire too deeply into the measures which were necessary. Even if they have a strong suspicion that a significant sacrifice or breach in protocol had to occur to make things happen, they will quietly accept it as a necessity and look beyond that to see what can be made from your findings and your efforts. Of course, if you have the opportunity to keep your methods private you should still take it; it simply is not sensible to give anyone more reasons for concern or unrest, especially during times like these. Remote Control Biology [400CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) Given all the changes the world has undergone, the idea of experimental biology probably is not the first thing to come to mind when considering potential adaptations to thrive in this new environment. After all, submarines, floating cities, hydroponics and other developments already exist. But by modifying your own body, you can potentially remove your dependence on some of these developments, shape your body into one that can thrive in any environment be it on land or under the sea. As long as you have the right materials available, you can replace your body parts to suit your needs and whatever your environment may demand. Your body will continue to function as long as you have made some attempt to introduce a substitute for the body parts taken out. Meanwhile, the parts which were taken out will not simply die off. With appropriate preservation methods they can be maintained indefinitely (in case you want to swap them back in) or you can integrate them into other components (whether as a donor for someone else, or integrated into some sort of mechanical unit) where they will continue to function as they normally would. With emergencies in mind, you should note that the “right materials” necessary covers a very broad selection of objects. You do not require sophisticated hardware to act as a replacement, though the difference in quality will likely improve functionality. You could realistically jury rig a replacement using some cabling, tubing, and maybe a battery or two depending on what it is you are replacing. Hybrid Theory [600CP] (Blue Submarine No.6) To the people of this world, this represents the pinnacle of genetic engineering. You are essentially the second person in the world with the ability to manipulate the genetic structure on such a level that you can create hybrid lifeforms with both precision and consistency. Your knowledge has given you the ability to remove most of the variables and obstacles that makes genetic engineering a frustrating, even fruitless endeavour for others. As long as you possess the relevant genetic samples, you can splice them into the human genetic composition, creating a new life form, a Hybrid life form which bears traits from the genetic donors involved. As you first work with this process, you will find the most success when working with human/X combinations, but as your proficiency in this field develops you should be able to shift away from human combinations – perhaps even moving into the field of fusing animate and inanimate objects together. The importance of meticulous planning throughout the entire process cannot be stressed enough. You may have no issues when it comes to creating the creature, but that does not mean that the creature will be “born perfect” certain donors may possess traits that are beneficial in some environments yet detrimental in others. A shark/human hybrid may be more resilient, stronger, and quicker to respond, but they may also possess an increased tendency for uncontrollable violence. If you want your creations to succeed in life, you must take some degree of responsibility in determining which traits should be emphasized and which ones should be minimized. Ideally, you will also stick around to help them grow, because while they can fend for themselves, having a parent figure plays a large role in development and growth. Had Zorndyke not been the first to unlock the secrets of this field, perhaps the Hybrids would have been viewed in a different light. But given the nature of human and Hybrid interaction, you would be wise to limit the interactions between your creations and the humans, perhaps even limit their interactions with other Hybrids. It makes little difference whether you intend to pick a side or remain neutral, the situation is volatile enough that introducing a new variable can lead to a complete disaster.",

The effects of this are even better when you have the person you’re designing the weapon for or someone with more experience with the materials you’re using, and can learn to adjust your abilities as a weapon maker to improve further than you already have.

      "description": "Knowledge of the Occult [100CP] (Children of an Elder God) You are well-educated in matters pertaining to the eldritch. This does not give you knowledge of how to perform any spells or rituals, but you can identify those done by other people. Furthermore, you know the most common names of all the gods relevant to the setting; both beings which are truly gods, and beings which are only considered gods (although this does not tell you which is which). You can identify by sight and name any monster or monstrous creature (eldritch or otherwise), and know their strengths and weaknesses. Librarian of Celeano [100CP] (Children of an Elder God) Alright, so technically the planet of Celeano has been depopulated, and the Great Library of Celeano has no librarians anymore. But the Elder Gods periodically add to the vast stores of lore held within, and the locals—when they were alive, at least—spent thousands of years collecting all the information they could obtain. As a result, it’s one of the largest collections of physical knowledge in the universe, Dreamlands or otherwise. It’s also in a host of different languages, from Aklo to English to Japanese, and stranger languages besides. Like the language of the Xicillians, which could only be read if you had electron vision. You, however, are completely fluent in all of these languages (except the mystical ones such as Aklo). As long as a language is not inherently supernatural, you can understand, communicate, read, and write in it. It doesn’t matter if understanding the language requires senses you’ve never experienced, or if communicating in it requires organs you don’t have. You can still comprehend it, and still speak/sign/etc. the language. Although it might confuse people how you’re doing it, it should be spectacularly physically impossible for you to accomplish. Find the Path [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) The Royal Museum belonging to Kuranes was ravaged by Cherubim, who destroyed the charts that would guide a traveler through the space of the Dreamlands from Earth’s Dreamlands (which, let it be noted, look nothing like the planet Earth you may be familiar with), to that of the city of Carcosa and the Kingdom of Joy. Instead, the dream-questors were forced to travel to the Great Library of Celeano to study its Map of the Stars, an entire building dedicated solely to tracing the pathways to travel between worlds, both in the waking world and the Dreamlands. You have internalized this knowledge and expanded upon it. As long as a way exists to get from Point A to Point B, you will know what that way is. This might not tell you how to sail one of the boats that travel through space in the Dreamlands, but you’ll know the right path to take, you’ll know where to go to find someone willing to take you on that path, and you’ll know the dangers present on the path you seek to take. Wisdom Too Great for the Waking World [400CP] (Children of an Elder God) There is a distinction between intelligence and wisdom that only a fool would discount. Fortunately, you are both smart and wise, and are in no way a fool. You are able to find the connections between seemingly unconnected topics as you realize the connections and correlations that lurk beneath the surface. If you were learned in a great many subjects, you would find you knowledge would encompass a number of topics you never directly studied, but simply inferred the answers from the vast wealth of knowledge you already possessed. Of course, it would be ridiculous to trust only one’s own conclusions without proof, but fortunately you have a mind capable of coming up with experiments to discover the truth with astonishing ease. But more than simply your intellect, you are a font of wisdom, and will rarely lead others astray with your advice by accident. Other people and their motivations are clear to you, and it takes you only a short interaction to fully understand who someone is as a person, even if they seek to hide parts of themselves. If you had enough truthful information on them from other sources, you might never need to actually speak with them at all. Your wisdom allows you to clearly find the most dangerous and foolhardy courses of action; while you can’t perfectly avoid making mistakes, you can rest assured that you’ll never take the worst course of action. You are keenly aware of your own weaknesses and failings, and will always know when your own senses aren’t to be trusted. Furthermore, you can tell when you risk learning knowledge that would be dangerous for you to learn, and have the self-control to avoid such topics. Craftsman of Ilek-Vad [600CP] (Children of an Elder God) Ilek-Vad is a city of magic. Even ordinary people draw upon the power of spells, and artifacts of power are commonplace. This magic is well-known to you, and you are a master in its use; it is safer than the magic of Aklo, and does not require such extensive preparation, sacrifices, or ritual tools. However, it likewise cannot accomplish acts quite as grand; for instance, it has no capacity to resurrect the deceased. It is not a magic well-inclined to combat; the people of Ilek-Vad had no magical means to defeat the sea monster that threatened their city, and had to rely on the strength of arms of Celephais’ Knight of Courage to slay the beast. Not to say that magic has no use in combat. The smiths of Ilek-Vad are capable of producing astounding weapons that bear mystical enchantments, and you too are skilled in this fine art; not only crafting tools of such beauty and elegance that they seem like they would only function in dreams (while still being entirely practical in the waking world), but you can enchant such equipment with magical spells to imbue them with special powers, such as a sword that bursts into flame.",

In addition to the raw power, these weapons tend to be inherently harmful to their source on a genetic level, such that simply launching them into the target could do substantial damage.",

      "description": "Sight Beyond Mortal Eyes [400CP] (Fate/Legend: Garden of Avalon) This is the mark of a magus destined for greatness. You are a clairvoyant, a being that can see into the future and into the past and even to far away places as easily as you see the things in front of you right now. At the moment, your range is not too far. You could peer for a few moments into the future of tomorrow or spend an hour visiting a week in the past or even watch events occurring several kilometers away without being present. But as you practice with this, and as your magical skill improves in general, your range in time and space will improve and you will even be able to combine your future/past sight with your ability to watch distant locations. Grand [1200CP] (Fate/Legend: Garden of Avalon) The truth of magecraft is thus. It is not power that matters, not really. It is knowledge and skill and talent that allows one to become unsurpassed in this field. A true master of the arts does not need the power of a thousand magi to blow up a fortress. He just needs a spark of mana and the right words to utilize it properly. And a master like that is far below you. Among all the magi in the world and those from history long since past, you are something special. A magus with such skill and knowledge that they have the potential to be a Grand Servant. There is little to no discipline of magecraft that you have not mastered to such an extent that others think you are wielding True Magic. Almost no spell you do not know as intimately as a husband knows his wife of several decades. No inch of your own magical circuits or energy that you do not exert absolute and total mastery over. Merlin the Incubus, Solomon the King of Magic. The names of the only two other magi to be your equal in knowledge and skill, though the matter of magical energy and power is something different. Perhaps you could find a way to take that too? (Editor’s Note: Increased the price of the Grand perk from 800CP to 1200CP.)",

      "description": "Desaad’s Ways [200CP] (DC Fourth World) Knives, racks, ropes, whips...you’ve learned well from the Apokoliptian torture artist, whether enduring his tender ministrations or being a disciple. Perhaps both. Beyond simple minute-to-minute sadism, you are an artist when it comes to the art of torture both physical and psychological. With a well-secured captive, you can make them scream or sing with enough time and effort, reducing even the strongest-willed hero into a traumatized and fearful wreck of themselves. A little more than that and you can make them pliant and broken, open to being remolded in your image. Be aware, keeping the captive secure and how much effort it will take to break them depends on just how strong your subject is...but if you keep them in your loving care long enough? Not even a miracle will save their souls. For Goodness Sake [400CP] (DC Fourth World) Young or old, the mind is an impressionable thing. All those values and memories so many hold dear...so easy to pick apart and mold into something much more useful. You’ve learned well in the ways of Granny Goodness, skilled in brainwashing others with both psychological warfare and the proper application of technology. You’re especially talented in raising impressionable youths into fanatical followers, or remolding the mentally broken into twisted and blindly loyal shadows of themselves, changed to suit whatever use you may have for them. Even if someone should break free from your doctrine, the lessons you burned into their being will always gnaw at them and torture them, freezing them with terror as they struggle to maintain themselves, only the strongest wills able to free themselves completely. Warmaster [400CP] (DC Fourth World) War is a glorious thing. The sight of entire armies being routed and slaughtered, homes and factories burning as the boundary between soldier and civilian disappears, and the terror that grips those fearing they’ll see another day...it’s everything you could want and more, isn’t it? You are a master of tactics and strategy on the battlefield, but especially in matters of massacre and abuse of your opponents. You know how to brutalize and demoralize your enemies in the most vicious ways possible, and how to best make use of what others would call atrocities or war crimes to damage their will to fight. They will find no righteous anger in proper use of this talent...merely despair and exhaustion at their foe’s lack of mercy. King of Fools [600CP] (DC Fourth World) The world is full of fools who seek to slake their own lusts or ambition, black-hearted sorts with more vice than sense. Some even become what humans call ‘supervillains’, those who use their genius or innate power to further themselves or tear down others. But you have been at this game longer than any of them, being the very concept of an aspect of evil. You are a master of long-term schemes and manipulation, particularly when it comes to using both heroes and other villains as pawns. Like pieces on a board, you move others into advantageous spots through minions or your personal dealings, even able to use thousands of specific individuals or whole organizations to suit your goals, even those wise to your nature. Just from a few unexpected visits to the homes of your enemies or associates, you can spin a vast web of conspiracy and control, with even your staunchest opponents unaware of your dealings or desires until you choose to reveal yourself. Even those who believe themselves above Gods or possess greater power than you are easy to move into positions you need them to be, and only the greatest detective or seer could hope to discern your influence.",

With your skill set, you can easily set up connections necessary to establish a virtual network and troubleshooting problems related to such matters is a straightforward process. You have a basic ability to “construct” objects in virtual space, but it requires that you know the desired object at least to the level an expert would, and the more complex the object the longer it takes to construct. With time, you might be able to fabricate basic digital constructs in real life, like a basic structure conversion tower... Dismantler [500CP] (Blame!)

They appear in the City, they tear open a path of destruction, and shortly after they are subdued...they return back to life in another position. The presence of the Structure Conversion Towers seems to be key to this resurrection process – as new Safeguard always seem to appear near these daunting structures. You’ve gained the knowledge to not only create these black obelisks; you’ve also gained the knowledge to create new Safeguard. When you come to understand the nature of the Safeguard and realize that they were originally security programs intended to protect the Net Sphere, suddenly the process of creating them doesn’t seem so peculiar. Perhaps the only peculiarity exists in the fact that you don’t consume standard materials in the genesis process – but rather a substantial amount of electricity and energy. Not that you can’t toss in materials to strengthen the final product further. A further peculiarity exists in the Safeguard that you create – as they answer to you regardless of distance, so long as they are within range of one of your Structure Conversion Towers. It’s going to take you quite some time and practice before you can make the whole process any quicker. With enough spare bodies, resurrecting yourself should you come to a point of near death near a SCT is completely possible as well – though you’ll have to conscious enough to actively proceed with the resurrection. Hopefully you’ve prepared the spare body sufficiently, because it’ll likely take a very long time for a spare body to reach the same level of strength as your own.

Any time you want to come off as sexy or just talk in a lightheartedly dirty manner, it's easy as pie for you. Want to make some people squirm with an implication? Done. You can even implement this in your battle quips, throwing them off their game for that moment of distraction you need. Jingle of Jazz (Bayonetta) You've got a soundtrack now! Whether you want it to be peppy and sound like something out of a club, or go to the other end of the spectrum with ominous latin chanting and heavy orchestra, it's up to you! Go nuts and remember to keep it how you like it. Heck, you can make it a soft jazz note fit for a bar if you wanted. Classy Contortionist (Bayonetta) -Um... this is something. You've got an innate sense of posing that you can utilize, whether it be to show off your sexiness or simply throw people off their game. It's got all kinds of applications, and no matter what you're always going to look good. Throw it into your battle styles or something. Small Beginnings (Bayonetta) Maybe you didn't have a weapon starting out, or you just want to start something new. There's a nice feeling to trying to start a legend, after all, to go into the world with a unique weapon all your own. You start with a single melee or ranged weapon, to be used in the Weapon Customization Table. (Editor’s Note: This appears to grant 1000SP for weapon customisation specifically; that won’t be listed here, but if you decide to give your character Small Beginnings feel free to go dig through the document to your heart’s content)",

When loaded into a weapon, they will change shape to match the necessary ammo type, and function as normal. A blood bullet loaded into a pistol will match the caliber, become a shell for a shotgun, and even fuel for a flamethrower, though is unable to become anything too complex. This ability is unable to make blood bullets in greater numbers, as using it again will cause previous bullets to lose cohesion. A single blood bullet is unable to take the shape of significantly larger projectiles, such as cannon balls, but if multiple bullets with a combined mass equal or at least close to the desired projectile are placed together, they will fuse and assume the proper shape.” Visceral Attack (Bloodborne) “Due to the use of blood ministration on you, or just because your status demands it, your inner beast has awoken. As with almost all hunters, and no matter which Aspect you chose, you have the ability to draw on some of this power with great focus and strain. This allows you to perform very minor feats when given time, such as partially transforming your arm into a stronger, clawed form to deliver a terrible strike.

Stickers that have been attached to the tape will allow you to use various special moves and abilities, and when it is used, the tape can ‘rank up’, gaining up to five stars and gaining a new sticker with each star. Once a tape reaches five stars, it is often possible for it to be ‘remastered’, evolving into a more powerful form of monster with better stats, and then it can be ranked up once again. When a tape can’t be ranked up anymore, it will still gain EXP and generate random stickers when used enough times. You are also able to load blank tapes into your cassette player, using those tapes to record target monsters, though you have to be untransformed to record. First Tape (Cassette Beasts) To start with, you will gain a basic tape with a monster on it. This could be one of the two ‘canonical starters’ (Candevil or Bansheep), or any non-remastered, non-legendary monster. Alternatively, this could be a personalized monster, like the monsters that the various partners in the game use, one that is tailored to mirror your talents and interests. Backup Tapes (Cassette Beasts) While here, you can potentially record any number of monsters to tape. Even after you leave, those tapes can continue to rank up and be remastered. Additionally, you can use tapes to try and record supernatural creatures and monsters you encounter in future Jumps to gain a ‘Cassette Beast’ version of them. It will be easiest to record creatures that are similarly based in thoughts and dreams, as the monsters here are, but there will be at least a slim chance to record a version of any supernatural creature or monster you encounter.",

These souls are free to be taken and they possess power. The stronger its owner, the stronger the soul. Of course, steps must be taken in order to use that power for oneself. Merely taking the souls of others will not make you stronger, at least not immediately. From now on, wherever you go, you shall absorb the souls of those you slay and those slain around you, to be used however you see fit. Whether you wish to forge these souls into weapons, strengthen yourself with them, or merely give them away, it is your choice. Sounds of the Dark (Dark Souls Series) Surprisingly, for a world that causes countless beings to be consumed by rage, this land holds many things of beauty. One of the more interesting things is the music. Whether it’s the boss themes or some truly morose music, this world has many different themes. This perk will grant you all of the music used in this world along with any remixes that have been created. Lastly, you will gain a personalized theme made with the style of Dark Souls. This can merge with any other music related perks if you have them. Estus Flask (Dark Souls Series) An Estus Flask, a flask made of pure emerald, conjured from the soul of a firekeeper to be gifted to those who would protect the keeper or the flame. To drink of the estus within this flask is to restore one’s health and vitality. The stronger a being is, the less proportional to their peak well-being may be restored, but no matter their power, no less than half their maximum may be recovered. You may drink from this flask five times before it is emptied entirely. You may refill this flask by simply resting by the presence of a bonfire or, barring that, a sufficiently well-kept flame. You receive one flask for free and may purchase more for 50CP each. Ashen Estus Flask (Dark Souls Series) Similar to the item above, this is an Estus Flask. But there are a few key differences. Through some process or another, this flask is cold to the touch, the Estus inside glowing blue rather than the liquid fire within a regular Estus Flask. The other difference is the flask’s healing properties. To drink of the estus within this flask is to restore one’s mind and magical energy rather than healing one’s body. Much like a regular Estus Flask, you can only drink from the flask five times before it runs dry. To refill it, you must simply rest by a bonfire or a particularly well-kept flame. As above, you receive one flask for free and may purchase more for 50CP each.",

However, it will take great skill and effort to pull off anything like blocking attacks with the back of your hand, or playing an air guitar that actually produces audible sound for others to hear. But never fear, if you train hard enough, and git gud enough, you too will be able to deflect bullets with other bullets, destroy buildings by spouting out innuendos, and become a worthy disciple of my ways. And yes, you totally get to see your rank whenever you're doing anything. Taunts (Devil May Cry) Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries! You are able to come up with witty dialogue, insults, jokes, and one-liners on the fly. Now, taunting does three very useful things. First, it will boost your Style rating. I know, I know, that's amazing, and awesome, and all that. Second, taunting pisses off your enemies. A lot. So much that they'll try to stomp your pretty little face in. While this may seem like a bad thing, it can also be good for you, as the dumbass you're fighting will make a mistake in their rage. And thirdly, a successful taunt will help you get your game on and replenish your stamina. You won't be able to run entirely on smack-talking suckers while you rip them a new rectal cavity, but it will definitely ensure that you'll be able to fight for hours, sustained only by the power of your quips. Weapon Swapping (Devil May Cry) The ability to swap between your weapons in the middle of battle. These weapons are stored in a pocket dimension known only to you, and can be switched instantly with but a thought. Sick Clothing (Devil May Cry) Stylish boots with spurs and neat western designs, cool and comfy pants that always fit, ballin’ shirts that can actually look amazing when the collar is popped. With each purchase, you get an entire Sick outfit that's resistant to all wear and tear. If destroyed it will respawn in your warehouse. It will retain any intended alterations , it is self cleaning and self repairing so long as to keep its dry cleaning and tailoring repair costs down. Be aware any future jump rare materials might take years to self repair.

The only common trait is that sorcerers produce a black smoke to manifest their abilities, but the amount of smoke that they can produce and the quality of their abilities vary greatly depending on the sorcerer in question. Not only that, but also the skill of the sorcerer can influence the results of their magic. Just with this, you will have a moderate amount of smoke, enough to manifest your magic at will and create the doors that connect the Sorcerer’s Realm and Hole. This smoke is produced by a special organ located near the gut, known as the ‘weak point’ of sorcerers by the Cross-Eyes. This organ creates their magical black smoke that is usually expelled from the body through large veins that run up to the sorcerer’s finger tips, and in some rare cases, also through the mouth. You may choose whether you have that trait or not for free. Now, you may select one, and only one, of the following tier of magic for you to use, as well as deciding on an ability that fits your tier. Common Magics (Dorohedoro) These magics usually follow a dubious useful theme, like transforming things into a specific thing or creating regular smoke bullets. Powerful sorcerers with these kinds of magics are rare, as it would require a lot of natural smoke production and talent to make use of them offensively or to gain money.

A fragment of Grace clings to you, permitting you to claim Runes from those you slay even in future worlds-and even if you yourself are not a Tarnished. Consider Runes to be a sort of life energy closely bound to but not strictly speaking part of the soul, which with the aid of a Finger Maiden (or perhaps, similarly powerful being or force capable of manipulating spiritual energy) can be used to increase your strengths and abilities-or be removed from your body and traded away. Particularly powerful individuals possess Remembrances- mystical records of light produced by the Erdtree which can be used to forge items, spells, or Ashes of War: Unique signature fighting moves used by truly accomplished warriors and other figures of legend, more akin to transcendent martial techniques than the sorcery and incantations of this world. Divine ones on par with the demigods of this world or even Empyreans may even have Great Runes of their own: Runes that embody their core divine traits. For an extra 200 CP you may toggle on the propagation of Runes and Ashes of War in future worlds. All living things-including cosmic beings and gods-will generate a certain amount of Runes, the process become as natural metaphysically intrinsic to the local realm of existence you’re in as it is in the Lands Between. Likewise, the remains of those with martial techniques of great power will manifest that can be used to relearn them. By your investment here you yourself have somehow obtained the ability to extract for yourself strength from these Runes. While spiritually or divinely sensitive beings may be able to figure out a way, as a unique ability by taking someone’s hand and concentration for a moment you may grant them the ability to gather runes from those they slay. Beware: This gift, once given, cannot be easily taken back.

These not only generate prana, the basic magical unit made through the combination of Mana and Od, but are also what allows any Magus to manipulate their energies to cast magic. They vary greatly in number and quality between individuals. Strenuous use of them can cause pain and numbness, whilst any use at all will heat the physical body up. You begin with an average amount of circuits, 20 in total, but each circuit is of exceedingly high quality, equal to the Circuits of Tohsaka Rin. They will not naturally grow but artificial means to increase them do exist. Basic Training (Fate Stay Night) Everyone has to start somewhere. No matter who you started as in this place, you've got the basic knowledge any magic user has. You know the core arts of Reinforcement, Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft at an average level. Reinforcement is the enhancement of the functions of beings or objects through magical energy. You could make yourself as strong and fast as an Olympic athlete or enhance your senses to the best of human ability and so on, or you could increase the sharpness of a sword to cut through steel or the durability of a shield to endure small calibre firearms with ease. Things can only be reinforced so much at a particular skill level before they simply explode from overstuffing. Gradation Air is shaping magical energy into the form of an item, which temporarily becomes real. You could make a sturdy but mundane sword or shield with this, though they would not last more than a few minutes at a time. Hypnosis is the basic form of mind control all Magi learn to use. It can be easily shrugged off by any supernatural being or magic user at this level but manipulating ordinary humans is quite easy and only those with exceptional willpower be able[sic] to resist the use of this without magic to back them up. Formalcraft, generally considered magecraft for dummies, is a way for Magi to use the mana in the air, along with sacrifices or ritual preparation, to make casting spells easier or possible at all for those with little personal magical energy. All of these can be improved with time, sometimes to terrifying levels, but it will take effort and time. The Most Remixable Song (Fate Stay Night) Everyone gets one, sooner or later. You’re able to play your very own personal version of the Emiya themesong. Remixed using any of the existing versions as a base, it’s a surprisingly epic yet fitting theme for you. If you want, your opponents and allies will also be able to hear the song, though it won’t be loud enough to be very distracting. It’ll definitely help get you guys hyped up though.",

You are skilled in the use of all four basic disciplines for no cost, the equal of an adult magus who completed their training in each area and was notably skilled. Magical Legacy (Fate Zero) To be called a real magical lineage, a family needs to have a notable specialisation. Something that separates them from any other family. This is the focus of generations of work, from the head and heir of each family at the very least, and often all other members contribute too. Whether you have a family or not, you have been trained to a level of excellent quality in one magical discipline of your choice.

Even if you were a fantasy, you could exist in the real world. Being a member of a Lostbelt is in no way harmful or risky for you; even if the Lostbelt were to collapse, you’d be left alive where it once stood none the worse for wear. With an act of will, you can gift a copy of this perk to other people to ensure that they too would be able to live in an environment where they would otherwise be dismissed as a fantasy. (Editor’s Note: I’ve only added the relevant description for the Truth From Fantasy freebie. And there is more to the perk with 400CP, but you will have to read that for yourself in the Fate: The Island of Sin jump.)",

      "description": "Even More Gratuitously Large Book of Achievements (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath) You gain a book of more than 600 achievements for things that you can do in this world, customized to your personal skillset and purchases here. The book keeps a record of all your previous achievements in previous worlds as well as creating 600 new achievements for you to complete in any future jump. If you have the ability to return to a previous jump, you may complete any achievements you may have missed completing the first time through. Completing achievements will increase your skill in magic over time. For every 100 achievements that you complete in a single world, you’ll gain a mid-tier talisman fragment. If you ever manage to complete every achievement in a single jump, you will be rewarded with a single talisman fragment of godlike quality. Literally. You would need to kill a god in order to get a comparable fragment. Talisman (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath) This is a magical trinket soul bound to its user that holds up to 25 shards of defeated enemy’s souls, commonly called Talisman Fragments. The shards fit together like puzzle pieces, and their combined effects can raise every aspect of a mage’s skill by an order of magnitude or more, although such a talisman would take painstaking centuries to construct. You can import any magical trinket to use as your talisman, and you also learn how to teach others to make them. Unfortunately, only enemies that you are personally responsible for the defeat of will ever provide a soul shard that works for your talisman. See Talisman Customization for more details. Talisman Customisation The talisman is one of a wizard’s strongest weapons, since it provides a permanent boost to their abilities and can never be lost or broken, since it is bound to the soul. Talismans are created by carefully filling the elaborate little shape with shards of souls from enemies that you have personally defeated. Up to 25 shards can be used in crafting a single talisman, and shards may be swapped out for better ones as you find them. Any time you kill or permanently banish an enemy, there is about a one percent chance that they leave a shard behind. Don’t worry, you collect the shards automatically, so you don’t need to go hunting for them. Each shard will provide some bonuses to a mage’s power or skills in some way. More powerful shards will both provide a higher bonus, as well as provide more types of bonuses at once. To unlock a shard’s true potential, it must be painstakingly polished, which can only be done with materials imbued with many shadow cores, or with ground up lesser shards. Higher level shards will require proportionally more expensive materials to polish. Shards that share similar effects will provide more than the sum of their parts, so it’s worth searching out several shards that have overlapping effects. Of course, this is more common on stronger shards that have more effects to begin with, but the synergies are even higher if multiple effects overlap, which gets increasingly unlikely. Some of the examples of the bonuses that shards can provide are: Bonus damage against a specific type of foe, Higher base mana capacity or regen, Higher skill in a certain type of magic, Higher base improvement rate for a certain skill, Slight chance for a chain effect on mundane magic spells, Stronger attacks from a specific element or magic type, Longer lasting effects from debuffs on enemies or buffs on allies, Small bonus to the base improvement of all magic, Etc. If a human level enemy provides a shard, expect a single bonus. If a strong but mundane monster provides a shard, expect two or three bonuses. If a powerful supernatural threat provides a shard, expect four to six bonuses. If a demi-god or powerful demon provides a shard, expect seven to ten bonuses. If you are lucky enough to get a shard from a god-like being, expect as many as a dozen bonuses. Additionally, you will always receive a single shard at the end of each jump. It will always be of at least medium quality, but it will receive a bonus depending on the danger present in the jump you just finished. In a jump like 40k, expect an extremely high quality shard as a reward for finishing the jump. Companions that have been taught to make talismans will receive shards under the same circumstances you would, but they only receive the jump shard if they are imported during that jump.",

      "description": "Summoning Basics (Generic Summoner) This perk gives you an understanding of the basics all summoners are expected to know and gives you the ability to summon in the first place. Summons typically remain active for an hour before a cooldown of twice that time and a summon cannot go beyond roughly 30 meters from the summoner. A summoner cannot normally have more than three summons active at any time. All of these may be trained up to increase the active time, decrease the cooldown time, increase the range of the summons, and increase the number of summons. Summoning may also cause physical or mental fatigue, dependent on the power of the summon compared to the summoner, limiting the summoner to some degree as they cannot easily summon something significantly stronger than themselves without causing severe fatigue, unconsciousness, or even death if they overtax themselves. This fatigue can be reduced over time with practice, increasing the power and endurance of the summoner. By default, you can choose if your summons are the same individual each time or a snapshot of a creature. The former are capable of learning and developing, but will have personality quirks and will remember how you utilized their abilities while the latter will be predictable in how it will react but will reset each time it is summoned. Summoner Archetype (Generic Summoner) There are several types of summoners with different ways of acquiring new summons, and this perk represents those various methods, which may possess some additional features that allow them to be used in other ways. On purchase, you may choose one of the following methods of acquiring summons to gain the ability yourself. Some methods of acquiring summons are more potent than others and will have an additional cost to them, as shown in the entries below. If an entry has a cost listed, it is in addition to the base cost of this perk. Basic Summons (Generic Summoner) If you're going to be a summoner, you need to have something to summon, right? This option grants you a contracted summon of some power that you can conjure forth at will. It can be a conjured animal on par with a small group of wolves, a series of minor creatures with an array of utility features, such as a glowfly to provide light, a small dog for tracking, or a crow that is capable of speech (generally, five such creatures on a similar level is the norm), or a single large creature that can match the other two in terms of abilities or threat level. Each additional purchase grants another set of creatures you can summon. (Editor’s Note: The price for additional summons are 50CP each. All of the options for the Summoner Archetype perk can be found in it’s original jump, there are two options for 100CP and 200CP respectively. And one Custom archetype which allows you to create one for either free or 100CP and 200CP, depending if you want to have a strong/complex summoning method or an exceptionally powerful one.)",

      "source": "Glitchtale",
      "description": "The Very Essence of One’s Being (Glitchtale) The soul, the very essence of one’s being, in this world is a very present concept. Everyone has a soul, whether one is a monster or a human. Including you. If you’re a Monster, your soul looks like a glowing white upside-down heart, made of love, hope and compassion and naturally with little to no Determination inside it. The monster souls are the weakest type of soul. If you’re a Human, your soul is clearly superior due to the permanent presence of Determination. Each human soul is unique and can be divided into different Soul Traits. Your soul has a heart-shaped form, with its color varying depending on your Soul Trait(s). Bravery (Glitchtale) The Soul of those who possess Bravery as their Soul Trait is orange. This is the only aspect that can be divided into moral and physical aspects. The magic of this trait is focused in spawning magic spheres and creating weapons made of magic, as well capable of generating explosive magic and manipulating orange fire, as a form of pyrokinesis. Losing this trait might be the cause of humiliation or being filled with cowardice. Justice (Glitchtale) The Soul of those who possess Justice as their Soul Trait is yellow. One of the easiest traits to be identified in a group according to their personality. Justice’s magic will rarely be affected negatively by a situation since the wizard lies on their own morals and decisions to boost their magic. The magic of this trait is focused in using ranged attacks, capable of enhancing mundane ranged weapons, and capable of creating the Armor of Yellow, an invisible barrier that surrounds the user’s body, to enhance their defensive capacity. Some more talented wizards with this Soul Trait are also capable of using telekinesis, being able to levitate themselves or use it on other physical objects. It is possible to lose this trait when a justice soul does something in their view that is incorrect or no longer has the willpower to serve justice. Kindness (Glitchtale) The Soul of those who possess Kindness as their Soul Trait is green. This is the rarest trait in terms of quantity, because of the cruel human nature. While every human possesses kindness, very few will decide to practice it and live by it with enough willpower to make it their trait. The magic of this trait is unique, having powerful healing magic and the capacity of creating a shield, as well manipulating its size and shape, capable of blocking almost anything, depending on the wizard’s expertise and/or power. Due to their pure essence, the Kindness Souls can’t be affected by HATE. Losing this trait might be a cause of selfishness or cruelty to others. Patience (Glitchtale) The Soul of those who possess Patience as their Soul Trait is light blue/cyan. The magic of this trait is known to be extremely flexible and unpredictable. The most common usage of this magic is to spawn and manipulate strings/ropes from the user’s hands, but, under very rare circumstances, few wizards acquire the ability of time manipulation, being able to slow down the time people and objects to varying degrees. Like Kindness magic, Patience magic is usually used as defensive magic. Losing this trait may be the result of accumulation of impatience. Integrity (Glitchtale) The Soul of those who possess Integrity as their Soul Trait is blue. This is the most common trait, making up the majority of humankind. It’s also the trait that is most likely to become a Grey Soul. It is inside a human’s nature to lie or to break your own morals to do something. Even when it's the right choice, an Integrity wizard’s magic can be affected by it. Compared to the other traits, their stability is very fragile. If an Integrity wizard is both morally and emotionally strong, they might turn into one of the most powerful kinds of magic known to date. The magic of this trait can be used to generate weapons made of magic, being able to create many different kinds of weapons, like the other traits, and having the ability of gravity manipulation, in some cases. Perseverance (Glitchtale) The Soul of those who possess Perseverance as their Soul Trait is purple. This trait, like Justice, is well known for being a stable and powerful kind of magic, known to focus on destroying defenses and negating regenerative ability. This magic is focused on close-range combat, but still is capable of using ranged attacks and capable of manifesting an armor to protect the user or arms blades to use as weapons. Perseverance wizards tend to become stronger as more adrenaline is gained during battle. To lose this trait, the person must either give up or become slothful. (Editor’s Note: You may only choose one soul trait. Alternatively you can buy the DETERMINATION Soul Trait for 500CP and an Inverted Trait for 300CP or 500CP.)",

The art of magic is otherworldly and requires the mastery of the supernatural. Spirits must be called upon to wield its power, and the tools of choice are Symbols. But be it through the command of arcane tools, or by binding the spirits to serve under your will, magic will answer your call. A Pitiful Ghost Who’s Lost His Way (GrimGrimoire) The most powerful mages cling to this world. They might learn to control their age by manipulating how close or far they are from death, use alchemy to master flesh, call upon the temptations of hell through compulsion or contact, or invoke the eternity of the elves. Still... There is one path open to all. To cling to the world as a ghost. To manage such as a being of power is no small accomplishment, and this perk will do nothing to enable that. But if you manage it, it will count. Only when your soul falls will it count as death. A Hale Mind in a Hale Body (GrimGrimoire) For all that it is seen as an intellectual pursuit, magic often ends up a physically demanding discipline, if only in an indirect manner. Whether it be escaping from the pursuit of rogue creations, or solving an issue with fistcuffs before it turns to spells, a wise mage tempers both body and mind. You are not exempt from this, and so you may rest easy knowing that your form is fit and trim, bearing no defects that came from the womb, from neglect, or from old injury. You might not be at the true pinnacle of health, but if you claimed to be an athlete, your abilities wouldn’t gain that statement.",

      "description": "Origin and Element (Kara no Kyokai) Origin and Element are attributes of the soul and one’s deepest being in this world. Everyone has one of each, some people have more, but this just helps you decide on the importance of your own ones. An Origin is like a concept, a word, that is at the core of your character. It might describe a secret side of you that you rarely show, it might show influence through every action you take or it might just be something you really love about yourself. Taboo for someone who feels a forbidden love, Worthlessness for someone who seems to be a complete failure, Nostalgia for a man who considers his memories dearly important. An Origin by itself doesn’t have much of an effect, merely lying unawakened. Some kinds of magecraft can eventually build on your Origin, such as a Taboo Origin holder eventually learning to invest that effect into an item that uninhibits the taboos of others. But these usually require quite high level skill and have subtle effects outside of extensive experimentation. You have an Origin of your choice, a normal one that is Unawakened and gives no real boons but has no real hindrance either. An Element is more important, at least for a Magus. It describes something like your affinity for certain kinds of magic, significantly increasing talent in that area. Or rather, most Magi find it quite difficult to learn all but the most general magecraft outside of their Element. Far from impossible but much more inefficient. Most people have an Affinity for one of the five primary elements- Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Ether. These ascribe to much more than just basic elementalism. Fire might cover consumption, energy transfer or fuel. Earth may relate to cultivation and embedding of energy. Water covers the flow and cycle and combination of things. And so on. You have an moderately strong affinity for an Element of your choice. One of the primary five is recommended but if you know of an alternate choice, you can pick one, as long as it’s not superior to the primary five. No Average Ones with talent for all five Elements and no uniquely powerful Element. Magic Circuits (Kara no Kyokai) The pathways through which magical energy mixes, flows and is expended. The circuits appear on your soul, though physical reflections can be found within your physical body, and generate heat when in active use. All magus have these circuits and they can sometimes be found in lesser forms even outside of magus lineages. As a benefit of entering this world, you’ve got at least the potential to use magic. You’re not particularly exceptional in terms of your circuits with just this but you’re no cripple either. You’ve got a fairy[sic] standard 20 circuits in your body, each one of decent but not exceptional quality.

If you purchase the Magic Crest item, purchases may instead be used to improve upon it at an equal rate rather than adding to your innate circuit count. (Editor’s Note: For Elemental Affinity, you can buy additional affinities up to four for 100CP each. And for Magic Circuits, you can buy additional twenty average magic circuits for 200CP each.)",

      "description": "This is what you’re here for, you have your very own Klyntar Symbiote. It starts relatively weak, able to make an ordinary human slightly stronger than Spider-Man with proportionate enhancements to speed, healing, and toughness, as well as the ability to generate a handful of thick tentacles or dozens of thinner tendrils for a variety of purposes. Your symbiote can produce fangs and claws as well, as well as simple melee weapons like blades or bludgeons. Additionally, your other both feeds on and sustains you: As long as you’re bonded, you can go without food and water indefinitely and your symbiote can exchange oxygen with the environment for you and recycle the CO2 you produce back into oxygen, letting you breathe underwater, go without having to manually breathe if need be, and last months without breathing at all in a pinch. Your symbiote can protect you from all but the strongest of supernatural diseases, can help regulate your body chemistry, and slows your aging to a crawl. However, it can’t keep you alive forever and is highly vulnerable to extreme heat and loud noises. A heat wave or a fireworks show isn’t going to do more than make it uncomfortable, but anything legitimately dangerous is far more so to it. The good news, however, is that heat is pretty much the only way to kill it, barring exotic effects. This perk can be freely merged with other perks representing symbiotic entities attached to your body unless such a perk has an import fee. Finally, you gain access to the following Perks while bonded to your symbiote, though upgrades must be purchased for the listed price and you are permitted to opt out of ones you don’t want or need. (Editor’s Note: There are additional free perks that come with the Symbiote that you can get on the Marvel Comics: Symbiotes jump. Along with paid additions if you have the CP. Also, there is a payable version of this perk that gives 200CP upon buying the perk for the same price to be used on the other Symbiote perks.)",

      "description": "Off The Watch List (Marvel Studios What If… ?) It would be unfortunate, not to mention rather unfair, to be erased from existence or otherwise targeted because you’re not ‘supposed’ to exist in this particular reality, or struck down without warning because your mere presence is interfering with some grand cosmic plan. Now, entities and organisations such as The Watcher, The Ancient One and The TVA either won’t notice your presence and actions, not notice you as anything unusual, or will assume what you are doing is all according to a greater plan that they believe in. They’ll completely overlook or ignore you, preventing them from doing anything about your interference or presence... unless you go after them directly, at which point they might take notice. Remarkable Person (Marvel Studios What If… ?) Being an entirely mundane human in worlds filled with marvels might not be what you want. Now, you’ll have at least the capability to begin matching such people. This will have a more general component based on features of a setting, such as the potential to use magical capabilities if a setting would allow it, even if only a select few in the setting could use it. While having the barest capability to fit in within a setting could be useful, you will find that anything that would be particularly applicable for your chosen Origin will be significantly beyond the basics. For example, picking an Origin related to the study and use of magic will not only ensure you have the ability to use it, but a moderate amount of experience and capability with it even without other Perks and additional experience. The Sacred Jumper (Marvel Studios What If… ?) If you had any concerns that the timeline you are in might abruptly vanish, perhaps due to a cosmic battle between multi-dimensional entities or due to the actions of those who would seek to control reality by erasing unwanted timelines, you might appreciate this. So long as you didn’t do anything that you know would have caused it to be otherwise, your timeline and reality will remain intact. Cosmic battles you aren’t involved in won’t shatter it as collateral damage, and neither natural timeline-erasing forces nor artificial methods will abruptly end your journey. Of course, if you deliberately break space-time or actively get into a fight with something that could shatter reality, this protection won’t stop the consequences of your actions. Marvellous Animation (Marvel Studios What If… ?) As an outsider, you might have noticed that this bit of reality might look a bit... different to the rest of the MCU. Maybe you like it, maybe not. But now you have something of a choice, as you can now view any particular reality in a way that you prefer, even if it’s different to how you originally perceived it. You might prefer your particular What If tales to be clearly live action, go somewhere else and keep the cel-shading style, or even pick some other art style that you prefer. Just be aware this only changes your perception; it doesn’t actually alter the underlying reality. Just because something that was originally highly realistic now looks more like a cartoon to you, it doesn’t mean that something like toon-physics will apply with this Perk alone. You can share this with others if you like, letting them see things the way you do, or letting them see things the way they prefer. Sir, They’re Gorgeous (Marvel Studios What If… ?) Well, maybe. Different realities might have slight differences even between different versions the same people, so this is your chance to alter your own appearance a little. Your aesthetic alterations are up to you, as long as it doesn’t give you any advantages you shouldn’t have without other Perks or abilities. This includes being particularly attractive, considering how much of an advantage that can be, so you can still look as good as you usually do, or be brought up to at least average for whatever you are, for free. Marvel Studios What If… ? (Marvel Studios What If… ?) Not everyone would want to see what happens here in the same way the Watcher does. You have the complete collection of the Marvel Studios What If...? series, including something to watch it on and a collection of concept art. It might be best not to let anyone here see this, if not just to avoid existential dread over the behind-the-scenes sections but annoyance that you might have been making popcorn while watching their suffering. What If… There Were Snacks? (Marvel Studios What If… ?) Even if you’re watching rather than taking part, you might get somewhat peckish. Now you have a replenishing supply of food and drinks that would be suitable to eat while watching something, such as ready-made popcorn. As it might attract attention or just annoy others who are trying to pay attention to whatever is being watched, it is somehow possible to eat and drink from this supply without the noise being heard by anyone else. What If… The Jumper Visited MCU What If? (Marvel Studios What If… ?) And what if they wanted to watch what they had been up to later? This record is blank for now, but when this Jump ends it will contain a recording of your time here in a style not unlike the What If episodes you might have seen. You can choose whether Jump-Chan or the Watcher will be narrating your story.",

      "description": "Soundtrack of Darkness (Omnibus New World of Darkness) To accompany your time here, you have access to a library of 2000’s and 2010’s music that was dark and edgy for the time: Death Metal, Speed Metal, Post-Hardcore, Dubstep, Electronica, Trance, etc. You get the idea. If you will it, you may have any song you choose play anywhere at anytime - no speakers required. Alternately, you may choose to have a dynamically cut and arranged score automatically generated for you. In either case, you may choose to make this music audible to everyone, just you, or just specific people you so choose. It Can’t Rain All the Time (Omnibus New World of Darkness) But it can rain most of the time. It is almost always overcast and frequently pouring down rain. Save for the red of blood and the bright shine of polished metal, most colors will seem faded and washed out. Black, white, and grey dominate the world’s color palette. Conventional electric lighting will be replaced with harsh fluorescent and neon alternatives. Architecture will take on a more Gothic, Brutalist, or Industrial feel. Black leather (and often trench coats or hoodies) will become more common aspects of individual attire; as will other trappings of the Goth, Punk, and Techno cultures. The atmosphere generated by this perk is cold, isolating, and oppressive, and it fosters despair, melancholy, rage, isolation, and violence. The world is dying and nothing seems to make it better. Barring your interference while this perk is active, hope and happiness slowly drain out of the world around you. This perk can be toggled on and off at will once you leave this world. Strangeness (Omnibus New World of Darkness) While the World of Darkness is a dark reflection of our own world, it can also be a mad one. All manners of strangeness suffuse the world. Some is innocuous[sic] if strange, like a ghost selling seafood from a wooden cart or laughter being the birth of pixies. Others are dangerous, such as a shady butchers shop selling tainted meat that infects buyers with The Hunger. Yet more are a mix of both, such as madmen who turn themselves into talking animals on the freeway during rush hour. Thankfully, you’ve learned to take it all in stride. Even the strangest things will seldom get more than a raised eyebrow from you unless you actively want to be affected. This isn’t a defense against things that cause metaphysical fear or terror or madness, but the strange will no longer bother you much at all.",

      "description": "Tolerance for Evil (Overlord (The Series)) The New World can be a brutal place. Regular annual wars, demi-human hordes raping and pillaging human nations to use them as livestock, rape, torture, and slavery being common, and the frequent abuses of power by the aristocracy. There’s a lot of problems in this world, and a great many of them would probably leave even the most even tempered man red-faced in anger and outrage at the mere thought of them. Not you, though. You have gained a tolerance for such acts, and can freely consider them based on their merits (if they have any), and are perfectly capable of carrying them out yourself if needs be. This does not make you evil and you don’t actually have to tolerate evil that you see, you’re just capable of doing so and can calmly and logically consider such things without undue or unnecessary bias. You’ll be perfectly able to kick a few puppies or burn down a few orphanages (or worse) and have no problems or mental compunctions of going through with the act, if you feel you really need to. This also gives you an ironclad stomach, you’ll never find yourself retching at scenes of gore or gagging at unpalatable smells or sights. Themed Aesthetics (Overlord (The Series)) If you’re a Warrior you appear to be physically powerful and imposing. If you’re a Magic Caster you appear to be a wise and erudite academic. If you’re a Generalist you appear to be a charming and affable rogue. Bottom line whatever you might be you tend to evoke the image of a classically good-looking version of it. Golden Coin Pouch (Overlord (The Series)) You’ve got access to a money pouch filled with a ‘respectable’ amount of gold coins. Respectable by the standards of a max level Yggdrasil Player at least. This amount of gold is enough to beggar the imagination of commoners and even landed nobility will consider it a ruinously large sum, easily into the tens of thousands. If you’re a Player it’s minted with YGGDRASIL iconography and is probably what you had in your inventory when you arrived in the New World, they’re sure to attract attention if you use them. If you’re a local it’s in local denominations, and god knows how you came across it. The pouch itself can hold any number of gold coins, but only gold coins, inside of it. One notable fact regarding these coins, and indeed Yggdrasil Gold Coins in general, is that they can substitute for many types of incidental materials or reagents when it comes to creating magical items or artifacts. For example as long as you have a scroll to work with the gold could substitute for inks to allow you to make a magic scroll, or special oils or unguents in a bit of clockwork, and so on and so forth. Hell, you can even use the stuff to garnish food and drink at no risk to the consumer. Basically, so long as you’ve got the “main” pieces for making something you can substitute in some Yggdrasil Gold for any of the incidental bits required in the process. Medium Tier Equipment (Overlord (The Series)) You have a free full set of medium tier equipment appropriate for your class. They’re of excellent quality and will serve you well. They provide slight boosts to your abilities but otherwise are merely serviceable. This is the kind of equipment you’d expect to see on elite, but otherwise normal, knights. It comes with a weapon, armor, and accessories appropriate to the classes you purchased in the ‘Class Skills’ perks. Companions get a set of this for free.",

Here, salt seems to be no mere condiment, but the name given to the material of which the very soul of people is made out of and yours too, now. Henceforth, in this world and others, you will be able to absorb the essence of life that is the salt that resides in others to empower yourself, gaining a greater haul the more powerful the foe felled and a chance to find ‘useful’ remains from their corpse; be it ashes, ears or even ribs. This salt can be channeled and coalesced at any creed’s sanctuary into black pearls to develop your abilities with a moment of meditation, guided by a vision of your own tree of life. Bound by Sanctuary [Free] (Salt & Sanctuary) As long as your stay in the Nameless Isle lasts, you will be carried back to Sanctuary upon death by a mysterious cleric for a small stipend of your gold, should you have any. This death will strip you of any salt, which will be stolen by your killer or will haunt the place of your death in the form of an otherworldly shadow known as the Saltbat, whose resilience and strength will scale with yours, though never amounting to more than a nuisance. Slay whoever it is that claims your salt and find it returned to you until you fall once again. A Brave, Foolish Curiosity [Free] (Salt & Sanctuary) You have history here, a life well or ill-lived, full of trials and tribulations that now seem small as you stand before the Isle. These memories are added to your own and you won’t be any less ‘you’. If anything, it’ll just feel like you remembered something you forgot, which is not unheard of in these parts. Choose one of the starting classes amongst Knight, Mage, Paladin, Thief, Chef, Cleric, Pauper, Hunter. You shall gain their skills, be it in wielding steel, bow, prayer, spells, incantations or cookery utensils. As for your gender and nationality, they are up to you, though your age will be locked between a late teenage youth and an elderly adult. (Editor’s Note: As the Nameless Isle and the Sanctuary won’t exist wherever the Darkest Tome ends up. Upon getting the Bound by Sanctuary perk and upon your death. You’ll be carried off to a place of worship. The more personal that place is to you, say one that you go to pray, or one that people go to pray to you. The more likely you’ll end up there.)",

This is more like the Charles Dickens version of reality, in which everything, motifs, themes and details reflect one another in ways that hint at some kind of pattern that you can usually grasp or sense if you’re paying attention to it. Everything just seems to be bursting with callbacks and references, giving seemingly greater weight to what is going on around you and occasionally hinting at adventures you had in other jumps - or will have in future jumps. Most of the time, these connections will only be obvious long after the effect, but occasionally you might be able to use this for some measure of insight into your current situation (by paying attention to the small details) - even to predict events or head off situations - even as a kind of shorthand for ‘what is important to the plot’ and ‘what is not worth paying attention to’. Everything that happens to you will be foreshadowed - often in ways that are bizarre or nonsensical, but if you keep your eyes open you never know what you might learn - or put together. Ninety-Nine (The Dark Tower) You develop an innate sense of the multiverse, allowing you to sense portals, hidden pathways, and dangers in your surroundings (spotting them is not the same as being able to travel them). It’s a largely unconscious awareness - but can easily allow you to take notice of things nobody else knows to look for - even if you don’t understand why. Comes with a healthy self-preservation instinct - you’ll never get too close to a thinny, or the like. Of course, this doesn’t create a portal network that wasn’t already there, and doesn’t allow you to travel to places you couldn’t get already - you’ll need other perks for that.",

      "description": "Speak Not the Name (Children of an Elder God) There is knowledge that is inherently dangerous to know; you may bring some snippets of knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos with you into this world. And simply by reading this document, you’ve been exposed to several names that are (or will become) dangerous to know—Y’golonac, Rei Ayanami, Yui Ikari. Simply thinking their names—or indeed, any alternate name they may go by—opens you up such that they might possess you for a time (although titles are safe, such as Y’golonac being known as “The Violator”). Fortunately, this document isn’t any sort of trap. You are utterly protected from being harmed or malignly affected by any knowledge you possess or acquire, or from thinking about that knowledge. Now, you can still be harmed by sharing knowledge, or by what you say. There is some knowledge that your mind simply cannot comprehend, and may harm itself in the process of trying. And this does nothing to protect you from sensory input or psychic attacks, and there remains that which will be dangerous in the process of learning. But simply having or thinking about information does not put you at risk. Finally, you will never say anything while unconscious that you would not say while awake. Don’t worry about sleep-talking the name of the Violator. Certainty of Existence (Children of an Elder God) If Nyarlathotep is to be believed, then individuality is an illusion; once you see the highest level of reality, you can see that all things and all beings are just components of Azathoth, separated to play out a story without narrative or plot, all for the purposes of entertaining a blind idiot god who doesn’t even realize what he’s doing. But if that’s the case, then what are you? Are you the only genuinely separate non-Azathoth entity that exists? Do you become a component of Azathoth while you’re here? And if you are a piece of Azathoth, what happens when you “die”, since you technically would still exist as a part of the Daemon Sultan? What happens to your Chain? And what happens when you leave? Dream Training (Children of an Elder God) The vast majority of dreams do not take place the Dreamlands; they occur in that nebulous realm between the waking world and the Dreamlands itself, and are fluid and subject to change. However, dreaming in such a fashion also leaves you vulnerable to a host of dangers that can affect you in your dreams. Learning how to send your mind all the way to the Dreamlands can help protect you from these attacks; it is not absolute, but it does allow you ways to defend yourself that you would otherwise lack, and allows you to know when you are in a dream or not. This training comes in many forms, but is always a challenge. For some, they descend into a pit of darkness in their dreams, and must make their way to the bottom. For some, they must climb a mountain. Others must find the 99 steps of dream from the Cavern of Eternal Flame, some swim across a river of piranhas, and yet others fight an initially-unstoppable beast or enemy. Sometimes this is a challenge that must be overcome, and sometimes it is simply a matter of enduring hardship until you reach the end. There are magic rituals to hasten this process. And… some people are just lucky, and are naturally capable of going to the Dreamlands in their sleep. But once you’ve intentionally traveled into the Dreamlands once, it is simple to continue to do so. Dream Walking (Children of an Elder God) When you are dreaming—but not in the Dreamlands—you can step out of your dreams to visit the dreams of other people. Dreamers that are near to your location in the physical world are closer to you as you search through dreams, and you gain a vague awareness of the contents of a dream and who the dreamer is before you enter it. An emotional connection also helps you find someone faster, and if you’ve been to their dream before, finding it again is a rapid process as long as they aren’t on the other side of the world. When you do enter the dream, you are not subject to the dream’s logic, nor to any sort of “lucid dream” effect. AT-Field (Children of an Elder God) What is the AT-Field? It’s not what it is in Neon Genesis Evangelion, that’s for sure. The AT-Field is something produced by Evangelions and Angels, and eventually by the Children (and presumably the Elder Gods). Most the powers present here are merely accomplished through specialized manipulations of the AT-Field, although they aren’t possible to merely “learn”. Rather, the capacity to use the AT-Field in a specific way is something innate (or something stolen). Still, there a few features of the AT-Field that are (mostly) universal. The AT-Field produces a barrier that can, technically, be pierced by conventional weaponry, but it takes incredible force; it took Unit00, Unit01, and Unit02 working together to contain the blast of an N2 mine (although this was at the beginning of their Angel-slaying careers), while a single mine was enough to severely damage Matriel. The AT-Field can also be wrapped around weaponry or your body, which can be used to try to force your way through an opposing AT-Field; you can also directly press your AT-Field against the AT-Field of another in an attempt to overwhelm them, allowing you to injure the enemy directly. Items can also be imbued with an AT-Field, as see when Salgiel turned an (extraordinarily large) spear-like tree into something capable of piercing through an Evangelion. You can even use your AT-Field inside of your own body, using it to “flush out” foreign influences such as poison, parasites, or eldritch infections. Angels, when directly exposed to a foreign AT-Field, such as that of an Evangelion, will start to turn grey, and begin to deteriorate as the AT-Field is pressed against them. This does, however, take some time to completely dissolve them. It’s best to immobilize them or surround them so they can’t escape. With training, an AT-Field can have its form manipulated in a variety of ways, from forming a blade to creating a basketball. Because almost all of these effects are the result of specialized AT-Field usage, they can be defended against with an AT-Field (or, in other settings, by sufficiently eldritch powers). (Editor’s Note: Certainty of Existence, Dream Training, and Dream Walking all have additional paragraphs about their effects in their original Jump.)",

Not only can you consciously evoke the blaze of your D.N.A. at will, but it’s potent enough to allow a digimon to reach Ultimate Level should you have a means to channel it, such as a digivice. Kin Sense (Digimon Data Squad) They say you only notice something once it’s missing, and that certainly holds true for Digimon. While outside of their native world they posses the extraordinary sense to detect the presence of other digital lifeforms, their relative strength compared to them, and whether they’re actively using their powers. At first this is little more than a “Hot to Cold” kind of feeling; but with practice and experience can be refined to extract more detailed information, and even be used within the digital world itself. Data Link Digivice (Digimon Data Squad) A miracle of science representing the hope of humans and digimon living together. This astounding device allows a human to safely focus and channel the power of their D.N.A. into a compatible partner digimon, while eliminating the risk of inducing madness outside of extreme circumstances. This process allows a digimon to digivolve; temporarily achieving its next evolutionary stage, healing their injuries, and restoring their vitality! Bearing a color pallet of white and the color of your D.N.A., these can handle up to a Full Charge of it’s system; sufficient to allow a digimon to reach Ultimate level so long as their partner had sufficiently potent D.N.A. to fuel the transformation. It can even store a digimon partner within, allowing them to always be by your side; and while they can’t use most of their powers from within, they can still communicate with you and employ their own extraordinary senses to aid you.",

      "source": "Don’t Rest Your Head",
      "description": "Awake (Don’t Rest Your Head) You are one of the Awake now, the veil that protects the Sleepers from the Nightmares has been lifted for you. You permanently no longer need to sleep. Supernatural effects such as abusing Exhaustion may still make you sleep, and if you do sleep you will be impossible to wake for a random number of days (at least one, not more than seven), lose your Madness and Exhaustion talents, as well as most of your Discipline until you force yourself to stay awake for a number of days equal to the number you slept. Then this perk will reactivate again, and you will be one of the Awake once more. Disciplined (Don’t Rest Your Head) All Awake function at least as competently as peak of human ability at every moment, represented by your Discipline, or the almost supernatural competence at performing every task you gain simply by keeping your head together and focused on your goal. Gaining Permanent Madness involves converting your Discipline into Madness, so you’re only going to remain skilled at everything as long as you keep your head together. Unlike the Talents in this section, Discipline is genuinely risk-free, and you need not worry about bad things happening solely because you relied on your Discipline. It is likely the only lifeline you’ve got in this hell and you better keep it close. Exhaustion Talent (Don’t Rest Your Head) Your Exhaustion talent is something you’re good at that gets taken up to frankly superhuman levels. You have a lot of leeway in deciding what your Exhaustion talent is, but it should fundamentally be something mundane you take up to inhuman levels. If you were a good runner, through Exhaustion you’ll be capable of matching a professional race car, or perhaps if you were a shooter you could curve bullets in physically impossible ways, and if you were a gambler your Exhaustion talent might swing your luck so hard you could win nearly any game of chance without effort. However, all Exhaustion talents come with the risk (and requirement, for the most powerful uses) of tiring you out significantly, leading to you progressively getting more and more exhausted until you can catch a lengthy break or worse, crash, suddenly falling asleep for days, up to a week at a time before waking up lacking all your talents and incapable of seeing the Nightmares. And being a magnet for every nearby Nightmare. Merely dying is considered a nicer fate than being caught by a Nightmare while still a powerless Sleeper. On the bright side, however, the more exhausted you are the stronger and stronger your Exhaustion talent will run and the harder and harder you can push it, making picking up exhaustion a very tempting prospect while in great danger. This is an inherent part of an Exhaustion talent and there is no known in-universe way to escape the downside. Out of universe abilities may enable you to evade them, but remember the less exhausted you are, the weaker your Exhaustion talent is, and if you’re not exhausted in the slightest your Exhaustion talent cannot be used at all. Madness Talent (Don’t Rest Your Head) Madness Talents are That Good Shit. They are your big guns, the things you can bring out to tear through practically any opposition in a suitably disturbing or mad manner. If an Exhaustion talent lets you play fast and loose with physics, a Madness talent lets you throw them right out the window. They’re something fundamentally supernatural that need not obey physics, merely symbolism and narratives. Madness talents are a fundamental part of your very nature, either a power you gained reflecting a deeply traumatic event in your life or something that indirectly symbolises another core part of your personality. Suitably dramatic personality shifts (or even more horrendously traumatic events) may shift your Madness talent into something else. With the simplest Madness talent, you might turn yourself into a T-Rex, or let out those bugs you know are crawling under your skin, while another one might allow you to perform all the miracles of Jesus himself through bleeding stigmata, catch a train anywhere (even to the future, past, Hell, Mars), or perhaps conjure up a knife of pure sharpness that can cut not just any solid object but insubstantial ones like ideas or even bits of history. Fight or Flight (Don’t Rest Your Head) You can delay the effects of going completely bonkers by having three (total) Fight or Flight responses. When you would otherwise snap and pick up Permanent Madness you may freely check off a response and avoid gaining it, for the small cost of having your emotions dominated by the response. A Fight response would fill you with irrational rage, the kind that would make you try to punch a Nightmare to death or turn on your own allies, while a Flight response would fill you with abject terror, making you freeze up and scream or perhaps run as fast as you can away. Either way, Madness still dominates, even if you are briefly spared Permanent Madness. Responses may be recovered through periods of rest and relaxation (falling asleep counts, but is generally unwise here), therapy sessions, spending Hope (if you have them) or similar ways to recover from stress. Alternatively, any time you burn through all your Responses and snap (or crash), you fully refresh all of them as the release is rather cathartic. The free version of the perk only affects the Madness Talent you find here, the 100 CP version lets you vent off other sources of insanity under the same system. (Editor’s Note: There are more paragraphs for the Madness Talent perk, also there should be some more information in the Notes & Game Context section of the Jumpchain. Both will help a lot in understanding most of the perks and the world/game they come from.)",

      "description": "A Little Bit Crazy (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) Every sorcerer has to be a little off his rocker, and you are no different. Something like freezing in battle is much harder for you, and you might even enjoy a fight just a little bit. Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good ol' brawl after all, so maybe accepting your new status as a nutjob ain't too bad. That said, try not to go too crazy. A little bit is fine, recommended even, but it can certainly get addicting, and that's the last thing you want... probably. Who knows maybe you're actually looking forward to getting addicted? Cut From the Anime (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) The Jujutsu Kaisen narrator, he made sure some of the most iconic parts of the series actually worked, and now he's here to help you. Well, help might be a bit too much, but when you desire you can let him commentate on your fights, and even your enemies and allies will be able to hear him, though they will never find him strange, or be surprised by his appearance. I'm afraid this can't be used as a distraction tactic. He will never give away important information either, like explaining how someone's technique works, he can only say what everyone already knows. He's here to make fights sound cooler, not to help you, so expect some cool quotes from him and that's it. Domain Creation (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) First, to explain this perk I must explain Domain Expansion. All sorcerers and curses possess something called Inner Domain, and when they imbue this with an innate technique they may try to bring this Inner Domain into the real world, expanding their domain. There are two types of domains, old style and sure-kill style. You see, Domain Expansions have two major advantages, and one major disadvantage. First the advantages, when in their domain the user will increase the power of their technique to 120%, they will also always hit the enemy no matter what. The disadvantage is that after expanding their domain, a person will feel curse technique burnout, a state where they cannot use their curse technique. Typically you would only be able to imbue your own innate curse techniques into your inner domain, but with this perk you may imbue any technique that is innate to you. It will work exactly like a normal domain, though doing so will most likely take quite a lot of training. A World of Curses (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) So many things in this world are reliant on cursed energy, so wouldn't it be a shame if you didn't have access to it anymore? Well, I'm sure you could get over this disadvantage in other ways, but this is a quick and easy solution. You see, now whenever you decide to start a new jump, you may choose to make it so that cursed energy exists and has existed for thousands of years. This means what you would expect, there will be sorcerers active, curse users, curses, a hidden society probably… It's up to you, but cursed energy should not be too tightly involved with the plot of whatever world you are going into. A world that you brought cursed energy into, something that is responsible for thousands of deaths each year… Kind of a dick move huh? The Basics of Being a Sorcerer (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) All sorcerers must know how to create a basic veil, a barrier that conceals the existence of curses inside of it. You now know how to create this veil as well, even if only a very simple one, messing with the characteristics of the veil such as making the entrance of someone impossible is beyond your current skill. That said, there is another basic technique that many sorcerers learn, that skill is how to create and control shikigami using charms as a medium. (Editor’s Note: For The Basics of Being a Sorcerer perk, there is a 100CP version that you can take.)",

      "description": "Cursed Energy Quantity (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) So how much energy do you want, Jumper? Because while a sorcerer Is constantly producing cursed energy, the amount they can hold is actually limited. It's also impossible to raise this limit through conventional ways, though it is possible to use it more efficiently. For Free you get as much as your average sorcerer, you can see curses and interact with them, and you can also use your cursed technique without much trouble. This will run out sooner than you think unless you know how to use it well, so keep that in mind, still most sorcerers are on this level, so this quantity should be perfectly serviceable. Cursed Energy Output (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) Here you can decide your output, or in other words how strong you naturally hit. Though you can imitate this effect by either having bigger reserves or by being more efficient with them, having higher output sure helps. Having a higher output means that everything about you will be better, from your reinforcement, to your techniques. For free you get the output of your average sorcerer, your techniques and reinforcement aren't anything special when it comes to raw power, unless you put in the work at least. Don't be discouraged Jumper, most people are here, and they can make up for it with training their asses off. Cursed Energy Shape (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) Typically cursed energy looks akin to a blue aura that runs through the sorcerer, this aura looks vaguely like flames. There are a few exceptions to this rule however, Yuta Okkotsu has pink cursed energy for example. By buying this you get to choose how your cursed energy looks, though this different appearance cannot give any benefit in battle. Basically if you want to be different from anyone else, this is the spot. (Editor’s Note: Similar to the Cursed Energy freebies from Part 1, there are other options for higher levels and more for purchase if you land on this bundle if you wish to buy them. Along with the choice of also buying a Cursed Technique from the Jump. Or, you can use the other JJK jump from TDT: D&D Part 1 or the Sorcerer Supplement from the Sorcerer Battle Perk to create your own.)",

      "description": "P★DA (Pokemon CGD) The Pokémon Digital Assistant, or P★DA, is a helpful tool for any Trainer. This electronic device serves as an ID for the Orre region, and has a number of useful functions besides. The P★DA can send and receive e-mails. It can create and organise lists to help you stay on top of things. It also contains a condensed version of the Pokédex, known as the Strategy Memo. The Strategy Memo adds an entry each time you encounter a new Pokémon, providing its name, type, average height and weight, potential Abilities, and a visual depiction. Lastly, it can be made compatible with tracking devices and sensors via various upgrades found in the Orre region. An example of this would be the Spot Monitor, which can alert you to the presence of a Pokémon at a Poké Spot. You will have to track down and installed such upgrades yourself though. Should your P★DA be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours. Your Ride (Pokemon CGD) The Orre region is not suitable for traversal on foot. To get you around, you have a choice of either a hover motorbike or hover scooter. The scooter has additional seating at the back to accommodate a passenger, and the motorbike has a sidecar. Your choice of vehicle also comes with an instruction manual, and is simple enough that even a ten-year-old could learn to drive it. Your vehicle never seems to run out of fuel, and general upkeep is not necessary, allowing you to drive it around just about anywhere. Should it be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours. Beginner’s Allowance (Pokemon CGD) A neat sum of Pokédollars, the currency of the Pokémon world. It’s not a lot, but it could get you some supplies, or let you stay at a hotel for a couple of months. It will not replenish, so think carefully before spending it. Beginner’s Item Set (Pokemon CGD) This set of items includes 2 Super Potions, 5 Potions, 2 Antidotes, 2 Burn Heals, 2 Ice Heals, 2 Paralyze Heals, 2 Awakenings, 2 Full Heals, and 5 Poké Balls.

      "description": "Speak Not the Name (Children of an Elder God) There is knowledge that is inherently dangerous to know; you may bring some snippets of knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos with you into this world. And simply by reading this document, you’ve been exposed to several names that are (or will become) dangerous to know—Y’golonac, Rei Ayanami, Yui Ikari. Simply thinking their names—or indeed, any alternate name they may go by—opens you up such that they might possess you for a time (although titles are safe, such as Y’golonac being known as “The Violator”). Fortunately, this document isn’t any sort of trap. You are utterly protected from being harmed or malignly affected by any knowledge you possess or acquire, or from thinking about that knowledge. Now, you can still be harmed by sharing knowledge, or by what you say. There is some knowledge that your mind simply cannot comprehend, and may harm itself in the process of trying. And this does nothing to protect you from sensory input or psychic attacks, and there remains that which will be dangerous in the process of learning. But simply having or thinking about information does not put you at risk. Finally, you will never say anything while unconscious that you would not say while awake. Don’t worry about sleep-talking the name of the Violator. Certainty of Existence (Children of an Elder God) If Nyarlathotep is to be believed, then individuality is an illusion; once you see the highest level of reality, you can see that all things and all beings are just components of Azathoth, separated to play out a story without narrative or plot, all for the purposes of entertaining a blind idiot god who doesn’t even realize what he’s doing. But if that’s the case, then what are you? Are you the only genuinely separate non-Azathoth entity that exists? Do you become a component of Azathoth while you’re here? And if you are a piece of Azathoth, what happens when you “die”, since you technically would still exist as a part of the Daemon Sultan? What happens to your Chain? And what happens when you leave? Dream Training (Children of an Elder God) The vast majority of dreams do not take place the Dreamlands; they occur in that nebulous realm between the waking world and the Dreamlands itself, and are fluid and subject to change. However, dreaming in such a fashion also leaves you vulnerable to a host of dangers that can affect you in your dreams. Learning how to send your mind all the way to the Dreamlands can help protect you from these attacks; it is not absolute, but it does allow you ways to defend yourself that you would otherwise lack, and allows you to know when you are in a dream or not. This training comes in many forms, but is always a challenge. For some, they descend into a pit of darkness in their dreams, and must make their way to the bottom. For some, they must climb a mountain. Others must find the 99 steps of dream from the Cavern of Eternal Flame, some swim across a river of piranhas, and yet others fight an initially-unstoppable beast or enemy. Sometimes this is a challenge that must be overcome, and sometimes it is simply a matter of enduring hardship until you reach the end. There are magic rituals to hasten this process. And… some people are just lucky, and are naturally capable of going to the Dreamlands in their sleep. But once you’ve intentionally traveled into the Dreamlands once, it is simple to continue to do so. Dream Walking (Children of an Elder God) When you are dreaming—but not in the Dreamlands—you can step out of your dreams to visit the dreams of other people. Dreamers that are near to your location in the physical world are closer to you as you search through dreams, and you gain a vague awareness of the contents of a dream and who the dreamer is before you enter it. An emotional connection also helps you find someone faster, and if you’ve been to their dream before, finding it again is a rapid process as long as they aren’t on the other side of the world. When you do enter the dream, you are not subject to the dream’s logic, nor to any sort of “lucid dream” effect. AT-Field (Children of an Elder God) What is the AT-Field? It’s not what it is in Neon Genesis Evangelion, that’s for sure. The AT-Field is something produced by Evangelions and Angels, and eventually by the Children (and presumably the Elder Gods). Most the powers present here are merely accomplished through specialized manipulations of the AT-Field, although they aren’t possible to merely “learn”. Rather, the capacity to use the AT-Field in a specific way is something innate (or something stolen). Still, there a few features of the AT-Field that are (mostly) universal. The AT-Field produces a barrier that can, technically, be pierced by conventional weaponry, but it takes incredible force; it took Unit00, Unit01, and Unit02 working together to contain the blast of an N2 mine (although this was at the beginning of their Angel-slaying careers), while a single mine was enough to severely damage Matriel. The AT-Field can also be wrapped around weaponry or your body, which can be used to try to force your way through an opposing AT-Field; you can also directly press your AT-Field against the AT-Field of another in an attempt to overwhelm them, allowing you to injure the enemy directly. Items can also be imbued with an AT-Field, as see when Salgiel turned an (extraordinarily large) spear-like tree into something capable of piercing through an Evangelion. You can even use your AT-Field inside of your own body, using it to “flush out” foreign influences such as poison, parasites, or eldritch infections. Angels, when directly exposed to a foreign AT-Field, such as that of an Evangelion, will start to turn grey, and begin to deteriorate as the AT-Field is pressed against them. This does, however, take some time to completely dissolve them. It’s best to immobilize them or surround them so they can’t escape. With training, an AT-Field can have its form manipulated in a variety of ways, from forming a blade to creating a basketball. Because almost all of these effects are the result of specialized AT-Field usage, they can be defended against with an AT-Field (or, in other settings, by sufficiently eldritch powers). (Editor’s Note: Certainty of Existence, Dream Training, and Dream Walking all have additional paragraphs about their effects in their original Jump.)",

This astounding device allows a human to safely focus and channel the power of their D.N.A. into a compatible partner digimon, while eliminating the risk of inducing madness outside of extreme circumstances. This process allows a digimon to digivolve; temporarily achieving its next evolutionary stage, healing their injuries, and restoring their vitality! Bearing a color pallet of white and the color of your D.N.A., these can handle up to a Full Charge of it’s system; sufficient to allow a digimon to reach Ultimate level so long as their partner had sufficiently potent D.N.A. to fuel the transformation. It can even store a digimon partner within, allowing them to always be by your side; and while they can’t use most of their powers from within, they can still communicate with you and employ their own extraordinary senses to aid you.",

Unlike the Talents in this section, Discipline is genuinely risk-free, and you need not worry about bad things happening solely because you relied on your Discipline. It is likely the only lifeline you’ve got in this hell and you better keep it close. Exhaustion Talent (Don’t Rest Your Head) Your Exhaustion talent is something you’re good at that gets taken up to frankly superhuman levels. You have a lot of leeway in deciding what your Exhaustion talent is, but it should fundamentally be something mundane you take up to inhuman levels. If you were a good runner, through Exhaustion you’ll be capable of matching a professional race car, or perhaps if you were a shooter you could curve bullets in physically impossible ways, and if you were a gambler your Exhaustion talent might swing your luck so hard you could win nearly any game of chance without effort. However, all Exhaustion talents come with the risk (and requirement, for the most powerful uses) of tiring you out significantly, leading to you progressively getting more and more exhausted until you can catch a lengthy break or worse, crash, suddenly falling asleep for days, up to a week at a time before waking up lacking all your talents and incapable of seeing the Nightmares. And being a magnet for every nearby Nightmare. Merely dying is considered a nicer fate than being caught by a Nightmare while still a powerless Sleeper. On the bright side, however, the more exhausted you are the stronger and stronger your Exhaustion talent will run and the harder and harder you can push it, making picking up exhaustion a very tempting prospect while in great danger. This is an inherent part of an Exhaustion talent and there is no known in-universe way to escape the downside. Out of universe abilities may enable you to evade them, but remember the less exhausted you are, the weaker your Exhaustion talent is, and if you’re not exhausted in the slightest your Exhaustion talent cannot be used at all. Madness Talent (Don’t Rest Your Head) Madness Talents are That Good Shit. They are your big guns, the things you can bring out to tear through practically any opposition in a suitably disturbing or mad manner. If an Exhaustion talent lets you play fast and loose with physics, a Madness talent lets you throw them right out the window. They’re something fundamentally supernatural that need not obey physics, merely symbolism and narratives. Madness talents are a fundamental part of your very nature, either a power you gained reflecting a deeply traumatic event in your life or something that indirectly symbolises another core part of your personality. Suitably dramatic personality shifts (or even more horrendously traumatic events) may shift your Madness talent into something else. With the simplest Madness talent, you might turn yourself into a T-Rex, or let out those bugs you know are crawling under your skin, while another one might allow you to perform all the miracles of Jesus himself through bleeding stigmata, catch a train anywhere (even to the future, past, Hell, Mars), or perhaps conjure up a knife of pure sharpness that can cut not just any solid object but insubstantial ones like ideas or even bits of history. Fight or Flight (Don’t Rest Your Head) You can delay the effects of going completely bonkers by having three (total) Fight or Flight responses. When you would otherwise snap and pick up Permanent Madness you may freely check off a response and avoid gaining it, for the small cost of having your emotions dominated by the response. A Fight response would fill you with irrational rage, the kind that would make you try to punch a Nightmare to death or turn on your own allies, while a Flight response would fill you with abject terror, making you freeze up and scream or perhaps run as fast as you can away. Either way, Madness still dominates, even if you are briefly spared Permanent Madness. Responses may be recovered through periods of rest and relaxation (falling asleep counts, but is generally unwise here), therapy sessions, spending Hope (if you have them) or similar ways to recover from stress. Alternatively, any time you burn through all your Responses and snap (or crash), you fully refresh all of them as the release is rather cathartic. The free version of the perk only affects the Madness Talent you find here, the 100 CP version lets you vent off other sources of insanity under the same system. (Editor’s Note: There are more paragraphs for the Madness Talent perk, also there should be some more information in the Notes & Game Context section of the Jumpchain. Both will help a lot in understanding most of the perks and the world/game they come from.)",

      "source": "Jujutsu Kaisen Remake",
      "description": "A Little Bit Crazy (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) Every sorcerer has to be a little off his rocker, and you are no different. Something like freezing in battle is much harder for you, and you might even enjoy a fight just a little bit. Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good ol' brawl after all, so maybe accepting your new status as a nutjob ain't too bad. That said, try not to go too crazy. A little bit is fine, recommended even, but it can certainly get addicting, and that's the last thing you want... probably. Who knows maybe you're actually looking forward to getting addicted? Cut From the Anime (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) The Jujutsu Kaisen narrator, he made sure some of the most iconic parts of the series actually worked, and now he's here to help you. Well, help might be a bit too much, but when you desire you can let him commentate on your fights, and even your enemies and allies will be able to hear him, though they will never find him strange, or be surprised by his appearance. I'm afraid this can't be used as a distraction tactic. He will never give away important information either, like explaining how someone's technique works, he can only say what everyone already knows. He's here to make fights sound cooler, not to help you, so expect some cool quotes from him and that's it. Domain Creation (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) First, to explain this perk I must explain Domain Expansion. All sorcerers and curses possess something called Inner Domain, and when they imbue this with an innate technique they may try to bring this Inner Domain into the real world, expanding their domain. There are two types of domains, old style and sure-kill style. You see, Domain Expansions have two major advantages, and one major disadvantage. First the advantages, when in their domain the user will increase the power of their technique to 120%, they will also always hit the enemy no matter what. The disadvantage is that after expanding their domain, a person will feel curse technique burnout, a state where they cannot use their curse technique. Typically you would only be able to imbue your own innate curse techniques into your inner domain, but with this perk you may imbue any technique that is innate to you. It will work exactly like a normal domain, though doing so will most likely take quite a lot of training. A World of Curses (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) So many things in this world are reliant on cursed energy, so wouldn't it be a shame if you didn't have access to it anymore? Well, I'm sure you could get over this disadvantage in other ways, but this is a quick and easy solution. You see, now whenever you decide to start a new jump, you may choose to make it so that cursed energy exists and has existed for thousands of years. This means what you would expect, there will be sorcerers active, curse users, curses, a hidden society probably… It's up to you, but cursed energy should not be too tightly involved with the plot of whatever world you are going into. A world that you brought cursed energy into, something that is responsible for thousands of deaths each year… Kind of a dick move huh? The Basics of Being a Sorcerer (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) All sorcerers must know how to create a basic veil, a barrier that conceals the existence of curses inside of it. You now know how to create this veil as well, even if only a very simple one, messing with the characteristics of the veil such as making the entrance of someone impossible is beyond your current skill. That said, there is another basic technique that many sorcerers learn, that skill is how to create and control shikigami using charms as a medium. (Editor’s Note: For The Basics of Being a Sorcerer perk, there is a 100CP version that you can take.)",

      "description": "Cursed Energy Quantity (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) So how much energy do you want, Jumper? Because while a sorcerer Is constantly producing cursed energy, the amount they can hold is actually limited. It's also impossible to raise this limit through conventional ways, though it is possible to use it more efficiently. For Free you get as much as your average sorcerer, you can see curses and interact with them, and you can also use your cursed technique without much trouble. This will run out sooner than you think unless you know how to use it well, so keep that in mind, still most sorcerers are on this level, so this quantity should be perfectly serviceable. Cursed Energy Output (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) Here you can decide your output, or in other words how strong you naturally hit. Though you can imitate this effect by either having bigger reserves or by being more efficient with them, having higher output sure helps. Having a higher output means that everything about you will be better, from your reinforcement, to your techniques. For free you get the output of your average sorcerer, your techniques and reinforcement aren't anything special when it comes to raw power, unless you put in the work at least. Don't be discouraged Jumper, most people are here, and they can make up for it with training their asses off. Cursed Energy Shape (Jujutsu Kaisen Remake) Typically cursed energy looks akin to a blue aura that runs through the sorcerer, this aura looks vaguely like flames. There are a few exceptions to this rule however, Yuta Okkotsu has pink cursed energy for example. By buying this you get to choose how your cursed energy looks, though this different appearance cannot give any benefit in battle. Basically if you want to be different from anyone else, this is the spot. (Editor’s Note: Similar to the Cursed Energy freebies from Part 1, there are other options for higher levels and more for purchase if you land on this bundle if you wish to buy them. Along with the choice of also buying a Cursed Technique from the Jump. Or, you can use the other JJK jump from TDT: D&D Part 1 or the Sorcerer Supplement from the Sorcerer Battle Perk to create your own.)",

This electronic device serves as an ID for the Orre region, and has a number of useful functions besides. The P★DA can send and receive e-mails. It can create and organise lists to help you stay on top of things. It also contains a condensed version of the Pokédex, known as the Strategy Memo. The Strategy Memo adds an entry each time you encounter a new Pokémon, providing its name, type, average height and weight, potential Abilities, and a visual depiction. Lastly, it can be made compatible with tracking devices and sensors via various upgrades found in the Orre region. An example of this would be the Spot Monitor, which can alert you to the presence of a Pokémon at a Poké Spot. You will have to track down and installed such upgrades yourself though. Should your P★DA be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours. Your Ride (Pokemon CGD) The Orre region is not suitable for traversal on foot. To get you around, you have a choice of either a hover motorbike or hover scooter. The scooter has additional seating at the back to accommodate a passenger, and the motorbike has a sidecar. Your choice of vehicle also comes with an instruction manual, and is simple enough that even a ten-year-old could learn to drive it. Your vehicle never seems to run out of fuel, and general upkeep is not necessary, allowing you to drive it around just about anywhere. Should it be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours. Beginner’s Allowance (Pokemon CGD) A neat sum of Pokédollars, the currency of the Pokémon world. It’s not a lot, but it could get you some supplies, or let you stay at a hotel for a couple of months. It will not replenish, so think carefully before spending it. Beginner’s Item Set (Pokemon CGD) This set of items includes 2 Super Potions, 5 Potions, 2 Antidotes, 2 Burn Heals, 2 Ice Heals, 2 Paralyze Heals, 2 Awakenings, 2 Full Heals, and 5 Poké Balls.

This means that his animals grew between two and five times as fast without any additional resources. You have studied this concept and learned to apply it to your products and creations. When you apply this there will be no negative effects from the growth rate such as a lowered lifespan. You may apply this effect to yourself as well if you have any powers that grow stronger as you age.",

Combining the blood of a dragon with an infant in the womb to grant them the magical power of that dragon as they grow up, for instance. With time and further mastery, it may even be possible to combine more than one thing in this way, though one cannot begin to think of the sacrifices the failed attempts might cause.

These can range from simple environmental adaptations to allow a creature to, for example, survive underwater should you find yourself deep below the surface, or they can be more generalized, such as a Template to enhance the natural armaments a creature has while bolstering their speed for a combat buff. Creating a Template requires you to collect a resource, which this perk allows you to see and interact with, that pools in areas where the Template would allow a creature to thrive. A former battlefield, for example, would help develop a Template to improve combat abilities while a volcano would give a Template to adapt a creature towards living around flames and lava. This resource can then be used to construct the template over time, similar to the methods of the Imagination Summoner Archetype. To start, you’ll only be able to create minor Templates with limited effects, however, with practice you will be able to push your skills to allow you to develop more potent and complex Templates, opening up newer and better options in time. Do note, however, that applying a template adds an additional drain to the summoning. At first, you will only be able to apply a single archetype at a time to a single creature at a time, but over time you will be able to apply them to more creatures and more of them to any individual creature.

Innate Talents are abilities that people are born with, and usually only one in two hundred people will actually have one. They can run the gamut of all sorts of things, though there is no certainty people will be born with an ability they will actually be able to make use of. For example someone born with an innate talent for learning magic doesn’t actually help them find a magic teacher, and thus some innate talents may go to waste. Thankfully for you you can choose what Innate Talent you have from the following list. You possess the unheard of ability to have more than one Innate Talent, assuming you purchase more than one. Enhanced Summoning - All summoned creatures you call forth will be 50% more powerful, stick around for 50% longer if the summon is duration based, and will cost 50% less magic to actually summon. Only works on creatures you summon with magic, creatures you create with magic don’t count. Discounted with Summoning Specialty. Specific Specialisation: Summoning [200CP] (Overlord (The Series)) You can purchase this perk more than once, each time you do so you can specialize in a specific branch or theme of magic. You will then be capable of spells of greater potency, scope, power, or so forth within that specific theme. The spells and magics you learn via these choices will always be superior than the ones you could learn without them, often being cheaper to cast, more powerful, larger in scope, or so forth. Taking a specialization doesn’t make you worse at things outside of your specialization, it just makes you better at the things you specialize in. Summoning - You are really good at summoning magics. Creatures you call up are more powerful, longer lasting, and often tend to have special abilities they wouldn’t otherwise have. Maybe you called up frost wolves that have a chill aura rather than regular wolves, or maybe that fire elemental you called up can spawn more of itself that will then also fall under your control. This explicitly works with summoning magic you know even outside of this jump, granting your summoned creatures extra strength and abilities thematic with their nature. If you were to purchase this alongside the Augmented Summoning innate talent your magical summons would be fearsome indeed. Why bother dealing with something yourself when you could send a disposable minion to do it for you? The perfect ability for masterminds (or the lazy). Summons made via the Ranked Magic system are perfectly loyal to you unto death, and you’ll find that with this that loyalty applies even to summons via other magic systems. Creatures and beings of godlike power, however, may be able to resist the enforced loyalty clause. Summon Mab or Cthulhu at your own risk. Additionally most summons are temporary, and the enforced loyalty is only in effect while they are serving as your summon. Keep in mind when using summons from other jumps that some summoned creatures have long memories, and may seek you out on their own if they feel you abused your influence over them.",

The first is that it allowed her to partially merge the Spirit Origin of a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History into her knights. Now, you can create this fusion for other people, layering a part of the “concept” of the chosen Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History atop your target and turning them into a faerie knight, a Tam Lin (even if they aren’t a faerie). This gifts them with a skill or ability possessed by that hero, although it is not of as high a rank as it was for the original. Secondly, bearing the name of a hero from Proper Human History allowed her knights to distance themselves from their own true nature as nascent Calamities. Those you gift a Tam Lin name to will receive a superior version of this; any racial or inherent weaknesses they may possess will cease to have an effect for as long as they are known by their title as a Tam Lin, rather than their original name. They will likewise find that they have an easier time fighting against any urges of their base nature they may possess, such as the drive to destroy a nation. Thirdly, it obscured the original name of the Tam Lin. Those you have gifted a Tam Lin name to will find that even people who already knew their original name are unable to remember, hear, or even read it. Know that this is a deceptive effect, so abilities such as Fae Eyes will see straight through it and remember it clearly. Furthermore, once someone manages to openly reveal a Tam Lin’s true name, this method of hiding that their name ceases to have an effect on anyone for the rest of the jump, although they will not lose their abilities if their true name is discovered. This will also serve to hide your Tam Lin’s true name from those who have some method to discover it, unless that individual also possesses the means to see “the truth” of things. Unlike the original, those who bear the title of Tam Lin will be able to toggle these effects on and off, making themselves “normal” again if they would prefer to be, and reassuming these powers when they want them.

The head of the clan is able to imbue a fraction of her power into those she brings into the clan, making them much stronger, and only weakening her if she is far away from them; as long as they remain in relative proximity, she keeps full access to her abilities. Now you too are able to infuse your minions with your power, making each one far stronger in exchange for a tiny sliver of yourself that you invest in them. As long as they don’t get more than a city’s-width away from you, you still possess your full strength, only losing access to it if they distance themselves from you. You can also weaken your perks to provide lesser versions of them to your followers; in exchange for reducing your own perk by 1/100th of its regular power, you can instill a single individual with that same perk at 1/4th the power with which you would normally demonstrate it. However, whatever you invest is permanently given up, and as such will be lost forever if your subordinates die or forswear their loyalty to you.

Outside of that, you might need potent artifacts like Holy Grails to significantly increase the power of a Servant without resummoning them in a better spiritual body. Thankfully, you've learned a few strengthening rituals utilized by Chaldea to enhance their Servants. By utilizing miscellaneous magical material or objects, such as perhaps the bones of magical beasts, Craft Essences, or Mystic Codes, you can slightly but noticeably increase the overall power of a Servant. This can only be done to a limited extent however, due to the natural limits of Saint Graphs. As a final note, modifying these rituals to work on non-Servant spiritual beings is likely possible, if very difficult, but it would require a lot of magical expertise to make them work on living beings.

      "description": "Ceremony of Investiture [300CP] (Generic Summoner) Summons rarely grow in strength, not to the degree one might want them to, and so, summoners have found a way to empower their summons. You are able to perform an hour long ceremony that uses various materials and your own power as a means to improve upon a summon, investing the essence and power of the materials used into the summon to permanently grant them additional traits, improve upon basic statistics, or add new abilities entirely. These are shaped by the materials used in the creation of the summon and are often expensive, but the rewards are potentially immense for any summoner and their summons. The stronger the summon already is, the more materials and the more power needs to be invested to get a result. Fusion Summoning [300CP] (Generic Summoner) When summoning a creature, you can choose to summon two creatures at the same time, merging them into a single, composite summon with traits and abilities drawn from both of the component creatures. Some abilities will combine, strengths will compound, weaknesses may wax or wane, some will cancel out, others will mutate, all depending on the creatures used in the fusion. If the two creatures fused are intelligent creatures, their minds meld and work in tandem to control the fusion, however, conflicts can arise which may destabilize it and cause the fusion to end prematurely. Alternatively, you can summon a creature into an already summoned creature, empowering it in much the same way as above, except that the creature infused is dominant in the fusion, providing more direction to the fusion then the infused summon. Such fusions are usually a bit weaker than a full composite but lack the potential for internal conflict that the true fusions possess. Given time and practice, you will be able to fuse more creatures at a time, though each additional creature added to the fusion becomes more difficult than the last. (Editor’s Note: I did change the perk’s name, Fusion Summoning, from its original, Fusion, so as for it to not get confused with another. There is a description underneath the Ceremony of Investiture perk in its jump about the synergy with the Fusion Summoning perk. And underneath the Fusion Summoning* perk in its original jump, there is a description about synergy with the Armsman perk.)",

You can also give yourself a Falna if you want to be an adventurer yourself even if you are a god. The Falna that you bestow upon others and yourself automatically integrates any existing System that you have access to, gaining all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible.",

      "description": "One Extra Line [600CP] (Fate Zero) The cost and strain of summoning can harshly what[sic] and whom a Master might summon as a Servant and moving beyond the Master’s limits can have disastrous effects on them over time. Now, you at least may worry less on this[sic] limitation. When you summon something, you pay only half of the initial cost in energy to do so but when it comes to maintaining and supplying energy to an active summon, your costs are only a tenth of what they would normally be. Your summoned being still receives the full benefit of whatever mana you would normally need to give to them but it ultimately only takes a tenth of that amount from you, no matter what they gain in the end. Capstone Boosted: Rather than going through a lengthy ritual, possibly filled with horribly rare and expensive sacrifices, requirements and components...you can just choose to not bother. What really matters, beyond will, intent and raw energy? So long as you know what you wish to summon, you may bypass any ritual, material components, chants, durations or waiting times and simply supply enough magical energy to make up for all of them former[sic]. The harder, more complex, more expensive or more powerful, the more energy it will take, but if you can pay. And if you can gather that energy up, then you’ll also bypass anything that would normally block you from summoning something specific, though this will not allow summoning things from across jumps that you would not normally be able to summon. Demi-Servant [200CP] (Fate Zero) Through some form of tangling of time and space, you’ve undergone a more perfected process to create a fusion between a modern human and a Servant, making you either a Demi Servant if you are human or a Pseudo Servant if you are a Servant originally. A Demi-Servant is a fusion between a Servant and a modified human that allows the human to make use of the powers, skills and Noble Phantasms of a Servant they are bonded with. You know and are skilled in the use of all of these abilities and items, though you might not quite know all the tricks as the original did just yet. You gain the Servant Origin in addition to your original one, though you do not gain the 100cp[sic] for free, as well as access to the Servant Supplement as described for those of the Servant Origin, with 1000SP and all associated discounts and freebies. A Pseudo Servant is much the same as a Demi Servant, a Servant is summoned into a human vessel but in this case the Servant is the one who gains control over the body with the human spirit already discarded. In effect, you gain a free origin, including discounts and freebies, and 1000CP with which to buy perks and items, though none of this extra CP can be converted into SP. You will still be summoned as a Servant by whatever Master you chose, they were the ones to prepare the vessel you now inhabit or to have someone else do it for them. An important note, is that Pseudo Servants effectively count as having living bodies, for the purposes of Magical Energy regeneration and any other effect that might care. Whichever option you have taken, the changed nature, be it Servant or Human, has magnified the powers of certain perks you could take. Any 600cp perk will gain an upgraded form for you if you take them and this perk at once, as described in the Notes section at the bottom of this jump. Taking either of the above options does not lock you out of getting a Servant or Master if you normally would, these are entirely separate from such a thing. You may opt into only paying 200CP instead to receive only the effects of the Capstone Booster, giving up any Servant related or Master related boosts. No extra SP or CP, only the boosts to capstones.",

      "description": "Mark, Twist, Possess [200CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows) If there is anything you can rely on it is that there will always be those who will do anything for power. You have gained the knowledge of imbuing magic effects into the very being of any willing creature through the carving of a rune and an investiture of mana. Those who you Mark gain a single attribute, those who you Twist gain two, and those who are given three abilities in this fashion are called Possessed. However, those granted abilities find themselves increasingly loyal to you, and with those Possessed being fanatic in their devotion. As always the greater your mana investment the greater the effects. Known runes and their attributes include: ● Sanctity: A triangle within a diamond, those marked with Sanctity have increased maximum health. ● Resolution: Appearing as a kite shield slashed by two diagonal lines Resolution increases the natural armor rating of any creature. ● Risen: The rune of the Risen is a simple upward arrow and triangle that bestows a powerful regeneration effect to a creature's health. ● Swift: As you'd expect the rune Swift increases the speed of those who bear it. It appears as two right-pointing arrows. ● Martyr: This rune is a simple diamond of bold straight lines. On death a martyr releases an aoe pulse of healing energy centered on them that only affects allies. ● Disunite: One of the more complex runes. Disunite consists of three triangles over a line divided vertically by a downward arrow. Upon death the body of those who bear Disunite dissolve into swarmlings that continue to attack enemies. ● Awry: On death its bearer emits an aoe pulse that causes gems to resocket themselves. Looks like a stylized tower with a solid circle floating above the top, and is one of the few runes that could be passed off as a tattoo rather than random markings. ● Refutation: Your greatest discovery, the rune of Refutation was made by the Forgotten herself to combat the wizards of this world. Those that attempt to banish one bearing this rune must pay a vastly increased mana cost. After this jump this rune negates any instant death effect, hostile teleportation effect, or similar spatial warping/banishment of any energy level less than or equivalent to the mana used in this rune's creation. Though blocking such effects weaken the rune. Despite the refinement of its name it is simply three long and savage slashes carved into the bearer. Spells (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows) Spells do not cost mana to cast and instead build up a charge over time up to a max of two held charges. Levels in wizard skills and bonuses from talisman fragments may increase charging speed, allow for extra levels of charge, or increase the effects of the spell. Spells are used differently by each origin. In order to reflect their deeper connection to magic apparitions also get any one spell for free. (Editor’s Note: Included in the Darkest Tome presuming that the ways these spells can be applied are not exclusive between origins, and merely additional ways of using them beyond the in-game gem buffs) Spells: Bolt [Free] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows) The bolt spell is the first any wizard learns. When used on gems they gain 50% increased range and their attacks completely ignore armour values for twelve shots, and when used on traps their attacks gain the permanent ability to bypass all armour. Forgotten Aspirants may use this on their monsters to give them a twelve use ranged attack or to empower a ranged attack they already have. Apparitions may cast this on themselves to form bolts from raw mana with same[sic] properties. Spells: Beam [100CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows) The beam spell allows a gem to fire a constant low powered beam for a short time. When used on traps it permanently increases the rate at which the re-arm themselves (attack speed) by roughly a third. Forgotten Aspirants may use this on monsters to temporarily increase their movement and attack speed and to modify their ranged attack into a beam if they have one. Apparitions can cast this on themselves to fire raw mana in a destructive beam for a short time. Spells: Barrage [100CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows) When cast on gems it gives them a number of barrage shell attacks equal to their gem rank times two. Barrage shells deal moderate damage in an aoe on impact and have nearly a third greater range. Traps enhanced with this spell gain an increase to the special abilities of any gem socketed within. Forgotten Aspirants may use this on a monster to permanently enchant them to cause it to detonate violently on death with the explosion scaling to their level. Apparitions may cast this to enhance a gem bomb to do much greater damage and have a greater blast radius based off its rank Beacons of Conquest [400CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows) You have detailed knowledge on the creation of Beacons. They are much like Shrines accept[sic] that they do not require any further input once they are created, and instead apply their effects at steady interval[sic] with a pulse of energy in a circular radius. The more mana used in their creation the greater their effects, the wider their aoe, and the more often they pulse. Their loud and steady tempo reminds all who hear it of your power. Known Beacons Include: ● Healing: Each pulse heals for a percentage of max health. ● Shielding: Grants a single layer of shielding per pulse with each layer negating the damage of a single hostile attack of any strength. Max 10 layers ● Cleansing: Each pulse removes negative status effects from allies. ● Speed: Grants a significant but temporary increase in speed. ● Dissonance: Each pulse causes nearby gems to be resocketed. ● Static: Prevents manipulation of the immediate area through magic that does not originate from its creator or those they have attuned to it. This is a constant effect rather than a pulse. Can only block magic of power less than or equivalent to the mana used in this beacon's creation, and takes damage based on the level of energy blocked. ● Beacon Protector: Reduces the damage dealt to other nearby beacons and structures.",

There are two ways of summoning beacons, paying their mana cost directly to summon them in your line of sight, or by paying their mana cost during the summoning of a demon and binding them to the demon’s pseudo-soul. When the demon dies, the beacon will form on the ground close to where they fell. Beacon effects can be customized based on strength, range, and the frequency of pulsing their effects, since most beacon effects are active. By spending more on a Beacon, you increase its durability and armor as well. You can make the following types of beacons. ● Heal: Restore a set percent of health to all friendlies within range of pulse. ● Haste: Makes time run a set percent faster for all friendlies within range of pulse. ● Shield: Adds a single layer of one-time-use invulnerable shield to all friendlies within range of pulse. ● Discharge: Disrupts enemy spells within range of pulse. Gems require several seconds to work again. ● Static: Disrupts all active enemy magic within range from forming, preventing building or moving via magic.

Chromafactor [600CP] (Gemcraft: Frostborn Wrath) Different wizards use different colors of gems to enact different effects.

When you do, you can decide whether the recipient gains a general increase in power or receives a copy of a specific perk or ability of your choosing. Those who receive a fragment of your soul are healed of all physical, mental, and spiritual ailments. As their wounds heal, the knowledge, skills, and talents they possess are imprinted onto the soul fragment they have received. Healing someone through this method significantly reduces their lifespan, but you can choose whether or not this reduction occurs. When a person with one of your soul fragments dies, the fragment returns to you, increasing your strength and extending your lifespan. You can forcibly reclaim your soul fragments using a technique called Auswählen. This technique creates a ring of light that emits beams targeting individuals who carry your fragments. Auswählen not only retrieves your soul fragments but also absorbs the general power of the targets, weakening them. Auswählen allows you to redistribute power among those who carry your soul fragments, enabling you to weaken some while strengthening others. Those empowered by Auswählen are fully healed and can even be revived from death, including yourself. However, this technique is fatal to those with weak souls, as they may be unable to withstand the light of Auswählen, causing them to perish and be reduced to bones. The Originator of Quincy [800CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement) This perk significantly enhances the strength of all your soul-related abilities, particularly your Quincy powers, granting you perfect control over spiritual energy and the ability to reconstruct spiritual objects into any desired form. You can also generate and fire Heilig Pfeil without needing a Spirit Weapon. These projectiles can appear either as arrows or blasts of blue energy, both forms carrying the same level of power. Additionally, you can use Spiritual Power alone as your energy source, removing the need to combine it with Spirit Particles for your Quincy abilities. This perk also enables you to grant others the powers of a Quincy or bestow them with a Schrift. By allowing others to drink your blood, you can choose whether they gain Quincy powers, a Schrift, or both. The Quincies you create through this method are considered Echt Quincy, and their offspring will be a Quincy as well. If one parent is not a Quincy, their child will become a Gemischt Quincy. Unlike Yhwach, this bestowal does not require sharing a piece of your soul to impart a Schrift. Instead, you engrave a letter into the recipient’s soul using your energy, which forms their Schrift. This process requires an immense amount of energy. The specific Schrift a person gains is determined by the letter you engrave, but the ability associated with it is random. For example, engraving the letter R might result in The Roar Schrift. While the strength of the awakened Schrift varies, no Schrift is ever useless. Some may manipulate elements, while others can alter fundamental aspects of reality. However, the Schrift granted through this perk will never surpass or equal the power of The Almighty, the strongest Schrift. The most powerful Schrift granted through this ability would be par with The Balance. Most Schrift fall within the power range of 100 CP to 400 CP tier in terms of strength, though you can grant one person a Schrift equivalent to the 600 CP tier once every twenty years. A Schrift equal to the 800 CP tier can only be granted once every two hundred years. Those who receive a Schrift from you can also access Vollständig at will.",

Healing someone through this method significantly reduces their lifespan, but you can choose whether or not this reduction occurs. When a person with one of your soul fragments dies, the fragment returns to you, increasing your strength and extending your lifespan. You can forcibly reclaim your soul fragments using a technique called Auswählen. This technique creates a ring of light that emits beams targeting individuals who carry your fragments. Auswählen not only retrieves your soul fragments but also absorbs the general power of the targets, weakening them. Auswählen allows you to redistribute power among those who carry your soul fragments, enabling you to weaken some while strengthening others. Those empowered by Auswählen are fully healed and can even be revived from death, including yourself. However, this technique is fatal to those with weak souls, as they may be unable to withstand the light of Auswählen, causing them to perish and be reduced to bones. The Originator of Quincy [800CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement) This perk significantly enhances the strength of all your soul-related abilities, particularly your Quincy powers, granting you perfect control over spiritual energy and the ability to reconstruct spiritual objects into any desired form. You can also generate and fire Heilig Pfeil without needing a Spirit Weapon. These projectiles can appear either as arrows or blasts of blue energy, both forms carrying the same level of power. Additionally, you can use Spiritual Power alone as your energy source, removing the need to combine it with Spirit Particles for your Quincy abilities. This perk also enables you to grant others the powers of a Quincy or bestow them with a Schrift. By allowing others to drink your blood, you can choose whether they gain Quincy powers, a Schrift, or both. The Quincies you create through this method are considered Echt Quincy, and their offspring will be a Quincy as well. If one parent is not a Quincy, their child will become a Gemischt Quincy. Unlike Yhwach, this bestowal does not require sharing a piece of your soul to impart a Schrift. Instead, you engrave a letter into the recipient’s soul using your energy, which forms their Schrift. This process requires an immense amount of energy. The specific Schrift a person gains is determined by the letter you engrave, but the ability associated with it is random. For example, engraving the letter R might result in The Roar Schrift. While the strength of the awakened Schrift varies, no Schrift is ever useless. Some may manipulate elements, while others can alter fundamental aspects of reality. However, the Schrift granted through this perk will never surpass or equal the power of The Almighty, the strongest Schrift. The most powerful Schrift granted through this ability would be par with The Balance. Most Schrift fall within the power range of 100 CP to 400 CP tier in terms of strength, though you can grant one person a Schrift equivalent to the 600 CP tier once every twenty years. A Schrift equal to the 800 CP tier can only be granted once every two hundred years. Those who receive a Schrift from you can also access Vollständig at will.",

Either importing into the world or as a new attachment to your warehouse. Hive Size [100CP*] (AVP) Perhaps you’re expecting a larger family than your small hive can house? Each purchase will double the number of rooms: one purchase gives 20 rooms, two give forty, three gives eighty, etc. Corridors joining all the chambers are free. If you also took “Nest Chamber”, each purchase increases the number of eggs by ten. Labyrinth [100CP] (AVP) The tunnels and corridors of your hive are particularly rambling, complex and confusing for non-xenomorphs.

Camouflaged Hive [100CP] (AVP) From the outside, your hive looks like something else. An ordinary apartment block? A cave? A water treatment plant? A hospital? Only once visitors are already inside will they realize that something is terribly, terribly wrong with this place. You can also take this option to combine your Hive into a structure you already own, keeping the function of both; even combining it with a starship, if you have one large enough to hold the Hive inside it. Secondary Tunnels [100CP] (AVP) Your hive is laced through with a network of smaller tunnels; a bit like air vents would be in a human structure. These secondary tunnels allow for rapid movement through the hive by facehuggers and drones, and are extremely hard for non-xenomorphs to move through. These tunnels also serve as escape routes or access points to the hive that are difficult for intruders to enter by. Snares [100CP] (AVP) Your hive’s tunnels have been cunningly designed with hidden pitfalls and pools of liquid, viscous resin. Unwary or ill-prepared intruders will quickly find themselves trapped within the pits or pools of resin, easy pickings for the hive’s guardians to kill or your facehuggers to infect. Reinforced Resin [200CP] (AVP) Thanks to chains of carbon nanotubules laced throughout the resin you secrete, your hive is much more resistant to damage, both from within and without.

Even the alchemical agents, wrought from the Labyrinth, which are needed to create the rarefied void-coated plates of Oblivion’s Panoply are in refilling supplies amongst these, should you have need of them.

The inside of the door varies from one pusher to the other as the world within the door is a representation of the pusher's heart. A Red Door usually contains spirits and ghosts belonging solely to that door created by the Pusher’s heart, if the pusher is strong enough they can rule the world behind their door and raise armies of ghosts. The pusher can also decide whether the ghosts live or die and can enforce rules that all within the door must abide by. As the door is technically a living entity, any who enter the door, living or otherwise, begin to be assimilated by the door and unless they leave within a certain time limit they will be unable to leave however, if they are able to follow the rules set by the door pusher, they can gain the favor of the world behind the door and reduce the assimilation process. Finally, if the door pusher is ever to die in real life they are resurrected as a Red Specter within the world of the door with twice the amount of power they possessed in life and can grow in strength via collecting resentment. However, your door is different Jumper, when you die it resurrects you not as a Red Specter but as you are nor with an increase in power as well but only once.

The total area within unknown and may continue to grow as more souls are added. Souls? Yes, you see, this is an afterlife realm. The residents however, are most unusual. Destroyed androids and robots may come here after their time is up, each soul within belonging to a machine (generally in state of clear disrepair). These robots will be hostile to intruders in their afterlife if you direct it, keeping the area secure. Such souls will not allow themselves to be removed from this afterlife, and if forcibly taken out will disappear and rematerialize within. Any soul-bearing machines you allow will also be permitted to come here once their product life concludes.",

The ritual site is built around the centerpiece of a sacrificial altar, or other object of sacrifice. By performing a human sacrifice at this altar you will see a larger boost to the results of your magic, as you offer up their soul to demonic forces in exchange for power. A normal sacrifice will be minor, but if it’s someone exceedingly pure or special - a saint, a child with great psychic powers, etc - it will be a much larger boost, though people can be made special - a man treated like a king who comes to the sacrifice as a fool of their own volition - or a special day can be used to further boost this effect. Don’t try reclaiming sacrifices from the altar - demonic forces do not like to be betrayed thus. If you’re sacrificing a person to a specific entity then you won’t see this general boost from the demonic forces of the altar, but it does seem to increase the value of the sacrifice for whatever purpose it is to be used for.",

Moving sidewalks run through it, and its toppled towers even now possess Shafts of No-Weight which lift or lower those within them to the desired floor. Fleets of air cars lay docked in some of these towers, though some have fallen to the ground, and receive power for their flight from the city itself. At its heart there exists a tower of fate where a control system constructed around an oversized brain manages the city’s systems. This organic control system is capable of controlling the entire city’s infrastructure, including its mysterious energy source - with a half-life of 1200 years - numerous tentacle manipulators, lights, and all the treasure of ancient, and perhaps magical, technology within. If activated, this control system could repair the ruins in moments, casting out any and all who it saw as undesirable from the city. And unlike Rogol Domedonfors this control system does not seek to rule as a god, but to serve you loyally.",

There is only one door leading to the corridor but there are over a thousand doors that continuously shuffle. The correct door opens to a massive drop with tall old trees with no foliage below. This leads to the space between the entrance and the actual tomb. It is an indoor forest area with trees, grass, and dirt. Jujutsu High's cursed warehouse where they store cursed objects is located in this area. Deeper inside is an elevator that descends underground to the main corridor. The main hall consists of a compound of old buildings that circle around a gigantic tree. There is a path that leads directly to the base of the tree where Master Tengen resides. There is also another barrier at the entrance to Master Tengen's shrine that prevents anyone from intruding other than those directly invited. If one were to enter and be rejected, they would walk into an empty white space void of Master Tengen's presence. You are now the master of this place giving you fool control and rights over all the objects and things inside. You can change up the area as you like but it has to keep some resemblance.",

These prisons can effectively hold a God hostage within. And that’s not to mention it’s abilities to defend itself from a potential break-in as well. Using the magic of both divine and damned, it can conjure horrifically large beams of light in tandem with swarms upon swarms of hellish energy, topping it off with massive vortexes to consume the life of foes while it’s swarms of drones and miniature Malicious Faces beside it pepper foes with bolt and explosion. And if left for long enough, the drones can assist in healing the Prison to prevent true damage from ever occurring to it. It is not impenetrable, but it will certainly stop all but the insane, desperate, or absurdly strong, and even then, it’s power may give even them pause.

      "description": "The humans are known for wandering about and spreading their influence across the land, but the vast majority of Mononoke are content to remain within a specific area and safeguard it from external influence. It isn’t uncommon to find Mononoke who have remained within a single forest for centuries and built up a tribe there. When Mononoke do migrate, it often is not out of choice and the consequences are often quite extreme. Hopefully it won’t come to that for you during your time here. As a Mononoke however, you can claim a piece of nature as your own to guard. With the presence of the Mononoke, the natural landscape can transform, allowing trees in forests to grow to massive heights or allowing mountains to possess remarkably rich ores. Even living beings within the domain can be affected, allowing them to grow slightly larger than normal. However, the process of claiming a domain requires an infusion of spiritual energy from your body into the land itself – so naturally you can’t go about marking a large chunk of land without an appropriately large donation. When it is established however, it isn’t so easy to spread the domain beyond its existing boundaries. Any additional energy infused into the domain will reinforce its strength, and enhance the rate at which spiritual energy is produced from the natural elements within, but true expansion requires new life to take root. In the past, the various Mononoke would plant new trees to expand forests, or dig out caverns to spread mountains. But with the humans going about torching down forests and pulling the veins from mountains...well, this is no longer quite as effective as it once was. As a Mononoke, should you wish to expand your domain, you should always be wary of external influence from beings such as humans. The Mononoke’s domain might as well be their home, so it isn’t too strange that they possess a natural advantage while inside. Mononoke tend to be far stronger while within their domain than outside it, and the tales of humans getting lost in a Mononoke’s forest can be attributed to the Mononoke’s influence more so than the human’s unfamiliarity. In the past when the Forest Lord’s influence stretched all across the land, it wasn’t uncommon to hear of Mononoke with several domains under their jurisdiction. However...in modern times, this situation is largely unheard of, partly due to the Mononoke receding from this world and partly due to the expansion of the humans. For a Mononoke such as yourself, it’s probably best to stick to a single domain at first.",

Who opened this chasm to Oblivion, no one knows except perhaps the Neverborn themselves, and they have not revealed it in their death-dreams. Perhaps it is a nexus of paradox, where the annihilating force of Oblivion meets and merges with the infinitely prolific, unshaped potential of the Wyld. Perhaps it the singular point of intersection between all worlds, all states, all possibilities, a gateway that leads beyond even the Void. None can say for certain, but the Dowager of Unrent Veils now seeks within its depths the Anti-Creation, the perfect opposite of the Primordials’ handiwork that cancels it out and leaves nothing behind. While she searches, however, she might settle for pulling out another plague or cataclysm like the Great Contagion. Perhaps the Dowager will find her Anti-Creation one day, or perhaps she has merely deluded herself through too long a meditation on the Void. Whatever the case, anything that enters the Well of Udr bypasses the Underworld and the Labyrinth to enter Oblivion itself. Further, the Well exhales the power of Oblivion itself and poisons anything that might live or grow around it. Even the chamber that holds the Well is deadly. Any living creature that enters the chamber feels the call of the Void. Remaining in the same room drains their willpower, and once this is depleted... they leaps to their annihilation in the Well. And while Exalts, gods and other supernatural creatures are more resistant, even able to ignore it with enough force of will, the only true defense against the existential horror of proximity to the Well is to be dead or to have sworn an oath to Oblivion (as all Abyssals have). Now you will have your own Well of Udr, set where you wish, and to use as you wish, along with massive tomes written in pre-human hands, found hidden in the Dowager’s citadel. But should you desire to meditate on the Well Of Udr yourself, perhaps to pull forth your own great cataclysm or plague, it should be noted that it took the Dowager more than a hundred years to pull forth the Great Contagion. Though she considered the results well worth the effort, she has yet to replicate this feat in the centuries since.",

In addition to spying on the Earth below through its advanced cameras, it can also sense the unique energies emitted by eldritch or alien entities, allowing you to pin down their presence anywhere in the world. That said, it does need to surpass a certain threshold to be detected; someone casting an eldritch spell isn’t going to particularly register to POLARIS, but the awakening of an Angel or similar entity would be easy to notice. It also only covers eldritch or alien activity, so something that’s completely passive, or that is contained so it can’t do anything, also won’t register. Although it’s designed to focus on a planet, you can direct it to scan outwards, which will allow it to detect incoming eldritch forces; it can’t examine the entire solar system at once, but it can scan the entire system every day or so. Throne of Nightmares [400CP] (Children of an Elder God) You have a grand and terrible throne. Whenever you obtain someone’s soul or dream-self, and it is unquestionably under your control—either due to an unwilling to escape, due to being bound so much that it can’t escape, or simply due to the power you can exert over it—then it will fuel the Throne of Nightmares. Every soul that fuels the Throne will enhance your powers, and you also gain access to any special abilities held by the souls you are taking advantage of. Should you ever conquer a planet, then you can use any given soul from that world as a means to connect to that world, and you will gain a small sliver of power for every sapient inhabitant of that planet… whether they’re alive, or whether you’re responsible for their deaths. It is possible for souls to be freed from the Throne; all this requires is that the soul no longer be in your control. The Throne can also be broken; it must be present in either the physical world or a dreamscape in order for you to benefit from it, so it is vulnerable to attack. Being used as fuel for the Throne is an agonizing process, but it doesn’t actually damage the soul itself; anyone used as fuel may be used eternally.",

If regularly supplied with blood – or the bodies of your victims – this nest will continually produce chunks of valuable Blood Amber over time, which can be carefully harvested without destroying it. Blood Amber can be traded for coin or used in jewellery like a semi-precious stone, and the amber and bloodflies themselves seem to have an occult significance. The nest may be installed in your warehouse, or in another of your properties. Raw Whalebone [100CP] (Dishonoured 2) Several pieces of pristine whalebone, ideal for crafting bonecharms, runes, and other occult paraphernalia that sing with their resonance to the Void. While you could trade this collection for a reasonable sum at any black market dealer, I wouldn’t advise it – only pieces that were expended in crafting will be restocked in your warehouse. Whalebone Blade [200CP] (Dishonoured 2) An ancient blade, carved in one piece from the jawbone of those sea creatures and scrimshawed with vine-like designs. This blade has a number of curious features, as the great whales themselves are said to exist in both the real world and the Void simultaneously. While you carry this blade, it resonates with other bonecharms, producing marked improvements on all of them – a charm to increase your mana will deepen your well further, a charm to improve your swimming will see you swim like a fish. Yet when it pierces the flesh of an enemy, the blade will curse their charms to blacken and turn against them; a lucky bonecharm becomes unlucky, one for fortune will produce loss, a charm for sweet dreams will create nightmares; a truly unfavourable fate. Grand Library [400CP] (Dishonoured 2) Built of dark grey stone and the rich wood of Serkonos’s mountain forests, the grand library seems embedded with a chasm, crossed with catwalks and bridges. It contains thousands of books, painstakingly hand-written on occult and metaphysical topics, and hundreds of years of research on the astronomy and metaphysics of the world can be found in their leather covers. While rare diamonds of practical knowledge are scattered between the books, the more academic literature is likely to help you in developing your own magics or rituals. The Grand Library updates for each new jump, adding further shelves of books along grey stone escarpments, and providing a comprehensive academic knowledge base of the metaphysics, magic and dimensions of your local setting, though it will not contain books which already exist. The Grand Library attaches to your Cosmic Warehouse or other pocket dimension.",

The prototype versions ran the risk of melting the Evangelion into a pile of goo, or of heavily irradiating the Evangelion to the point that it needs to be destroyed. Yours, fortunately, has all the kinks worked out, and is effectively an infinite source of energy. It is said to function via the manipulation of gravity, supposedly producing a field that induces fusion on any material that is introduced to it, which is contained by the microfusion engine itself. This should be impossible, because gravity isn’t something you can “contain”; it’s the influence of mass upon the fabric of space-time, not a particle. But it exists and it works in defiance of what local scientists understand, somehow producing enough energy to keep itself functioning no matter what is added to it as “fuel”. It is likely that some alien component is involved to keep it working. As long as you have material to add, it will continue to fuse it and produce monstrous amounts of energy, enough to keep an Evangelion active. You receive a microfusion engine with your purchase, but if you possess the Eidolon item, you will also have one installed in your Eva’s “stomach”; everything you eat will provide your machine with power, letting it functionally keep operating indefinitely as long as there are materials to feed upon. The microfusion engine only produces energy, and never produces waste. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 400CP to 800CP.)",

What makes this cave special is that some world power decided to sneakily dispose of part of their reserve of highly radioactive waste there, consisting of around 50000 metric tons of nuclear waste emitting massive doses of radiation, which basically prevents any form of life from staying in the cave. Fortunately, this is another story if you have the Radiosynthesis perk or some other way to take advantage of this material, because this will be a great boost of power for you. By default, only you will know the location of the cave, so, unless someone directly follows you or you personally inform them, it’ll be impossible for others to discover it purposely or accidentally.

Pure Land [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The Second Impact caused consequences around the entire world, but no place on Earth was so affected as Antarctica. Thanks to the powerful Anti-AT Field and the L Barrier, the South Pole became a true “Dead Sea”, with the entire region became coreified and all Lilith-based life, even down to microbial life, in the surrounding area were destroyed, becoming a alien-like land free of the taint of human sin. What you receive isn’t Antarctica, but instead another land that was also purified by these extreme effects, located somewhere in the world of your choice. This pure land is a hostile being to basically any form of life based on conventional life, as the L Barrier converts them into more Core Matter, but this effect is harmless with angelic lifeforms like you due to your exotic composition. This angelic paradise is small, just 20 miles or around 32 km, ending in a set of giant, black monoliths that have the anomalous effect of containing the L Barrier, preventing it from spreading to other places, but, if you want, you can destroy the monolith to allow the paradise to spread to other lands, being able to grow to the size of a small country with little less than a decade. At the start of each jump, you can decide where exactly in the world your pure land is located, but, regardless of its location, the giant monoliths will be repaired.",

Everything stays clean, organized, and doesn't require any staff or ‘staff’ to maintain though you can hire or acquire them as you like. The only exception being the dungeon where you control how comfortably your ‘guests’ stay. Your grand residence can be in any old world style you want, you can even have each room in a different design, though each style will be flavored with this setting's unique touches. In future worlds, your residence will blend with more modern ideas while losing none of its old world charm gaining things like heated floors, electric lights placed tastefully, a jacuzzi to go with that Roman bath, updated steam cookers and fryers, and other little quality of life things custom made to not disrupt the design of each room. Your library, greenhouses, and storage spaces update to include the books, plants, and materials of the new world. Live decadently, Jumper.

The prototype versions ran the risk of melting the Evangelion into a pile of goo, or of heavily irradiating the Evangelion to the point that it needs to be destroyed. Yours, fortunately, has all the kinks worked out, and is effectively an infinite source of energy. It is said to function via the manipulation of gravity, supposedly producing a field that induces fusion on any material that is introduced to it, which is contained by the microfusion engine itself. This should be impossible, because gravity isn’t something you can “contain”; it’s the influence of mass upon the fabric of space-time, not a particle. But it exists and it works in defiance of what local scientists understand, somehow producing enough energy to keep itself functioning no matter what is added to it as “fuel”. It is likely that some alien component is involved to keep it working. As long as you have material to add, it will continue to fuse it and produce monstrous amounts of energy, enough to keep an Evangelion active. You receive a microfusion engine with your purchase, but if you possess the Eidolon item, you will also have one installed in your Eva’s “stomach”; everything you eat will provide your machine with power, letting it functionally keep operating indefinitely as long as there are materials to feed upon. The microfusion engine only produces energy, and never produces waste. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 400CP to 800CP.)",

It would in most cases take a fluke for someone to find this place. This dimension is not a big one. It is about a large city’s size. It could be perfect as the capital of an evil empire, but it’s pretty dark, lit only by the lanterns that illuminate the halls of your castle.

What makes this cave special is that some world power decided to sneakily dispose of part of their reserve of highly radioactive waste there, consisting of around 50000 metric tons of nuclear waste emitting massive doses of radiation, which basically prevents any form of life from staying in the cave. Fortunately, this is another story if you have the Radiosynthesis perk or some other way to take advantage of this material, because this will be a great boost of power for you. By default, only you will know the location of the cave, so, unless someone directly follows you or you personally inform them, it’ll be impossible for others to discover it purposely or accidentally. Post-jump, the cave will appear anywhere similar in future worlds, as well as replenishing its content at the start of each jump. Pure Land [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The Second Impact caused consequences around the entire world, but no place on Earth was so affected as Antarctica. Thanks to the powerful Anti-AT Field and the L Barrier, the South Pole became a true “Dead Sea”, with the entire region became coreified and all Lilith-based life, even down to microbial life, in the surrounding area were destroyed, becoming a alien-like land free of the taint of human sin. What you receive isn’t Antarctica, but instead another land that was also purified by these extreme effects, located somewhere in the world of your choice. This pure land is a hostile being to basically any form of life based on conventional life, as the L Barrier converts them into more Core Matter, but this effect is harmless with angelic lifeforms like you due to your exotic composition. This angelic paradise is small, just 20 miles or around 32 km, ending in a set of giant, black monoliths that have the anomalous effect of containing the L Barrier, preventing it from spreading to other places, but, if you want, you can destroy the monolith to allow the paradise to spread to other lands, being able to grow to the size of a small country with little less than a decade. At the start of each jump, you can decide where exactly in the world your pure land is located, but, regardless of its location, the giant monoliths will be repaired.",

The building is saturated with the power of the Entities, counting as your domain even if you aren’t able to create one, and enhancing all of your abilities to twice its original potency and effectiveness. Due to all of this power within just one place, the time and space are distorted, causing some “errors” in reality. These errors turn very confusing to anyone trying to move on the tower, due to a door in a room leading to some random place within the building, unless you personally help them. Unfortunately, unless you’re capable of using space-time manipulation, these errors are uncontrollable and will be completely random. Your Black Tower also has the same equipment to broadcast any kind of signal and, unlike the original version, it isn’t inhabited by an eldritch abomination made of flesh. Personal Domain [600CP] (Little Nightmares) Currently, there is a hidden war happening in this world. The Four Entities are fighting for influence, increasing their control over humankind and increasing their domains at the same time that they try to weaken their rivals. Each one of the Entities has a specific territory turned into their personal domain, where they rule, and you, as an Entity yourself, aren’t different from them. You can choose a location of your choice to be your domain (with max size of a mansion), as long as no one has already turned it into their personal domain or have some control over it. Completely turning a location into your location takes some time, varying from a few seconds to days depending on its size and its connection with you (for example, one of your fiat-backed properties would take just a few seconds but an entire mansion, unrelated to you, would take years). Once a domain is complete, this lets you know the location of everyone inside it, even if they’re using some ability to hide their presence (unless they’re stronger than you) and freely teletransport to anywhere inside it. These abilities work even if you’re currently outside your domain. You can just maintain one domain at the same time and, if you want to choose a new location, you’ll need to cancel the old domain to create a new one. It’s also possible for you to use your power in an attempt to impose your own domain over others, turning their territory yours, but, unfortunately, this also is possible to other Entities and beings with similar abilities, so protect your domain if you don’t want to lose it.

A private hospital with top- quality doctors and practitioners, it’ll bring in a lot more money to your company while providing you a large testing population for any new ‘procedures’ you would like to introduce to the world while ensuring that any procedures or medicines you test here are much more effective. You don’t need to be an asshole about it if you want, you could just treat it like a very advanced hospital as well. Fertile Grounds [100CP] (Resident Evil) Blessed be the creatures. Blessed be their womb and their hosts. They shall be blessed indeed, with this cavernous section underground that feels creepy and appears mucky and wet. It doesn’t look like much, but it’s a very nutritious area that allows for superb breeding of parasitic lifeforms or fungi. This means the parasites will not only be stronger, but they will be far more plentiful than they would normally be. This also applies to parasites or fungi that have strange gestation requirements, so those rare parasites aren’t going to be rare for long. Spencer Mansion [300CP] (Resident Evil) Forget the idea of living like a peasant, sometimes you just want to live in style.

There's a large, illegal lab equipped to create viral agents and infect others for testing. It also comes with traps and nonsensical puzzle deterrents within the underground section, including the infamous 'laser grid' hallway to really ruin anyone's day.

You can’t really do much for those without causing too much noise, so how is one to perfect their unstoppable death monster? That’s why there’s this section, a rather complex and elaborate death maze that can be adjusted and changed as needed to prepare for each B.O.W. you want to test out. Each test will send data back to a computer, and give suggestions for ways to improve said B.O.W. as needed which will make any B.O.W. you test here become that much more effective in the final design. Time to make your death army for fun and profit. The Hive [300CP] (Resident Evil) When you need to wait out the end of the world, or just want to make for all sorts of nifty bio-weapons for your own personal power play, you need look no further than this elaborate underground bunker. Staffed by multitudes of employees that focus on B.O.W. research, it also has housing for those employees with numerous security checkpoints and traps so that information leakage would more or less be non-existent. It has many layers for holding pens, and a large cryostasis room to allow hundreds to ride out any apocalypse. It also has a really sick office for you so that you could control everything in style, and a station to install an A.I. so you can monitor it all. Viral Laboratory [100CP] (Resident Evil) But what good is a bunker or research facility without the proper tools to create what you need? What good is bioweapons research without the means to create bioweapons? Fortunately, this facility is all that you need, incorporated into the Hive to cultivate and develop viruses at a rate far faster than normal so that you could have a slew of pathogens just waiting to be used and modified as you see fit.

Inspiration for magical studies and insight into supernatural matters of all sorts comes naturally to you naturally of all sorts-and when it’s light shines down on you your luck is greatly increased too. And the magic or alien powers of your enemies are greatly weakened by its presence- and though the moon is not invulnerable, it is still a great floating ball of stone that resurrects like a Tarnished during the next full moon.

Simply calling forth quantities of glintstone will be relatively easy. Summoning hordes of Alabaster Lords or alien beasts, a moderately taxing task aided by the moon lending you great authority among these beings.

A miniature gravity furnace based off of the same technology used by TOHA Heavy Industries, you’ll find that the power output of this little beast is far beyond its size might suggest. Running standalone off of elementary particles, there’s seemingly no end to the lifespan of this reactor. But such an immense amount of power is hard to control, and this not a very suitable unit to power a home for instance. Well...unless you want a home that will likely burn down. Despite the sheer amount of power it can potentially provide, it’s going to take you quite some time to replicate this reactor...and really, you should focus on perfecting the containment field first, because without proper containment you’ll experience massive losses to the environment. Structure Conversion Tower [400CP] (Blame!) Despite not being a full structure conversion tower, only about as tall as a two floor building, the internal engine in this is powerful enough to facilitate replication of entire blueprints at a respectable pace. Without any sort of blueprint, the SCT will function like a power pylon, effectively saturating nearby electronics with necessary juice. Once a blueprint is inputted however, the SCT can “download” the finished product anywhere within its effective area, which spans nearly hundred kilometers in radius. Unfortunately, there’s no way to boost the signal strength – and the farther away from the SCT, the longer it takes to beam anything in. There have been cases where the SCT can beam in bodies along with virtualized personalities when the SCT itself is connected to a virtual domain with stored personalities. That might come in handy at some point in time. Cloning Facility [400CP] (Blame!) TOHA Heavy Industries has relied heavily on cloning in the past for purposes both benign and unsavoury. Though a large majority of their facilities happen to be on heavy lockdown, it wasn’t impossible to obtain the blueprints to reverse engineer the technology. Granted, we had to pull quite a few favours – but that’s beside the point. The cloning technology is dependent on a DNA sample of any sort – but the veracity to the original product is very high so long as no form of contamination is present. The only challenge with this may be the fact that you can only clone a single individual at a time. Maybe if you had the facilities to replicate these...but then there’s the matter of gathering sufficient resources as well. Oh well, nothing useful ever came easy.",

      "description": "Cloning Chamber [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) You’ve got in your hands a special chamber of the same model of the ones used by Gehirn and Nerv to create their clones. This tank-like chamber, big enough to even fit dozens of human beings, is filled with a nutrient-rich LCL, capable of keeping any immersed organism alive and in stasis for an indefinite period of time if needed. It’s also equipped with special machinery capable of creating entirely new beings or even modify already existing living beings utilizing any genetic samples that are added on the computer attached with the chamber. You’ll have freedom to mix the genetic data to create hybrid organisms, as the chamber can work with any traits and features as long as they’re biological, even if their respective samples aren’t organic in nature, like the Angels that are biological beings but formed of Particle-Wave Matter instead of organic matter. Sample Reservoir [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) Regardless if you were created by Gehirn or some other third party, you managed to acquire one of their treasures, a large storage container storing genetic samples of several different species with useful traits from all over the world, as well as also containing conserved samples of practically every Angel, of important individuals to the cycle and even of the Seeds of Life themselves. Rarer samples will be fewer in number, with common animals having dozens of samples while having four or five samples of Lilith for example. Of course, the samples are limited, but they do regenerate in number yearly and the collection will grow to add new usable samples for the notable species and important beings of each future jump you visit.",

      "description": "How curious. A smaller moon, one perhaps tenfold as large as those that Carian royalty can conjure, seems to be following you around at a respectful distance. And occasionally going off on its own, but somehow extremely hard to notice by others when it doesn’t want to be even in broad daylight-and never far from you when you’re looking for it. Not the great patron of Ranni, but perhaps the equivalent to it of what the Fingers are to the Erdtree. When it’s light shines down upon you, your magic is greatly empowered-hails of glintstone shards raining down with the effort needed to cast one. Magics and supernatural powers associated with the moon are particularly bolstered in both raw power and complexity; if you, for example, uncontrollably turned into a feral werewolf in the moonlight this moon could help you retain your human mind during the process. Inspiration for magical studies and insight into supernatural matters of all sorts comes naturally to you naturally of all sorts-and when it’s light shines down on you your luck is greatly increased too. And the magic or alien powers of your enemies are greatly weakened by its presence- and though the moon is not invulnerable, it is still a great floating ball of stone that resurrects like a Tarnished during the next full moon. Last but not least, it can also supply you with an endless flow of the frost native to the moon which it shapes as if an extension of its own will-whether conjuring a blizzard at your foes, or enchanting weapons and storing it in pots for you to use later. Or just keeping drinks cold. Finally, through this moon you can summon and commune with the alien beings of this world through various rituals. Simply calling forth quantities of glintstone will be relatively easy. Summoning hordes of Alabaster Lords or alien beasts, a moderately taxing task aided by the moon lending you great authority among these beings. And while it is possible to summon truly potent entities that embody the stars themselves, be wary-even with the moon’s support, such beings can be unpredictable and dangerous.",

      "description": "Gravity Furnace [200CP] (Blame!) A miniature gravity furnace based off of the same technology used by TOHA Heavy Industries, you’ll find that the power output of this little beast is far beyond its size might suggest. Running standalone off of elementary particles, there’s seemingly no end to the lifespan of this reactor. But such an immense amount of power is hard to control, and this not a very suitable unit to power a home for instance. Well...unless you want a home that will likely burn down. Despite the sheer amount of power it can potentially provide, it’s going to take you quite some time to replicate this reactor...and really, you should focus on perfecting the containment field first, because without proper containment you’ll experience massive losses to the environment. Structure Conversion Tower [400CP] (Blame!) Despite not being a full structure conversion tower, only about as tall as a two floor building, the internal engine in this is powerful enough to facilitate replication of entire blueprints at a respectable pace. Without any sort of blueprint, the SCT will function like a power pylon, effectively saturating nearby electronics with necessary juice. Once a blueprint is inputted however, the SCT can “download” the finished product anywhere within its effective area, which spans nearly hundred kilometers in radius. Unfortunately, there’s no way to boost the signal strength – and the farther away from the SCT, the longer it takes to beam anything in. There have been cases where the SCT can beam in bodies along with virtualized personalities when the SCT itself is connected to a virtual domain with stored personalities. That might come in handy at some point in time. Cloning Facility [400CP] (Blame!) TOHA Heavy Industries has relied heavily on cloning in the past for purposes both benign and unsavoury. Though a large majority of their facilities happen to be on heavy lockdown, it wasn’t impossible to obtain the blueprints to reverse engineer the technology. Granted, we had to pull quite a few favours – but that’s beside the point. The cloning technology is dependent on a DNA sample of any sort – but the veracity to the original product is very high so long as no form of contamination is present. The only challenge with this may be the fact that you can only clone a single individual at a time. Maybe if you had the facilities to replicate these...but then there’s the matter of gathering sufficient resources as well. Oh well, nothing useful ever came easy.",

In your case it’s by any CP backed properties or dimensions you possess. While within one of these properties you are able to cause the structure to rearrange itself. You can’t create new structures and furniture, but you could cause buildings to move, or change the placement of rooms. Once you have used this ability you must wait for a period before doing so again. You are also able to issue mental commands and compulsions to any creatures which come with or are generated by the property while you and they are within it. True Dungeon [800CP] (Dungeon Meshi) This is a large dungeon, one on the scale of the dungeon underneath the island. It even possesses a similar spell that prevents true death from happening to humans within it. This multi-layered dungeon is large enough that it would take adventuring party days to pass through it, even if they weren’t exploring and hunting for treasure. And it does contain treasure, along with a fully functioning dungeon ecosystem to keep the dungeon healthy and full of mana. The dungeon seems to lack a demon, or at least the demon is strangely inactive. This does mean you will need to keep the ecosystem working since you won’t be able to draw infinite power into it to fix your mistakes, and that the dungeon is less likely to provide adventurers with what they need. But on the other hand you don’t have to deal with a being that is a piece of infinity trying to escape from the dungeon and extend its influence over the entire world. The dungeon will refill with treasure at the start of each jump, and if its ecosystem has been damaged it will fix itself. Even if you did not take the Dungeon Master perk, the monsters in the dungeon are strangely apathetic to you, not treating you as an enemy unless you attack them, though they will not obey you particularly either. If you took the Dungeon Master perk you are recognized as the dungeon’s master, able to rearrange it and command the monsters within. Beyond this you are able to make extensive use of its mana when you are inside of the dungeon, accessing it more easily than other mages.",

      "description": "Mill [200CP] (Over the Garden Wall) This is an old mill, powered by a waterwheel. It even comes with a river to power the wheel. It’s been set up to grind (edelwood) trees and wood down to extract oil from them, but could be reset to do other mill tasks with surprising ease. One person with no particular training could manage it. The mill mostly runs and maintains itself, and is particularly good at extracting special oils, essences, or materials from paranormal or supernatural trees. Grove of Trees [400CP] (Over the Garden Wall) This is a grove of dark and twisted trees. Trees that seem to have human faces locked in permanent anguish. Hollow trees that bleed black oil. These trees don’t grow, or heal, seemingly dead wood though with quick and flowing ‘oil’. It’s this oil which is perhaps most valuable as it seems to be made from the souls of children, and can be used in place as such for any purposes that require souls. It also serves as a physically embodied soul should you for some reason need a soul in a specifically liquid form. While the trees don’t normally heal or grow, you’ll find that new trees grow at a rate of a tree or two a year. Dark Lantern [600CP] (Over the Garden Wall) Outwardly this lantern looks normal. However should you die during a jump the lantern will light itself, as your soul is transported to it. You will find that as long as the lantern remains lit you cannot truly die, able to reform your body from complete destruction - albeit not quickly - though should you have ‘died’ you will come back physically twisted and darkened by the experience, growing less beautiful and human and more terrible in visage. Still as long as the lantern burns your bodily death is not your death. Unfortunately once your soul is in the lantern should it go out you will die in truth. Making things worse the lantern’s flame requires a very special fuel, and if you don’t keep feeding the lantern it will burn out. Specifically the lives or souls of others. Edelwood oil works best, but should you lack it, you can substitute other forms of gathering souls, and should you lack a more efficient means you can burn souls in the lantern by sacrificing people to it, though this will be highly inefficient compared to a more effective means of extracting their soul.",

      "description": "Expansible Egg [600CP] (Dying Earth) This object looks much like an egg, by flinging it up you may cause it to expand, creating a transparent membrane out into an area about the size of a small house. This membrane is impermeable to thew, claw, ensorcelment, pressure, sound and chill. It still allows for excess heat to leave it, light can enter and leave it, breathable air can enter it, and non-breathable gasses can leave it. Though it is worth noting that lights at an intensity of energy to cause burns or physical damage cannot enter it. And when it is stated to be impermeable to thew or ensorcelment this is meant. No power known to science or mage can break this membrane or force its way through it to harm those inside, though it might be possible to go around it through some extraspatial means and it may not be powerful enough to survive impacting the Nothing at the edge of the universe. From within it, it is possible to retract the egg once more, lowering this membrane and returning it to merely an object the size of an egg. So do try to not allow your enemies inside. Skybreak Spatterlight [600CP] (Dying Earth) This scale possesses a red center and an intricate pattern stretching out from it, and a luster that could be mistaken for a jewel. It is the scale of a demiurgic being of the overworld. Unfortunately for that being it seems that it crashed into a swamp on the Earth and the network of forces which held its form together shorted out and its hollow body crumbled into scales. Any of these scales would be a valuable object, if at least as a curiosity, but this scale constituted their central node of force or “protonastic centrum.” As a product of the overworld the scale creates a protective field which disrupts earthly magic, and if worn or carried on the body this will protect the wearer as well. Though magic of the overworld - and in other worlds holy magic or magic from higher beings - ignores this protection. Since you’re paying CP for this it will also not interfere with magic you place upon yourself. This is not the spatterlight’s only purpose. Drained of its energies it is a hungry object. If one touches it with bare skin it will begin to suck them in, consuming the forces which make up their mind and body and charging the scale with these forces. It takes only moments to absorb human-sized creatures completely in a painful and somewhat horrifying process, and even larger creatures can be absorbed quickly. Should the scale - or flesh touching it - be wet it will prevent this process.

In these information banks lay the most complete repository of human knowledge ever constructed in this world. Unfortunately there is no master index of these computer banks, or an effective search engine, meaning you will have some task before you in finding what is useful. Still it contains countless years of human achievement and knowledge, and while not all of the science, history, or sorcery will be applicable to future worlds, it is still a trove of knowledgIt will automatically update with new banks containing any scientific, magical, or academic knowledge you acquire in future worlds. You must first acquire this knowledge either by learning it yourself, or acquiring data banks or books containing it - but it will continue to expand, perhaps to become the greatest repository of knowledge anywhere.

Phandaal’s Catalogue [600CP] (Dying Earth) Well this may not be Phandaal’s own, but this is a vast collection of magical knowledge, which has certainly not been so complete in its recording since Phandaal himself. This is not all of the magical lore to be found in this world, to give you that would be to rob you of your adventure, but it is easily the most complete collection of magical lore, and spells anywhere in this world, and contains a vast trove of magical information. Creating such a collection would have been the work of an aeon, and merely reading it could take more than a lifetime much less mastering all the lore within. It also seems to automatically update itself with additional tomes recording magical lore you learn in this world or others, as well as acquiring a few new books in each world you enter recording their magical lore and practices - whether efficacious or otherwise. This will never be the most powerful or forbidden lore, but it will also rarely include the beginning and introductory information either, instead being obscure and rare tidbits of mystical knowledge.",

It’s capable of FTL travel between star systems, and at a fairly good speed, and while it has no weapons, it’s extremely maneuverable, able to turn in air as if it didn’t have a trace of inertia, and hover, and its stealth systems are good enough that it’d be an extremely lucky radar on Earth which managed to detect it. It’s got a minor forcescreen, enough to avoid damage from small space debris, or survive a few missiles from fighter jets, if they could aim for it with the way it’s hard to maintain a radar lock on it. And while it has no weapons, it does have a tractor beam for lifting and moving objects, and can even beam things into the ship or back down within the area of the beam. But as a weapon for air to air or even air to ground engagements it’s not great as its range is a few hundred feet at most, and it has trouble targeting a moving object; the tractor beam could probably catch a slowly moving car or truck, but the transporter pretty much requires the target to be stationary. It automatically refuels itself when not in use, or recharges its power supply, as well as repairing and maintaining itself, and if it is destroyed you’ll get a replacement within a few weeks. Oh, and it does have artificial gravity which doubles as inertial compensators - you can be flying upside down near Earth and still keep your feet on the ‘floor’, and accelerate at rates which could kill a human pilot.

It can be some something associated with your parent, such as a section of Hell or a slice of Faerie, or it can be a dimension all its own. Whatever the case, within this dimension, your power is increased significantly over as you gain dominion over all of the magical power that exists within the dimension. The world can be reshaped to your will, allowing you to change the environment as you wish or control the weather on a whim. By default, this dimension is roughly 20,000 square miles in size and you may choose to have it be inhabited by residents that are fitting to it. This could be anything from humans to elementals, fae to golems, or a variety mix. Whatever the case, these residents are absolutely loyal to you and can number anywhere from none to several million. Even outside of this dimension, you may draw on its power, though not nearly so much as while within and it is possible to block your attempts to do so. Drawing on its power outside of it does not increase your power, it simply allows you to recover your pool of magical energy much faster. You may also summon the residents outside of your dimension to serve you. You may also import another dimension you have to gain these effects. Each new jump you may choose if the dimension remains the same, is a copy of one of your previous dimensions, or if it is in a separate locale based on your desired settings, such as jungle, ocean, mountain top castle, hellscape etc. Should your dimension be a copy of an older one it will be populated by facsimiles of its previous inhabitants, should it be an old one it will have the original beings. Do note that these beings are not companions, and attempting to use the Dimension as a pod will leave whoever it is you tried to bring along in a safe spot in the dimension they entered yours from. You make your choice on if your Dimension is a copy, one of your old dimensions, or a new dimension the first time you access it each jump. Time in inactive dimensions is frozen.

This library will contain multiple copies of every non-sentient or divine book to ever exist, all organized and stored within these walls. It is maintained by librarian automatons and has multiple desks, chairs, computers and side rooms to study any of the books contained. It will update any time a new book is made and will have both physical copies and digital available. While everything is organized by world, subject and then alphabetical you can ask any of the librarians to bring you copies of any books you would like to study and they will retrieve them if they are available which will only take 5 seconds of them being out of direct sight. This library has high quality aesthetics and is designed similar to a fantasy world's aristocratic manor. The library also has a few effects, first time in the library is dilated at a rate of 10 hours in the library is 1 hour outside of it. Second the library reduces needs of those that are within the library at the same rate of time dilation. 3rd the library has an effect of boosting motivation to study those within so that someone who wouldn’t like to even look at a book would almost gladly study a hard subject they don’t like, it even makes the act of studying slightly enjoyable, like reading a good book. Studying is also 3 times more effective within the library. An Empty Earth [2000CP] (Bibliomania) A simple copy of this jumps Earth after the Apocalypse, aside from plants and animals the only sights are ruins of the fairly advanced society, husk of the Beasts seal and various magi-tech scattered about the world. It's a simple world connected to your warehouse from a sub-dimension but it's yours to do as you please. Interestingly they planet will repair itself and restore used resources over time and will retain any intended changes you implement.

A particularly strange layout is inside but otherwise, at first, the house seems to be nothing more than a nice home with a resident spirit. In actuality, it has three main abilities. The first, is that the Stand is able to control the house as it wills, shuffling around rooms or even make the house roll around at high speeds to move it. Second, the Stand can place other people underneath the house, where they will count as being frozen in time and outside of space until retrieved, though this can be resisted by the unwilling. Finally and most impressively, a latch exists in the central room of the home which leads into a confusing inner house formed of countless space warping rooms. While this dimensional house tesseract is interesting, the most powerful use of it is that when one drops down the latch, they will fall down another latch beneath them and continue to fall. Speed will gather more and more until, impossibly, the falling person begins moving so fast that they travel through time. Unlike the original, this Arrow Cross House has gained enough control to send you to any time that you wish, though it will not follow along with you immediately. If you wait around a few days, the house will trundle up to you, even in another time entirely. Despite the awareness of the Stand, who you may decide the appearance and personality of, they do not count as a companion unless you desire to import them, upon which they will permanently count as one. Rhinoceros Beetle [1200CP] (Jorge Joestar) What in god’s name is that!? Is that a town walking on bug legs? A whole town?! Better believe your eyes because that really is an entire town of several thousand people and a lot of space that just sprouted 6 legs and walked over here. It’s yours now too, whatever consciousness drives the moving town seems to follow your orders, as do the people still in the town. It’s a gigantic being and a nigh unbreakable force field surrounds the town on top, it’d take a falling meteor to break through it. The town is also able to move at supersonic speeds with its bug legs, yet doesn’t seem to transfer the effects of that speed to its surroundings or the people on its back, allowing for a smooth and destruction free ride. You’re able to freely open the force field to any degree you wish, so this ‘Rhinoceros Beetle’ island makes for a fantastic mobile base once you’ve done some renovations. If you’re willing to shell out quite a bit more, 400CP more to be exact, you’re able to go a lot bigger. Instead of just a large town, you’ll get a Rhinoceros Beetle island the size of the United Kingdom, complete with a similar level of population, civilisation and technology. With a moving, supersonic country at your fingertips, there’s not really any mundane person that could stop you in these worlds. The Rhinoceros Beetle will appear in future worlds, pretending to be an ordinary island until you call for it to move and while its original residents will carry over, none of them may become companions and you cannot use it to transport non-natives from one jump to another.

      "description": "Monolith [100CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) In previous worlds, the members of Seele used monoliths to communicate, representing them in their remote meetings among themselves and with their subordinates, but the importance of these monoliths is greater in this world. Currently, the members of Seele were lifeforms, not necessarily humans, gifted with the Fruit of Knowledge who altered the shape of their souls as a way to live indefinitely, that is, they abandoned their former bodies and transferred their souls and consciousness to their monoliths, which utilizes some of sort of technology that utilizes core matter as its basis. Even if you’re still a human, you still receive a monolith made specifically for you, one marked with your title of SEELE 08. You’ll be able to connect with the monolith to speak through it by using any computer you have access to. Unlike the other seven monoliths, yours has its own power source, so it doesn’t need to be connected to an external energy system to stay working. While you will still retain your human body, your own monolith still can be used as a vessel to souls and similar contents, due to also being made of core technology. Tesseract [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The Tesseract is the prison developed by Nerv to hold Unit-01 in the case of its pseudo-evolution, but, as we know, it proved to be a failure, as the Eva was able to escape from it by itself. You, on the other side, managed to develop your own Tesseract, as a more successful version compared to the original. The Tesseract is a cross-shaped, coffin-like structure, made specifically to contain a single powerful entity like an Evangelions and even an Angel with some luck. In addition to being resistant enough to endure several N2 bombs, it also has a defense system in the form of a swarm of drone Evangelion units of the same models of the Mark.04A and Mark.04B specifically programmed to protect it from any threat. Unlike the original, your Tesseract comes with a few extra features, like internal mechanisms capable of better restraining the sealed entity and keeping it in stasis for an undefined period of time, as well as two defensive artificial AT Fields, an external one to protect the coffin from attacks and an internal one to hold the prisoner in the case of it awakening from the stasis. Theoretically, even a being like the Tenth Angel could be properly sealed there if you manage to restrain for enough time to be able to seal them adequately, but something like a Seed of Life is already too powerful to be sealed for a long time. Your Tesseract and its guardian drones are powered by a N2 Reactor by default, but it can also drain the energy of the sealed entity for extra power. If destroyed or somehow lost, you’ll receive a new Tesseract at the start of the next jump. Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) This world’s version of Nerv appears to be more well prepared to lead with Angels than its other interactions, mainly thanks to the developments of the Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars and derived technologies. The pillars are devices which use special square glyphs (named Angel-Sealing Hexes) to control, suppress and even seal Angels and their contamination, including the Ninth Angel’s infection and the coreification caused by the L Barrier. These dark pillars can have different sizes, varying from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters tall, with bigger pillars having a larger area of effect and increased potency, but even a small device is powerful enough to prevent the development of a half-Angel like Asuka with direct contact. You receive a set of ten giant pillars, capable of cleansing an entire city like Paris from coreification when activated together or greatly suppressing an Angel like Sachiel, as well as the blueprints to make the different models of pillars and a special manual explaining the usage of the Angel-Sealing Hexes, allowing you to learn how to infuse their effects on other technologies. With enough time and effort, it’s possible for you to discover how to modify the glyphs to make them able to affect other kinds of spiritual/magic-based beings other than only Angels. Lastly, if lost or destroyed, you’ll receive new pillars in the next year to replace the lost ones. Automated Evangelion Factory [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) You were granted the control of one of Seele’s automated factories that will be responsible for mass producing Evangelion units of the Mark series in years past the Third Impact. The factory is a gigantic complex with a size similar to Nerv HQ, equipped with several womb-like chambers to grow Evangelion bodies, as well as also having various Failures of Infinity stored, and a production line controlled by an AI that requires minimum human intervention to control its many large facilities, as well as counting with a few modified Evangelions piloted by the Dummy System to work there and serve as guards, like many-eyed units responsible by inspecting the factory and large many-armed units to assemble other units for example. Additionally, if you also have the Cloning Chamber item, the factory will also have their own set of twenty chambers already prepared to produce several Advanced Ayanami clones that can be trained to be workers, pilots or whatever role you have for them. Your factory will follow you along your Chain, appearing somewhere of your choice in future settings, and any of its resources will be replenished monthly. Chronostatic Sphere [1200CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The original Chronostatic Sphere, a region of space-time where time is so slow to the point it’s the nearest it can physically reach and being almost an absolute stasis, is the “egg” generated by Lilith everytime the Instrumentality fails and used to transport her to the next world. While investigating some of Seele’s lost relics and treasures, you’ve found a lost Chronostatic Sphere sealed deep in one of their secret bases, but it definitely shouldn’t be here, because Lilith is already free from her “egg” and currently located on the Terminal Dogma. After some investigation, you discover that there is something sealed inside this sphere, a third, inactive Seed of Life, one outside of the main set of seven Seeds created directly by the First Ancestral Race, so completely unrelated to the problems of Adam and Lilith, which was born through mitosis of another Seed of Life that was able to fulfill its goal of spreading life on their planet. Once released, this Seed of Life will awaken and peacefully start spreading some random form of life (sometimes it’ll be angelic lifeforms, sometimes it’ll be organic lifeforms, sometimes it’ll Lilin-like lifeforms, sometimes it’ll be machine lifeforms, among many other different kinds of lifeforms) on the planet it’s currently in, without needing to reset all life before doing this unless threatened, which would result in the Seed deciding to actually trigger an Impact to ensure the survival of its progeny and to terraform the planet if needed. This Seed of Life is mostly loyal to you and will never do any harm to you or your Companions, but doesn’t expect it to follow many of your orders as it’s just interested in spreading life and terraforming planets. The main limitation is that it can only do this once a decade (or once a jump), so, after spreading life, it’ll usually teleport back to your Warehouse if possible and return to its Chronostatic Sphere, unless you order it to stay around. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price of Chronostatic Sphere from 600CP to 1200CP.)",

Of course, their personality, abilities and caste are determined by the gem you put in the ground- All Rubies are the same, so on and so forth. Normally, this process takes hundreds (if not thousands) of years, but this particular machine seems to be able to shorten that to just a year. It should be noted that more powerful gems take more resources out of the earth, and were you to put a unique kind of gem in the ground, then it would be on an even power level with someone like Rose Quartz. Using Diamonds will yield a similar result- It seems this machine cannot create Diamond-Caste gems. Additionally, the accelerated growth of gems planted by this machine appears to be a unique quality of this particular one. Attempting to reverse engineer it will provide machines that serve the same purpose, but they'll take the intended amount of time (ie: longer than you have).

While you will still retain your human body, your own monolith still can be used as a vessel to souls and similar contents, due to also being made of core technology. Tesseract [400CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The Tesseract is the prison developed by Nerv to hold Unit-01 in the case of its pseudo-evolution, but, as we know, it proved to be a failure, as the Eva was able to escape from it by itself. You, on the other side, managed to develop your own Tesseract, as a more successful version compared to the original. The Tesseract is a cross-shaped, coffin-like structure, made specifically to contain a single powerful entity like an Evangelions and even an Angel with some luck. In addition to being resistant enough to endure several N2 bombs, it also has a defense system in the form of a swarm of drone Evangelion units of the same models of the Mark.04A and Mark.04B specifically programmed to protect it from any threat. Unlike the original, your Tesseract comes with a few extra features, like internal mechanisms capable of better restraining the sealed entity and keeping it in stasis for an undefined period of time, as well as two defensive artificial AT Fields, an external one to protect the coffin from attacks and an internal one to hold the prisoner in the case of it awakening from the stasis. Theoretically, even a being like the Tenth Angel could be properly sealed there if you manage to restrain for enough time to be able to seal them adequately, but something like a Seed of Life is already too powerful to be sealed for a long time. Your Tesseract and its guardian drones are powered by a N2 Reactor by default, but it can also drain the energy of the sealed entity for extra power. If destroyed or somehow lost, you’ll receive a new Tesseract at the start of the next jump. Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) This world’s version of Nerv appears to be more well prepared to lead with Angels than its other interactions, mainly thanks to the developments of the Angel-Sealing Hex Pillars and derived technologies. The pillars are devices which use special square glyphs (named Angel-Sealing Hexes) to control, suppress and even seal Angels and their contamination, including the Ninth Angel’s infection and the coreification caused by the L Barrier. These dark pillars can have different sizes, varying from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters tall, with bigger pillars having a larger area of effect and increased potency, but even a small device is powerful enough to prevent the development of a half-Angel like Asuka with direct contact. You receive a set of ten giant pillars, capable of cleansing an entire city like Paris from coreification when activated together or greatly suppressing an Angel like Sachiel, as well as the blueprints to make the different models of pillars and a special manual explaining the usage of the Angel-Sealing Hexes, allowing you to learn how to infuse their effects on other technologies. With enough time and effort, it’s possible for you to discover how to modify the glyphs to make them able to affect other kinds of spiritual/magic-based beings other than only Angels. Lastly, if lost or destroyed, you’ll receive new pillars in the next year to replace the lost ones. Automated Evangelion Factory [600CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) You were granted the control of one of Seele’s automated factories that will be responsible for mass producing Evangelion units of the Mark series in years past the Third Impact. The factory is a gigantic complex with a size similar to Nerv HQ, equipped with several womb-like chambers to grow Evangelion bodies, as well as also having various Failures of Infinity stored, and a production line controlled by an AI that requires minimum human intervention to control its many large facilities, as well as counting with a few modified Evangelions piloted by the Dummy System to work there and serve as guards, like many-eyed units responsible by inspecting the factory and large many-armed units to assemble other units for example. Additionally, if you also have the Cloning Chamber item, the factory will also have their own set of twenty chambers already prepared to produce several Advanced Ayanami clones that can be trained to be workers, pilots or whatever role you have for them. Your factory will follow you along your Chain, appearing somewhere of your choice in future settings, and any of its resources will be replenished monthly. Chronostatic Sphere [1200CP] (Rebuild of Evangelion) The original Chronostatic Sphere, a region of space-time where time is so slow to the point it’s the nearest it can physically reach and being almost an absolute stasis, is the “egg” generated by Lilith everytime the Instrumentality fails and used to transport her to the next world. While investigating some of Seele’s lost relics and treasures, you’ve found a lost Chronostatic Sphere sealed deep in one of their secret bases, but it definitely shouldn’t be here, because Lilith is already free from her “egg” and currently located on the Terminal Dogma. After some investigation, you discover that there is something sealed inside this sphere, a third, inactive Seed of Life, one outside of the main set of seven Seeds created directly by the First Ancestral Race, so completely unrelated to the problems of Adam and Lilith, which was born through mitosis of another Seed of Life that was able to fulfill its goal of spreading life on their planet. Once released, this Seed of Life will awaken and peacefully start spreading some random form of life (sometimes it’ll be angelic lifeforms, sometimes it’ll be organic lifeforms, sometimes it’ll Lilin-like lifeforms, sometimes it’ll be machine lifeforms, among many other different kinds of lifeforms) on the planet it’s currently in, without needing to reset all life before doing this unless threatened, which would result in the Seed deciding to actually trigger an Impact to ensure the survival of its progeny and to terraform the planet if needed. This Seed of Life is mostly loyal to you and will never do any harm to you or your Companions, but doesn’t expect it to follow many of your orders as it’s just interested in spreading life and terraforming planets. The main limitation is that it can only do this once a decade (or once a jump), so, after spreading life, it’ll usually teleport back to your Warehouse if possible and return to its Chronostatic Sphere, unless you order it to stay around. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price of Chronostatic Sphere from 600CP to 1200CP.)",

      "description": "Kindergarten Machine [400CP] (Steven Universe) This hulking, virus-like machine is one of the very same kind you can find in the Earth's Kindergarden, and it functions like any other- It drills into the ground, plants a gemstone \"seed\" that you provide, which then sucks out the minerals in the ground and turns them into a fully-fledged Gem, with all the powers and weaknesses that entails. Of course, their personality, abilities and caste are determined by the gem you put in the ground- All Rubies are the same, so on and so forth. Normally, this process takes hundreds (if not thousands) of years, but this particular machine seems to be able to shorten that to just a year. It should be noted that more powerful gems take more resources out of the earth, and were you to put a unique kind of gem in the ground, then it would be on an even power level with someone like Rose Quartz. Using Diamonds will yield a similar result- It seems this machine cannot create Diamond-Caste gems. Additionally, the accelerated growth of gems planted by this machine appears to be a unique quality of this particular one. Attempting to reverse engineer it will provide machines that serve the same purpose, but they'll take the intended amount of time (ie: longer than you have). Homeworld Colony [2500CP] (Steven Universe) You gain a colony of homeworld that is populated with gems of all castes. The planet is roughly the size of earth. Look of the planet and distribution of gem classes is up to you. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price of Homeworld Colony from 600CP to 2500CP.)",

Almost no one will be missed should you keep your abductions sparse. Additionally comes a stream of income from the medical workers, pharmaceutical drugs, and medical supplies.

Eternal Order of the Second Death [800CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity) A massive cult created and led by yours truly.

The Crucible [1600CP] (Faith The Unholy Trinity) A massive hovering sarcophagus which can be used as a containment field for an almost endless amount of demonic energy. Demonic beings entombed in this sarcophagus are able to recover rapidly from injury or exorcism should they have survived the attempt.

Still, there are uses for them, which I’m sure you’ll soon make use of. These ten cages were built to hold something with the strength of an Ursa, though they can easily be turned towards holding those who had designed such devices. Wicked Throne [100CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) An obsidian throne, meant to invoke the feeling of dark authority and dread, as well as being surprisingly comfortable. When you sit upon this throne, you will appear more imposing and fearsome to those who gaze upon your form, an effect that lasts up to a day. It can also allow you to, when placed within a structure, allow your voice to be projected all throughout the building, as well as a bit further beyond. Apathetic Farm [200CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Man always seems to think that they can triumph over your kind, even use you to their advantage, such as with this example. A mundane looking farm, fully furnished and with a plentiful harvest without any effort on your part. Within the catacombs beneath it, however, is a pack of Apathy whose presence drains away the willpower and motivation of any unwanted visitors or guests of your choosing, to the point where they don’t even feel like moving, starving themselves to death in their own beds out of sheer indifference. Mountain Glenn [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) The largest tomb in all of Sanus, and a humbling reminder of the hubris of humanity, meant to be an extension of Vale. This mountain is absolutely crawling with long decayed corpses and the Creatures of Grimm, from the ruined city above to the deep, winding tunnels that riddle it. Filled with all manner of hidden nooks and crannies, it’s the perfect place to hide away, especially considering that the Grimm will never harm you or yours, turning their ire towards only intruders and your enemies. Nightmare Realm [600CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) A run in with a Nightmare Grimm has given you something quite special, that being your very own dreamscape, a mental landscape that is shaped by your mind and experiences. Yours is different from those typically created by the Nightmare Grimm, instead offering a safe haven for when you slumber. Not only does it protect your dreaming mind from invasions, but you can train any mental skills or talents far faster than normal within this realm as you sleep, and wake up in the morning refreshed and more deadly than before. Grimm Lake [800CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) Grimm are not born as other creatures are, but instead spawned from pools of black tar created by the God of Darkness long before this world was ever known as Remnant. You now claim ownership of one of these dark pools, a massive lake from which the Creatures of Grimm will emerge from forevermore. You are in full command of what emerges from this lake, from standard Beowolves to winged Beringel to titans like Monstra, though the larger and more powerful they are the longer it will take to emerge. You can even halt its production all together, if you don't wish to flood the world in darkness. Flying Whale [1000CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) An utterly massive beast, one that could block out the sun, its size could only be comparable to entire cities. This creature, bizarre as it may be, can be used as a mobile base of operations, filled with rooms and prisons, even landing platforms for any airships. It is completely loyal to you, flying anywhere you direct it. Should you wish, you could even attach any property to this beast, so long as it can fit inside, though that shouldn't be much of an issue. Shattered Moon [1400CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) High above the sky lies the moon, a broken remnant of what it once was, not that there are many here able to imagine it not shattered. Should you never wish to part from such a sight, you are free to take this alongside you on your journeys. When the Brothers left long ago, the God of Darkness shattered the moon, imbuing numerous chunks with his essence, similar in nature to Dust, though these dark crystals possess their own unique properties. You may harvest as much of this as you are able, for it will replenish monthly. Do not fear the broken shards of this falling to the planet, though, as it will hold itself relatively together for as long as it is under your control. Remnant [3000CP] (RWBY: Creatures of Grimm) If you are hesitant to part from this world, yet desire to continue on to other places, there is a way. The entire planet of Remnant may be taken with you, though it will obviously come at a high cost. Still, it may prove worth it, as not only do you receive a barren version of the planet, devoid of all intelligent life, but all of the resources you harvest will replenish after a year. This includes the substance known as Dust, which can be used to cause elemental effects and can be used outside of the atmosphere, unlike normal. Additionally, you can decide if this version of Remnant is inhabited by the Creatures of Grimm or not. You will not abandon this world like those who created it.",

Under your employ is an Alter Ego Servant, imbued with a select few divine spirits, giving them an impressive amount of power and a versatile set of abilities to fall back on. You are able to decide everything about them yourself, from what the original Servant is to their personalities and divine spirits fused into them. Perhaps a bladesmith with all he needs to be a Godslayer or a Mastermind touched by the fates themselves? Should one Butler not be enough for you, you can purchase this Item as many times as you like, each purchase giving you one more Disciple and still being Discounted for the Alien Origin. (Editor’s Note: I’ve increased the price from 400CP to 900CP.)",

It can be possible however, to acquire Tatarigami that is stabilized and controllable, provided that the bearer is sufficiently strong in both physique and willpower. The Tatarigami that we’ll affix to your body with this option are essentially stable, however, the cost of this stability is flexibility. Normally, as the Tatarigami spreads across the host’s body, every part of their body experiences enhanced strength and resilience – but in the process of stabilization this has been limited down to a specific body part. You’ll have to choose for yourself what part of the body you would like the Tatarigami to adapt to. Once that adaptation is complete however, the Tatarigami will no longer adapt to anything or anyone else. The resilience of the Tatarigami is not to be underestimated – they can continue to act even in situations when a normal human body should succumb and it takes complete disintegration or strong purification magic to stop them in their tracks. Even in cases where the Tatarigami is separated from its host forcefully, it can still pull itself back to its host and reconnect with it as necessary. Should you ever face a complete Tatarigami, you should always be wary of how resilient they are. With enough Tatarigami implants to recreate a body, it might even be possible to temporarily separate from the Tatarigami, and have them act autonomously in a group for a brief period. We’re pretty sure that a writhing mass of worms will provoke people to exterminate it right on sight though.",

They are stronger, faster, tougher, and their poison is paralyzing rather than merely debilitating. Whenever any of these GOLEMs die, a replacement appears in its rack after a day.

      "description": "Key of Servitors [200CP] (Lords of the Night: Liches) Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of the Servitors, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. This Key lets the Arcane Lich perform perhaps the most iconic trick people think of when speaking of liches. It lets them raise their minions of death. Ironically, this is more a trick of the light and an echo of the Lich’s own undead status than actual necromancy. The Arcana of Servitors uses the Arcana to create false corpses, and fills them with a false spirit born of the Arcane. Despite having never lived, they still count as undead. A Servitor can be turned or destroyed by positive energy, and can be rebuked but not commanded or controlled by negative energy or spells. Only the Arcane could steal control of a Servitor. You can see through the eyes of your Servitors, and their eyes glow with purple light. The forces of the Arcane that form and animate your servants forms streams and nimbuses of the same purple light of force that puppets them as they move and act. This Arcane is very mechanical in how it creates “undead” and controls them. You form ‘binding points’ or slots in your soul over time, and then fill those slots with your manifested Servitors. When one is destroyed, you can simply create another. All your slots are equal and interchangeable - they’re all able to form undead of the same ‘stature.’ You can’t make a smaller number of greater undead, or a greater number of lesser. At the beginning, you’ll only be able to form a bare dozen false ‘ghouls’ or equivalent, but as you grow in your mastery of Servitors, you will find yourself able to slowly create more undead, or greater ones. You may invest your growth in either direction - creating more ‘slots’ you can fill with ‘undead’, or making those slots capable of being filled with more impressive ‘undead.’ While they are made from an echo of death, and count as undead, they never lived. Servitors are strangely sterile things of false flesh or bone effectively created from nothing more than your mastery of the Arcane. They cannot cause those they slay to rise as undead, nor inflict disease, even if the undead they were based on could do these things. The undead created via this ability never count against your total amount of more ‘normal’ undead you may control. Eldritch Monsters [100CP] (Lords of the Night: Liches) While an echo of the Necromancy shaping you lets you give your Servitors form, they aren’t truly of the dead. Your Servitors count as Constructs or Undead, whichever is more favorable at that moment. They also become completely incorruptible, with your control absolute and incapable of being broken by any means. But the real benefit is that the energies and nimbuses that form and animate your servitors become more than a light show. You can bind them into useful functions. Essentially, your Servitors gain the class abilities (though nothing else, no saving throws or attack bonuses or the like), of a totemist of half their hit dice (minus Wild Empathy, Illiteracy, and Totems Protection), with ‘meldshapes’ formed of the Arcane, and themed around ‘Undeath and the Eldritch’ instead of ‘Nature and Magical Beasts’. They have a false ‘essentia’ formed of the Arcane Energies making them up, and the ‘Undead Meldshaper’ feat.",

In those days, the Ur-Dragon was the prototype and ancestor of all great saurian life, the original and gigantic model upon which the tyrant lizards and river dragons of today are based upon. As these super-predators roam Creation’s jungles now, so too did their ancestor roam Creation’s borders and kingdoms, clad in scales of volcanic stone and with a breath as ash-clouds. But in time, even this great terror shared the fate of its Primordial creators, eventually falling before the might of the Exalted host. Only the bones of this dead behemoth remain, the final markers of an ancient beast from a time before civilization. Yet the flames within these bones never died down, leaving the field where they fell forever a burned wasteland. Until now. Reanimated by great works of necromancy, these monumentally massive bones have been raised from the earth to show Creation the might of the dead. Composed of earth and molten rock, its skeletal remains resemble nothing so much as black granite. Still scorching hot to the touch after millenia of dormancy, and occasional cracks in the bones reveal the bright, yellow-hot glow of ever-burning, magmatic stone within. Bound to your command, its great steps shall rattle the foundations of civilizations and flatten cities across Creation, their ruins to be forgotten as it once was. Yet this reanimated behemoth offers more than heat and fire, gigantic bone claws and fangs, and an earth-shaking stride that flattens all in its path. For within its fossilized rib cage has been set a fortress of soulsteel and jade, the chill of the grave that emanates from the soulsteel keeping occupants comfortable even as the air shimmers with heat around it. Along the cervical vertebrae of its neck, a relatively flexible and slender bridge of soulsteel has been constructed, leading from the fortress up to the skull of the great beast. There, a flat crown-plateau has been set on top of its skull, with a throne of soulsteel reserved for you at the center of this great howdah-crown.",

It is this that forms their demon worlds where physical energies are meaningless. Likewise we are shown an ancient god of justice born from the mass prayers and invocations of a race of just people molded by their will and unified thought. You now possess a skill and ability in this creation of beings from concerted psychic force. Creating demons is a simple enough affair, and should you allow it may happen independent of your active will as the worst behaviors of humanity causes these creatures to coalesce from them. This passive spawning will take time, and many vile acts committed by many people, and you will have no special control over these demons, though the most powerful of them can still surpass mages and sandestins should you find a way to deal with them or control them. You can orchestrate great acts of evil by many individuals at once to hasten this creation, which will also help you control the end result though humanity’s dark, unconscious aspects are hard to control especially across large hordes who are actively releasing and acting upon them. Or you can turn off this passive creation completely. The higher ideals of humanity are less universal, and less actively pushed forth. As such gods will not be spawning accidentally. But by gathering many people together with the same ideals, a devotion to these concepts, and a willful belief in them and the possibility of such a god, you can create gods based on these concepts. This creation is harder and will require more time and participants - who themselves must be more dedicated - than the creation of demons, but is much easier to control and predict the end result though it does still require making certain everyone is willing the same thing lest you create something that deviates in some way from your intent. Still as unwieldy as this is, these gods may possess power which would be described as beyond magic, and even Pandelume “...with knowledge of every spell yet devised, the sleight of runes, incantations, designs, exorcisms, talismans...” admits to being surpassed by the power of gods.

      "description": "The Mettle of Man [400CP] (Fear and Hunger) “Many fall in the face of chaos; but not this one, not today.” The very notion that you are not capable of achieving something is comedic in the face of your nature. You now possess the capability to cultivate any characteristic you now desire, by donning the rituals and performing the liturgy of the roll you intend to assume. If you wish to become brave, do brave things and things which invoke bravery and soon fear will lay at your feet, defeated. If you wish to become cowardly act as such, speak as such, and soon, you will find yourself as scared of the world as you seem... If you wish to be divine, then that is how you will need to live. Become a wizard by doing wizardly things. Become intelligent by doing things that evoke intelligence. As long as it is a human characteristic, it is within your grasp, if you but reach for it. This is a conscious decision, and you must actively put effort with the intent to gain the desired quality. King in Yellow [1000CP] (Fear and Hunger) “A man-made god.” Scorn the divine, Jumper, for you do not need it. By your hands will a new kind of deity be made. Better, purer, human. You have discovered the means by which to produce that spark of divinity. With your new understanding of the underlying mechanisms of reality your strength, speed, intellect and resilience grown immensely. Your very will seems to radiate around you as an invisible yellow glow that subtly bends reality to your convenience, as if the very knowledge of this procedure elevates you above your fellow man. Candles burn longer, time seems to accelerate or pass slower at your pleasure. But the greatest ability born of this new wisdom by far is the ability to produce a God Seed. Taking the shape of an unassuming and un-hatching egg, this is one of the five ingredients necessary to produce your very own, man- made gods. The other being a Ritual, a Vessel, a Principle and a Sacrifice. Once you decide on a principle, you will have a feeling to the scale of the requirements necessary to hatch one of your God Seeds. The specifics, however, are up to you, and will in fact result in a completely different god, depending on the choices you make. Debauchery can exist without any sexual intercourse, for example. The only caveat is that the principle chosen needs to be man-made. You cannot create a god of hunting or fishing or a god of fire or sex, but you can create a god of farming, or literature, or war. The broader and more elementary the principle chosen, the stronger the resulting deity overall, and the greater the Sacrifice. It would take a truly staggering amount of preparation and death to bring about a god of Mankind, luckily, you already have a perfect Vessel. (Editor’s Note: For examples on the types of gods that can be created. Please check out the NOTES at the end of the Fear of Hunger Jump. Also the price for King in Yellow has been increased from 600CP to 1000CP.)",

      "description": "Tyrant Deployment Tubes [300CP] (Resident Evil) This massive set of four 16ft tubes may not look like much on the outside, but inside each contains a custom Tyrant-model B.O.W., resembling massive grey-skinned humans ready to follow whatever orders you may have programmed into them. They won't understand much outside of those orders, but they're very knowledgeable when it comes to combat, they each come with a 'Power Limiter Coat', and they can be incredibly deadly combatants on their own... and that's before they mutate into Super Tyrants. Should the Tyrants perish, another will respawn within a single month. The respawn will not work unless the Tyrant for that tube has perished, and their 'Power Limiter Coat' only works for them. Verdugos of the Cloth [300CP] (Resident Evil) I would like to ask you, my friend... are you a person of faith? Do you believe in a higher power? Whether you do or don't, these bodyguards will leave their enemies praying for their god before they are slain. These 8ft B.O.W.s come with either a red cloak or a black cloak, depending on your style, and are essentially large insect/human hybrids. With powerful segmented tails that possess a blade at the end, durable exoskeletons, and incredible levels of intelligence, comprehension, and dexterity? Any who underestimate this sneaky, crafty quartet will be quite sorry, if not dead. Should the Verdugo perish, another will respawn within a single month. There may only be four Verdugo out at a time. Molded Horde [300CP] (Resident Evil) There comes a time where you just really don’t care about the state of a person when they get killed. You just want them dead, to hell with how it happens. Enter this hyper-evolved fungal creature that can be reshaped or augmented thanks to the filaments that constitute its form. Significantly more durable and intelligent than zombies, they’re capable of using the environment to their advantage while working in groups. What you have here are three dozen of the Molded, able to be reshaped into their different variants as you see fit. They will respawn once a month. Licker Horde [300CP] (Resident Evil) One of the more iconic B.O.W.s that came out of Umbrella’s viral laboratories, the Licker is a strange creature that comes about from a human who has had prolonged exposure to the t-Virus. Increased musculature, exposed brain tissue, and loss of skin while running around on all fours makes it look scary, and the elongated tongue it has makes for a very deadly weapon. What you have here is either three dozen of the regular Lickers, or a dozen and a half of the Licker β variants which are further augmented into dangerous predators. They will respawn once a month. J’avo Squad [300CP] (Resident Evil) Coordination and frightening intelligence matched with absolute unpredictability of mutations. Such a combination is exceptionally terrifying, and it is with good reason that the BSAA would come to see the J’avo as an exceptional threat whenever they are fielded. Not only are they able to be trained in use of weapons and vehicles along with group tactics and advanced forms of combat, but taking damage will cause them to mutate into one of many possible forms that will augment their combat capability while forcing the enemy to change tactics themselves. Some of these mutations can even be stacked, with larger amounts of damage causing a Chrysalid state that cocoons them and creates unique monsters ready to fight. You gain a dozen and a half J’avo as your loyal minions, respawning once a month. (Editor's Note: If you wish to make the monsters more of a precious resource, then you can remove the respawn property, or add a similar permanent death clause like the Tyrant Deployment Tubes perk.)",

      "source": "The Dark Tower",
      "description": "Deadlights [800CP] (The Dark Tower) Writhing, radiant orange lights that are a mysterious but very deadly and terrifying eldritch form of energy which originates from the preternatural dimension known as the Macroverse (better known as the Todash Darkness). Just a mere glance into the bright lights instantly causes death or permanent and incurable insanity - as well as doing unspeakable things to the victim’s soul. They can destroy minds and bodies, warp whole communities - or even worlds - and drag victims into Todash Darkness where they will wander blind and helpless until devoured by unspeakable horrors. These are among the greatest weapons wielded by the Crimson King which he has used to ascend the levels of the Tower, and while these will not allow you to do that, they are nonetheless yours to use in whatever fashion you should wish - you may call them at will, and dismiss them just as easily back to the outer darkness from which they came. However, be warned, there is no undoing what is wrought by them - by any power. These are your weapons to wield, but they are not tame - do not be careless with them. (Editor’s Note: This perk also acts as a Capstone Booster for the perk Dominate.) Dominate [800CP] (The Dark Tower) Mating with machinery is one of your talents, and you are able to take over (working) machines - no matter how advanced or seemingly tamper proof - by means of your inherent authority and the force of your will. Intelligent or aware machines may begin to break down if you are not gentle with the demands which you place upon them, as their programming is eroded, however resisting you is ultimately impossible (and most won’t even try). Dealing with living creatures which are young and lacking in will isn’t much different from dealing with machines - you instinctively understand how to look through their thoughts and locate the node that controls their will - and how to seize it and make it your own. You could force them to lower their necks and let you take their lives. However, like with machines, you risk damaging them irreparably if you use this talent without finesse. Beings (and machines too, for that matter) already dominated by some equally implacable supernatural force will usually resolve the conflict by dropping dead. Capstone Boosted: Your dominion is over all creatures great and small, whether they recognise it or not they are your playthings, and so simply by demanding it you may take control of people, forcing them to do as you command. Demanding it is sufficient to make them rip out their own eyes with their bare hands - or kill each other with the same, irrationally hate someone they have every reason to love without any cause, or even abruptly stop breathing and drop dead. This is a power that is not entirely irresistible, but mere force of will - no matter how potent - is not enough to contest you - only those with some manner of supernatural power over their own minds would even be able to attempt it (anyone else would simply have an aneurism and still have to do whatever you demand of them). This power takes effect at your command, not their comprehension - they don’t have to be aware of your presence, or understand what you’re saying, or even hear you - give them an order, and they’ll do it. They simply have no choice in the matter. You are not limited to one person at a time - you could easily make an entire community commit mass suicide.",

      "source": "Ib Gauntlet",
      "description": "Master of the Arts [100CP] (Ib Gauntlet) You are the new Picasso and Da Vinci, able to make every kind of visual art possible, from sketches to sculptures to paintings. You are knowledgeable in a variety of styles, and have a way of giving your own creative flair to your masterpieces. Critics will fall over themselves over your art, and whatever you make will be treasured for years to come. Reclamation [200CP] (Ib Gauntlet) You can cause any artwork belonging to you to instantly return to your possession if it goes missing. Even if thieves take it away to a secure vault, it will reappear in your collection at your wish. Also allows you to essentially leash naughty paintings that try to run away from home. Does not restore art that has been destroyed. With enough work, you can expand your power to other items besides artwork. If your artworks are alive, you might gradually be able to assert further control over their thoughts, though you’ll need to fight against their own willpower. Paint to Life [300CP] (Ib Gauntlet) It's said that spirits dwell in objects into which people put their feelings, and the same applies for artwork. You now have the ability to give life to paintings, statues, and other artworks. Even a crayon sketch of a sun would give off heat and light as if it were real. There are but a couple of catches. First, you can only animate works that you made by your own hands. Second, they cannot be of people who exist in the real world; in the case of inanimate things such as moons and stars, or things that have multiple copies such as a species of snake, they can still be created. Third, to give life to an artwork you must sacrifice a small but vital piece of your own life. It is possible to recover in time, but overdoing things may put you at the edge of death. Although you can create works that have magical powers, to fully use their magic in the real world they would require continual magic support from you. Also, the act of creation does not give you control over the animated works, and they retain independent wills, though they will generally respect their maker. Claimed for Posterity [400CP] (Ib Gauntlet) It’s wonderful to make your own art, but the real world is full of lovely things as well. It’s such a shame that they all fade away so quickly, never finding the eternity that paintings have. Fortunately, you can be their salvation. If you have access to someone who has just died, you can claim him or her as your own artwork. The subject will be reincarnated into a fitting art piece of your design, and be given an appropriate title if you do not choose one for it. Unless you choose otherwise, reality will shift so that other people, unless they were especially tied to that person, will forget about your artwork’s original life, and believe that it is one of your own creations (which it is, in a fashion). In addition, since the artwork still embodies the soul of the person, you can give life to it even without the Paint to Life perk (and you won’t need to use any of your own life force). If given life, the artwork will retain a degree of the memories and personality of its past self; as a result, don’t expect it to necessarily follow your orders. Fabricated World [600CP] (Ib Gauntlet) Even if you give life to your artworks, they still do not have a place in the world of the real. By sacrificing part of your life, you can create a full-fledged gallery, an elaborate dungeon where all of your living masterpieces can live forever, along with anything trapped inside. Your artworks now exist on two planes: in the real world as inanimate objects, and in another world as living things. The paintings in the real world act as windows of sorts for their living counterparts in the other world, but they cannot physically interact with the real world. The real and unreal are bridged through a special painting, the Fabricated World, which can appear and disappear anywhere in the real gallery at your command; whenever someone stares deep and long enough at the tapestry, you can pull him or her into your other world. Within your painted world, you can give life to your artwork (even without Paint to Life) and use their full magic potential without needing to drain your own reserves (as long as they stay inside the Fabricated World). If you purchased Claimed for Posterity, any person who dies inside the gallery will automatically turn into another of your artworks. These galleries are self-sustaining once you pour in the initial energy. The galleries you create will link together and follow you between jumps and are accessible from your Warehouse when not summoned; you can also continue to add new pieces to and remodel your old galleries as you see fit. You can allow yourself to dissolve and merge into the gallery as a whole to control it at will, place special messages on wall or paper, and exist in that fragmented yet all-seeing state indefinitely; however, you are able to regather yourself and return to normal when you wish. If you fuse your soul to the gallery, you may be able to find ways to apply other powers you have to the form of the dungeon – for example, if you had some sort of control over fire you could perhaps make your gallery’s features resistant to fire or keep the gallery permanently on fire without any of your creations being harmed.",

The summoning of the dead is acceptable, but abuse of their power will see the sacred turn its back on them. Likewise, the great alchemist Chartreuse Grande transgressed similarly. A spirit of angelic descent was captured and bound to flesh as a homunculus by his hands, and yet her incarnation was a holy thing. For you, the sacred has given its blessing to trespass upon its domain. With the dark arts at your disposal, you are able to meddle in the sacred and divine without fear of retribution. The power to manipulate divine forces is now yours to wield, free from the taint of evil or corruption. You will not sully the holy simply by observing or manipulating it. Do not mistake this for being holy yourself, or think this forbearance will remain if your arts turn to the service of sin.

For certain spirits a simple gesture may suffice, for others, a sacrifice may be necessary, but with a little bit of observation you’ll be able to determine what is necessary to pacify the spirit in question. If you are truly sincere, the spirit may even hold you in good favour – with spirits, honesty can sometimes be the best policy. That being said however, not every spirit will wait for you to appease them. Most Mononoke, while scornful of humans, are still coherent and willing to listen to reason. Should you ever have the misfortune of running into a cursed spirit, one that can no longer retain any of their former senses, your knowledge of spirits attained from your heritage may still be of some use. With the same rituals used to appease a spirit, you may be able to calm a raging spirit down – though how effective this is will likely be dependent on how long the madness has been allowed to take hold.

You're sure you have never been to these places before, yet they feel eerily familiar, as if you've walked upon these halls a thousand times before. What guides you your steps is not some spirit or demon. The voice whispering secrets and dangers might not be true memory, but rather its habits. This will not warn of uncommon dangers; of surprise ambushes and plots. But it might tell you where an ambush might happen, or any persistent threat in the area. Such impossible recollections will dog your steps no matter how far you run. Before the Bell Tolls [50CP] (GrimGrimoire) As you embark upon these five days, punctuality shall be of utmost importance. To fall behind in your duties could have dire consequences, far beyond a mere dent in your academic records. Therefore, it is imperative that you make the most of each passing moment. Fortunately, it appears that you have been granted a small reprieve. Should you find yourself in a precarious situation, outnumbered and in need of escape, these extra minutes could make all the difference. The same can be said for the completion of your studies - a few extra moments could mean the difference between success and failure. Though in the grand scheme of things, these minutes may seem insignificant, we must remember that it is often the smallest actions that carry the greatest impact. All told, it will struggle to grant half of an hour within the scope of a day, but if moments count, then it shall be all you need. Likewise, remember that this time is not for you alone; it is no gift of haste, but of time, to be used by anyone in your vicinity. Make the most of this time, and ensure that you are fully prepared before the bell tolls its final call.",

If you’re dealing with something like the Fae, who are bound by both explicit and implicit rules, you’ll quickly understand those rules, maybe even better than they do, understand the grey areas, and understand when their limitations would come into play when it wouldn’t be expected. You can call upon fate and death to bind agreements as a supernatural power. You can bind any agreement made with you as a participant as if with a Quest spell. You yourself will be so bound to your part. The supernatural effect will have the strength as if cast by an Overdeity of Magic. You can’t trick someone into this - they will feel the power before a word leaves their lips. If someone is completely at your mercy, you can demand they accept such a Quest, but you cannot use magical compulsion to force the issue.",

So they rely on others. Most commonly, they rely on familiars, a category of being that you are oddly gifted with. Outside of just a specialisation in magic, you appear to get significantly greater results than normal in anything regarding familiars. Your efforts to create them result in more powerful creatures made for less costs, while attempting to attract existing creatures to become your servants most often ends in a quite powerful new ally who is rather lenient in their required contract. You’ll quickly become well versed in using multiple familiars in your goals, particularly making use of them in combat instead of fighting yourself, and even find that maintaining familiars is relatively cheaper for you. A weak magus might not be much of a threat but if he had ten loyal spirits aiding him, they could most certainly take down even much larger game. In particular, any magecraft you know will soon reveal to you ways that it can be entwined with any familiars you have, sometimes stretching the boundaries of what’s normally possible in those disciplines when used for your focus here. Often methods to enhance your familiars during creation or battle, it may also show ways to create entirely new kinds of familiars. Perhaps a Doll Making specialist would learn to make familiars out of their own selves with this, an army of one!",

Eating mushrooms will, much like taking pills, promote a rapid regrowth of your body’s cells, regenerating wounds.

Works on all mushrooms post-Jump, though ones that are unusual in some way will provide greater healing. Appetite [100CP] (Darkwood) Strange appetites abound in the Darkwoods. Savages can often be found gnawing on trees, but there is some method to their madness as you will discover that your jaw is capable of gnawing through entire logs to provide a similar benefit to the above, or planks for a minor, but respectable healing boost.

This applies even to attacks from outside of this jump, however, those tend to not map directly very often. Trigger Element [200CP] (OFF) This is an expensive attack, causing mediocre damage for a far higher energy cost than [Home Run]. However, the trick is that this attack bypasses all armor and defenses, applying damage directly to your opponent; this means that even though it has disappointing damage output, it is capable of harming enemies that would otherwise be unaffected by other, more powerful attacks. Same deal as usual; the damage output can be increased over time, but at the cost of higher energy usage.",

Sometimes the dead need a hand moving on, or finding a place to settle down and something to occupy their time. In this world this is especially true as the bridge to the afterlife was destroyed. You have developed a knack for saying and doing just the right thing to calm an angry spirit, and can even recruit them to aid you on your quest. This affinity for afterlife therapy ensures you will always have the opportunity to persuade the restless dead to work with you, or at least not against you. Soul Whisperer [100CP] (Graveyard Keeper) May only be taken if you have also taken the Soul Saving Scenario and Ghost Whisperer. The act of healing souls and sending them to the afterlife has drawn the attention of other earthbound spirits. Your actions have earned you a bit of respect and a willingness to help. So much so that you can ask those earthly spirits to complete any task that would require a bit of time and effort on your part, and they will be able to complete it as if you did it yourself. This only works for tasks that are physical and constructive in nature. (Editor’s Note: You do not need to worry about the Saving Soul Scenario as a prerequisite.)",

When you take one of the cards and place it in opposition to the other four, whatever card is singled out is unable to actualize as a threat. These cards aren’t omnipotent though, each card only prevents a single threat; For example, a single card could prevent the Elsewhere from creating it’s mimicked rooms, but not prevent the Elsewhere from moving the other Threats, or it could prevent the Presence from hiding behind doors, but not all manifestations of the danger it poses.",

SCPs are no joke, even (or especially) when they might seem like someone’s idea of a joke. Lots of these objects can kill indiscriminately and without warning. You know exactly what line not to cross to use them before it compromises your safely. Anomalous equipment spares you the worst of their effects, if there are certain types of users they won’t harm you’re probably in the clear – or at least suffer less than a typical user. Mastering the positives of anomalies and overcoming their dangers is your specialty. From sci-fi technology to magical artifacts, you’re great at making use of anything with only minimal exposure to it and quickly understanding the best way to use it. For the most lethal and cursed of these objects it will only buy you greater survival time than others. But with your adaptability and understanding of the anomalous, it might be that a little time is all you need to save yourself with a clever solution? Of course, none of this will help if you’re the specifically intended target. It might just be that every SCP object you use is just a little stronger for you being the one to use it.",

You regenerate twice as fast as a troll, with such regeneration hampered by negative energy and similarly ruinous forces.

If your health is full, your abundant life force pours into a lake of vitality that you can instantly parcel out to heal yourself, or lay on hands to bolster the living, ward away negative energy, and burn the undead.

This lake is about the same size as your ‘natural’ level of life-force. If that lake is full, the excess life energy will form an invisible haze about you that bolsters friendly life, kills harmful disease by overwhelming it much as the Positive Energy Plane does to all life, scours away at curses and hostile magical forces, poisons the undead, and generally invisibly works in your favor.

In its unused form, the cursed object appears as a cube small enough to fit in a person's hand and is wrapped in talisman constraints. The curse is activated with the incantation \"gate open\". On command, the cube opens into a mass of flesh stretched out by four corners with the remains of the cube at the edges. It has a giant bleeding eye in the middle with stitches keeping it open to stare at its target. Conditions must be met for Prison Realm to activate. In order for the target to be sealed, they must be kept within a four-meter radius for long enough for the cursed object to take hold. In Satoru Gojo's specific case, he had the potential to escape Prison Realm's range in time, so he had to be kept within the required radius for a minute's worth of time within his brain. The next stage of sealing involves the mass of flesh transferring to the target's body in a flash, ensnaring them. This renders them immobile and unable to access any of their cursed energy. The sealing process can be completed with the command \"gate close\", reverting Prison Realm into its small form, trapping the target inside indefinitely. Only one occupant can be contained at a time. Unless the person inside takes their own life, Prison Realm cannot be used again. While \"processing\" a strong sorcerer such as Satoru Gojo, Prison Realm becomes extremely heavy and cannot be moved. Several eyes open around the surface of the cube as well. Inside the pocket dimension of the Prison Realm, time doesn't pass and the sealed person is surrounded by dark skeletons and an ominous atmosphere.",

Unfortunately, this Magic is slippery and only really seems to attach itself to the physical world, be it people or structures, but can never exist freely by itself. Nothing is stopping you from cursing someone with bad luck or laying down in a field that makes people want to go far away from some place, but you won’t be throwing fireballs around with this power. This comes with the ability to sense the presence of magic around you, get an idea of how dangerous it is and its general effect, and the ability to shatter similar wards and curses on physical entities by ‘poking’ at the right points of the magical structure. All magics and supernatural effects you witness in the future will have these ‘shatter points’, but only you and those to whom you teach the art seem to be able to discover and take advantage of them. This magical style is most powerful against purely supernatural beings with no truly physical form, for the power they are made out of is extremely susceptible to being shattered or bound.",

Pookys are usually Garfield’s favorite stuffed bear, and you lucked out in finding the equivalent to your universe. This item will by all accounts just be a toy, slightly broken and off putting, the exact form it takes depends on your Gorefield’s aesthetics and origin, but even your Gorefield will care about their Pooky. You can even use this as a bargaining chip, they still prioritize killing you over the teddy bear but ideally they want both, and are willing to make deals and bargain to make sure they get it. Post-Gauntlet, you get a fixed version of Pooky for collection sake, and per Jump you can ask for one stuffed toy that has a similar effect on another specific monster of your choice. Holy Water Spray [200CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes) A normal looking water spray on the surface, but the water inside of it is blessed against everything that is malicious. It can even cause mild harm to the weaker half of the Gorefields you encounter and it can even stun the stronger half, it is repelling against them because they are both cats and evil creatures. For the Gauntlet your supply will be limited, but post-Gauntlet it will refill itself automatically and you can tinker with the formula to boost it. Nermal [200CP] (Gorefield Horrorscopes) Oh, that’s convenient. This is Nermal, a cat that just so happens to be one thing your Gorefield wants to kill that takes priority over you. This is sort of like the opposite of Pooky, as Gorefield will go to great lengths to make sure this cat dies. Nermal here will be just a regular, if a tad cuter than average, kitty. Unlike Pooky, Nermal seems to be a higher priority target than even yourself, meaning if you somehow force a binary choice of either killing you or Nermal, your Gorefield will rather have Nermal killed. You can choose if you own Nermal or if he is a street cat or belongs to somebody else. You wouldn't be that heartless to use Nermal as a sacrifice, right Jumper? Post-Gauntlet you can decide if you want Nermal as a pet, and if he still attracts hatred when it comes to supernatural creatures.",

      "description": "Though there are certainly other humans who understand the cycle of nature and the relationship that nature has with mankind, the age where mankind coexisted with nature and respected that relationship has passed. Many of the folks who consider themselves “civilized” see this land as something to be exploited and consumed in order for society to progress, so they go about spreading death into the old lands, tearing apart mountains and mowing down forests to consummate their grand ideals. But humans aren’t only capable of spreading death and disease far and wide; the Emishi stand as proof that humans are capable of nurturing the natural environments around them and capable of establishing a balance between nature’s presence and mankind’s influence. The ancient rituals tell of methods to drive out corruption from an individual, but should an adequately large vessel be present, there’s no reason why a geographical area couldn’t be purged of corruption and ruin as well. A method such as this isn’t without its risks however, and should you choose to undertake such a venture, there are details that you should heed. To take corruption from another and absorb it into your own body is no difficult task for you, regardless of whether your target is a location or another individual. However, there is only so much that your body can take in at once, and it will strain your body to retain large amounts of foreign matter without allowing that foreign matter to affect you directly. Take in too much and you’ll risk spilling all of it back out into the environment. Perhaps though, this could be useful in a pinch, especially since any corruption that you’ve absorbed will most likely be harmful to others. The longer you retain such malevolent elements, the stronger your own resistance will be towards it, so as risky as it is – it isn’t entirely detrimental. With time, you should be able to convert that which you’ve absorbed into something less malevolent and something more beneficial – but how long this will take will depend on the quantity you’ve absorbed, its concentration, and how much of your own life force that you are willing to dedicate to the process. Of course, just because you’re a vessel doesn’t mean you can only retain a single element within your body. With time, you’ll be able to use your body as a vessel to equalize the energies between two different targets, by transferring life force from one source to another through yourself as a vessel. Whether you see this as equalizing the life force between two things or using one to bolster another, the result will still be the same as you pull the two targets closer to a state of equilibrium. In this fashion, it should be possible to breathe life back into a place which has been rendered desolate...but the amount of energy that will be required to do so will undoubtedly be significant.",

      "description": "Blank Rose [200CP] (Ib Gauntlet) A white-colored rose. Whenever you give it to a person, the holder can bond with it in a manner similar to Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit. The rose will accordingly shift to a color that reflects the user’s soul, and allow him or her to exist normally in realities that would normally alter or reject their existence. When the holder lets go of the rose for more than one day or chooses to relinquish control, though, the rose returns to its blank state and the former user loses the protection granted by the rose. However, until the time limit runs out, the person who was given the rose can automatically summon the rose back to himself or herself at will, as long as they have not relinquished their use of the rose back to you. Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit* [600CP] (Ib Gauntlet) Since the Fabricated World is meant for artwork and not real humans, you would normally be unable to exist in that other world, except as an imaginary thing yourself. Fortunately, you don’t need to worry about that. Your life force has been transferred to a special rose of a color that resonates with you. As long as your soul is tied to the rose, you can exist in world that would otherwise forcibly change the very nature of your body and soul without facing negative consequences; any changes to your mind or body to suit the requirements of that world are neutralized with the flower’s presence. The rose does not need to be kept nearby you, and as long as it is kept fresh you will be protected from the distorted reality’s changes even if you are far away from it. The rose’s petals vary depending on your age and health, but do not pluck them, as they literally symbolize your life. Whenever a petal is plucked, you gain cuts and sharp internal pains. In turn, whenever your body is hurt, your rose loses a petal; on the bright side, as long as the attack would not have been instantly fatal, you only lose a single petal each time. When they all disappear, not only do you face imminent death, but you lose your protection from the gallery’s imposed fantasy, and must face the consequences; normally, that would mean you become part of the gallery, but in the context of the jump it constitutes a game over. However, there are some benefits. The rose is eternally fresh, and whenever it is immersed in water (there must be at least a vaseful for there to be any effect, it rejuvenates, and its petals (along with your health) are restored; the water is absorbed into the rose in the process. Please note that the rose only affects the health of your physical body for better or worse; it has no effect on magic and other energies you might use. Also, if you have any special powers with flowers and plants, you might want to experiment and see what happens. Once you leave the gallery, the rose vanishes, as you do not need it in the real world, but you can summon it again if you feel the need. On the flipside, if you could not normally exist in the real world, the rose might be able to have the reverse effect and allow you to go there without needing to make additional sacrifices. If you choose the Local Human background, you’re stuck with the rose during the jump even if you don’t buy the perk, but you will not get the extra benefits outside the jump unless you take the perk. In the case that you purchase the perk but did not choose the Local Human background, you can freely summon and dismiss it as you please. Please keep in mind that since the rose’s purpose is to keep you in existence in the world you are in, the rose must stay in the same overall reality/dimension you are in; if you move between dimensions without it, the rose will either appear before you or be dismissed until you activate the perk again.",

If an Angel demands you be pure of heart in order to earn their services, they will judge you as worthy even if you’re the type who lies and steals. If a demon-possessed weapon would encroach upon your body to corrupt you into a monster, you will find it unable to do any such thing and will work just fine otherwise in your hands without the extra ‘gift’. In other words, powers and forces that demand you be aligned to a particular ideology or level of goodness or evil find you an acceptable vessel, letting you wield the sacred in one hand and the profane in the other without needing to be one or the other.

The truly powerful ones, however, are the Cursemancers known for taking down ancient evils they were simply not capable of destroying. How? By sealing them away. A simple well-placed dimensional barrier with strong magical locks, curses to weaken and drain whatever is inside, and eventually the target simply fades away, trapped in hungry nothingness until they give up on existing. You have learned this art yourself. Creating barriers to trap targets, compressing the barrier and attaching it to an object or a location, then cursing the inside of that barrier to hell and back to ensure whatever is within will never come out again, you can do it all. Of course, whatever curses you can apply to your seals will be entirely dependent on what you’ve learned so far, but even without any your seals will work wonderfully as temporary and very annoying impediments. Or as ingenious travel pouches that are bigger on the inside, they can also do that.",

Every person has some magical potential in them, in the worth their name carries to the spirits. In many contexts, it is said that makes a person who they are. In genetics, in family, in every step you take, until a stray arrow on the battlefield relieves you of it. All that carry it consider blood to be a constituent of self. This can all be seen in a blood barrier. This is a circle drawn in blood, with the original owner of the blood not being of any particular importance. Once this circle is drawn, anything that wishes to harm you will have serious trouble crossing it, especially if they are monstrous in nature. It does well to ward away creatures, but bear in mind that there is nothing stopping them from simply throwing an object, or shooting through. Spiritual Storage [300CP] (Pact) Some Others are more easily bound to an item. This object will allow for that, taking on the form of whatever object is needed to store an Other, being almost impossible for them to escape from once inside. It acts as a conduit, making it easy to draw the Other back out, or channel their energies for other uses. This Is Who I Am Now [400CP] (Pact) As a vestige, you are but a commodity to some. Easy to twist and alter, at the hands of malicious Others, an almost blank template to become the creature that others want from you. If this situation were forced on you, transforming you into a terrible beast, you could easily come out on top. Regardless of the changes to your body, you can fight to maintain the right to autonomy. Your new limbs will move for you as your previous did, and the feral thoughts they have filled your brain with can be forced back down with the reassertion of your own. Even the new powers are your own to command. Regardless of changes, your body is your own. To Bind and Call [400CP] (Pact) Your skill at summoning and binding Others, is far beyond what most would expect. You own dozens of books stating the bindings that would work best for different Others, as well as names and information about those that can be called. On top of this, you are exceptionally skilled at deal making, when it comes to Others. You can find exactly what they want, and know how to have them work for you with minimal personal sacrifice. It would be no issue for you to have tens of bogeymen on rotation, summoning them in waves, as your enemies mow them down.

      "description": "Parautilitarian [Free] (Control (Remedy Entertainment)) You are now a ‘parautilitarian’, a person with sufficient mental power to be able to link to Objects of Power and utilize their abilities. Even without linking, you will gain a vague empathic sense for the emotions of those around you, and strong but unfocused telekinetics, which can mainly be used to execute a force telekinetic shove or push. Your main ability will be the ability to link to Objects of Power, forming a connection that can allow you to borrow their abilities, which can range from levitation to mind control and more. In future Jumps, objects with strong supernatural powers or links to the combined human subconscious can be treated as Objects of Power and bound for abilities as well. Upon binding an object, you can be transported to a temporary mental space, where you can go through a brief ‘tutorial’ on how to use the object’s power. Anti-Hiss [300CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment)) Jesse Faden was made immune to the Hiss via her relationship with Polaris, and now, you have the same immunity, with the source being this perk instead. You are able to travel through Hiss-infected areas without becoming infected yourself, and if you selected the Infected Origin, this Perk is what allows you to retain your mind while still gaining some powers from the Hiss or whatever other phenomenon has infected you. If you spend 300CP, this immunity will continue with you into future Jumps, and expands to all forms of possession, corruption, and mind control, rendering your will inviolate by any external force, and even if you do allow someone within your mind and soul, you can still perfectly isolate and ignore any influence they might try to exercise over your will, and expel them at any time. Black Rock [600CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment)) Comes with a free Ashtray and Cigarette Object of Power. Black Rock. A frankly miraculous material that can suppress almost any paranatural ability, acting like lead for paranatural ‘radiation’. It is the key to many of the FBC’s security procedures, and now, you embody its effects. To start with, you are simply far tougher than you actually should be, more resistant to damage or impacts. But more importantly, your mere presence severely dampens the effect of paranatural effects around you. This can include supernatural effects from other sources than the “resonances” that you encounter here, but the moment that they come close to you, they will be severely weakened. And that is not all. You can choose to ‘close the Firebreak’ and render yourself entirely immune to such effects, allowing you to simply no-sell supernatural effects the instant they make contact with you. The cost of doing this, however, is that you will have to severely weaken any supernatural abilities that you yourself possess (excluding the Perks associated with this Origin). Object of Power: Ashtray and Cigarette [free with Black Rock] (Control (Remedy Entertainment)) A steel ashtray and a constantly smoking cigarette. When this Object of Power is activated, an impenetrable maze will form around the ashtray and the space it occupies, up to the size of a moderately large building. The maze itself will appear to externally take up the same space as the inner sanctum it guards, but within will create an infinite array of shifting corridors to prevent passage, and it can even redirect teleportation or dimensional travel effects that would try to bypass it. Only the binder can allow passage through the maze, typically by summoning the cigarette and giving it to someone to hold as they move through the maze. HRA Maker [600CP] (Control (Remedy Entertainment)) The HRA is a marvel, allowing for the influence of a specific paranatural resonance to be mimicked and spread, to provide an extremely thorough protection against hostile forces and possession. You now have a stockpile of resources and technological know-how that would allow you to create your own HRAs. These devices don’t rely on the specific resonance of Hedron to function, instead being able to replicate both potential functions of the original devices separately. Your version of the HRA can either mimic the effects of some sort of paranatural or extradimensional energy and provide those effects (or a useful subset thereof) to the wearer, or they can provide a comprehensive protection against possession, alteration, or manipulation by some other paranatural or extradimensional energy. It is entirely possible for the device to do both functions at the same time.",

      "description": "Anti-Entity Agent [1200CP] (Adrift in the Complex) Humans have lived in the Backrooms for an eternity, and you will not see them laid low by these entities and their fancy powers! You possess a significant resistance to the influence and power of supernatural beings. The Animated King can’t transform you, and not even nonsense like really thorough semiohazardous lifeforms can stop you from driving a knife through the skull. This will not protect you from supernatural environmental hazards. Reality Anchor: It seems like you share at least one feature with that bastard Clef. When around you, reality bending and various alterations to reality are ineffective if you don’t want them to work. Existence erasure, dimensional banishing, transmutation, curses, and hostile environmental modifications are now totally ineffective. This does not make you immune to omnipresent forces, which would include things like the laws of physics, magic, and conceptual forces. All Men Must Die [1200CP] (Adrift in the Complex) Or Valar Morghulis, if you get that reference. The problem with this creed is that a lot of things can’t be harmed, despite you clearly being able to know it’s there. So long as you are able to perceive that something exists in front of you, even if you can’t actually see it, then you are able to deal real damage to it. This includes humans, entities, intangible & non-corporeal beings, and other creatures of atypical configurations. This doesn’t mean you’ll win, but you do get a real fighting chance. The Killer of Gods: What you can do is what the Iron Fist could only dream of. Your weapons can pierce and slay anything, even if that thing is immortal, conceptual, or even a god. Do note however, that if something is beyond your ability to conceptualize, then you literally cannot harm it. Please see this article's conceptualization chart to understand what that means. Fight the gods of the Backrooms if you want, but don’t go and try fighting the true forms of the Pillars, because it’s a bit like hitting a shadow.",

And while with this alone there is no true mind control, those given the semblance of life in this manner are generally inclined to fight for you in instinctive thanks for the second chance of life you have granted. For the living, you instead gain the power to lay down a sign which permits others to request your aid-and within touching distance, bless others with a similar power. This lets them come to aid you in battle as a tangible but translucent spirit form with all their powers and abilities, even in truly unusual locations. Though in both cases, without greater arts they will soon fade away- in the dead’s case, because of the fading magic. Though the living may stay, most choose to return to their own lives and bodies once the battle is over. ...most of the time, anyway.

You are only limited by your levels of health and mana and the processing constraints of your mind. For the moment you may give rise to Swarmlings, Reavers, and Giants, but in the future who knows what you could create. Do be mindful though that the stronger the creature the greater its cost, and some will demand more than blood and mana. After their creation you may also invest mana in monsters you have created to increase their power, but as with gems the cost quickly becomes prohibitive. Monsters you create will not resist your commands, but they are not strictly loyal as they do not have much of a mind of their own. Should your control over them falter they will likely revert to a primal state. If you learn to create more intelligent monsters they will likely follow you as long as you remain stronger than them, but what they would do when not under your control will be hard to predict.",

Instead what this perk does is summon that Gorefield into the world of your own, a random location that’s guaranteed to be far enough depending on its power level. You nevertheless do possess an intrinsic link to one another, as “cat” and “owner” just like Jon and Garfield. The moment they catch a whiff of your scent, they will come looking for you. Make sure they don’t find you first, or else they’ll likely attack you first or “play” with you. But once you confront your Gorefield, you must do one of three methods in defeating them. Depending on the way you choose to deal with your Gorefield, you can either make them leave/disappear, gain their special item, or have them join you as your very own “Garfield”. Albeit a gruesome version of one, but a Garfield nevertheless. (Editor’s Note: This is an alternative perk I made to the original. Which now allows for Gorefield to be “summonable”. Depending on how you wish for the Gorefield to manifest and scale to the universe you're in. I recommend dialling Taurus Gorefield down, or keep them at that size if you wish. Also in the original gauntlet at the bottom, there are rough power levels given based-off the JJK Grade System. It should help gauge how strong you wish them to be.

Since you haven’t had any exposure to the actual phenomenon expecting you to understand the root cause would be unreasonable.

But be warned, dear reader, for the necromancer's fascination with the underworld's secrets can lead them down a dark and treacherous path of magic. Still, Necromancy is the scourge of Sorcery, whose diabolical machinations and demonic forces pale in comparison to the eternal essence of the spirit realm. Indeed, the willful servitude of demons cowers before the restless spirits of the dead. Even as the unreal dead flinch away from the touch of nature divine. The Arts of Sorcery [200CP] (GrimGrimoire) Sorcery, the arcane art of calling forth demons from the nether realms and bending them to one's will, is a practice steeped in the forbidden lore of damnation. The demons, banished from the holy embrace of the Almighty, exist as physical beings, enslaved by the chains that bind them for their defiance. The price of this mastery is steep, for no magician may conjure the spirits of the damned without risking a terrible cost. But, for those with a pure heart, the demons are but tools wielded as a God would in his wisdom. Yet, the sorcerer's soul must remain steadfast, for the devils are cunning, and seek to lead weaker souls down the path of betrayal and ruin. The will of the Dead, boundless and unbound by form, forms Sorcery’s most deadly bane. At the other extreme, Alchemy, with its hubris and disregard for God's sacred creation, stands defenseless against the dark majesty of sorcery.",

Written by Achmed the I Just Get These Headaches, it is a mystical tome of great arcane power, able to liquefy the brains of an unprepared reader. For the prepared reader (or one who can somehow survive their brains dribbling out their ears) it is an artefact of great power. It provides the necessary spells, rituals, and protocols to contact or summon gods, demons, the dead, and other supernatural entities, even ones banished to the Dungeon Dimensions, constantly keeping updated with the various states of gods and other beings. While it doesn’t put them under the summoner’s control, the ability to talk to the gods and force them to at least hear you is a powerful (and dangerous) tool.",

Demons are infinite in number, and are summoned from Beyond, so there is no risk of running out, and no penalty for their death. The price is easy; a drop of blood and an investment of mana. The more mana you contribute, the stronger the resulting pseudo-soul of the demon. Since the soul-like structure of the demon is tied directly to their body, it also increases their physical resilience, with no real upper limit. At the time of summoning, you can bind them with a simple command, and they will try to complete the given objective, albeit with extremely limited intelligence. With advanced techniques, you can also provide more direct control, but that requires an ongoing effort, as well as the specialized training necessary to avoid damage from the corrosive mind of the demon. A word of warning, while simple demons are dumb reguardless of their strength, that is not the case for every type of demon. Simple swarmlings, reavers, and giants all lack the critical thinking necessary to rebel against your control, but if you try to get creative and summon anything more sophisticated, you may end up with a powerful enemy that resents your chains, and may very well possess the creativity to get loose from them. The greatest threat that the world faces was one such demon, once upon a time.",

Does blood not flow even if curdled? It seems so easy to imagine a time when the dead may rise if they can only think to do so. In our dreams, perhaps? You have much greater skill with dissecting, pulling apart, studying, preserving, and stitching corpses back together. It matters little whether it’s of an otherworldly nature or not, a corpse is a corpse, even if it still writhes. Perhaps you had a past as a mortician, but they usually look well when you’re done too. More curious, you have a knack for ‘Making Contact’ with otherworldly minds, consciousness with no form, and guiding them to the cold bodies you’ve been tampering with. Though it may be far easier in the dreaming lands, the fact remains, you may make the dream of the living dead a reality.” Eldritch Teachings [300CP] (Bloodborne) “It could be said that magic does not exist within this world in any true capacity. Those who believe in mysticism are simply tampering with forces they have no understanding of. Yet, there are discoveries of rituals and methods that certainly resemble the arcane. As with the witches of Hemwick, you may sacrifice harvested eyes to summon Stalkers, almost demonic beings armed with hand scythes, difficult to perceive by layman[sic]. This is no specific skill, but the start of your abilities relating to human sacrifice and summoning of abominable wills. All manner of rituals writhe in your mind, though they all share the same themes. You must sacrifice parts of a thinking being, and the manner in which it was taken, and in which it was sacrificed, causes the lingering consciousness tied to the sacrifice to create a new form for itself. Harvested eyes create a being that carries the implement used to take them, and goes unseen. Numerous innocents boiled alive could create an animate slurry of limbs moving as one. A great and abhorrent enough sacrifice may even birth something greater, such as the One Reborn.”",

While the Ghost-Bloods are perhaps the most common necromancers, they could never reach the depths of power the Abyssals may aspire to. The deathly power a master necromancer wields in Creation inspires fear enough, but it pales in comparison to their power over the Underworld and the spirits of the dead. Some of the deathlords fear that the enlightenment of the Void would bring knowledge enough for the Abyssal Exalted to free themselves from bondage, and so they hesitate to teach Void Circle Necromancy. Instead they prefer to dole out necromantic teaching in small pieces, so they can monitor their underlings’ progress and test their continued loyalty. Taking on the mantle of a master necromancer of the Void circle, you will be able to show Creation and the Underworld alike Oblivion’s grandeur. As the fifteenth person to unlock the deepest mysteries of the Void Circle, only the Deathlords themselves outstrip you in skill and depths of knowledge in the field of necromancy. Even then, you will likely know a few spells they do not, as each has invented a few they never shared with others. With these dark miracles, other necromancers might be able to animate the dead, bind ghosts into servitude, and chain the souls of the living. But you could use it to animate the greatest of necrotech siege engines, summon and bind the ghost-behemoths known as hekatonkhires, curse entire bloodlines to serve eternally in death, free your soul from your body to wander as a ghost temporarily, slay your enemies a thousand different ways, and weave even stranger spells such as those to communicate and teleport through mirrors. And gaining more than simply vast knowledge and talent in this dark art, you can substitute the elements of Creation in any spells, rituals or working of sorcery you know with their Underworld counterparts: Air is replaced by Ash, Wood is replaced by Bone, Fire is replaced by Pyre Flame (The green-hued flames of the Underworld, which are like liquid fire and burning acid), Water is replaced by Blood, and Earth is replaced by Void.

Other shikigami can be summoned with an exorcism ritual where the user must defeat the shikigami in order to make them submit. Once dominated, the shikigami are under full control of their master and can be summoned using hand signs that create a shadow puppet of the respective familiar. The shadows act as the intermediary for the shikigami conjuration, reflecting the shape of the user's hand-weaved shadow puppet and manifesting the shikigami from tangible liquid shadows using cursed energy. After gaining more familiars, the user can repeat the ritual process to exorcize and amass up to ten different shikigami. The summoning ritual for the shikigami can be performed around multiple people. However, exorcizing the shikigami with help nullifies the technique once the exorcism is completed. The Ten Shadows Technique can be activated and deactivated at any time to manifest and dispel shikigami as long as the user has enough cursed energy. As with any shikigami, the more powerful it is, the more cursed energy required to summon it. Shikigami of the ten shadows cannot be summoned again when completely destroyed or killed. However, the power left behind by the shikigami is inherited by others. In the case of the Divine Dog shikigami, if white or black dog dies, its black or white twin will inherit its power and can be summoned in a far more ferocious form. The exception to this rule applies to any shikigami that are summoned by combining two different shadows. In addition to using shadows as an intermediary for shikigami, a Ten Shadows Technique user can manipulate shadows to some degree as well like keeping their shikigami in a semi fluid state at the cost of weakening them. They are able to move physical mass in and out of shadows at will. This allows them to hide their body inside shadows whether it be their own or someone else's. They can eject themselves from shadows at will as an effective means of surprise attacking their target. This same function can be used to store items within the user's shadow, but they must bear the weight of anything kept in there. You start with the same ten Megumi has with Mahoraga (Unexorcised).

Due to the destructive nature of demons, it is a very risky type of magic to use, and causes a great loss of karma, often into the negatives. Those that summon and utilise demons for their power, are looked down upon by almost everyone else in the world. Though the animus towards diabolists may seem like a prejudice, it is arguably deserved. However, the few that are successful will find great potential waiting for them in the capabilities of demons. Their powers are varied, but almost always more powerful than those of other Others. Demons can be hard to defeat, and equally hard to bind, so only the brave and un-fearing turn their head in this direction. Magical Specialisation: Valkyrie [400CP] (Pact) A Valkyrie is the term used to describe a practitioner that commands the souls of the dead. They call upon ghosts and wraiths, to rally behind them, forming an army as they march on. These ghosts will have an effect on the people they near, related to their manner of death. An old man who passed from a heart attack, may cause weak hearts to stop. A woman claimed by frost, may freeze those she touches. A Valkyrie will need to take note of significant nearby deaths, so that what is left behind can be called upon. They may also find trouble commanding lots of ghosts at once, and so would gain from having a related implement to guide them with. (Editor’s Note: Though these are the sole two Magical Specialisation options available in the source doc relevant to the Tome, those familiar with Pact may wish to consider expanding the list with something like Magical Specialisation: Scourge, or other appropriate specialisation)",

With a sharp movement and the right word, you send flying a needle at your target, it is a petrified worm that will come alive and burrow into the wound it causes. As the worms nibble on the flesh of your foes you will find your own flesh healing by an equivalent amount to the damage being caused. With time and practice you may be able to sustain an increasing number of infestations. Beyond the price in magic, this spell also requires that you carry the worms inside you as parasites... while they will cause you no trouble, you are now sharing all you eat with them, making you go hungry faster. If, for some strange reason you produce no waste from which the worms might draw sustenance, they will instead become leech-like and feed on your blood, from the inside. (Post Jump, you can choose to keep or remove the worms, and your spell can now simply create them out of thin air.) Flock of Crows [200CP] (Fear and Hunger) “Two ravens flew from Hnikar’s shoulders; Huginn to the hanged and Muninn to the slain.” Call upon the God of the Depths to summon a murder of crows to ravage your foe. If it has eyes the unkindness will unerringly focus them. Differently from nearly all other similar spells, the crows seem to persist in the world, and after your first cast will roam freely. Subsequent casts will instead summon the murder back to your location, even in future jumps. Dead crows reappear the next time you cast, as if fleeing the afterlife and seem very grateful. The crows remember you and seem capable of recognizing you no matter what form you wear and will occasionally gift you shiny things... or eyes. Mastery over Insects [200CP] (Fear and Hunger) “No one ever pays attention to the fly on the wall...” This is a special spell, it only needs to be cast once, and its effects are permanent. After performing the appropriate incantations and sacrifices, you must swallow an insect and invoke the power of the God of the Depths and thus gain the ability to communicate with all insects. They don’t usually have anything useful to say, but sometimes may surprise you with insightful or useful information and anecdotes. Insects of all size will be able to sense this ability and will respect you more, being much more amenable to listening to you. Locust Swarm [300CP] (Fear and Hunger) Summon a swarm of flesh-eating locusts to cover and ravage your foes. They will attack any and all exposed body parts, being especially devastating against unarmored foes. These locusts are capable of reducing a naked man to bones in a matter of minutes, but do not eat anything other than flesh and will quickly die if they leave your vicinity. However, even against armored foes these locusts have a use, as their incessant impacts against armor at high speed will disorient foes, leaving them open to devastating attacks",

Normally, you’d need special equipment or a ritual to keep these slaves from escaping. After all, it isn’t an easy thing to get to the Dreamlands, and you need to ensure that your new slave won’t escape just by waking up and returning to normal dreams afterwards. Fortunately, when you have captured someone’s dream-self, or otherwise obtained their soul, it is not possible for them to escape you. Oh, they can be stolen, they can kill you and be free of you that way (if they have the means), and someone can let them go, but the dream-selves and souls that you have obtained cannot actually escape you of their own accord. For dream-selves, it is up to you whether this means that they simply never wake up again, or that they wake up, but return to slavery at your hands whenever they go to sleep again, bypassing their normal dreams. Regardless, should you sell, trade, or gift a dream-self or soul to someone else, the recipient will retain this fiat-backed protection against escape. Capture Them Alive [200CP] (Children of an Elder God) It’s possible for your dream-self to fall asleep or be knocked unconscious in the Dreamlands; doing so wakes you up. And if you fell asleep in the Dreamlands, then when you fall asleep again in the waking world, that would wake you up. However, if you wake up from being knocked unconscious, then either before waking up or after going back to sleep, you will undergo a period of time where you are in the Dreamlands while unconscious, such as Touji experienced after he was wounded in a forest by the Rei in a fit of madness, yet woke up in King Kuranes’ castle. But wouldn’t it be inconvenient if you knocked someone out, only for them to disappear? When you encounter a sleeping person—or encounter the dream-self of someone who is sleeping in the physical world—you can decide that they will remain asleep no matter what you do to them. There will be no escapes by waking up on your watch! You can also end this effect whenever you like. Of course, you’re also quite skilled at knocking people unconscious in the first place, and are able to do so with a single sharp blow to the head. And you’re able to do it without causing any brain damage or lasting trauma, too. Master of Nightmares [600CP] (Children of an Elder God) In a place like the Dreamlands, nightmares are a bigger threat than they are in the waking world. You’re skilled at harvesting nightmares; you can extract them from dreams (both by encountering dreamers in the waking world, and by delving into dreams to pull them out that way), you can pull them from your own dreams, or you can capture them in the world. Once you’ve captured a nightmare, it will serve you obediently. The power of the nightmare is based on how much fear they were causing in the dream at the time you extracted it, and on the personal power of the one dreaming. A nightmare that terrified a child would overwhelm a nightmare that only disrupted an old woman’s sleep, but an eldritch god’s dreams are far more potent than a mere human’s. You can store a nightmare in any container, such as a bottle, and can summon them forth by opening or breaking the container, at which point they will attack your enemies or do your bidding. If you store nightmares in your Cosmic Warehouse, you can carry them into the waking world, and can use them there, as well.",

The catch is the consequences of these energies. Cursed energy will cause cursed spirits to appear and they will also generally be equal to the power of the setting. Also you can decide if this is a new thing that happens upon your arrival or if it is something that has existed since forever. This will inevitably change the way the plot goes Jumper so be careful. Although the amount of deaths that will more than likely happen will be horrific. (Editor’s Note: If you purchase this perk, you may gain access to Cursed Energy Freebie if you wish.) Cursed Spirit Manipulation [800CP] (Jujutsu Kaisen) As the name suggests, Cursed Spirit Manipulation is a technique where one can completely control cursed spirits they were able to conquer in battle. Rather than exorcize a cursed spirit, the user can absorb them into a small black sphere. A cursed manipulator can also absorb curses from anyone also capable of controlling them by killing the master. Exorcize and consume the cycle of exorcism and consumption. Orally consuming this orb of the curses remains gives the user complete dominance over the vagabond curse, allowing them to summon them at any time in the future. If the difference in grade is two levels or more, the curse manipulator can absorb a cursed spirit with practically no conditions attached. The user can extract the curse technique of semi-grade 1 and above cursed spirits they absorb, providing them with an immense arsenal of potential different moves. However, the quality of the cursed spirit's technique ceases to grow the moment they are absorbed. Cursed Spirit Manipulation operates functionally the same as shikigami conjuration. However, no intermediary is required and the quality of vagabond cursed spirits tends to be greater than simple shikigami. When summoned, the user's curses appear from the same portals they would use to manifest naturally. The curse manipulator can create portals of various sizes from their body and summon any number of curses from them at the same time. Due to the nature of consuming curses, a curse manipulator's cursed energy also feels different than that of a normal sorcerer. After this jump you will be able to devour monsters, demons, spirits, angels, dragons and the like. This will work if you defeat them or are stronger than tham. The difference in grades will evolve to the power of the word your in. Also the orbs don’t taste like garbage since you are paying for this. Instead they taste like different foods depending on the type of thing you devour. Like a fire cursed spirit tasting like a spicy pepper. It will never taste like trash.

To use it you must instead come to understand a species of wild animal by battling it in its natural habitat. A process most practitioners find skinning and wearing it’s pelts to enable.

Not only are you better versed at challenging the mighty dragons than most warriors, but along with a wide arsenal of basic dragon-summoning based techniques-and a handful of some truly unique dragon’s breath attacks.

Through long battle in the feral wild, you’ve somehow reverse engineered the divine invocation of the Hornsent and rendered it into something akin to Dragon Communion. Except...not for dragons. To use it you must instead come to understand a species of wild animal by battling it in its natural habitat. A process most practitioners find skinning and wearing it’s pelts to enable. Once your understanding is sufficient, this incantation lets you manifest the animal’s body parts to empower your form or strike down your enemies. Empowered by your soul and faith, this could result in a grand bear head many times larger than life scattering your feeble foes with a mighty roar! You’ve already communed with one such animal in the Lands Between. It need not be a bear, but is not a bear the mightiest of beasts? Dragon Communion [900CP (200/300/400)] (Elden Ring) The practice of dragon communion is a primal practice, founded in the sacrificial devouring of dragon hearts in order to create the likeness of the dragons as elemental breath attacks, claw swipes and tail slashes-with an eye for greater transformations later on. Marika herself decreed that the worship of the Erdtree did not conflict with idolizing the ancient dragons, and so it is the difficulty of advancing of hunting and slaying dragons rather than persecution that has mainly hindered it’s spread. You are no mere neophyte. For years you have followed the path of Dragon Communion, and can be considered experienced in it. Not only are you better versed at challenging the mighty dragons than most warriors, but along with a wide arsenal of basic dragon-summoning based techniques-and a handful of some truly unique dragon’s breath attacks. In future worlds, even the hearts of dragons alien to this world will confer similar benefits proportionate to their overall power.",

When reality formed into separate layers and began ticking obediently through time, the beings in the darkness were forced into the deepest recesses between (todash) worlds. These hungry hordes slaver just beneath one precious layer of stable reality, their claws and fangs greedy for the opportunity to reach the surface and wreak havoc upon it. [400CP] Option For 400 cp, open a vortex and summon up to 10 creatures from todash space once daily, prepared to attack your target. If no target is available, their malice may turn them against you - keep them well slaked with the blood of your enemies. These creatures may be no bigger than a large elk, but they are fearsome, ravenous, and lethal. [800CP] Option For 800 cp, you may open larger doorways that may be permanent, if you wish. This requires a 24 hour ritual to rip open a crossing and leave it open for the monstrosities within to escape. The magnitude of this tear brings with it the risk that you will allow something truly titanic and horrifying to cross. Demons to rival the Guardians of the Beam might escape this way and bring entire cities to ruin. Additionally, you gain the ability to safely travel through todash yourself. You may traverse levels of the Tower (local multiverse) with the secret, dangerous paths you trace through this mysterious not-space. Other people may come with you dramatically increasing their odds of survival at your side, but you can’t guarantee their safety with this perk - only your own. Usually you may not reside in todash space without significant aid: it is too dangerous to let down your guard, even for one as gifted as you. (For inspiration on todash creatures and the 800 cp level of threat, refer to King’s The Mist.) (Editor’s Note: Examples of creature of Prim can be found in the perk from the Jump.)",

Well, there’s a bit more to this than there seems to be. You see, most humans can’t naturally use magic. It’s just... not in their making. Sure, you’ve got the odd psychics and magicians and other special cases running around, but they’re the exception, not the rule. In short, you gotta be born with it. You just happen to be one of the lucky few. Maybe your family has a long history in the business, or maybe one of your great-grand-somethings was an Oni. Hell, maybe you’re just a fortunate anomaly. Whatever the reason is, you’ve got what it takes to magic the place up a little. As of now, you’ve only got the barest of basics of conjuring up some arcane energy, but through time and practice, you’ll eventually be able to pull off all sorts of bizarre magic nonsense. Demonologist [600CP] (Devil May Cry) So, in case you’re feeling like being cartoonishly evil, here’s a little something for ya. You are now a demon summoner. Yep. Uh-huh. That’s correct. You can do exactly what the above statement describes. If you manage to form a pact with a demon, you’ll be able to summon and use them as you desire. Keep in mind, however, that demons generally tend to be pretty damn rowdy, and they sure as hell don’t like being pushed around. So if you get too bossy with your tropical friends, don’t be surprised if you suddenly find them wanting to renegotiate their contracts. Capstone Boosted: Or maybe you don’t want to mess about with contracts? Maybe you just wanna skip ahead to the part where the demons work for you? Well, now you can. Thanks to the sheer strength of your demonic heritage, if you manage to defeat a demon, you can try to impose your will over it and completely subjugate it, essentially turning it into a slave with no choice but to obey. Naturally, there isn’t a single demon alive who’s gonna be cool with this, so be prepared to meet a lot of resistance when attempting this, specially[sic] when concerning the stronger types of demons. Any and all demons you subjugate will be available to be summoned later on to any other world you may visit. Since they have to obey your commands, you won’t have to worry about them going rogue, but don’t act surprised if they start giving you lip. Demonic Lineage: Devil [800CP] (Devil May Cry) Rather than a specific species of demons, “Devil” is a catch-all term for the big guys, the movers and shakers of the Demon World. I’m talking about the likes of Sparda, Argosax and Mundus. By sharing their lineage, you’re a step above the vast majority of demonkind. Superior physical ability, powerful innate magic, the works. But, more than anything, this lineage will improve what you already are. Good will become great. Evil will become worse. Make sure to use the power of your bloodline responsibly, alright, Jumper?

Familiars can be imbued with their own Magic Circuits, allowing them to be used as a medium to cast spells; they also hold a connection to their master’s mind, and mental communication is possible. It’s even possible to outright take control of a soulless familiar, directing it with your mind while your body lies stationary. That often isn’t necessary, however, as a familiar’s connection to their master’s mind means that they carry out their will even without special direction. Now, just about any half-decent mage can create a familiar. It’s a simple spell commonly worked on small animals, dead animals, or small statuettes. But while you have surpassing talent in all areas involving familiars, where you excel is transforming items into them—including items of such power as Noble Phantasms or your own CP-purchased gear. Using such excellent material, the resulting familiar will be able to change form into the appearance of some manner of fantastic beast, grow or shrink in size for convenience, and will be much more powerful than any ordinary familiar could be, proportional to the strength of the artifact they are created from. Please note that while Ghost Liners can be considered a type of familiar, Servants are far too powerful and complex to actually create without magecraft on the same level as the most advanced tier of Student of Mystery, and you’d have to possess appropriate components. But creating a Heroic Spirit out of a figure of legend or fiction that didn’t make a strong enough impact on history to be recorded on the Throne of Heroes is technically possible.",

      "description": "There are many creatures that thrive when they’re acting as a collective. Bees, ants, birds, to an extent even humans work better when they’re cooperating rather than acting in competition. But when it comes to integrating into a collective, achieving the necessary level of familiarity and rapport is generally a time consuming process, perhaps made impossible if the target collective isn’t human to begin with. In this world, there are some individuals who have found a solution to that problem, and have adapted so well that they’ve managed to form symbiotic relationships with creatures such as bees and bats. Just like these individuals, you can establish a symbiotic relationship with multiple non-sapient creatures at once. You can grow your collective over time by integrating individual creatures into your congregation, though this works best if you’re sticking to a single creature species – some beasts don’t work well with other species. The fact that this is a symbiosis should clue you in that the relationship goes both ways. To sustain the gathering you’ll need to maintain it with your own energy and of course, actually bonding with the creatures will help. Keep them satisfied and in turn they’ll aid you through whatever means they have available; as an example, a boy here that bonded with bats was able to sustain himself and others by having the bats transfer blood around. So before you choose whether to enthral a creature, you should carefully consider its inherent qualities. (Editor’s Note: Check the notes section of the Junji Ito Kaidanroku jump for a summed up explanation of the perk.)",

Though the full implication of these precursor factors is still unknown, it has led to theories surrounding the root cause of this predicament. At the very least, some scientists are convinced that the effects could be replicated through some sort of microscopic entity, such as a bacteria or nanomachine colony of some sort. Frankly, at the rate that events are unfolding, it’s rather unlikely that the scientists will ever get any confirmation. But at least, you can try to fight fire with fire. This allows you to control microscopic entities and gather them together as a group, channelling one of your abilities through them. While there are some theories that the root cause of this disaster is sentient to some degree, this countermeasure ability of yours only affects non-sapient entities. As long as the target you’re attempting to control is sufficiently small in size to the point that it cannot be seen by the naked eye, you really should have too much trouble attempting to influence and use it as a vector for your own abilities. Naturally, the effectiveness will be fairly dependent on what you choose to channel. Not unlike the strange phenomenon at work, normal resistances will not have much effect on your control group. Depending on what you use the group for, resistances may not factor into the equation at all, but under normal circumstances your control group will ignore barriers and resistances to a fair degree. This is true regardless of whether you’re using a biological or synthetic vector...though they may not fare as well in the face of complete immunity. You should also take note that once your control group goes beyond a size threshold, there’s a good chance that it could slip out of your control if you can’t keep check of all the elements at once – essentially, there’s some degree of micromanagement involved. It would be bad if you created another disaster on top of what is already happening, so take care not to overstep your limitations.",

You're still as human as you ever were, but your shadows are deeper than before.

By yourself, you can take control of your shadow and mold it into objects such as spikes, walls or tentacles in order to attack enemies with strength and speed surpassing most demons. More importantly, these spirits have some innate mystical ability that you can draw on. Their first ability is that they can each take control of a person's mind. While there's no real limit to how long you can control a person's actions, willpower, mystical potency and outside interference all can break your hold, and a spirit's strength wanes the longer it is separated from your shadow. The second is that they each can completely immobilize a person. This ability is almost impossible to escape from without help, but is even more tiring for the spirits, to the point you'd have to keep someone inside your shadow to paralyze them for more than a minute. The third and last ability is that of healing. By expending energy, the spirits can heal a person. Healing a small cut is nothing, but making a man who will die in seconds totally okay would require that it consume itself fully.

Though Shadows appear as large black apparitions they are the most powerful monsters in this world. Their many abilities include: a massive pool of health, greatly increased speed, short range teleportation, minor independent intelligence and will, casting projectiles that can damage gems, towers, walls, etc, their armor rating increases constantly during battle, they can communicate telepathically with their creator across any distance, they can condense into a tiny and near invulnerable sphere to heal rapidly, and they can Mark, Twist, and Possess monsters you control should you have that ability. Additionally they are partially immune to any status effects that hinder their ability to act ie. slows, staggers, and even a complete time stop can only limit their speed by 50%. Such quality demands great cost however, and as such creating a Shadow permanently reduces your mana pool by the amount used in their creation. I’m Casting Doubt [600CP] (Gemcraft: Chasing Shadows) A dark ability this. You may now project a shadowy incorporeal avatar of your current form that you may control across any distance as well as see and speak through, but you are unable to physically interact with the world.

You may however cast magic through your avatar, but with a twist. You magics[sic] will strike directly at the mind of your targets having no effect on the environment. Monsters you create through your avatar will be illusory and unable to affect the environment, but should they attack a living being they do as much damage as if they were fully real. This also effects[sic] out of setting magic, and for an example you could cleanse an entire city with great storms of fire without damaging the infrastructure.

An uncommon variant of Conqueror’s Haki, Sovereign’s Will allows you to impose your will upon others in much the same way Conquerors do, however, it requires a ruler’s instinct and a degree of respect towards you, though this can be overcome in some ways. Sovereign’s Will is more controlled than Conqueror’s Haki, where a Conqueror will knock their foes unconscious or render them in awe, a Sovereign gives commands that are listened to. Any command you give while using Sovereign’s Will causes the target to follow it, they may fight it, but force of will alone won’t let one succeed in doing so.",

You may, either through sending your dark energy or directly sending your spirit into their mind, possess people. People at the height of despair are more susceptible to your possession than others. You can see through their eyes and even access their memories and feelings as if they were yours, if you wish. However, you may be resisted and even forced out if the person is sufficiently strong enough to do so. Last​ ​Chance​ ​Fusion​ [600CP] (Sailor Moon) As a last resort you may combine your essence with a willing person’s. This will combine your powers as you become something greater than the whole, great, powerful, and big. If one or both of you are injured at the time of the fusion, your wounds heal as the fusion process creates a separate body out of both of your old ones. However, if this new form is slain, you will both die with it. The other person is also the one in control with this form, although you can give suggestions from the back of the fusion’s mind. You cannot choose to wrest control over them except when you wish to break the fusion.",

      "description": "Manifest Destiny [400CP] (Silent Hill) Silent Hill is a place powered by the human mind. Archetypes, fears, wants, desires. Those who have a deeper connection to the town have a deeper understanding of how to utilize this power, and it seems that you have this as well. The town will change slightly. Not enough to make everything a cakewalk, but you’ll find it more... accepting of your goals. Ammo will be found, puzzles can be completed. Monsters hit less as hard, and luck is on your side. Note that this may help with troubles stemming from nature, or the environment, but never those stemming from other people. Shattered Memories [600CP] (Silent Hill) Silent Hill has been in many forms, and has created beings with many forms. Perhaps this world is more a part of you than you’d like to admit Jumper. For you see, the town will now actively draw on your memories. Your fears, desires, guilts, all will be used to form monsters and the landscape of the hellish Otherworld. However, this isn’t for nothing. For while this town may be much more personal than you’d like to admit, this perk now acts as a Capstone Booster. Additionally, post-Jump, you may create your own ‘Silent Hill’, or a place where the mind and matter intersect. You may spread this ‘corruption’ wherever you wish, but only in one place at a time. As your own psychic powers grow, so can the size of this place. It starts out the size of Silent Hill, but with more power, could grow to that of a massive city, or even a continent. Whether it is as hellish as the atrocities made on this land have shaped it, or a place of true peace, is up to you. Broken Circle [600CP] (Silent Hill) “Son... you still don't get it. It doesn't matter what you want.” Silent Hill has a habit of keeping people trapped in it until they’ve finished what they started, or came to grips with their past, or what have you. It can even get to the point where some people are drawn back to this place after escaping, or history repeats itself to bring their trauma anew. For you however, it has no hold on you. You’ll find that this town has little to no hold on you. You can come and go as you please, regardless of barriers. This even influences the layout of the Town itself as it shifts to provide passage. Capstone Booster: Limbo. The trapping effects of Silent Hill don’t just ignore you, but now they shift to your whims, allowing you to place intangible, invisible, unbreakable threads onto others. These threads will slowly shift fate itself to draw them back to either you or a location of your choice. Depending on your choice, either the area around you, or the location you choose will gain more Silent Hill like qualities as it feeds off of the thread you used. It will create personal monsters and environments for your chosen. They can escape via attaining some form of personal growth or conquering whatever challenges form from it. Rest assured that any other means of escape are moot, they will always come full circle. (Editor’s Note: Shattered Memories is the Jump’s Capstone Booster. And for the perk itself, take the meanings and effect of the former paragraph and add it to the latter.)",

      "description": "The Compulsory [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement) This Schrift grants you the power of the Soul King’s left hand, enabling you to shoot nerves from your body. These nerves can pierce through any material and give you control over anything they touch, even inorganic objects. For instance, if your nerves make contact with an enemy, you can control their movements, tear their body apart, or manipulate the surface beneath you to create hands from the ground. Additionally, you can absorb information from objects touched by your nerves, allowing you to evolve and match the power level of those objects, along with acquiring their genetic abilities. This Schrift also allows you to absorb biomass, gaining the abilities, traits, and attributes of the beings from which the biomass is taken. You can fully control your anatomy, freely altering and manipulating it, creating or removing limbs and organs, adjusting your size, and even changing your body’s appearance. You can also create clones of yourself using pieces of your flesh, though these clones can only use your Quincy and genetic abilities. Furthermore, you can regenerate any wounds, including lost limbs or organs. Despite its power, you will still experience pain from the nerves you generate if they remain connected. Quincy: Vollständig [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement) Quincy Vollständig is an advanced form of Quincy Letzt Stil, which removes its drawbacks and allows for repeated use without long intervals. Vollständig is typically activated through a Leiden Hant, though some Quincies can trigger it without a catalyst. When activated, a pillar of light surrounds the user, protecting them until their Vollständig is fully formed. If the Quincy is trapped when activating it, the pillar of light will break through the confinement, freeing them. A Quincy’s Vollständig manifests as a pair of wings and a halo of Spirit Particles. The appearance of the Vollständig is heavily influenced by the user’s Schrift. Vollständig provides several benefits, such as flight, increased spiritual awareness, the ability to create multiple Spirit Weapons at will, and a massive increase in their power. It also amplifies their Schrift, allowing them to access more powerful techniques and abilities previously beyond their reach, including using their Schrift through the Vollständig itself. The most significant ability of Vollständig is Sklaverei, which enables the Quincy to absorb and control Spirit Particles through their Heiligenschein (halo). This ability allows the Quincy to absorb spiritual objects or even the bodies of spiritual beings, boosting the power of their Vollständig and changing its appearance. However, the Vollständig does have a drawback: its duration depends on their stamina. If their halo is destroyed, the Quincy loses the powers granted by the Vollständig, though they will still retain the wings. This perk grants you your own Vollständig with all its abilities. You can activate it without needing a Leiden Hant and choose its appearance, including the wings, halo, and any additional accessories formed by the Vollständig and Sklaverei. Your Vollständig is not connected to Yhwach, and if your halo is destroyed, you still retain its abilities. Your Vollständig does not require stamina, allowing you to stay in it indefinitely. The Zombie [600CP] (OoC Quincy Supplement) This Schrift allows you to turn people into zombies and control them by splattering blood. You can also reanimate real corpses into zombies. The zombies you create retain their abilities from when they were alive, and you can summon them to your side, no matter the distance. However, their personality vanishes once they are zombified. You can let them fight as they would when alive or control them directly. Additionally, this Schrift enables you to heal wounds by using the flesh of the deceased to replace your own, even healing lost limbs. You can use this method to heal allies as well. When the Schrift is activated, you can endure and heal from fatal injuries. The amount of blood needed to turn someone into a zombie depends on their strength: weaker opponents require only a drop, while stronger individuals need the blood to be spread throughout their body, reaching the heart before the Schrift takes effect. While your blood can turn people into zombies, the blood of your zombies does not have this property.",

      "description": "Watch Your Shadow [100CP] (Kingdom Hearts) If you can summon Heartless you now gain the ability to bind a few of them into places or items to attack whoever next interacts with the item, or visits the location, yourself excluded of course. These Heartless can’t move far from the area the item or object was corrupted (with the exception of appearing inside vehicles and the like) but once imbued no longer count towards your normal active Heartless limits. Instead you can imbue up to your active limits in up to three areas or objects to attack interlopers. Watch Your Shadow [100CP] (Kingdom Hearts) You have such darkness in your Heart that you can call Heartless to you to do your bidding. You can call upon the most common Heartless, the Shadows and Soldiers, and can have about two dozen active at once. Sending these summons scuttling towards your foes is almost effortless, though constantly replacing them will quickly drain upon your energy. The monsters summoned by this perk and its subsequent add-ons are almost extensions of yourself - an expression of your darkness that will let you call on them even in other worlds. They will be totally obedient to you. Dispelling them, or any from the subsequent perk tree is as easy as willing them away. Army of Darkness [200CP] (Kingdom Hearts) You can now summon most Heartless, from Large Bodies and Air Soldiers, to Powerwilds and Wyverns. You can call upon half a dozen such creatures, along with your dozen lesser Heartless. It takes a few moments to all upon these Heartless, and doing so takes a little effort. The Closer You Get to the Light [300CP] (Kingdom Hearts) The elites of the Heartless now flock to your banner. Invisibles, Defenders, Assault Riders and more. These are the enemies that can put up a challenge by themselves, and you can bring forth two or three at a time. It is more difficult to call upon these skilled fighters, though you could call upon a few every ten or twenty minutes without feeling much of a drain. Using them alongside Shadows and Soldiers is fairly easy, but summoning them with your Army of Darkness will have a much bigger impact upon you. The Greater Your Shadow Becomes [400CP] (Kingdom Hearts) The Mightiest of Heartless now come when you call. You can unleash a single boss monster at a time, from the unpredictable Trickmaster to the enormous Behemoth, Darkside, and Groundshaker; all are at your command, though it takes considerable effort to call upon them. Using them alongside anything other than Shadows and Soldiers will be very tiring. Heartless Stars [600CP] (Kingdom Hearts) You can call upon the hosts of Heartless capable of travelling through space, the Ship Forms if you will. Dozens of Dragonflies, Crawlers, and Drillers - among other forms - will pop into existence at your command, though they’ll dissipate almost instantly within an atmosphere. Even Reaper’s Wheels and Hunters come in groups of three or four, though the former will need something to manoeuvre on. The greatest space-born Heartless though, the Pirate Ship and the Hunter-X, they only come one at a time, but they’re both worth it. The former summons fragile ghosts that speed towards enemies and bite them, and also has an assortment of laser cannons and a deadly main cannon that fires an explosive cannonball Heartless. The latter is an upgraded version of the Hunter, armed with four Hunter-X Bombs, a gatling laser, and assorted other weaponry, this devastating Ship Form can fill the space between itself and its prey with a storm of lasers in its choice of beams or blasts, and packs some powerful melee damage to boot. World of Chaos [800CP] (Kingdom Hearts) You can call upon the biggest and one of the most powerful Heartless ever seen; a monstrosity the size of a battleship, bristling with ‘organic’ laser turrets, force fields, and has a variety of blasting attacks that’ll make short work of all but the most powerful of foes. Calling upon this veritable demon will be a time consuming effort, leaving you drained for a while. Fortunately, it can defend you as you recover. Calling upon other Heartless alongside this is extremely draining, and should only be done in the direst of circumstances. To control this massive monster you’ll be attached to it via cables connected to your back and spine that lead into the humanoid forms chest cavity, which you can retreat within for protection. Controlling the entire beast is as easy as moving your own limbs. (Editor’s Note: Costs of certain perks have been increased. The Closer You Get to the Light has been increased from 100CP to 300CP. The Greater Your Shadow Becomes has been increased from 200CP to 400CP. Heartless Stars has been increased from 200CP to 600CP. And World of Chaos has been increased from 500CP to 800CP. Additionally if you wish, you can lower the overall metaphysical power the Heartless have to fit better in the narrative your writing.) (Additional Editor’s Note: Each tier of summoning you purchase (not including the ships) lets you call upon more of each lower tier, 1.5 times more in fact (rounded up). This means with the full purchase you could have up to 122 Shadows active at once, or two Heartless from The Greater Your Shadow Becomes. This does dig into your total pool, so you can’t have 122 Shadows and the World of Chaos out at the same time.)",

They won’t attack you or your friends unless you want them to, and if an item is moved too far from where it was imbued the binding will fail. Nobodies bound inside vehicles are the exception to this. Binding Nobodies like this doesn’t count towards your active limit, instead you can bind up to your active limits worth of Nobodies in up to three places or items. You Are Nobody [100CP] (Kingdom Hearts) Your status as a being that doesn’t exist lets you call upon other non-existent beings. The Dusks and Creepers appear upon command, and will attack your foes en masse. Calling upon up to two dozen of these is as easy as breathing, though replacing them continuously will start to drain you rather quickly. Your power will let you bring these monsters into ‘existence’ even in other worlds, and they will bow to your will like puppets on strings, or extra limbs if you prefer that analogy. Dispelling them, or any from the subsequent perk tree is as easy as willing them away. End of Day [200CP] (Kingdom Hearts) Most varieties of Nobodies will now heed your summons. Snipers, Assassins, Samurai, Dancers, and Gamblers take only a few moments to bring forth and only take little effort. Half a dozen can be brought forth at a time. Empty Hearts [300CP] (Kingdom Hearts) Dragoons, spear wielding warriors with a deadly leap attack. Berserkers, extremely durable soldiers whose hammers deal immense damage. Sorcerers, floating magicians with conjured cubes that can repel attacks before zooming in to attack. These three breeds of Nobodies are the elites of the Nobodies, and will each put up a challenge by themselves. You can use two or three at a time, but it’s much more difficult to do so than your lesser summons. Replacing them more once every ten to twenty minutes would be very draining. Providing them with Dusks and Creepers as backup is a breeze, but using them alongside more powerful Nobodies will be a quite noticeable drain. The Summons That Never Were [400CP] (Kingdom Hearts) Hearts): Swift and deadly, capable of wreaking devastation across the landscape, Twilight Thorn, Spectre, and even the mighty Angel of Death are yours to command. Only a single such monster will answer your call at a time, and it will be a significant effort to call upon them, but the damage they can deal makes it worthwhile. Fortress of Nothingness [600CP] (Kingdom Hearts) Mini-Cruisers and Cruisers are enormous Nobody ship forms, the former are about the size of a house; six legged flying platforms housing four watchtowers, twin spikes on the front, and surprisingly manoeuvrable, the latter are hanger sized horizontal towers with cylinders running along the four longest edges ending in giant forward facing spikes. Both are able to take a substantial amount of damage, and deal out damage with their ramming attacks. You can call upon a dozen Mini-Cruisers and half a dozen Cruisers at once. You can summon these behemoths in space in other Jumps, or the space between worlds in this Jump, and as a bonus you can also call upon the lesser Nobody Ships such as Speeders, Gatling Ships and Spiders in similar quantities. They don’t last long in atmospheres though, so don’t try calling upon them planet-side. World of Nothingness [800CP] (Kingdom Hearts) Part city, part castle, part dragon, this monstrous Nobody can be called forth with an exhausting effort, but will then lay waste to huge swathes of almost any battlefield. Throwing lasers and buildings at your foes, this being is a one monster army. Providing other Nobodies as backup will be a challenge though, as the drain will reach critical levels quickly. You control it by sitting on the throne located in its head, and can direct it with the ease of moving your own limbs. (Editor’s Note: Costs of certain perks have been increased. Empty Hearts has been increased from 100CP to 300CP. The Summons That Never Were has been increased from 200CP to 400CP. Fortress of Nothingness has been increased from 200CP to 600CP. And World of Nothingness has been increased from 500CP to 800CP. Additionally if you wish, you can lower the overall metaphysical power the Heartless have to fit better in the narrative your writing.) (Additional Editor’s Note: Each tier of summoning you purchase (not including the ships) lets you call upon more of each lower tier, 1.5 times more in fact (rounded up). This means you with the full purchase you could have up to 122 Dusks active at once, or two nobodies from The Summons That Never Were. This does dig into your total pool, so you can’t have 122 Dusks and the World of Nothingness out at the same time.)",

Lucky you, that you are able to gain some of that benefit, while avoiding the negative consequences. You are able to pick a patron, such as the Wall of Flesh, Fairy Empress, one of the four Lunar Pillars, or the Moon Lord Himself, and you can tap into and channel a portion of their power, gaining abilities related to them in the process. The amount of power channeled is ultimately limited, though it is still a tremendous power boost, but your theft is also hidden from their perception. So unless you do something like channel the power of the Moon Lord right in front of him, your ‘patron’ won’t suspect a thing, and you won’t have to pay the typical costs of servitude and potential madness. Faux Cultist: Doubled Up: For an additional, discountable 200 CP, you can choose two patrons, gaining some power from them both, and you can swap one or both Patrons temporarily in future Jumps, targeting any entities of magic or power that may exist in said Jump.",

As living portions of Hell themselves, they are filled with such energy, able to bring it forth from their bodies and launch the volatile energy at foes. With a bit of focus and time to charge, you can even launch extremely fast bolts of it, exploding violently on impact with any surface. Focus [200CP] (ULTRAKILL) While Machines and Husks may utilize hellish energy for their own needs, such results are volatile, short lived. But Demons possess unparalleled control over Hellish energy, for it is their lifeblood, their birthright. Your focus with hellish energy and other spells allows you to maintain such effects for far, far longer than any would consider possible. Perhaps they’ll just consider the sphere in your hand a lamp until you proceed to reveal it’s true purpose as a normally extremely volatile explosive. Maybe they’ll think that hellish barrier will only last a few moments while you could hold it for days. Instability shall never be an issue again, even in the middle of stressful combat.",

Not only that, but you can perform such Sorcerae as a reaction, rather than a conscious action, and the ripple of disturbance is greatly suppressed such that it’s almost impossible to detect your use of the Arcane in such ways. And you can do the reverse, pulling on other places to make them overlap with where you are, calling beings and phenomena from the distant places to serve you, or remaking the world around you to be more like some distant plane, though such works take a normal measure of your attention, rather than as an afterthought. Lastly, if you could succeed at such a Sorcerae, you will with grace and panache. You might call it a ‘natural 20.’",

This is the anomalous version of the Observer Effect in action, it gives you a better understanding of how to use your own body’s energy and cause your observations to make changes on reality. Using thaumatology to create powerful spells costs a great deal of EVE. Other spontaneous improbable events occur as a form of equal and opposite backlash – which can be a problem for normlacy.

There’s usually a massive cost to practicing diverse magic in any long-term way, and it’s different and costly for everyone. Often, massive perspective changes are needed.

But instead of changing physics, you just bypass the rules. Your magic cannot be properly contained, with efforts to silence or negate it met with just building up more reserves of mana until you inevitably have enough to break free. The belief you have in your own magic is enough to improve it; whether that’s making better enchanted item or just stronger spells. Yes, you can even talk in blue, too.

You could bind souls to yourself permanently, make great barriers impassable to the dead, and someday, someday, in another world you just might make it impossible for anyone to pass on. But such power comes with its costs. Whenever you use the red sword, you cut off a piece of your soul. The more you do it, the more you lose your sense of self. Your identity and memories will slip away, until you are no more. But surely that’s a small price, right?",

Whether you are a member of a gifted family of witches or received your power through a quirk of fate, your magical abilities have grown exponentially. The maximum potential strength of your spells has increased by an order of magnitude, and your internal well of power actually runs deep enough to support those kinds of workings. Your magical energy reserves are several times larger than those of your peers, and can replenish quickly over a short rest. This effect also applies to any other reservoirs of power within you, and will scale with you as you mature. A young witch with this power could easily earn the “Top Student” spot, while a fully grown witch with this boon would be something amazing indeed. The Emperor will watch your future with great interest. (Editor’s Note: See the Notes section of the Owl House jump for additional details & interactions.)",

You have taken this farther, able to subtly alter a spell as you cast it without changing the spell matrix at all by simply altering the way your mana flows through it. With this, you can also more efficiently combine the various methodologies of thaumaturgy. Additionally, this level of control over your mana both increases its potency and expands your reserves, doubling the effective amount of mana you possess and increasing the rate at which your reserves in all mystical energies grow. Mana itself has its rate of growth doubled and the closer in nature to mana that other energies are, the closer they are to the same increase as Mana. Archmage [600CP] (Ravenwood) Archmages are those that have honed their magic to a razor’s edge, above their peers through their efforts and able to flawlessly meld the various methodologies of thaumaturgy they have mastered. You have earned this title for yourself. As an archmage, you have a deep well of magical power to draw from, five times the norm for a practiced mage, and can continue to increase your reserves at five times the normal speed. This stacks with the effects of Metamage. Your speed at creating and casting a spell matrix is impressive, fast enough that you could cast a sorcery matrix with the snap of your fingers and only need a minute to fully form and reinforce a wizardry matrix. Your care similarly allows you to use witchcraft without destroying the materials with no need for alchemical reinforcement or extra mana to do so and gives you the ability to tune your mana to a mix of elements rather than just a single one with shamanism. You will also find that your dormant mana provides some measure of enhancement and protection without the need for active thought, and when you do actively use it, they provide more potency for the same level of effort that they had before. Finally, you have enough talent to develop new methodologies of thaumaturgy, if you are willing to put in the effort necessary to do so.",

Your capacity to improve on spells and innovate on existing magical theory is phenomenal, such that if your talent was proven and displayed your work could earn you the tittle of conspectus-first and greatest of a whole new school of sorcery. With the resources and knowledge base of an academy, within a few days you could innovate on barrier magic to heights those in this world would deem impossible-even deflecting the magical projectiles of divine beings. It’s such a shame that far-fetched talents such as your breed scepticism in many. Primal Current [600CP] (Elden Ring) The eldest primeval sorcery is said to have been discovered by an ancient astrologer, who glimpsed a primeval current that became real, causing the stars' amber to rain down. Not only are you highly skilled in the sorcery learned from Crystallians, and Onyx and Alabaster Lords, that mortal men struggle to comprehend but the effectiveness of your spells increases when you are able to witness the stars clearly-even if only as a simulacrum or projection, as long as it is sufficiently accurate one. Their movements presciently guiding your knowledge of things to come as well as the complexity of your spellcraft, and unlock insights into creating new sorceries beyond mortal ken. With time and study, any celestial phenomena in the heavens above can be used to design a new sorcery bolstered with the power of the heavens. Notably, you have already discovered one that can cause glintstone to rain down from the heavens even in other worlds-a great boon for the sorcerer’s art, for that precious substance contains the stars’ lifeforce and is valuable for building all manner of implements. Greater power awaits you if you are willing to apply your knowledge of the forbidden primeval current. You know how to replace your body parts with inorganic glintstone components, to transplant your soul into a great primal glintstone through which you can animate a suitably prepared puppet’s body and to weave multiple such sorcerers into a “star seed” to channel greater power. More importantly, your chances of surviving such a procedure with your mind and soul intact have drastically gone up-and in general, magical transformations of the body, mind and soul are far more successful and safe for you to undertake than they were without this. Last but not least, beings of eldritch or alien nature are much more amicable towards bargaining fairly with you-intuiting your needs and desires, and being more generous in terms of granting power. It may still be perilous to court a significantly malign or powerful entity, but in this world should a star fall to the Lands Between a pact might be struck with it.",

      "description": "Pathless Prodigy [400CP] (Elden Ring) Like Thops, it seems you have an underrated knack for cutting corners in magic. Your capacity to improve on spells and innovate on existing magical theory is phenomenal, such that if your talent was proven and displayed your work could earn you the tittle of conspectus-first and greatest of a whole new school of sorcery. With the resources and knowledge base of an academy, within a few days you could innovate on barrier magic to heights those in this world would deem impossible-even deflecting the magical projectiles of divine beings. It’s such a shame that far-fetched talents such as your breed scepticism in many. Primal Current [600CP] (Elden Ring) The eldest primeval sorcery is said to have been discovered by an ancient astrologer, who glimpsed a primeval current that became real, causing the stars' amber to rain down. Not only are you highly skilled in the sorcery learned from Crystallians, and Onyx and Alabaster Lords, that mortal men struggle to comprehend but the effectiveness of your spells increases when you are able to witness the stars clearly-even if only as a simulacrum or projection, as long as it is sufficiently accurate one. Their movements presciently guiding your knowledge of things to come as well as the complexity of your spellcraft, and unlock insights into creating new sorceries beyond mortal ken. With time and study, any celestial phenomena in the heavens above can be used to design a new sorcery bolstered with the power of the heavens. Notably, you have already discovered one that can cause glintstone to rain down from the heavens even in other worlds-a great boon for the sorcerer’s art, for that precious substance contains the stars’ lifeforce and is valuable for building all manner of implements. Greater power awaits you if you are willing to apply your knowledge of the forbidden primeval current. You know how to replace your body parts with inorganic glintstone components, to transplant your soul into a great primal glintstone through which you can animate a suitably prepared puppet’s body and to weave multiple such sorcerers into a “star seed” to channel greater power. More importantly, your chances of surviving such a procedure with your mind and soul intact have drastically gone up-and in general, magical transformations of the body, mind and soul are far more successful and safe for you to undertake than they were without this. Last but not least, beings of eldritch or alien nature are much more amicable towards bargaining fairly with you-intuiting your needs and desires, and being more generous in terms of granting power. It may still be perilous to court a significantly malign or powerful entity, but in this world should a star fall to the Lands Between a pact might be struck with it.",

And whether this is a meagre victory or a prelude to yet another tragedy, it seems you have a great affinity for magic governing fire of all kinds. Fireballs roar into short-lived rains of fire while dragon’s breath roars like a comet; while all fire magic benefits, the yearning for destruction within you is drawn most to unrestricted, wild, passionate destruction. The magic of the Frenzied Flame in particular is most empowered by your blazing gift. With certain unwholesome practices it would not be out of the question to pervert and warp other powers with the Flame’s destructive ways, whether by reducing a promising Finger Maiden into a self-immolating vessel for communion with the Frenzied Flame or perhaps becoming a spiritual entity capable of possessing others preserved by the Flame’s own endurance. Perhaps you have been embraced by the Three Fingers at some point before entering this world, for were you to cut loose and channel a truly potent source of flame (like that of the Giants’ forge) you could well burn down the Erdtree and any barrier it throws up in your path. And as you descend further into madness, as the conviction that enough is enough and this twisted world has to be reset, your power to burn it all away will only grow stronger. Divine Grudge [600CP] (Elden Ring) Hatred for the Erdtree, hatred for Marika-is that truly the root of the Omen Curse? The Hornsent are certainly happy to take credit for the malformed horrors that plague both the Golden Order and Marika’s own bloodline. You are heritor to some of that hatred, being able to inflict similar horrors on kingdoms through a combination of sustained, almost meditative rage and ritual invocation. It would take a demigod to unleash such a curse singlehandedly, but even a mere mortal has an alternative: Sharing that hatred with others, several tribes or villages’ worth of hatefulness has the potential to unleash lasting blight on the shared figure of blame for them all. Even should you find yourself standing alone though, there is one final recourse feared even by the Hornsent. In a truly transcendental moment of despair or rage, you can invoke a divine element amongst destructive phenomena-something like your village’s destroyed ashes. In doing so, you can beckon-or perhaps, create-an outer god that will look kindly upon you as its first petitioner (or perhaps, creator) and bless you with all manner of blasphemous powers much as Saint Romina was changed by the Scarlet Rot’s caress. You have little control over the deity afterwards. But isn’t it worth it, to see all that caused you pain choke on its own blood?",

      "description": "Persistent Casting [100CP] (The Owl House) You’re skilled at pushing the duration of your spells as far as they can go. Your spells don’t take any less energy to start up, but they are incredibly efficient once they get rolling. Minute-long spells last hours and hour-long workings can last days when it comes to your spellcraft. With enough planning and preparation, you could even construct a spell so solidly that it would last until dispelled. Rapid Casting [200CP] (The Owl House) Few are faster than you. Normally a quick evocation can take a second or two to cast, and more powerful rituals can take hours of careful preparation, if not longer. You now cast cantrips in an eyeblink, and can complete more complex workings in a quarter of the time. Precise Casting [200CP] (The Owl House) You have a steady hand. You excel at delicate magics, small-scale spells, and detail-oriented work. Several groups, like the Plant or Healing Covens, would benefit nicely from this style. Of course, perhaps you can apply this focus to less altruistic magics. Potent Casting [200CP] (The Owl House) Your spells are bigger, badder, and pack more bang. Whether you’re a Bard student making louder sounds or an Abomination witch making larger constructs, you get double or triple the results for the energy cost of a normal spell. Parallel Casting [300CP] (The Owl House) You specialize in repeat performances. You find casting the same or similar spells repeatedly is vastly more efficient. An Illusion witch could create multiple duplicates, a healer could repair dozens of minor injuries, or a Plant witch could grow fields of garden variety vegetables. So long as you can cast the first spell, casting the second, third, and even tenth will come at a quarter of the cost. Covert Casting [300CP] (The Owl House) Magic can produce some powerful effects, but it’s usually pretty overt. You’ve taken steps to avoid such tells. You don’t need verbal incantations or complex somatic gestures. You don’t even have to draw a circle. Simply exert your will and your magic will respond. Your spells still take the same amount of time to cast, but now you can do it on the sly. Blended Casting [400CP] (The Owl House) Combining schools of magic is punishable by petrification! It also produces incredibly potent effects. I wonder if those two facts are related? You are one of the few witches who can mix different forms of magic and produce useful effects. This is how Eda and Lilith pull off more esoteric spells, like conjuring animated earthworks or sending people inside a person’s mindscape. Like those masters, you can turn disparate forms of magic to your advantage with unmatched versatility! You still have to understand each school of magic you work with, but weaving two or more kinds of magic together will come naturally. This also allows you to combine and coordinate magics from other worlds to enhanced effect!",

In addition, you are quite skilled in passing along your knowledge of your chosen school to others. Spell Crafter [600CP] (The Elder Scrolls Series) The only thing that really holds magic back is the creativity of the caster. You can easily create new spells with a bit of effort, and if you were to see any new or unknown spell in action, you could recreate or mimic it through experimentation. No magic is beyond your reach. Well of Magicka [600CP] (The Elder Scrolls Series) All practitioners of the arcane know that magicka leaks into Nirn through the Sun and Stars, holes into Aetherius itself. Your pool of magicka is greatest mages in history, as is the potency of any spells you cast. You could be throwing fireballs all day without effort, and you may pour more magicka into a spell to overcharge it to such a degree that the simple Flames spell could rout armies with great effort.",

Even bound, you can call it’s power through you, guiding it with gestures and will alone. Increased Zeon Recovery [400CP] (Anima: Beyond Fantasy) Magic has a single great weakness: The fact that your soul can only channel the flow for so long, the Zeon quickly running out. Further, it takes time to recover, days to weeks to even months! Fortunately, you recover quickly, recovering four times faster than you by all means should. Improved Innate Magic [400CP] (Anima: Beyond Fantasy) Magic has costs, and even the smallest spells can quickly drain your Zeon, leaving you empty. No more. Spells of sufficiently low cost can be cast without touching your reserves, the Flow of Souls washing through your body, and shaping itself with the barest hint of your will. Though any mage eventually learns to cast the lesser spells without calling upon their reserves, the spells you can cast without cost are twice the strength of theirs. High Magic [600CP] (Anima: Beyond Fantasy) There are spells beyond the potential of other, lesser beings. Spells of such power that most cannot cast them, no matter how much zeon they call upon. You are not so limited, and your potential shakes the world. High Magic lies within your grasp, even outside of a sanctum or without effort in the arts of metamagic.

You know dozens of types of magic though no Sealing or Literacy magics but you know artificer magics, how to use various elements, transmutation spells and other such magics all with absurd degrees of power and control. This perks also gives you extreme talent when it comes to supernatural powers and energies you get enough that casual effort would see people calling you absurd even by prodigy standards(Like making Minato Namikaze in Naruto look like the average cannon fodder instead of the prodigy he is.). Additionally you naturally have 3 times the energy reserve for all energy types you gain and recover your energies 3 times faster than normal. Control over your energies while not flawless is so efficient you now use 1/5th the energy you’d normally need and can train your control and energy based abilities 5 fold. A Soul of Great Might [1000CP] (Bibliomania) Your soul is easily 50 times stronger than it should be and as a result you are extremely resistant to any soul based effects meaning soul based effects would need to be 50 times more potent to even start to affect you if you just have this. But more importantly your soul is capable of instinctively fighting back against any effect that tries to damage, change, kill or consume it, reducing the effectiveness of any soul based negative effects 50 fold before even touching your defenses. Your soul also recovers quickly and can’t be fully killed, you could have your soul shattered into dozens of pieces and still retain who you are and with only a week's time pull yourself back together and heal your soul assuming your body isn’t dead. It's also impossible for beings that have managed to swallow your soul to digest you and with time and effort you could even fight your way out of a demon god's guts. Your will is bolstered as well meaning you have an incredibly enduring will to the point you won’t flinch in the presence of beings that would drive anyone with a strong will mad instantly. Thanks to your soul's strength your body is minorly enhanced and you and now beneficially receptive to any enhancements you gain improving any and all perks potency that you gain a further 50% of its initial potency. This perk is also special being that due to how it changes you it now counts as part of your body mod and now joins you on your Gauntlets.",
