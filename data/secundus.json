Despite her reputation as a heartless commander who throws men's lives like dice, her crew looks up to her with a grudging respect, knowing that they serve under one of the most skilled and effective captains in the entire Imperium. She's a woman of few words, preferring to let her actions speak for themselves, and the only thing that seems to ignite her passion is the challenge of combat. Her eyes are a piercing and intense blend of fire and ice which inspires both awe and fear in those around her, and her unrelenting focus on her mission has earned her a reputation as a leader who never reckons wrong or right. To some, Captain Mallory may seem like a cold and calculating figure, with no emotions to control and no mercy to show. But for those few who know her well, there's a deeper layer to her character. Haunted by the lives she's lost in battle, her sleepless nights are filled with the memories of all the comrades that died at her command, and sometimes, a melancholic melody echoes through the dimly lit halls of the Norway. Yet despite the haunting beauty of her strings, the crew knows not to approach the port observation deck too closely, for their Captain is in mourning, and none dare disturb her wordless eulogies. Despite this inner turmoil, Captain Mallory remains resolute in her duty to protect the Imperium from the horrors that stalk the void between stars.

In fact, it’s so large that even Thunderhawks seem small in comparison. Whereas those aircraft can carry up to thirty Space Marines, the Overlord can carry at least eighty and it’ll still have room to spare for two Space Marine transport vehicles. But don’t think that’s all the Overlord can do. First of all, its quintuple engines make it fast enough to break into orbit while also possessing hulls armored and thick enough to perform orbital insertions with ease. And to make it even more durable, it also comes with energy shields for even more protection. It will take ruinous amounts of firepower to bring this down. And like with many other vehicles of the Imperium, the Overlord Gunship is brimming with enough weapon to kill a full company of soldiers.

It is a sprawling complex of interconnected modules and hangars that can accommodate an entire fleet of starships, along with their crew and support staff. The station is heavily fortified with layers of shields, armour, and weapon systems, and is capable of withstanding even the most powerful attacks. The station is equipped with state-of-the-art communication and sensor arrays, allowing it to monitor activity across the entire sector and quickly respond to threats. The command centre, located at the heart of the station, is staffed by the sector's most experienced and skilled naval officers, who work tirelessly to ensure the security and defence of the Imperium.The station also serves as a training ground for new naval recruits, who learn the art of space combat and strategy under the guidance of seasoned veterans. In addition to its military functions, the station also houses a variety of civilian facilities, such as markets, living quarters, and recreation centres, that cater to the needs of the station's inhabitants. Despite its imposing size and formidable arsenal, the station is a symbol of hope and security to the people of the sector, who know that the Imperial Navy is always watching over them from the vast expanse of space.",

At over a kilometer and a half in length, weighing over six million tons and carrying a crew of over 25,000 souls, the Sword is a powerful and yet simple vessel used by just about every force in the Imperium, whether it be the Imperial Guard, the Space Marines, or even the Adeptus Mechanicus. As for weapons and armor, you’ll find that this vessel may just surprise you. Boasting thicker bulkheads and plenty of redundant supports and beams in its construction, the Sword can take a surprising amount of punishment, better than most of its contemporaries. And with the multitude of laser weapon batteries on its hull coupled with its two macrocannons, it’ll be able to strike back with enough firepower to make wrecks out of its fellow escorts.",

These abilities make Delta-level psykers invaluable assets in war and intelligence gathering, but they still remain controlled, ensuring that they do not become dangerous warp portals for daemonic entities. The Imperium trusts psykers of this level to serve without excessive risk of corruption.",

However, her gift comes with a heavy burden - she is often plagued by visions of death and destruction, and her paintings, which she creates based on her visions, are often seen as morbid or unsettling. Despite the accuracy of her predictions, Sariel has struggled to gain recognition for her talents. Many people are skeptical of her abilities, dismissing her paintings as fanciful or the product of an overactive imagination. Some even accuse her of deliberately spreading fear and panic through her art. To make matters worse, many of Sariel's predictions are so far into the future that they are dismissed as irrelevant or impossible. But Sariel knows that the future is not set in stone, and that even the smallest actions can have far-reaching consequences. She continues to paint, driven by a deep sense of duty to use her gift to protect the Imperium, even if no one believes her. Despite the lack of recognition, Sariel is dedicated to her role as an Astropath and remains loyal to the Imperium. She is a quiet, introspective person, often lost in thought as she tries to decipher the meaning of her visions. She has a deep respect for the chain of command and her fellow Astropaths, but she sometimes feels isolated and alone in her experiences. Sariel's paintings, while unsettling to some, are highly prized by those in the know. Inquisitors and high-ranking officials secretly seek out her work, recognizing the value of her predictions and the insight they provide. But to most people, she remains an enigma, a misunderstood figure whose true importance will only be revealed with time.",

And if you want to be like one of those psykers, it’s best to start off with Biomancy, the art of manipulating the biological energy and processes of themselves and of others. With this, you’ll not only be able to conjure up lightning from your body, but you’d be able to heal yourself and your allies, shape your body to your whims, or turn the flesh of your foes into bloody works of art. The Mechanicus may decry the flesh and its weaknesses but to a powerful Biomancer, the flesh is mightier than any metal.",

While many things are fragmentary, due to Humanity simply not ever having or managing to fully recover the knowledge, it is all accurately written, and a sufficiently clever person could piece most things together given enough time. There are a great many who would kill to have access to this hidden library- and just as many who have to make sure none do. Use its knowledge well. You will find blueprints for any item your purchase within its halls, though xenos or archeotech beyond your faction’s knowledge base will be scattered and fragmented, requiring a not inconsiderable amount of research to piece together.",

He wielded this deadly weapon during the long years of the unification wars, and it never failed Him. He only parted with it when the first Captain-General was granted that immense honor, granting it to his most trusted guardian. Its disruptor field is so immensely powerful that no armor may withstand it. So powerful is it that it can unmake entire enemies whole with a single well placed strike. Its haft has a hyper-velocity bolter worked into it, capable of punishing even heavily armored of foes at extreme range. So great is the force of these bolts that they often leave foes dizzy, slow, and disoriented- if they’re lucky enough to survive the initial impact. But this blade has another ability: as its edge meets flesh it will fill its wielder’s minds with revelations about those it reaves from life. This spear tells only truth, pitiless and cold. All that enemies once knew will become your knowledge in the same instant they die. Though this can be a gift, it can also be a heavy burden, to know all the life of one’s enemies. To know them as they knew themselves, and to know the imperfections which lead to their folly. Perhaps it will make you less eager to spill blood, as He once intended.",

If you load in an improper sequence it simply won’t work- this lab has a zero percent rate of failure and an equal mortality rate in procedures.

It comes with two preloaded sequences- that of blanks, which the Imperium has never managed to successfully bring about with gene-craft, and that of Custodians.

After all, why waste all your time pumping bullets and bolts into your foes when a single dose of poison can kill them far faster? So, by following in the footsteps of the Venenum Temple and their assassins, you’ve gotten your hands on their own Poison Globes. Filled with crystalline shards, these grenades disperse a rather potent gaseous neurotoxin strong enough to debilitate, if not outright kill, almost every foe you might encounter. Not too useful on those wearing power armor unfortunately.",

And despite all that polymorphine allows one to do, others have sought to improve upon the substance, regardless of the costs. One such person was Inquisitor Dahwrin, whose Thorian beliefs led him to believe that an improved version of polymorphine could lead to the creation of a Divine Vessel, one who could take in the Emperor’s soul itself.

Your Navigator is adventurous, and deeply desires to see more of the Galaxy with their own eyes, and may even hazard a trip out of the ship to visit wherever you are as long as it isn't a Death World or an environment utterly inhospitable to mostly-human life.",

While an ordinary Navigator would be able to blend in with the rest of humanity, save for their third eye, Cicera does not have that luxury. With skin and hair as pale as snow, amethyst veins and warp-colored eyes, Cicera stands out even amongst the rest of her kind. But don’t think this appearance of hers will deter her. What she lacks in subtlety, she more than makes up for it in firepower. Standing heads and shoulders above most of her fellow Navigators, Cicera is psyker of great power and skill, capable of wiping out scores of daemons through her mastery over her Third Eye, supplemented by her experience in the use of cryomancy. More than once, she has left a battlefield littered with frozen corpses. Of course, just because she has phenomenal psychic powers, it doesn’t mean that she is ignorant to the usage of tools and weapons. After all, she has met blanks before. She knows full well, that her psychic powers are not infallible, a sentiment not shared by many of her fellow Navigators. To that end, she has equipped herself with an arsenal that wouldn’t be out of place in the Imperial Guard, if only far more ornate. Her weapon of choice is a Combi-weapon, a fusion of a orce Rod to enhance her own psychic capabilities, and a Grav-Gun, perfect for crushing most forms of enemy machinery under their own weight. To defend herself, she is garbed in a suit of Reinforced Void Armor, enough to make her almost as durable as a Space Marine, even without shielding herself with her psychic capabilities. No helmet though. Can’t cover up her most attractive feature after all. Outside of battle though, Cicera is far more demure, preferring to stay away from most forms of social interaction. When she isn’t tasked with navigating ships, you’ll find her in her quarters, reading a book, painting on a canvas, or making a few miniatures with her psychic powers. However, her favorite hobby is stargazing, something she never got much of a chance to do in her younger years on account of the harsh training she underwent. She’ll very much appreciate it if you can get her quarters with an open view of the cosmic void. As for her interactions with others, you will likely have to bear the brunt of that. Unaccustomed to the outside world, the only person she’s willing to communicate with for now are you and your Companions. For others, she usually just stares at them disdainfully, almost as if they weren’t worth her time. Fortunately, that’s the worst thing she does, which is better than what could be said of some other Navigators. Still, maybe you can help her out with that. Navigators can’t work alone after all.",

It takes great effort and willpower to activate, and can only be activated by a person with some kind of psyker or psychic ability. For the Hollow Atlas, both Astropaths and Navigators count. When active, a series of highly detailed three dimensional star-charts in glowing blue energy erupt from the Atlas to fill whatever room or area it is currently occupying (within reason). Usually, these charts are of a region of space the user is interested in visiting and thinking about. The region displayed can be as large as a sub-sector or as small as a single solar system. However, sometimes the Atlas does not show the user what he wants to see, but other regions entirely. Often there is no discernible reason for this, however should the user heed the Atlas and travel to this region of space, he seldom finds the trip wasted. In future jumps, the Hollow Atlas will update to the region around the owner’s starting point.",

Numbering in the billions, without the Imperial Guard, the Imperium could not stand for they are the foundation upon which the Imperium wages war. After all, if you throw enough bodies, you can fix almost any problem. But the Imperium isn’t stupid, despite how it may seem at times. They know full well that the precision of a scalpel is needed just as much as the brute force of a hammer. Which is why the Tempestus Scions exist. Often trained since childhood, the Tempestus Scions are the best of the best of the Imperial Guard and as such, are tasked with missions that ordinary Guardsmen are not trained or equipped to handle. And Lyla Kaiserin is one of them. With a scarred yet stunningly beautiful face, Lyla has no shortage of admirers and yet, it is her eyes which are her most striking features. In fact, once you see them, it is blindingly obvious what world she calls home. Let me give you a hint. The planet broke before the Guard did. Yes, Lyla is one of the many Cadians who have found themselves without a home and like many Cadians, that doesn’t stop her from continuing the good fight, no matter how far she has to go. As a soldier, Lyla is every bit what you would expect from the soldiers of Cadia. Fierce and brave with a foul mouth to boot, she can field strip a las gun with her eyes closed in only half a minute and reassemble in another thirty seconds. Although, she does have a knack for explosions, often exulting and preaching of the magnificence of the grenade, be it a simple frag grenade or a mighty vortex bomb. For her armaments, she comes equipped with a triple-barreled Hellgun, capable of punching through power armor and blowing open a fist-sized hole along with it. Her sidearm is an archaeotech Plasma Pistol, one that fires purple bolts of plasma and never overheats. But her real pride and joy is her Assault Grenade Launcher. It might ordinarily be a single shot weapon, but she’s had it hooked up to a backpack filled with all sorts of grenades, letting her let loose a torrent of explosions at any target in range. And don’t think that offense is all she has. She armors herself with a suit of Kasrkin Carapace Armor and an energy shield from House Van Saar of Necromunda. It’ll take a lot of enemy fire to bring this bad girl down. And if she ever needs anything more than that, she’s an able hand at the wheel when it comes to most vehicles. Get her in something like a Heavy Sentinel and she can mow down troops faster than a man can throw down a grenade.",

That’s how the launcher works after all. Of course, if that isn’t to your liking, you could always have the Exorcist missile launcher replaced with something more conventional.

      "description": "Where would the Imperium be without the Ecclesiarchy and where would the Ecclesiarchy be without the Adepta Sororitas? Since the Age of Apostasy, they’ve been a common sight across the Imperium, their presence serving to bolster the faith and courage of the common man. Of course, they also serve as able deterrents to any who would dare to rebel against the Imperium. The sight of a Sister blowing a man to shreds with a bolter or watching the men they burn with their Flamers scream in agony as their flesh sloughs away helps people change their minds rather quickly. But let’s not fret about the Sisters of Battle and instead focus on your companion. Or to be more accurate, companions. That’s right, for the price of one, you get two! No older than twenty-five, these two Sisters—Eliana and Soriana Illumoise—were originally supposed to be stationed on Sepheris Secundus but with the opening of the Cicatrix Maledictum, approaching the planet became a nigh-impossibility and as such, they’ve decided that sticking with you is the best option they have. As for their appearances, they’re about what you might expect out of one of the Adepta Sororitas. Both of them are astonishingly beautiful, bearing flawless faces framed by their natural snow-white hair and with bodies that seemed to have been sculpted by the Emperor Himself. They have no trouble turning heads and more than once has a sinner repented upon seeing their visage. But for personality, the two of them could not be more different. For one thing, both of them specialize in entirely different branches of the Sororitas. Eliana is a Sister of Battle and perhaps one of their fiercest soldiers. In battle, she shows her fervor and zealotry to the Imperium with her proclivity towards fire, burning all those in her path. Soriana on the other hand, is part of the Orders Dialogus, and her knowledge and diplomatic skills lets her translate all but the most encrypted of texts and keep peace between even the most different sects of the Imperium. Naturally, this also means that they also wield different equipment. Eliana wades into battle clad in the standard of power armor of the Sisters of Battle, along with a Rosarius to further protect herself. For weapons, she wields an Infernus Pistol, a Godwy-De’az Pattern Boltgun combined with a Hand Flamer, and a vicious two-handed Chainsword that she wields with but a single hand. On the other hand, her sister armors herself with special Sororitas Carapace Armor, complete with a Rosarius, and wields an ornate Bolt Pistol alongside a powerful Null Rod for use against daemons and psykers. And yet, despite all their differences, the two of them are more like than even they realize. With their loyalty to humanity and their faith in the Emperor, the twins are the pinnacle of what humanity should be. And their faith has been more than rewarded. Their faith is of such strength that they become capable of great feats that some would say they were psykers or for those more foolish, witches.",

Painted entirely black, and running without lights, a Black Ships makes for a rather secretive and spacious vessel, perfect for any Inquisitor. As for its armaments and armor, you won’t be disappointed. Built as a combination between a Strike Cruiser and a Navy Battlecruiser, the Black Ship is somewhere around four kilometers long, weighing in at twenty-six million tons, and carries a crew of almost 90,000 bodies. And with its size comes room for plenty of weapons. From a Bombardment Cannon to port weapons batteries, and torpedoes, there’s no shortage of tools to let the Black Ship annihilate the forces of your enemies.",

I’m not saying you don’t have it, but picking this up will bolster that common sense while giving you the mannerisms and skills to articulate yourself to others so they can understand the advantages of thinking and acting rationally. Yes, sometimes sanity does have its advantages. As a result, your mind is also significantly less likely to be open to the influence of others’ charisma, by the simple reasoning of looking at their ideas and realizing just how stupid it sounds.

She moves with the fluidity of a cat, her lithe frame able to contort itself into all sorts of positions. Her quick reflexes and nimble fingers make her a natural at sleight of hand and pickpocketing, and she takes great pride in her ability to relieve others of their valuables without being detected. Lyra's clothes are a patchwork of rags and stolen garments, cobbled together from whatever she can scavenge. Despite their shabby appearance, her garments are designed for maximum mobility and flexibility, allowing her to move with ease through the crowded streets of the city. A small leather pouch at her waist contains her ill-gotten gains, along with a few tools of her trade - a set of lockpicks, a length of wire, and a few other odds and ends that she uses to gain entry to locked doors or to disable alarms. Although she may seem tough and streetwise on the surface, Lyra has a vulnerable side as well. Her life on the streets has left her with few friends and even fewer allies, and she has learned to be fiercely independent and self-reliant.

Her speech patterns are formal and technical, reflecting her deep commitment to the Machine God. Despite her distant demeanour, there is a passion in her eyes that suggests a desire to unlock the secrets of the universe. She is always looking for ways to enhance her own abilities and those of her fellow warriors, even if it means delving into esoteric areas of science. At times, however, she becomes too consumed in her work, pushing herself beyond the limits of what is considered safe or sane. This is when she needs someone to bring her back down to terra, to remind her that there are more important things than the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, and the dangers of unbridled curiosity.",

That is why you need someone to protect your back. This soldier is a grizzled veteran of many battles. She has skill in wielding most of the weapons of the Imperial Guard and even when push comes to shove, she can also handle non-Imperial weaponry due to a rare pass from the inquisition combined with more combat experience than any normal human should ever have to have. How could she get this amount of influence ? Nobody knows. She tends to act like the mother of the squad, always caring for everyone, but especially for you. She will notice, when you are tired and guard you, when you are at your weakest. If you fall asleep at your job, she will give you a lap pillow. Hanging around her for some time will peel more information about her previous work. She used to work for inquisition as one of the personal kill teams of one of the Inquisitors with huge reach in this part of the space. Which explains why she gets access to more weirder weapons in her arsenal. Her youthful appearance is also a result of rejuvenat treatments as her service to Inquisition was long one.

A warship filled with such technology that many Mechanicus members would do anything for the slightest chance to step onboard and learn its secrets. A warship filled with enough weaponry that it alone could shatter planets, destroy fleets, and lay waste to star systems. However, the Dracothion initially was meant for something far more: exploration, discovery, and learning. The Nameless King's journey kept to the original purpose of Dracothion, allowing scientists, engineers, scholars, teachers, and others to come aboard to learn from the ship's massive data banks of forgotten knowledge.” A mighty warship created by the Dark Age of Technology for the Primarch to take command of. As mentioned above this is not meant to be a warship, but instead functions as one due to the size and power of its weapons. The ship from tip to tip is approximately 90km compared to the standard 26km of a Gloriana class.",

Planets that you conquer will become loyal and you won't ever have to worry about betrayal, unless outside forces interfere. This will also work on people as well. For example, if you face an enemy champion and beat them, you could choose to spare them. This would allow you to recruit them. They may not necessarily be happy, but they will become loyal enough not to betray you. In addition this will never be against you or affect you negatively.

Rogue Traders are empowered to act in the Imperium’s name and interests beyond the border of the Imperium itself. Beyond the borders of the Imperium their word is, at least theoretically, the word of the Emperor himself, so long as they are acting in the interests of the Imperium. To this end, they are legally empowered to acquire and operate void ships, even military grade ones, and raise, equip, and maintain private armies. They may trade both within and without the Imperium, but theoretically their immunity is only effective outside the border. As much in the Imperium, theory & practice don’t always match. Within the borders of the Imperium their power and authority fluctuates with their wealth and other assets, but is generally equivalent to that of a Planetary Governor.

The information they contain, however, is in and of itself far more interesting. It is information as old as the first war between your kind and the Necrontyr, if not older – the architecture of a system invented by the Old Ones and inherited, as were many of their wonders, by your people. The means by which your ilk avoid the predations of the Warp in their travels across the stars. The very feat the one who Mon'Keigh call the Emperor of Mankind attempted to recreate using his Golden Throne. Within these crystals lie the keys to the creation of the Webway itself. However, you have nowhere near the almighty psychic power the Old Ones wielded in their heyday, and the Warp was far calmer then, when they merged its outermost layer with realspace to form a skein-realm that was neither Materium nor Immaterium, and yet both. This knowledge is of little use to you here. With that said, there are other worlds beyond this grim, dark galaxy. Worlds ripe for the foundation of a fresh, unbroken Webway. Perhaps a fine and proper starting point for the application of this system is simply connecting faraway points on a single planet, about the same size as Old Earth before it came to be called Holy Terra. A feat connecting the northernmost and southernmost points of such a world, that one might step through a gate at the bottom of the world and exit at its top or a number of points in between, might well cost you precious decades of psychic exertion, spiritual focus, and of course the construction of the actual Webway Gates. Even so, given much longer, you might well connect the planets within a system to one another at singular points. As your psychic power and the amount of time at your disposal grow, so too shall the potential this information brings. And should you truly ascend into a state akin to or even surpassing that of the Old Ones themselves? You might erect Webway Gates at opposite corners of entire galaxies.",

In contrast to the malevolent natures of its kin it seems to possess the naivety of a child despite its still alien mind. With it’s living metal form constantly restructuring as it learns, gains experience, and develops currently it’s only core trait it having irrevocably imprinted on you for some reason or another, seeing you as something similar to a beloved parent. Hanging onto your every word and desiring to please and emulate you, it begins only as strong as a powerful psyker of one of the lesser races. It’s raw potential is possibly unmatched, and given enough time and sustenance it will grow rapidly (by the standards of the C’tan at least, still requiring potentially thousands of years and incredible amounts of energy in even the most ideal circumstances) into a rival of the mightiest of the Star Gods.",

Its weaponry was able to scour entire worlds clean of any life, all while safely protected by void shields so powerful that none of the Imperium’s weaponry was able to so much as damage them.

      "description": "This egg-shaped warship has weak shields, slow maneuvering, and weak guns, relative to its size, but it has several major advantages. Firstly, it is large, large enough that it can be considered a mobile staging platform rather than a ship. Capable of carrying millions of Kroot (or other T’au affiliated species) through space and even landing on planets to serve as temporary or permanent colonization hubs. Secondly, it is very heavily armored, just by sheer dint of its size, its thick plating can shrug off large amounts of fire from enemy vessels. Thirdly, it has a true Warp Drive, technology that eludes the T’au to this day, making it strategically faster than any other T’au vessel. Fourth, it comes crewed with a skeleton crew of kroot voidsman, who can instinctively navigate the warp without navigators or psychic powers. Fifth, it is protected from Warp entities by a Kroot field that is oddly reminiscent of the orkish WAAAGH field, serving as a Gellar field replacement that cannot fail until the ship itself suffers major structural damage and requires no power from the ship itself to function. The crew of this ship are loyal to you, the T’au and Kroot both recognize your ownership and right to captain this vessel, and as part of your purchase you also receive the schematics to construct more of these ships, even without the innate technical insight that Kroot use to build these vessels.",

      "description": "You now have a sword similar to the Dawn Blade wielded by Commander Farsight. It is older than T’au expansion, older than the Imperium of Man, and it’s origins are shrouded in mystery, having been constructed by unknown Xenos in Segmentum Ultima long ago. Its materials defy scientific analysis by the greatest and wisest members of the Earth Caste, and its chronophagic alloys steal the life-span of those it kills, adding power and life to the wielder. It can cut through any mundane materials and do significant harm even to warp entities, being far superior to ordinary power weapons. In many ways, both its iridescent glow, its life-devouring properties, and its ancient nature, it seems to resemble a Gauss weapon...",

      "description": "The Pharos was a pre-Imperial installation of Necron design. While operating on very different principles, and significantly less powerful, the Pharos, like the Astronomicon, served as a beacon aiding navigation through the Warp. It was used by Guilliman when Imperium Secundus was separated from Terra by massive warp storms during the Horus Heresy. It was destroyed during the Heresy, but after the Indomitus Crusade Belasarius Cawl discovered that there may have been more than 1 such installation. Apparently that is true, because you now have one. While it does not have the same range as the Astronomicon, it also does not require an godlike level of psychic might to operate, nor does it require the sacrifice of thousands of psykers. It is also filled with necron technology, but if you decide to tamper with that it is entirely at your own risk. It is located either on a planet you own,or a planet near your starting point. In future jumps it becomes a Property you may import or not in the standard way of fiat backed properties.",
