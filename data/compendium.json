The petty concerns of human life fade somewhat, making it so much easier to retain the sophistication and grace expected of a refined member of the Association. It requires a will stronger than normal people to brush up against death and that same will, in a rather less dramatic application, is something that allows most Magi to withstand the long hours of study, research and constant requirement for creative thinking when it comes to learning magecraft. Exam hell doesn’t even begin to describe it, when you’re studying to make sure you don’t incinerate yourself from the inside out!"

It taught you all the basics of being a Magus, such as decent capability with Formalcraft, Reinforcement, Gradation Air, and Hypnotism. The core arts of any magus, as well as a general familiarity with the supernatural world. You also took on something of a specialty, possibly even a family legacy you inherited, in magecraft. In a field of modern magecraft, you’ve made a name as having decent potential. An amateur to any professional but in your chosen field, from a rookie Alchemist to a burgeoning Elementalist to a spirit user or something more specific, you’ve got a few years training on the other students with no ability at all. Your time there also lets you gain a few friends and contacts at the Association, mostly classmates and perhaps a faculty member or two. You can buy this perk multiple times, gaining another specialization of the same level each time."

Careful study of this massive book will certainly grant you insights you would not ordinarily have into the working of your Lore of Magic, as well as how it relates to the others overall. As your adventures continue, you may make similar discoveries on the workings of other forms of magic - and oddly enough this copy of the Treatise will record your future findings as if Puchta himself had penned them.

However, you can only memorize one spell to mimic at a time, and must rehear a spell you have forgotten in order to cast it once you’ve shifted to mimicking a different spell. Also, mimicking a spell costs (MP, energy, etc.) twice as much as it would if normally cast (even if the normal spell had no costs, the vocal mimicry will still get an extra cost attached)."

If you have an Apprentice of your own, they will be more than grateful to study under your wing. For another 200 Aethyric Humors in addition to the base price, you may notice a strange thing happening. Should you take someone under your wing who is neither of this world nor in possession of native aptitude for magic, your Wind might blow upon them so that they can learn more properly from you. Use this provision for the continued advancement of the magical arts wisely. Should you fail to impart upon your student the importance of controlling that power, you will have only yourself to blame."

You on the other hand don’t need to do that, if only because Vasu himself trained you to be able to do so as well.

Azul is one of them. Colored blue in case you couldn’t tell, this Grimoire has similar abilities to the others, being a deep reservoir of knowledge and capable of powerful spells. Capable, in the sense that when you first obtain her, Azul will only know Dark Blast. More spells will need to be obtained via finding Sealed Verses or recording spells you discover in other jumps. And if you’re wondering why Azul costs double what the Pod perk does when all that is basically the same, the answer is, of course, power. While the standard uses of Sealed Verses are similar to pod programs, Weiss was capable of creating super-powered versions of the spells, such as giant-sized Dark Hands the size of buildings. And apparently he was only using a portion of the power of the Sealed Verses. Any spell recorded in Azul will be able to be enhanced far beyond its normal limits, creating truly ridiculous spells. Personality wise, Grimoire Azul starts off very reticent, almost robotic. Due to her trauma at getting turned into a Grimoire and sealed away for a thousand years, her personality has been repressed somewhat. But as you travel with her and grow closer, you’ll find her old personality re-emerging. Who knows what sort of person you might discover underneath that trauma. A refined, humble lady? A cheerful genki girl? A over-protective yandere? Just know that she won’t be anything like one of the three other Grimoires, so she won’t be an prideful gentlewoman, arrogant egomaniac or, uh, just plain crazy."

A toxic belief that all that we have now is just a pale imitation of what came before. Age is power, an old family serves a magus better, we must reach the origin of it all. That’s just so much shit. Magecraft may lack the raw power and direct use of systems from earlier in history but the idea that it is useless is the thought of someone without the will to persevere. A true magus would not stop, not until they tear open a path beyond their limits. You’re living proof of the idea that magecraft being an inferior system is not necessarily as true as much of the Clocktower thinks. Whatever your own innate power, you have taken a chosen specialty of magecraft to obscene heights, the likes of which is only matched within magecraft by things like Aozaki Touko’s doll making styles or the impossible Bounded Fields of Araya Souren. Whatever your chosen field of study is, you’re certainly one of the greatest users in many generations, if not centuries outright. Your spells within that field are stronger, cheaper, faster and far more skillfully controlled than any hopeful peers. Your knowledge and skill is near total, at least in regards to existing knowledge on the field, and you have the sheer talent to continually push the limits and learn impossible spells and actions, like discovering how to make Bounded Fields mobile around a person. It’s far easier than normal, almost springing into your mind, to discover ways to combine other magic and magecraft you know into your chosen field to expand and empower it even further. As a finishing touch, whatever path you choose has revealed to you a method of immortality, a way to make yourself not just unaging but outright harder to kill in general. Touko’s famous immortality puppet network as a sterling example. In future worlds, you’ll find anything similar enough to your chosen specialty will receive all the same effects. A brilliant alchemist here will be one in the future too. You may also buy this perk multiple times."

Right down to the most miniscule detail regarding that which you’ve so painstakingly cracked. The pages will automatically, via clues within the text and notes, also indicate which other discoveries and creations can be linked or may be improved by studying in tandem. And to top it all off, this book is bound to your claws only. Should any other eyes try to pry its secrets, they’ll be stumped two-fold: The first, the book will spontaneously rewrite its secrets in such a thick and foul code that a determined cracker would need decades to break it. The second, the reader will contract a skaven-devised curse, being randomly stricken with bolts of warp-lightning."

These secrets were brought back when Eshin returned to their people, and since those days have remained as deadly as the ninja-assassins of the east. You have a set of five mist-billowing scrolls, covered in the flowing and elegant script of Cathay - standing out starkly from their verminous surroundings. Within these scrolls is carried all the knowledge and secrets that allow Eshin to turn fidgety, cowardly clanrats into cold-blooded, disciplined assassins and orchestrators of disaster. They also contain the magicks to the Lore of Stealth, causing any one rat or person who handles the scrolls to gain potential within that shadowy magick of Eshin Sorcerers. If one simply reads from these scrolls, and practices, they will swiftly rise in skill to become a dreaded assassin within weeks - with your aid, even days."

All of this culminates in a greater overall fitness and also makes you a single repetition learner, like Link you’ll only need to be shown how to do something once and you’ll be able to do it as long as you have the ability to. In addition to this mastery of swordsmanship you have learned how to create Tiger Scrolls which allow you to pass on any of your physical arts to a willing student. A student must dedicate around six hours of practice to what is written upon the Tiger Scroll every day, however the instructions are concise and within a week a weak version of the art should be learned with the full version being learned in around a year. Sadly you can only craft one of these Tiger Scrolls per year and it can only contain one 'move' of an entire art, so to learn a full martial arts style the master would have to break it down into separate pieces that together teach the entire style, The Tiger Scroll can’t teach magic or non-physical ‘moves’ but those moves that are largely composed of physical action with a magical or mystical component can be taught, such as the moves learned from the Blade Brother’s Spin Attack is done by channeling slight mystical energies into the sword before using the attack. The Tiger Scrolls don't discriminate, however, so if someone you don't like picks one up they could learn as easily as anyone you like."

It’s either a predecessor or an offshoot of the Book of Darkness, a legendary Lost Logia that collects both magical knowledge and energy, giving it a completely bottomless well of mana as well as knowledge of every spell from everyone world and individual it has absorbed. Problem: This white book is completely blank and tapped dry of any mana. While it can store as much energy as you can put into it, and copy as many spells as you can find a way to absorb into it, it has nothing within it right now. Still, if you had some way to do so, you could potentially gain a grimoire with an infinite supply of mana and an endless index of spells...if only you had some way to fill it. Maybe the book’s more-complete counterpart could give you some sort of clue? Once it has absorbed some mana and spells, it can be used in an identical way to a Unison Device. Even if you’re not the ‘collect and fill’ type, this book has another program of note: The Guardian Knights program. It contains four AI programs designed specifically to protect the user, who begin without personality and or sentience beyond guarding the user of this - though some time and care can cause them to develop personalities and wills of their own, much like Hayate Yagami did for her Knights. They start with low magic capabilities and function similarly to Familiars, but could potentially use Devices of their own (if built) and eventually advance to as far as S-rank natural ability after some growth and training. They do not count as companions and can be resurrected by draining mana from the Book if slain, but can be imported as true companions in future jumps, where they follow all associated rules therein. You may also import four companions into this role for free to receive the same benefits, though they follow normal companion rules instead from the get-go. Similarly, it contains a nascent control AI in the style of Reinforce, though like the Knights and Book itself, which is the primary subject of the Unison function. It starts off lacking personality or anything except base functions like a ‘Basic’ Intelligence, but will steadily grow to become Sapient as time goes on, particularly if you devote effort to educating it. It follows the same rules as the Guardian Knights in terms of companions, and is otherwise completely loyal to the Book’s user (you). After the book has collected a significant amount of mana, it can even begin to form an ‘internal world’ that functions as a pocket dimension, which will grow along with the Book. Obviously, if the artifact is destroyed or damaged, things contained within that world go with it...so mind keeping this safe, if you can. If you took the Darkness bloodline, the Book automatically retains all spells you learn and copy without needing your direct input."

Perhaps the greatest application of all is that you may draw out spells and magical effects from multiple books, combining them into a new spell all its own with the best parts of all those described.

Still, every life in this world has a single defining word for them - a compulsion and an instinct that their actions move in harmony with.You also possess such an Origin, such as ‘Taboo’ or ‘Nostalgia’, which gently guides your actions towards it, though you possess awareness of it and can choose to ignore it without any detriment to your own choices. Any actions you follow that line up with your Origin, particularly Magecraft, will enjoy a minor but noticeable boost in competence as you work in tune with your own nature in this world. You may choose any Origin except for ‘Void’."

      "description": "Origin and Element are attributes of the soul and one’s deepest being in this world. Everyone has one of each, some people have more, but this just helps you decide on the importance of your own ones. An Origin is like a concept, a word, that is at the core of your character. It might describe a secret side of you that you rarely show, it might show influence through every action you take or it might just be something you really love about yourself. Taboo for someone who feels a forbidden love, Worthlessness for someone who seems to be a complete failure, Nostalgia for a man who considers his memories dearly important. An Origin by itself doesn’t have much of an effect, merely lying unawakened. Some kinds of magecraft can eventually build on your Origin, such as a Taboo Origin Holder eventually learning to invest that effect into an item that inhibits the taboos of others. But these usually require quite high level skill and have subtle effects outside of extensive experimentation. You have an Origin of your choice, a normal one that is Unawakened and gives noreal boons but has no real hindrance either. An Element is more important, at least for a Magus. It describes something like your affinity for certain kinds of magic, significantly increasing talent in that area. Or rather, most Magi find it quite difficult to learn all but the most general magecraft outside of their Element. Far from impossible but much more inefficient. Most people have an Affinity for one of the five primary elements- Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Ether. These ascribe to much more than just basic elementalism. Fire might cover consumption, energy transfer or fuel. Earth may relate to cultivation and embedding of energy. Water covers the flow and cycle and combination of things. And so on. You have a moderately strong affinity for an Element of your choice. One of the primary five is recommended but if you know of an alternate choice, you can pick one, as long as it’s not superior to the primary five. No Average Ones with talent for all five Elements and no uniquely powerful Element."

      "description": "While magic does spread into the air, especially in the urban areas of magic-using nations and can be used from there, the most common source is a specialized organ called a Linker Core. Linker Cores are actual, physical organs situated in the chest, above the solar plexus, and are what take in and release mana. Naturally, Mages hold a certain potential, which is their capacity for storing and to an extent, actually processing that magic. This capacity can increase somewhat over time and with use, but it’s a very slow, trickling increase and does not exactly match up with what a Mage is capable of. See, the capacity of a Linker Core to store magical power is graded on a scale going from F to SSS, seen on the table below, but the power of spells are also graded on the same rank. However, a Mage with A-rank power is not necessarily required to cast an A-ranked spell, and on top of that, there is also a skill based rank assigned to Mages on the same scale, which leads to the complicated example of an A-ranked Mage with A-rank power trying to cast a A-ranked spell. What’s the distinction? While a spell may be A-ranked in power, it does not necessarily consume an A-rank in mana. Certain techniques, calculations and algorithms along with Devices and systems can increase the efficiency of spells, enabling low-potential Mages to cast above their metaphorical weight class. An A-ranked Mage is simply a Mage who is considered able to fight at a A-ranked combat level, usually involving the casting of A-ranked spells, hence the correlation. A-ranked capacity is far more nebulous, appearing to mean simply being able to provide the power for an A-ranked spell without collapsing, which makes it virtually indistinguishable from Mage Rank when it comes to Combat Mages. But at any rate, to help you get a head start in this world, we’re going to grant you a natural A-rank potential. For your purposes, this is going to be virtually identical to your Mage Rank at first, unless you put the training in to improve your prowess. You may purchase to the indicated rank for the point cost listed below. Remember, raw power isn’t everything, skill is just as much the name of the game as anything, but raw power will certainly give you a leg up."

You may obtain a maximum of five ranks here or over the course of the jump, but cannot reach archmastery (higher than five gnosis) until post­-spark. A higher Gnosis is also a danger as the higher it is the more likely a paradox is to occur when you use vulgar magic. When a paradox is invoked, its power will be equivalent to the level of your Gnosis. Gnosis limits the level of Arcana you may know at a given time. For ease of reference a chart has been produced below listing what level your Gnosis must be to know a new arcanum (the top row of numbers indicate the order in which you learned your arcana). Your first and second Arcana will always be your ruling Arcana while your third is the one you chose to invest a single free rank into. The rest follow in order as you choose to purchase or learn them. Maximum Arcana possible by Attained Gnosis These same limitations on Gnosis and Arcana will persist after the jump, and while you may learn more Arcana and increase your Gnosis, they will always fall within the limitations provided by the chart to the right."

Your body is in peak physical condition, capable of running and jumping for a few hours before you start to feel the slightest fatigue. You also possess an Inventory, a special extra-dimensional space within which you can store items. When prepping items for storage in your inventory, you can cause them to shrink down into a small, hand-sized chunk, shaped and colored to represent whatever they happen to be. Similar items can stack together, up to a certain amount depending on rarity. You have 50 ‘slots’ within which to store items or stacks of items, and you can store or retrieve items with just a thought. Upon beating enemies or destroying objects like jars, they will occasionally drop hearts which can heal your health, stars that can replenish your mana, or pre-shrunk items as loot that you can suck into your inventory. Finally, you are able to take stored items and use them to craft new items, though many such recipes require a special workbench or station to be nearby for you to actually make an item. However, if the correct station is nearby, and you have all needed materials, you will instantly be aware of whatever item you could potentially make.

Whatever it is, its effects are the same as it is a literally fragment of your soul made manifest in the fallen world. The soul stone is a powerful tool and may be used as a strong basis for creating an enhanced or imbued item. Its true strength emerges only after someone has reached mastery in an arcana. Once this is done, the mage may choose to create a demesne; a ritually prepared area in the fallen world wherein vulgar magic does not induce paradox. The size of the demesne and the arcanum that may be cast there are limited by the number of soulstones that are willingly contributed to it, and the paths of the mages that those soul stones belonged to. A single soul­stone could be used to create a demesne large enough to cover a small apartment or underground chamber. By adding more soulstones from different mage’s (to a maximum of five) the demesne will extend over a sprawling estate or series of underground tunnels. While vulgar magic will not trigger a paradox in these hallowed realms, the spells themselves are still subject to disbelief and subsequent unraveling by sleepers observation. Should someone get their hands on it however, they will be able to siphon magic away from the soulstones owner freely. Furthermore anyone who possesses it will have an incredibly powerful sympathetic link to its owner; allowing them to cast spells at a great distance on them with an extreme chance of success. Finally, soulstones are highly sought after by all sorts of nightmarish entities, from the Tremere Liches evil spirits and demons of the abyss, all of whom would happily destroy or devour the stone for their nefarious purposes. Soulstones are an extreme vulnerability and must be well guarded, lest their owners suffer terrible fates."

As long as the user accepts ownership of the charm, the powers of the pearl affect you as long as you are relatively close by, even if you set it down. When your emotions are too high, the pearl turns blue and cools your passion down. On the flipside, when the user becomes depressed, the gem turns red and makes him or her feel more upbeat. However, if the pearl is close to the opposite element of its current process (such as fire when it’s blue or water when it’s red), the user’s emotions become chaotic and uncontrollable. Furthermore, if the crystal becomes too overloaded and shatters, all of the concentrated, magically-enhanced emotions splash out onto the user and make him or her go berserk with passions. Fortunately, once the emotions are used up, the user will fall unconscious and gradually recover."

If the shell is large enough for a mermaid to squeeze in, sleeping inside heals a mermaid's health. By sitting on it like a cushion, your water magic is strengthened, and by blowing into it like a musical instrument your singing power is amplified; the level of the enhancement increases with the size of the nautilus.

If you should happen to be knocked out in combat, the wizard will ask your unconscious mind for control of your body to continue the fight, flee, or seek medical attention, depending on the circumstances. The wizard’s personality is roughly of your design, but they always have your best interests at heart. Despite being sentient, the wizard does not take up a companion slot so long as it remains in helmet form."

Whatever you feel, it is with full certainty and intensity. As a number of abilities draw on a specific emotion in the user, you can reach intense levels that you could not achieve with extra emotions getting in the way. Your emotion can change, whether by choice or at random, but it will always be a complete change. Furthermore, the concentrated nature of your inner self means that when you focus on a specific thing, whether it is an emotion or a certain talent, you can put your full heart into it and bring out the best of that quality of yourself. You will have to deal with the emotional changes as a fairy regardless of whether you bought the perk, but you will need to purchase the perk to access the same abilities (with greater control) after the jump."

      "description": "Steeped in darkness, this is a cursed magic ring. While you wear it, it empowers whatever magic you cast, doubly so for dark aligned magical abilities, but that is not its true power. The Wraith Ring is most interesting when given away. After being cast into circulation, when a wielder of the magic ring’s power dies the essence of their soul and emotions is absorbed. As bits and pieces of souls and emotions of deceased past wearers are absorbed over time, a gestalt of spiritual impressions will begin to form and may even become aware. Each bit and piece absorbed will somewhat empower the ring, which only further entices those who wish for it themselves."

The Rail Map is a repository of spiritual power, gathered from the various Temples in each Realm, and drawn towards the Tower of Spirit along the lines of the rails. These sections of the map then store excess energy, allowing those lines to be reinforced in an emergency. A backup battery, if you will. In your hands, it also serves the purpose of storing a truly massive amount of energy, and transferring that energy into any broken seals, enchantments, or other magical effects that may be damaged."

Whether through a trick of fate or a stubborn bloodline, you’re related to one of the bloodlines of Belka that existed during the Warring Ages that led to its eventual collapse. You may even be more than that, if you take a particular Scenario...but for now, choose a single bloodline below. Sagebrecht - The bloodline of the last Saint King, said to have died without progeny or children of their own. Somehow, you’re the exception to this rule. Just like the Saint Kings of old, your body has grown into a living weapon, granting you perfect efficiency and control of mana, though it is difficult to utilize in a younger or damaged body. Your magic color changes to the Kaiserfabe, a neat rainbow color, and naturally possess the Saint’s Armor, which functions as a passive AMF field that weakens incoming magic and steadily erodes hostile or unwelcome persistent magical effects on your person. Flame King - An artifact of the Dark Ruler of Galea, your body is now a living factory for Marriage, female artificial puppets that can change their arms into razor-sharp blades, and an advanced version that can transform its arm into a mass-based cannon. Upon death, the Mariage detonate, often taking their opponents or unwary foes down with them. Initially, you can only produce the control cores of the basic Mariage types, but eventually you will be able to create new types or even fully form Mariages from the beginning. Darkness - This isn’t exactly a ‘bloodline’ per se, but somehow, you’re connected to the original program of the Book of Darkness. Your hair becomes white and your eyes turn red, and you bear more than a passing resemblance to Reinforce Eins. You’ve also retained the Book’s function of collecting magical knowledge through a Rare Skill called Collect and Use, letting you drain a subject of their magical energy and copy their spells with near-perfect accuracy. With time, you can even copy other Rare Skills. You may not necessarily be able to use it depending on your own energy reserves, but you’ll have a magical target’s complete repertoire so long as you can absorb it. Minor - The diluted bloodline of some minor noble, lost to time. You may have Unendlichjagd and Thought Investigation or Prophetinschriften. Unendlichjagd, or “Endless Hunt” summons spectral dogs with extensive fighting and stealth capabilities that obey your every command. Thought Investigation allows the accessing of someone's mind and memories. However, it is easily resisted, so your target usually must be incapacitated in some form. Prophetinschriften or “Book of the Prophet'' creates a highly archaic poem written in Ancient Belkan that predicts the events of the next half to several years of the future. It requires a specific alignment of a planet's moons and is generally only usable once or twice a year."

In addition this perk allows you to tap into your latent power of telepathy that the Hylian people have all but forgotten, once upon a time it was used to communicate with the Goddesses but now only acts as a nigh perfect form of willing one-way telepathy, your telepathic reach extends to the edges of the kingdom’s borders to start with and will grow with time. However, it seems that dimensional barriers prevent such magics from working. (CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Soul of Light - Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap first.) If taken with the Soul of Light perk your mana bar is immense, easily double its previously impressive bulk."

But due to their nature, they cannot be artificially created, only forming after several years of mana condensing and purifying in a single location. This commonly happens only on asteroids, where they can be left undisturbed for long periods of time, and truly vast mana veins can form. But even as mining them can be a hassle, their value makes it worth anyone’s while, as they are capable of holding and regenerating massive amounts of mana, with the exact volumes depending on the gem’s size and quality. And it seems like you’ve hit the jackpot, as with this you’ll be able to gain a steady supply of mana gems each week. You may decide on a case by case basis whether you want several dozen small and low-quality mana gems, or two to three big and high-quality ones."

Your family decides the number and potency of your magic circuits, the kind and depth of your magical specialisation, the unique traits of your magic and the potential you have to go further. Certainly, there may be some mutants here and there that buck the system but to the Association, a family as old and storied as yours is far more valuable than the transient nature of a one off prodigy. You hail from a line that is centuries or even thousands of years old. The heir to their circuits and knowledge, it’s ensured you have an impressive amount of power at your fingers. Both quantity and quality of your circuits is among the highest found in Magi of this age and you are generally talented with all magecraft you try your hand at. You may have an exceptionally strong affinity for your Element to improve studies relating to it even more or choose to spread out more and appear as one of the rare Average Ones, of lesser talent in one field in exchange for talent and ability at all five traditional Elements. Your family inheritance ensured you are wealthy, influential and very well connected in the Association, with many would-be allies and mentors hoping to benefit from your name even before you arrived for your first period of study. Incantations come quickly to you, casting at much higher speeds than all but other prodigies, and your skill with the core arts of magecraft have significantly increased to an expert level. Your family arts are of course much more impressive, as the Magic Crest on your body holds the work of many generations of your forefathers on your one chosen specialty in modern magecraft. As an Alchemist or Elementalist or Spiritualist or whatever else, you’d be well-educated enough to capably run your own lessons in the Clocktower. You might even be doing that now, considering it’s almost certain that you have at least one impressive Title from the Association to honour your achievements, along with a widely known reputation through the Association. A famous lineage in the same style will also optionally be your family in future worlds."

Any spell run through it has its powers increased to powerful effect. It takes energy from your life force and concentrates it into magic power. But if you put effort into fiddling with it, then maybe you could use it to enhance other sources of energy. While it lacks the power of resurrection and purification of the original Silver Crystal, it is still quite potent. It can take any form you wish, like a lotus or tear shape. You can change this form at any time as well with some magic on your part. It comes in a dazzlingly jeweled case, the crystal itself hanging from a silver chain beaded with pearls. Luxurious red velvet pads the inside of the case. This case cannot be damaged and it will never rot away, and the silver chain cannot break unless you wish it to break. You may take the crystal off the chain if you wish."

The Endless are far older and more powerful than mere gods and rule absolutely over their domains. You have somehow caught the attention of one of these beings and have been granted a boon related to their sphere of power. ● Blessing of Delirium: ​Once Delirium was known as Delight, but some event forever altered the youngest of the Endless into a twisted form. With the favor of Delirium, you never need fear this same fate. Your mind is a rock upon which madness breaks. Nothing, be it the passage of eternity or staring into the eyes of the Old Ones, may so much as scratch your sanity. ● Blessing of Despair: Despair finds you to be one of only a handful of beings in all of creation that she actually likes. For finding a soft spot in her heart, she rewarded you with an immense willpower that will forever shield you from the depression which she Embodies. ● Blessing of Destruction: Destruction is a strange being. Having long since grown tired of his duty as the embodiment of destruction and abandoned it to instead pursue (very flawed, due to his nature as the opposite) attempts at creation instead. With his favor, you gain insight into the structure of all things, and more to the point, the weakest points in the structures. Whenever you wish to destroy something, be it a simple physical object, a vast conspiracy, or something more abstract, you will always know where it is most vulnerable. ● Blessing of Desire: Desire is the personification of lust and desire. With this blessing you are among the most beautiful people to ever live. Even beyond your base attractiveness, everyone who looks upon you, or even a likeness of your image, will see something slightly different as your features warp in their mind to be ever so slightly closer to what they consider ideal beauty. ● Blessing of Dream: Dream of the Endless rules over the Dreaming. And he’s honestly kind of a dick. But his involvement in the lives of mortals is really not that uncommon, and you are one of his favorites in millennia. With his blessing, you are now always capable of lucid dreaming and may project yourself into the Dreaming at will, allowing you to access both the whole of the plane itself and all the dreams of every living being. Additionally, as dreams and illusions are very closely related, any illusions you cast are enhanced and you are capable of completely ignoring any other illusions that attempt to affect you. ● Blessing of Death: ​Don’t fear the reaper, baby. Death is not exactly what you’d expect. Oh, she once was, but then she took a tradition of becoming mortal and facing a mortal’s death one day a century and her entire perspective changed. Now, instead of appearing as something unnerving, she appears as a rather attractive and upbeat goth girl. After all, everyone deserves one last hot date. As Death favors you, she will turn a blind eye to your death once per jump, reviving you and healing your wounds in the process. After all, why rush things? All will eventually find themselves before her one final time, no matter how many come before. ● Blessing of Destiny: Destiny is the eldest of the Endless and the one most subsumed by his duties. For him to favor a mortal is a very strange thing indeed... but then, you’re not exactly a stranger to strangeness, are you? With the favor of Destiny, you are granted much greater freedom from fate than others. Any attempts to alter your destiny are doomed to failure, as are any attempts to look into a future which directly involves you."

Your mastery allows you to eschew requirements for magic outside of the magical energy needed to power the spell and the focus needed to shape it. You don’t need wands or reagents or even incantations for your magic, simply the will and knowledge of how to accomplish something. This isn’t without downsides, of course. It’s always somewhat both harder and less effective the more powerful the spell and the more components you eschew. Throwing a simple fireball without a chant won’t make much of a difference, but attempting to cast world rending spells that normally require elaborate rituals and hours of incantations are another matter entirely."

The blood of a normal person will let you heal your own wounds and extend your lifespan to unnatural lengths. The blood of a wizard may give you access to his particular brand of magic. The blood of supernatural creatures such as vampires or werewolves will grant you the abilities of a fledgeling of whatever species you drank of, without any of their corresponding weaknesses. You are skilled enough in your art that you will never succumb and become a vampire or werewolf permanently through your magic unless you intend to. However, these abilities are temporary ­while you may extend the duration of them given practice, once the blood leaves your system you will revert to normal. Generally, about 250 ml of blood will give you enough “juice” for about half a day but the ratio of blood consumption to time of empowerment will likely improve with experience."

Unfortunately, this is not all benefits. The Orcs of Athan’Khar hate humanity with a passion, a quite reasonable result of the Tiraan Empire hitting the Orcish homeland with so many magical weapons that even time has broken in the area, and even the local god was slain. These furious spirits constantly drive their host to kill, often driving them insane with their demands. While you do not suffer these consequences, good luck convincing others.

Many of the protective spells on the vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light require the constant incantations of choirs of acolytes. Now you too may cast beyond your means, with the aid of your fellow Hierophants. By casting together in a choir, you and any nearby allies who know the protective, binding, or purifying spell you are attempting to use may combine your efforts seamlessly, creating an exponentially more powerful effect. In the light of Hysh, you are all one."

Regardless, you have the Staff of the Horned One - a potent magical weapon that magnifies the power of any spell you cast through it, turning a blast of warp-lightning into a torrential beam. But its true power is as a symbol of station: Whilst you hold the stave, your words have a level of gravity that force even those that despise your very existence - such as the dwarf-things and leaders of men - to cease action and hear your words."

That of Zelda and the Hero, or that of the seven sages. Beyond simply being skilled at barriers and seals, your magic now has the secondary effect that makes it stronger when working in concert with others. And not merely in the sense of ‘seven people cast this spell, so it’s seven times stronger’. So long as you share a strong - and hopefully positive - emotional bond with your fellow caster, you would end up with a spell up to forty nine times stronger instead of just seven times stronger.

Instead of healing the curse, it healed only part of the curse... Which promptly turned into a second, weaker, Majora’s Mask. Absolutely not according to plan. The mask has enough power to let you levitate around, some telekinesis, will make any curses you cast stronger, and one other thing.

The first ritual is but a taste of the power, the ritual to create a Doll. Dolls are reanimated replicas of people, dead or alive. They constantly burn up small amounts of mana to sustain themselves, but are otherwise completely believable and in many respects “people.” The ritual to feed them mana is also included, and the materials to create a Doll are not difficult to find all things considered. (Insert your own comments about human transmutation.) However, that’s not where the interest lies. The REAL interest lies in the Ritual of the Sabbath. You may through a half hour of preparation make a pretty wide area, about a city block, the location of a Sabbath. When a time of simultaneous day and night(Eclipses, Sundowns, Sunsets) happens, the Sabbath will occur and one of two effects of your choice will take place. You may either initiate a “White Sabbath” and have the Sabbath infuse and create Gates, or begin a “Dark Sabbath” have everyone in the Sabbath face their Phantom. By creating Gates, you’ve essentially introduced magic potential into a wide amount of people at once...even in worlds where magic doesn’t exist. They won’t be able to use it at first, but any system or method of magic becomes available to them and perhaps they’ll even develop their own if left alone. However, creating Phantoms through the Sabbath is a much more immediately rewarding from a research point of view. They are able to directly tap into the power of Magic in ways Gates alone cannot, and as magically potent beasts with unique powers and capabilities...There’s a lot of benefits to having a large number of Phantoms around for those who seek opportunity. Spare parts, a magically delicious snack, test subjects, new abilities to absorb or pure muscle...They can be a lot of things, if you’re willing to have others pay the price. Unfortunately, the Dark Sabbath has two drawbacks. The first is that the Phantoms are not loyal to you as a matter of course, and may see you as just something in their way or to be used. Secondly, not everyone in a Dark Sabbath will die and become a Phantom. Though the capability is rare, those with the strength of will to survive and become Hope can tame their Phantom and become a Wizard. While this may be a benefit if you can get their loyalty, they will often also be the type to oppose you for initiating a Dark Sabbath. (CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.) There is a “Missing Piece” to these Rituals that could complete their usefulness… Well, of course you’ve found it. When initiating a Sabbath, an additional component or two will allow you to create a Sabbath Seal on the Phantoms or Gates created in the meanwhile. Sealed Gates will already have a stronger idea of how to use their magic immediately, while Sealed Phantoms will become loyal to you (though they can break free if they are stronger than you, and Wizards will always be able to break the Seal.)"

While this grants a 10% greater chance of your endeavors succeeding or your opponents' efforts failing at any given time, you may also, once per day, guarantee the success of a single-target attack you make or guarantee that you dodge such an attack. Someone with an affinity for nature could call upon the powers of nature and strike down a storm of lightning, or someone with an affinity for love could blast a powerful chain of hearts at someone."

      "description": "Through great magical study or maybe a deal with a higher power, you have acquired the ability to rob someone of the very thing allowing their existence--a star seed, what one may call a soul. You understand the flow of the energy, and what gives a star seed the ability to project a physical body to protect itself from the corruption of the outside world. You can now rip out the star seed of someone, and use it for your own gain. When you blast someone with a special ray, A flower will bloom from the person’s forehead. Their star seed will float out for you to collect. You could use a star seed to empower yourself, create a powerful, sentient and intelligent minion out of this star seed, or use it as a great power source. Minions created with star seeds take time to create and form, and will in some way resemble their previous incarnations. Through personality, looks, or both. However, the stronger the soul, the more the victim can resist these blasts. Please see notes for further elaboration on what happens when someone has their star seed stolen."

There is theoretically no true limit on the number of powers you can hold, but the more you steal, the less time you will be able to hold it. For instance, power stolen from the Spectre would flee your grasp in mere moments, where power stolen from a normal magician could be used for hours on end. You also gain all of their knowledge relating to the use of the stolen powers. Be aware that this may also result in other odd reactions; stealing the power from a rhyming demon would compel you to speak in rhymes, for instance. Stealing power that is sufficiently alien to you may result also in catatonia or damage to your sanity. And one final thing: your clothes transform into a hybrid of yours and those of the beings you steal power from while you retain the power. Not that big of a deal, but stealing from a ton of different people may result in some horribly unfashionable outfits. You cannot use the power you steal to permanently increase your own power in any way."

You know how to tap into external sources of power, whether it be leylines, artifacts, or a group of sorcerers channeling their power to you. You can weave this power into vast spells capable of amazing things greater than the sum of its parts, and you can handle far more of this power than would otherwise be possible. But even then, it puts a great strain on your body and mind, and even you have limits - limits that it will push you past if you're not careful. Your skill with this can grow in time, allowing you to reach over truly vast distances to draw power. Should the need be great enough and you have some method of reaching out to them, you could spread your net over the whole of the world, asking thousands of magical beings and sorcerers to lend you their power. Of course, you’ll need to actually convince them to do so, but if the entire magical world was putting up a united front, you could be a valuable player in such a game. This also allows you to power magic with other forms of supernatural energy. After all, when you really get down to it, there’s not that much of a difference in the power inherent in a soul or the chi that rests within the body from the energy you use to cast your spells, is there?"

In reality, the box was a portal to an alternate universe, where everything was twisted and villains ruled the earth. In any case, this is not that box. It’s not a box at all, point of fact. This is simply a replica of the real thing, which takes the shape of a human skull – with the addition of a third eye socket in the center of the forehead and the fact that the top of the skull is removeable. Instead of leading to an alternate earth, this particular skull simply acts as a doorway to a dimension of endless pure magic. Any attempts at travelling through to this dimension will inevitable fail, but when opened, the magic will flow unceasingly from the skull – at least until it’s closed again. You can use this magical energy for whatever, from powering artifacts or rituals to simply recharging or amplifying your own power. Just so you realize, just because the amount of magic in the other dimension is infinite, the amount that can flow through at once is very much not so. After all, just because you hook a fire hydrant to the ocean doesn’t mean you can instantly flood a city, does it?"

Order magic is also capable of undoing the damage that Chaos magic and other corruptions have done, and can ward against it with near perfect ability if used preemptively. Chaos magic on the other hand is about corrupting and perverting nature and the elements to suit the user’s will, and can be used to cause plants and animals to grow in size and hostility, as well as to create powerful magical constructs to harass and attack your enemies. Chaos Magic is also capable of transmuting objects, though not into or from materials with supernatural qualities. Both types of magic allow their users to create force fields, shoot magical bolts, as well as fly. Users of Order Magic may be stronger than Dr. Fate or on par with him depending on his host, but users of Chaos Magic are much weaker than Klarion."

Legend has it that the Magisters of your Order can tear the spirit from a man and trap it forever, crush his heart within his chest with but a thought, and wither a man instantly to dust. For one as gifted as yourself in the arts of Shyish, all of these are true, and for each life reaped by your spells of death or decay, your stores of magic are replenished a small, but appreciable amount. von Draken herself would be impressed by your power over Shyish. You are become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

Typically, this falls to the disturbingly reverent and pious Seerlord - but occasionally there is one chosen by the Father of Rats, chosen to be his Herald and push skavendom into The Great Ascendancy."

For you though, this applies to anything that is offered to you, be it Rupees other Fae desire or a more traditional offering of a newborn goat or something equally silly. These offerings create an extra store of energy within you, one you can spend on anything you like. It even comes prefilled with enough energy to turn a farm boy halfway into a hero from sheer ‘blessings’ alone, as befitting your new status as a Great Fairy. Speaking of blessings, you’ve also learned how to spend this energy on people, places, even certain pieces of equipment to upgrade them. Perhaps you’ll raise the potency of his bombs, or double his own magical reserves?"

Of course, you will need something between you and the light, because as a demon it’s still the bane of your existence. If you weren’t one it would be fine, but alas. Perhaps if you were to possess a body of someone talented in the manipulation of Light magic and its derivatives? Yes, if you were to manage that, your own dark powers would surely rise.

Go back up to the Origins section, everything under Intoners now applies for you, except for a few things. First off, you don’t have to change your gender to female if you’re not. Second, ignore the uncontrollable libido thing, you don’t have to deal with that. Finally, that part about being the weakest of the Intoners? Wrong, you’re the strongest. (You still have to get the perks if you want Intoner Mode or a Disciple though.) Now that you’re the host of the Flower, you are the origin of a new batch of Intoners. This means that you’re as strong as Zero was at her most powerful. There is literally nothing a human or anything else that weak can do to harm you.Your strength, speed and Song are all boosted. Additionally, anything that actually is strong and fast enough to damage you will find their efforts for naught. Forget the healing factor and added endurance (though you still have those so, you know, don’t actually forget), the Flower straight up will not let you die. If your body is ever damaged enough that you simply can’t survive anymore, the Flower will semi-bloom until it’s the size of a man and simply spit out a bloody new body for you. Very gross, very lovecraftian. The only things that can permanently kill you now are Dragons or anything made of Dragon magic. However, the main benefit of this perk is that you now have the Flower’s ability to make new Intoners. If you choose, you can create five pseudo-clones of yourself, each an Intoner with all the power that entails. They’ll have their own personalities and hang ups just like the canon Intoners, except the unceasing lust from Zero will instead be replaced with whatever personality fault you chose to magnify when you became an Intoner. In addition, they’ll have a greater ability to resist the Flower’s influence, though not as much as you, and they won’t be suffering false memories. Maybe, if you make the effort, you can be the type of family that Zero’s Intoners only had delusions of being. You’ll need their power though, even if the whole family thing falls through. LIke I said, the Flower acts as a beacon, an advanced scout. The Grotesqueries can see you now. They’re watching you. And even if you can resist the influence of the Flower, they won’t give up. Not until they’ve exterminated humanity. They’re coming. They’ll find their way in, with or with your help. Not just here, but in every future Jump you make as well. Everywhere you go, divine vengeance and slaughter will follow. So take all that power you wanted, Jumper. I hope it was worth it. Oh, and I almost forgot. The Flower is now blossoming from one of your body parts. You can copy Zero and choose your eye or pick somewhere else. Whatever the case, you’ll sure stand out at parties."

The only way to increase their power past a certain point is to become something more or to wield powerful artifacts. For you, however, this is not the case. Not only do you start with much greater power than most, but there is no true ceiling to your growth. You will, for a time, grow in power at a meteoric rate, and then slow. But you will never reach a point where your magic cannot grow further. Just remember... the greater the power, the greater the price."

      "description": "​The Lords of Order and Chaos are powerful magical beings that were born at the dawn of time. For untold millennia, they have been locked in a metaphysical war, attempting to further the cause of Order or of Chaos. Primarily, this is accomplished by empowering mortal agents to act as proxies. The most powerful and well-known example of this is Doctor Fate -- the manifestation of Nabu, the greatest and most powerful of the Lords of Order -- who channels his power through the Helm of Fate and those who wear it. But Nabu is far from the only Lord to empower his agents through artifacts and one such item has fallen into your possession. You have some wearable object that contains the essence of a lesser Lord, whether of Chaos or Order. This item is bound to you, allowing you to summon it at-will, and when worn, grants you access to a large sum of magical power. This would be a formidable amount of power even in the hands of a mortal with none of their own, but it truly shines when worn by an already powerful being. The more powerful the person wearing the Vestments, the larger the increase in power will be. As well, when worn, the ghost of the — now long-dead — Lord will whisper into your mind, teaching you powerful magic and prompting you to follow their agenda. The ghost will be completely unable to possess you unless you allow them to do so and the possession may be revoked by you at any time. You don't have to advance their cause, but they will be much more willing to teach you if you do so. After this jump is over, you can silence the ghost or awaken it as you please. With a second purchase (discounted if the first purchase wasn’t), you may gain the Vestments opposite of the ones first purchased, but both cannot be used together. Or, in place of having one for Order and one for Chaos, you may instead spend 1600 CP (prior to discounts) to purchase Vestments containing the power of a Lord of Balance, which will be half again as powerful as either of the others and allow you to wield both Chaos and Order magic at once."

      "description": "The magic supplied to all Butchers and Slaughtermasters by the Great Maw, proof of their role as its priests and clerics. You will begin as a notably skilled wizard in this Lore, knowing a handful of spells. Anytime a spell from this Lore is successfully cast, there is a large chance that the caster will be healed of many of his injuries and gain a small but significant boost to his next casting of any magic. This Lore deals largely with the act of eating and gaining power from that act, with flesh and bone and blood and with twisting the bodies of others. The signature spell of this Lore allows the caster to empower his allies with great fortitude and willpower by devouring bones and bone marrow. Other spells include eating bones to snap the bones of your foes, devouring the hearts or muscles of strong beasts to grant that same strength to yourself or others, eating stone or metal to take on that substances durability, forcing horrific nightmares into the minds of any foe near you by devouring a piece of a brain or skull or even taking on or granting to others the traits of monsters or beings of whom you consume for a time, such as granting the regeneration of a troll to yourself and your companions. Truly gifted Gut Mages can even summon the Great Maw beneath their foes, or at least a small incarnation of it, to swallow up and devour any caught in its immense gullet. This Lore, as with any other Lore in this world, is subject to the Winds of Chaos. At any time, the strength of magic may wax or wane at random, forcing the user to adapt rather than try to force it to obey them. If they are truly unlucky, the Winds will turn against them, resulting in some horrid accident that may even cause the user’s death. But that’s only for the unlucky ones."

You, as an inducted Gray Seer, have begun plumbing the depths of the Great Horned Rat’s two wonderfully vicious lores: The Lores of Ruin & Plague.

From this Lore come such spells as The Vermintide, or the manipulation of Warp Lightning. The Lore of Plagues comes from the Horned Rat’s title as Harbinger - and though it rends a toll upon the caster’s body, the manipulation of disease, pox, and cancer alike allows one to even infect the very earth itself with diseased ichor and make poison rain down from the skies."

      "description": "Arcana are the various expressions of supernal truths in the fallen world. Specifically, they represent a given branch or type of magic that a Mage may specialize in. The various ranks of mastery displayed below denote the level of a given type of spell a Mage is able to cast. Higher level spells require higher Gnosis to use and will likely cost more mana to cast/maintain. It should be noted however that the higher ones Gnosis and the higher the level of spells they have access to, the greater the chance of causing a paradox is. The effects of magic that cause the greatest and most wondrous effects (i.e. creating earthquakes o granting a machine sentience) all risk paradox and may result in a backlash even against an experienced Mage. For this reason overt expressions of magic are denoted as “vulgar” whereas the subtle effects that do not cause paradox are called “covert”. You receive the first two ranks in your ruling arcana for free and may choose one free rank in any other arcanum. Death- 1. Initiate: You may discern the specter of the grave from its grossest to its most rarefied. You may see and speak with ghosts both resting and unquiet. You catch glimpses of death and can tell when others are near death themselves. You have begun the practice of shaping ectoplasm and so long as it is available may contort it to your will. You gain the basic powers of manipulating existing shadows for concealment. 2. Apprentice: You may alter a corpse, changing its apparent cause of death. You may summon ghosts, entreating their friendship or castigating them. You may conjure ectoplasm (the substance the dead use to manifest in the physical plane) from nothing. You may even draw the objects held by ghostly apparitions into the world for a short time. You may cause steel to rust and wood to rot. Your mastery of shadow and concealment increases allowing you to hide even from other Awakened. 3. Disciple: When you speak, the dead head your commands. You may temporarily walk in the realm of ghosts (twilight) and may temporarily will yourself to enter a state of death, as well as to rouse yourself from this temporary death at a later time. You may call up lifeless corpses from their burial grounds to serve as soldiers or servants. Steel and stone may crumble beneath your grasp. While a heinous act, you may choose to devour the spirits of the dead and dying to regain strength and mana. With great effort, you may be able to pull the souls of the living out of their spiritually unprotected bodies, leaving them devoid of vigor and passion. 4. Adept: You may chain the dead and ghosts to this world, forcing them to exist in their now rotting shell. You may walk in the worlds of ghosts and end the lives of normal humans with a well placed word. You may place the shadow of death upon the living, making them appear dead on nearly every level of existence. If your need is dire and your morals are questionable, you may steal the souls of others and bind them within yourself. 5. Master: Death is all too familiar to you now. You may consume the souls of both the living and the dead, restoring your willpower, physical health and mystical energies with each feeding. You may obliterate even powerful magical constructs or destroy spells with a touch. You may call upon the dead from thousands of years ago to do your bidding and answer your questions. Fate- 1. Initiate: You may perceive the way the subtle strings of destiny alters the lives of others. You may tell if an action is one of destiny, or if destiny is to be thwarted by free will. You may detect the relative fortune a given soul carries, how lucky they have been and how lucky they will be in the future. You may also detect where, when and how a prophecy was uttered, and how it will impact the world around it, if at all. 2. Apprentice: You are able to subtly alter the threads of fortune, allowing you to make good actions more likely to happen to good people, and misfortune more likely to befall the unrighteous. Oaths you swear and fortunes you tell are more likely to be upheld or come to pass, as fate shifts ever so subtly in your favor. Even the mundane affairs of daily life may plague you less, letting you ward yourself against the inconveniences and happenstance that drive salary workers mad. 3. Disciple: You may use your spells to improve the luck and happenstance of the tools, garments and vehicles of your allies, making them more likely to function well in their given task. Similarly, you may curse the objects of your enemies, making them more likely to break or malfunction at inopportune moments. Your workings become more resistant to other fate-­manipulating entities, and with effort you may slightly shift destiny or twist sanctified oaths. 4. Adept: You are now able to manipulate vows and contracts with ease. You may send the soulless and lifeless to their destined end, and convey the fortune of treasures, and the bane of curses as you please. You may break the chains that bind one spirit to another (both literally and figuratively), emancipating all with your power. 5. Master: You may change the destined path of nearly anyone with enough power. You may through manipulation of destiny, make a pauper into a statesmen, or lay low people of influence from their high office. Miracles and plagues in equal measure may be accomplished, as the dice of coincidence, luck and fate align under your spellcraft. Forces- 1. Initiate: Through your magic, you may perceive the invisible physical forces which surround us. The flow of gravity, the passage of invisible light, the waves of sound, the tumultuous nature of heat and all other kinetic energy sources are laid bare to you. Perhaps you may subtly manipulate this energy to deliver a message to a person far away, a letter whispered on the winds. 2. Apprentice: You may now maneuver some of these unseen energies to your will. You may hide others from sight by bending the light around them, or slightly drain the kinetic force of lethal blows before they strike you. Through your magic you may conjure light, heat or sound and make them flourish or diminish as you please. 3. Disciple: You may transform some of the raw energies in the universe into other forms, making light become heat, or heat into a kinetic strike. Your magic is strong enough that you may maintain your invisibility even while in motion, and can control electricity and fire at a distance. 4. Adept: You may create thunder and fire from nothing. You may strike down at enemies with conjured thunderbolts and may control the weather if you are strong enough. You may call rain and winds on a clear sunny day, or bring a brief drought amidst a monsoon. Your spells may even let you move at the speed of winds, and turn bullets aside. 5. Master: You may harness the fury of the storm and earthquake, unleashing them accordingly as you desire. Even the fundamental force of gravity is under your control. You may create a miniature facsimile of a sun and outright destroy the mundane technology of sleepers. You may fly through the air as the legendary gods of old and halt bullets in mid­air. Life- 1. Initiate: You may perceive the trillions of invisible microscopic lives that share our world. Your magic allows you to nullify poison, and detect any ailment within a someone's body. 2. Apprentice: You may manipulate your own life force to an extent, using your magic to heal yourself and dispel ailments. You may use such powers on small lower lifeforms as well (cats, dogs etc.) and may completely dominate the least of living creatures, bending insects to your will. You may manipulate your flesh, strengthening your bones and hardening your skin, making yourself more resistant to damage. 3. Disciple: Higher orders of beasts will now head your mystical commands, including snakes, reptiles, dogs and cats etc. You may throw literal barbs grown from your skin at enemies, and may mend the injuries of allies. You may change your own shape within the limits of human possibility, as well as the shapes of simple animals. If you desire, you may reshape your face entirely. You may adapt yourself to your environment, using magic to make yourself grow swifter, stronger or more enduring as needed. 4. Adept: You may change your form into that of a bird or a beast or change your normal appearance as other people would change clothes. You may change lesser beasts into greater versions of themselves (Cats into tigers, dogs into direwolves etc.) and assert your control over them. The forms of your fellow human beings are similarly mutable to you. If necessary you may even stimulate their various secretory glands and hormone production to influence their behavior and urges. 5. Master: You may wear any shape with equal ease, and transform yourself into nearly any biologically possible form that you could envision With enough time, care and application of your craft, you may even create an entirely new species, or elevate existing creatures to take on the forms of mythic creatures (transforming a lion into a griffon or a snake into a basilisk). Lesser creatures may be raised up to the intellect and capacity of humans and even humans may be manipulated with enough effort through the application of your life­-controlling spells. Some may even fear you as a deity, for you possess the magic to create life itself. Matter- 1. Initiate: You may gaze into raw matter, and see the intricacies of an atom’s dance, knowing at sight one material from another, as well as if any mystical effects have been cast on it. You may more easily see the strengths and flaws within material objects or tools, and gain the first insights you need in how to reproduce them. 2. Apprentice: You may improve the craftsmanship of simple devices; causing swords and hammers to have perfect balance or weight. You may shape water or rain drops as well, or engage in truly biblical transformations, changing a glass of water into aged wine, or even coffee. 3. Disciple: With a bit of time, preparation and well crafted spells, you may render iron as soft and warm as butter, or as easy to manipulate as clay. You may transmute mud into steel or render glass as strong as stone. . 4. Adept: Just as you can create matter from mana, so too may you destroy it. At will you can create and destroy wood, rock and even diamond, though the size and value of such objects will require greater effort, time and mana. You may even manipulate air itself causing it to be solid, forming invisible cages. Your art has now propelled you above the concerns of lesser man, allowing you to perform the long sought parlor trick of changing base metals into gold. 5. Master: You may create alloys beyond the knowledge of ordinary men, and create elements not found on the periodic table. You may make objects grow or shrink at will, and may even annihilate powerful and durable magical artifacts. Mind-­ 1. Initiate: Through your magic you are able to sense the conscious minds around you, determining their emotional state and focus at a glance. You may tell if a person’s mind is disciplined or untrained as well as whether or not they are capable of psychic feats. Even disembodied but thinking consciousnesses are visible under your gaze. You may partition your thoughts, decreasing the processing power of your mind, but allowing you to follow two cognitive pathways at the same time. Perhaps if you are studious enough you may even touch the mind of the world itself. 2. Apprentice: You may speak into the minds of others, conveying information without the use of speech. You may control the actions of simple creatures, insects, reptiles and the like. You may defend your consciousness from hostile intrusion, and cordon off portions of your mind, preventing even you from accessing certain information. You may shift the perception of an enemy slightly, making them misjudge distance or target non­vital areas in a combat situation. 3. Disciple: You may now enter a deeper realm of consciousness through meditation; delving into the subconscious level of your mind and perhaps beyond. You may understand the meaning of the words someone speaks, regardless of their language. You may protect the minds of others from harm or detection. You may even strike at a person’s psychic presence, and in turn harm them bodily. Your mind may be divided even further without loss of processing power, allowing you to concentrate on multiple things at once without detriment to any of them. Alternatively you may fortify your own thoughts and capabilities and act as master of your own fantasies, whether dreaming or awake. 4. Adept: You are now a medium between your own internal self and the otherness that composes all minds. You may traverse this distance, entering into another’s memories, dreams or conscious thoughts, all of which are as tangible to you as solid matter..and just as easily manipulated. You may confound the senses of others and even turn the mind against the body, destroying it from the inside out. 5. Master: You may wander out, through your mind, into the Realms Invisible. You may forge a psyche out of nothingness and alter any aspect of consciousness you desire. If you wish you could walk for a time in the flesh of another, possessing their body and acting in their stead. You may manipulate the substance of the immaterial world and compel obedience from any mind you are capable of ensnaring. Prime- 1. Initiate: You may perceive raw mana, and by extension magic in its untouched state. You are always aware when magic is being cast and where it interacts or intersects with all other things. You may see through mystical illusions as they are made of mana and so always look like mana to you. 2. Apprentice: You may manipulate raw mana for a variety of uses. You may force a spell or mystical artifact to yield its purpose, function and proper use. You may also transcribe your own mystical knowledge (and those of others) into grimoires for use by others of the mystical persuasion. 3. Disciple: You may enchant material objects in numerous fantastic manners depending on your other arcana. You may craft illusions out of raw magic that will fool sleepers and inattentive mages. You may give form and substance to mana, making the immaterial, material, at least for a time. You may use spells to draw mana from the environment into yourself, empowering you further. If the need is dire, you may unleash your raw mana in the unique form of celestial fire. 4. Adept: Your spells may now be used to rend the magic of your enemies into nothingness, or allow you to feed on the mana hidden even in base materials. You are suffused with raw magic, and may sculpt it into any shape you desire, or command it as one would a trained animal. You may revitalize extinguished natural nexi of mystical energies or drain similar places of their power. 5. Master: You may create a simulacrum of a human beings, animated by your power and subject to all of your commands. You may steal the mystical energies from others through your spellcraft, and use it to your own ends. You may create Hallows; nexi of mystical energy, though this requires great effort. Alternatively you may instead create mystical dead zones where no mage may regain their expended energy. Space- 1. Initiate: You may view the tapestry of space and can discern the location of nearby hidden things, assuming you know what you are looking for. You are aware when others have tampered with space, such as when one has teleported or created a portal. You may even trace sympathetic connections, determining the strength and emotional weight held between people and objects. 2. Apprentice: You have found a means to cast spells far beyond the limits of your vision, able to scry distant locations and affect targets remotely at a much reduced effect. This is possible so long as you possess something of sympathetic significance. Similarly, you may guard your own home from similar scrying and sympathetic attack. If you possess the appropriate corresponding arcana, you may even transport small objects (matter) energies (forces) or living beings (life) through miniscule portals. 3. Disciple: You may ward your sanctum against intrusion, forbidding entrance to certain objects, creatures or individuals, for space itself bares their passage. You may see into many places at once as well as binding or severing sympathetic connections as you are able. If you desire it, you may use your magics to transform a door into a portal to nearly anywhere else in the world. 4. Adept: You are very nearly unbound in space. You may be in more than one place at once, with the aid of appropriate arcana, though your spatial doppelgangers may never meet. You may use the threads of space to entangle enemies or bind them to a given location. You may travel without motion, disappearing and reappearing as you cross the illusion of distance. If necessary you may step into the gap between spaces, waiting in an impermanent tiny universe until you are needed. 5. Master: You are able to alter the amount of space an object takes up, reducing a house to the size of a cat, or making a lonely road stretch out near infinitely. Just as you are able to be in several places at once, so to may you draw objects, places and even other people into a similar disassociated state of being; allowing them to be in more than one place at the same time. You may conceal locations within gaps in space, and twist the bonds of it to ensure that no mortal is ever able to find it. If you desire, you may ensnare others in twisting roads and winding paths with neither origin or destination. Spirit- 1. Initiate: You are able to view the comings and goings of spirits; quasi­-sentient manifestations or personifications of the various phenomena in the world (both natural and man­made). You are able to tell if they exist in a state of twilight or if they are possessing a living host. You are able to see and determine the relative strength of the gauntlet (the barrier between the mortal and spiritual realms) and may communicate with spirits as though you were one of them. 2. Apprentice: You may communicate with spirits as you would beings of flesh and blood, as well as convince them to do your bidding. You may strengthen or decrease the strength of the gauntlet in a given area temporarily, and may affect beings in twilight with your own hands. 3. Disciple: You are now able to enter into twilight, awaken sleeping spirits in base matter or unintelligent life. You may mend damage that spirits may have taken and cast out both dark spirits and ghosts, as well as shield yourself from possession. You may also forge a bond with a spiritual familiar, and benefit from it more so than other mages. 4. Adept: You can imprison spirits, binding them into matter or flesh as needed. You may guide neophyte mages in obtaining familiars for their own and may traverse through the gauntlet and into the realm of spirits. 5. Master: You are able to raise or lower the gauntlet with relative ease. Amongst spirits, they regard you with high esteem as a member of the aristocracy. You may shape the substance of spirits, altering existing forms and even giving birth to new spiritual entities. If you desire, you may give these spirits a physical shell with which to explore the mortal realm. You may travel between the various levels of reality within the world of darkness (save of course the supernal realms), though this is an inherently dangerous power as there is no guarantee you will be able to return. Time- 1. Initiate: You become aware of the march of time, able to tell how much of it has passed without the need of traditional timekeeping devices. You may also recognize when others have impeded or altered the flow of time around you. 2. Apprentice: You may view the recent past in an area and are more able to suss out future events, your words bordering on prophecy. Your manipulation of time may extend ever so slightly to protect your person, granting a few nanoseconds more to recognize or evade a deadly strike. Similarly, your identity may be protected from others who use the flow of time for their own gains. By expending mystical energy and effort, you may see the immediate results of your actions before you take them, thus choosing a more wise path. 3. Disciple: You are able to strike with preternatural speed and rob certain enemies of their swiftness. In moments of great importance, you may use your magic to reverse your immediate actions, taking a slightly different path than you would have seconds earlier. You look into the uncertain future with the eyes of a seer. 4. Adept: You are able to step outside of time, a place without any flow save for its own impermanence. You see both what will, and might be, and how it might come to pass. You are able to alter the flow of time, allowing you to step ahead to hours or perhaps days in the future. You may never travel backwards. 5. Master;: You are able to spin time as needed, creating “faerie glades” in which time moves much faster or much slower within them than outside. It is possible that you may be able to capture a person within the flow of time itself, holding them in stasis temporarily. A mage may temporarily alter their personal history in a given world (within reason), choosing to play baseball instead of chess and gaining all the benefits and consequences such a choice would have on their person (but not to the rest of the world). This change is only temporary and may never affect your soul/mystical abilities or other supernatural powers. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (One Dot) - Mage: The Awakening first.)"

Of course, there’s also a field of magic for any element you can think of and more, such as Fire and Earth magic, and even Nature magic and Technomancy exist. You can also pick two affinities to start off with at 5%. Affinities, in case you don’t know yet, can be literally anything. If something exists, it has a mana signature. And if something has a mana signature, the signature can be forged (cultivated) and controlled. Be it an affinity for life, fur, time, leaves, bark, a specific fetish, or something more abstract like luck, order, madness, or chaos, the variety of affinities is truly endless."

Doing so is as easily as “drawing” it from a convenient shadow or trench coat, and is even easier if the conjurer is highly familiar with the weapon in question. This ritual is not without fault, however. The affected weapon can be no larger than a shotgun or a large sword, and summoning almost always fails when performed in front of unbelievers, but a skilled or subtle sorcerer can offset the later restriction.

Trained since childhood by the Fey Enchantress and her fairy helpers, you know quite a fair amount of magic and have quite some skill in it too. You have the choice of picking from one of three Lores of Magic to learn from for your starter. The Lore of Heavens, the Lore of Life or the Lore of Beasts. The lore of Beasts has dealings with animals, enhancing or transforming the body of the self or others and with some forms of monsters, particularly the more natural sorts. You may pick one to be a well-studied and experienced user of and it will cost 100CP more for each Lore extra you want to pick up at this level of proficiency."

Alas, for a halfling to be able to overcome their resistance and be able to wield even one of the Winds of Magic is a monumental effort. You’re one of the few halflings to have done so, becoming an Enchanter. Select one of the Lores taught by the Imperial Colleges of Magic: Fire, Beasts, Heavens, Light, Life, Metal, or Shadow (as unfortunately, due to proximity to Sylvania the idea of a halfling practicing the Lore of Death is a nigh impossibility). You know a marginal amount of its beginning spells such as how to generate fireworks with the Lore of Fire, or quickening the growth of barley and fruits with Life. Unfortunately due to the Halfling magic resistance, the Winds of Magic just refuse to accumulate near you long enough to use any stronger spells. After your decade in this realm is over, that particular downside goes away luckily enough."

You may purchase this again, discounted for Mage but not free, for an additional Element per purchase. The Fire Element can be used to create waves of flame and small explosions at will, both excellent for initial damage and damage over time. The Water Element may not seem like much at first, conjuring crashing waves of water to push or pull foes and such, but your control over the water you create could grant you additional advantages. Like slowly enclosing foes in layer after layer of water that, at your will would slow them down as well as apply pressure upon foes. The Earth Element is useful in its ability to produce blunt, but easy to manipulate, effects. Tearing up hunks of the ground and throwing them around would be easy. While simple it is dangerously effective and without any fancy tricks it makes up for it in impact. The Wind Element is very good for crowd control and utility. Blades of air are damaging but the primary power of Wind is the sheer force behind it, able to drag any foe not thrice your own size towards you or creating whirlwinds that you can use to retrieve objects or spin around enemies to daze them. The Element of Darkness is a powerful additive that can easily be mixed into the other four Elements to create stronger effects, almost twice as strong in most cases, however on it’s own it merely creates wells of darkness that can deal no damage of note. This allows you to use any of the various magical items of Zelda without any teaching, have a perfect knowledge of your mana pool, and grants you a slight boost in generic mana pool size."

      "description": "Magic is incredibly prevalent among the more powerful enemies and allies you’ll meet during your stay. As an up and coming Sorcerer or Sorceress yourself, it’d be silly to be without it, now wouldn’t it? The magic of this world is capable of quite a few things and feats. The most basic application is transforming magic into one of a few elements like light, darkness, fire, lightning or water as examples to combat enemies or for normal utility. Magic is also capable of enhancing objects or manipulating magical objects and things. This can be used to reinforce an object’s toughness, animate things such as commanding the pages of a magic tome to fly out at your direction, willing magical relics to activate and work on command and so on. Lastly, magic is able to summon familiar objects or people from far away, as well as conjure objects out of thin air. Conjuration is quite difficult without intimate familiarity in what you’re trying to fabricate however, more so if you want some form of permanence in it. Magic runs off of stamina and knowledge for the most part, with greater feats being more taxing. While the basic principles of magic are bundled into the Sorcerer/Sorceress origin, this perk allows you to leap ahead with your knowledge in elemental manipulation and master an element of your choice."

The strength of the shield depends on how much magic you use, meaning it can potentially stand up to the Demon Lord himself, if only for a time. The second is a simple ‘bomb’ technique, creating a ball of energy that explodes with a great deal of force after a moment or two - or a second or two. The last is a Sheikah technique, using magical power to enhance one’s physical strength. Punch harder to make your foes go down... Or run away faster.

The required steps to do so are to send out your mana to connect to an element, attuning your mana to match said element as closely as possible, and then cycling it by pulling just a little bit of mana from the element and assimilating it with your own. Even “finding” the mana of an affinity besides the main seven elements can be extremely hard. Gravity and Time might be all around you, but it’s not easy at all to pick them out of the all the mana types swirling around you. In this kind of endeavor though, you’ve got a bit of a leg up on others. You have an “affinity” of sorts for cultivating affinities - or rather, integrating yourself with, studying, and manipulating nature. With a bit of meditation and some time, you can easily identify whatever there is in your surroundings, even obscure mana types such as Order or Chaos that would normally be nigh-impossible to cultivate without finding a major source of them first. Even cultivating Time mana anywhere you want would be possible for you, though quite a bit slower than if you were near a large source of it, such as by speeding your personal time up by a few million times through the attraction of time mana, considering how spread out it is over the universe. Still, just the fact that you are able to do so at all without resorting to methods like that could make a few people jealous. Once you have an affinity, you’ll also find it easier to manipulate its element, make it seemingly moving on its own volition to follow your commands, and having to use less mana to control it. And don’t think that this skill is limited to helping you with Druid skills like World Casting or training affinities. A Mage could just as easily study nature to come up with highly efficient spells imitating it, and a Rogue would find it helping make their illusions seem more natural and difficult to see through. It’ll help you with all other abilities that work with or through nature as well."

They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over it, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing “hello world” and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience.Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it’s bashing someone’s head in with the “Force” rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold.

Furthermore, mermaid songs at night often contain potent curses that vary between the victims; pirates hallucinate and see old enemies, birds and other flying beings start flying upside down as they lose their sense of up and down, and fairies transform into bats. For the magic to take effect, the victims must be able to hear the song; if they are able to avoid hearing it, they won’t be ensnared. The range of the song depends on the acoustics, but at most has at most the radius of half a mile. Also, the strength of the effect is split between all listeners, and therefore dilutes with a large audience. On the other hand, every voice added to the chorus strengthens the song’s power, and moonlight strengthens the magic night effects.

Effects from these runes/glyphs when triggered include but are not limited to: negating all magic in the area, causing fire (under daylight) or necrotic (under moonlight) damage, teleporting people away, and dropping the temperature to below freezing. With this perk, you also gain the ability to more easily build structures into surfaces that would otherwise be difficult, such as a dungeon under a sandy beach."

All of your magic abilities purchased in this jump are amplified by this perk twofold, to the point where even your basic White Magic attacks are complex and capable of causing potent damage to a potential foe. Even magic purchased outside of this jump is slightly amplified by this ability, if only in raw power. In addition, movement-restricting magic becomes much more potent. (CG Note: The next part of this perk requires You’re Blue Now - Undertale first.) With You're Blue Now, you can manipulate your opponent's gravity based on your perspective- You can force them to the ground, send them flying up in the air, or careening to the left or right. While this technique is potent, it does have a maximum range of around 10 meters, at which point your opponent just lands on the air as if it were a solid surface. It's also very draining and can exhaust the user quickly if overused. (CG Note: The next part of this perk requires It’s Not Easy Being Green - Undertale first.) With It's Not Easy Being Green, your opponent gains two independent shields they must manipulate- And your ability to output attacks doubles. You may now attack from two directions at once, forcing your opponent to concentrate on two avenues of attack instead of just one. (CG Note: The next part of this perk requires Purple Suits You - Undertale first.) With Purple Suits You, your opponent's movement is further restricted to the intersections and vertices of your web- Attempting to move along the web instead zips them to the next intersection. Use this to your advantage and set up traps for them."

      "description": "Each fairy is born with an innate talent that defines her role in Neverland and what sort of magic she has. If you do not buy a talent, you will get a lot of strange looks from your fellow fairies. The power of the talent is proportional to your size. It is possible to teach your talent(s) to others, though it will take quite some time for them to learn anything more than minor little tricks (it’s easier when you are teaching people with innate affinity for your talent); in turn, you might be able to learn a couple things from other talents, but not nearly as much as you would with it as your talent. Also, your control over your talent is enhanced with the One Feeling at a Time perk. Shoot the Birdie! lets you take leadership over people who specialize in/practice your talent. Fairies can either purchase a talent of their choice from the list with a discount on the price or, for free, roll a 1d9 to determine their talent. In the case that you roll a 9, you instead get a common talent such as laundry or table-setting; you will become highly skilled in your respective talents and now find the activity highly relaxing and blissful, but your abilities are more mundane than the rare talents offered below. You may purchase more than one talent if you wish. When purchasing additional talents, you need not roll; you can simply select the talent(s) you want for the discounted price. Other backgrounds can purchase a talent for the full price, but they must roll a 1d9 to determine which talent they receive. When purchasing additional talents, you need not roll; you can simply select the talent(s) you want. 1. Tinker- Tinkers are master craftsmen and women when they put their mind to it, and can make priceless works out of mere scraps. Interestingly, the trade of the tinkers requires them to work with iron often, yet they have no issue with the metal. While all Neverland fairies are immune to iron’s effects on the fae, after the jump you will be immune to any negative mystical effects that iron might have on you, as well as any other metals that affect fairies. In addition, your talent gives you increased skill at finding utility in almost any material you obtain, even scraps thrown away as trash by others. 2. Animal- You can speak to any small animal in its native tongue and sense their emotions, allowing you to understand its condition and its needs. Therefore, you are responsible for looking after the smaller animals throughout Neverland. Like the animals you tend, you have a heightened sense of smell and hearing, and are a good tracker. In addition, animals know many shortcuts and hidden passageways that you can access and gain safe passage through. The talent also gives you increased skill in teaching/domesticating wild animals and finding good uses for their special skills (without harming them). 3. Garden- You can sense the needs of plants and imbue them with magic to grow. By producing just a speck of pixie dust, you can make a plant grow and blossom instantly. Moreover, just by examining a plant you can identify its key qualities and needs. You are also able to train small bugs such as worms and bees to help take care of your plants. Plus, you have a good sense of balance – which will come in handy when you need to carry half a dozen berries on your head. 4. Water- You have control over water, alter it between solid, gaseous, and liquid states, and form it into various animal shapes or even into fountains. You can send special messages in bubbles that only pop open to reveal the message for the intended recipient. In addition, you can find hidden sources of water. Being filled with so much water in their hearts, water fairies tend to cry whenever they feel strong emotions, whether happy or sad. You also know the “language of water” to communicate to a degree with any bit of water, which may enhance other water abilities you have (see Ocean Secrets). 5. Kitchen- Technically, the kitchen talents are subdivided among over 25 individual talents ranging from baking to scullery, but you have a knack for kitchens in general. And for fairies, given their small size and the lack of modern amenities in Neverland, chefs are greatly valued for their ability to make delicious foods from almost anything. You have not only increased ability at finding useful ingredients, but you can produce tasty replicas of normal recipes using any available resources – even if it shouldn’t make sense to be able to make pastries solely from things you collected from a nearby tree, but somehow you can; this does not apply when the food being replicated consists of just one primary ingredient, such as roast chicken or corn on the cob. Furthermore, you have an instinctual knowledge of existing cuisines and cooking techniques for your location, though it’s always good to experiment. Also, as you make the foods with magic, you can often bless your masterpieces with special enhancements. 6. Light- All fairies are surrounded by light, but you are one of the brightest. Fortunately, such is the source of your power, and you can control the light around you accordingly. You can bend and move light around as you desire, and even create rainbows with the help of water fairies. You can also enhance yourself with light, such as turning yourself bright red to burn through things in your path (it works better when you’re mad). You can temporarily imbue individuals with light as well (this is normally limited to fireflies, but feel free to experiment). The strength of your light magic depends on the phase of the moon, being the brightest when the moon is full; even so, your power over light is still fairly strong even at the lowest phase of the moon. On a related note, you are born with an innate understanding of the stars in the sky, improving your interactions with stars if you also took Star-Talker. Said to have “bright” personalities, light fairies are energetic perfectionists who enjoy the spotlight quite literally. 7. Wind- You have power over the wind, and can produce anything from breezes to mini-tornadoes – and full- sized tornadoes once you get to a human’s size. The wind also gives you enhanced speed; considering that even normal fairies, ever-filled with boundless energy, can open every drawer and turn every pocket inside-out in a bedroom by the time you’ve read this far into the sentence, a wind fairy can fly as fast as the quickest wind, such that you can reach subsonic speeds. 8. Art- You are constantly inspired to produce various works of art, but your greatest strength lies in painting. For you, painting is not merely a physical skill, but a magical one, as you can literally determine the color of things by painting them. Any change you make to a target’s color becomes its true, permanent color unless you use a new paint. The colors will also enhance certain traits and strengths of the subject depending on the symbolism; for instance, blue embodies depth and stability, while orange represents joy and excitement. And if the colors should belong on something else, it can become that thing; for instance, painting stripes on a horse makes it a zebra, and painting a dome brown or white could turn it into an earthy hill or an igloo respectively. This ability also allows you to change the seasons by painting leaves either green or orange; once you paint enough of them the same color, the world will conclude that it must be time for that season and change accordingly."

      "description": "he Soul - a part of the Aura that allows it to absorb memories and grow over time. As it is the liveliness that exists in all living things, not just sentient races possess souls, but animals and plants too. The only intelligent beings without souls are “mere” machines such as androids, for whom the only way to grow stronger is to upgrade their software and hardware, though they can be changed into Deus Ex or other machine races by granting them a soul. Which is something that you can now easily do, along with oh so many other things. You see, levels and experience are simply an abstraction of the strength of someone’s soul. When you kill monsters or people, you take a small part of their souls, roughly five percent of it, which becomes the experience you gain. And when you learn new things or simply increase your stats through training, your soul also grows and gains experience. Though in the latter case, you wouldn’t gain stat points to spend after a certain point (about 1-2 stat points per level) as instead of using the growth of your soul as fuel to strengthen parts of yourself, your soul grew through said strengthening. So, another way to describe Soul Arts would be “Experience Control”. You could, for example, revive a dead person in the 24h windows before their soul disappears, or hold their soul in place to use it for other things, but it would cost either you or the person experience. Beyond that, you can impart your own experience onto others, easily fight souls and soul-type creatures, guard your soul against attacks, or create Skill Shards. And if you were a slightly shadier kind of guy, you could absorb someone’s soul to gain their levels, memories, and skills. And, luckily enough for you, doing this won’t cause you to go mad or turn into a monster! If you don’t want to do that, though, there’s yet another avenue open to a Soul Artist for growing stronger. You can instead pull the full soul out of a creature you killed, purify it of all its memories and personality, and gain vastly more experience than you would’ve otherwise gotten, though still less than if you had absorbed the whole thing. Another use of the same skill would be to purify a soul and then put it back into the creature’s body after healing it, to bring it back without any memories of its former life, becoming essentially a newborn baby. This is often how users of Soul Arts get powerful creatures as their pets, as they are able to easily tame them afterwards. At this point, it should be clear to you that the power of this ability is truly limitless, the above skills just some examples: whether it is reading someone’s level with a glance by discerning the luminosity of their soul, putting a soul into an item to create a Growth Weapon, shedding your physical body and only living as a soul, or quite literally anything else to do with the soul, as long as you put in the practice, experiment enough, and get a lucky insight or two, you’ll be able to do it all. Even creating souls wholesale instead of having to use the soul essence of creatures you slay would become a possibility for you after reaching the lofty heights of the Legend rank and knowing everything there is to know about the nature of souls."

      "description": "Magic is a force that has certainly fascinated people since it was conceptualized in the annals of history. Now that Neolife exists and magic will soon come to thrive in the real world, is it a surprise that it will capture the hearts of many more? No, of course not. And it is this fascination that has brought an interesting revelation to light. Namely, that there is something more to magic than Arcane and Runic magic. Those are called “unique” abilities people can develop. Each is essentially a new type of magic, and anyone can develop one if they have sufficient patience and imagination. Although this new magic can be powerful, it has to be developed manually, each new aspect to it added one at a time. That is what sets it apart from Arcane magic, where you can easily come up with new spells following the same concept. A few examples will be provided in the Notes. Now, this wouldn’t allow you to just do something like the ability to use laser eyes from scratch. As mentioned above, each ability has to be developed block by block. It essentially lets you expand upon already existing abilities, bring them up to a new level, or make them branch out into entirely different areas. Extremely simple things like Aura Sight or enhancing your body in different ways would only require the ability to control mana and infusing it into the relevant body parts, but more powerful abilities would have stricter prerequisites and training regimes. If the ability you want to create involves an item, for example, you need to be completely familiar with its physical form, to the point where you could imagine it in its entirety in a split second, usually done by using a VR device to create it in a test world, and then slowly studying it, taking it apart and putting it together again and again, while also training with something like Origin magic to instantly create matter, starting with small and simple things, then working your way up. After all that is done, you would be able to create said item with a thought, instantly and reflexively, and be able to work on and enhance it further. Now, that’s actually something anyone can do with some time, so it’s nothing all that special. What sets you apart from the masses is that you can do the same thing with anything in your arsenal. You are able to mix and match any amount of perks, abilities, skillsets or techniques to create something new, or propel them to new heights by stubbornly training. And no matter what your capabilities are, you will always know just how to advance them in any possible way, possessing a sort of instinctive knowledge of what your training should focus on."

Even if it costs as much as you have at full or more, you can get one standard use out free. Do note that this will only work with spells that have set energy costs. If something could be charged forever or works based on how much energy you put in, the best you’d get is the minimum energy use of that spell. The second way we’re encouraging you is the ability to pay large amounts of energy to cast spells that are normally usable only a few times per day.

In fact, when training in martial pursuits, you easily learn at five times the rate of a normal man. In addition, your experience grants you one of the below sub-trees. -The Paladin tree allows you a further boost in your physical might, double what the base capstone granted you. In addition to this, you gain a great talent for manipulating electricity, a middling talent for support magic, and a small talent for fire magic. You might fire giant electric bolts, or empower your strength to even greater heights than before, and maybe make an occasional fireball. Whatever you do, you are made for killing zombies. -The Captain tree grants a wide skill set. First, you’re skilled in the art of leading soldiers in combat situations with efficiency and speed, allowing you to storm a large and highly equipped insurgent village and eradicate everyone there within minutes with only a dozen or so mildly experienced soldiers. But the big part of where you shine is your elementless support magic.

They are costly however, so you can’t just hand them out like candy. Lastly, you know a few poison-based spells. -The Judge tree first bestows you with knowledge of shadow and ice magic, though primarily ice magic, with a particular bent towards capture and debuffs. You could use your ice to freeze enemies in place, and use your shadow magic to weaken your enemies in order to reduce their struggle. But the real place you shine is in your strength and durability, with strength enough to flip a tank with small effort and durability enough to take a tank round to the chest and only feel a bit bruised."

But before we get into the meat of what you can do right now, let’s start off with a few bonuses. First off, you learn magic about thrice as fast as before, and not only that but are about twice as magically powerful as you would be otherwise. This applies to other magic systems too, though it does fall off with more esoteric systems. - The Baron tree is for those out there who hate being a productive member of society. To begin with, you have an immense talent for manipulation, such that a wanted criminal could throw on a loose mask and jacket and begin a cult with their victim’s families as the members within a month. Second, you also have a good talent for shadow magic. You have a few high-quality buffs and debuffs in your arsenal should someone see through your bullcrap, and you have a moderate strength boost in case you run out of Focus. No, you do not get the ability to control zombies. This doesn’t make you Baron Brixius, it was just based on him. - The Deceiver tree is a bit more classic. You have absolutely grand talent for Shadow and Lightning magic, and a bit of raw Cosmic aligned attacks. And the shadows are not just simply the debuffs the other trees use so often, but actual attacks as well. And this is the biggest thing you’ve got, you by far outshine the other trees in this with your sheer skill and raw power. You could throw electric bolts that match actual lightning strikes in power, throw great beams of darkness that shatter concrete like glass, and shoot arcane bolts that act like high-power grenades. Keep in mind that even though you are powerful, your Focus supply isn’t infinite and you don’t have much in the way of physical attacks. - The Shaman tree gives a lot of needed variety. You’ve got a bit of everything. Fire, Ice, Electricity, Cosmic, non-elemental, buffs and debuffs, the whole nine yards. Your selection is above average but none of it will be enough to match the other skill trees. You do have a bit more talent with Fire and Ice than anything else though, so that might be where you want to aim your pursuits should your desire be to catch up to the others. Until then, you make up for your lack of power with versatility. As a side, you also have a decent bonus to your physical might, maybe enough to crack a tree and withstand similar blows."

Your powers with the magics of life and death, particularly those unique to this land such as the Lore of Nehekhara, have grown to staggering levels of might. You have a knowledge of the rituals, ceremonies and traditions of Nehekhara unmatched by any save Khatep himself. You could have unsealed the greatest of tombs and performed the rituals to summon Settra and his great army alone if you were awake at the time. And if you had done so, summoned the dead yourself, your will would stay with them regardless of your presence. The undead you create or raise up do not require the presence of a priest to maintain themselves or energy to continue functioning, though you may still forcefully dismiss your own creations."

Voodoo magic is only rarely used by the witches that live on the outside of Amazon communities, a form of curse magic that allows them to harm or cast spells on people even from great distances away, so long as they have a link. You’ve mastered this magic, allowing you to affect people so long as you have a piece of their body. For a normal person or those weaker than you, a lock of hair would allow you to cast spells on them from hundreds of miles away or kill them by destroying a doll made in their image. Those stronger than you or with significant magical protections of their own may only receive lesser effects or even be entirely immune to your voodoo magic, unless you can get something more important from them. Even those stronger than you might not resist if you have a limb or organ of theirs."

Shield creates a mystical “armor” around your form that acts as invisible and weightless plate mail, turning otherwise mortal blows (or a full heart containers worth, for reference) into survivable hits. Jump allows you to leap twice your normal height and land with ease. Life allows you to restore the equivalent of 3 “Heart Container”’s worth of vitality to yourself. Fairy transforms you into a small fairy much like those that bless the hero link, giving small size and flight.

Yet, for some reason, you can combine different paths and spells for more complicated and powerful effects than should be possible. It’s significantly harder than it would be for an Awakened mage doing Sphere magic, but the fact that you can do it at all is fascinating. In future worlds, you will be able to combine different kinds of magic in much the same way, as long as they aren’t diametrically opposed anyway."

      "description": "In Neolife, all things possess affinities, sentient races included. Druids, and those using the same skills, cultivate those same affinities by cycling mana of the affinity they want to gain between themselves and a source of said mana, and manipulating their mana to match it. As they increase their affinities, they will see bonuses such as being able to cultivate passively, control whatever the affinity represents, and even develop a resistance to their affinity, as their passive control grows to protect them from its expressions. Meanwhile, people who do not develop their affinities simply have them hovering around somewhere below the first useful threshold, 5%, as they choose to focus their attention elsewhere. But there is a third option to take here. Anyone may choose to strip away all of their affinities, which would normally be a lengthy and complicated process in and of itself. But for sacrificing their ability to possess and gain affinities, they would instead get an affinity for pure, unattributed mana. Now, since you already paid the cost of this new affinity in other ways, there is no need for you to give up your other affinities, so we can jump straight into the explanation of what this actually means for you. While it won’t let you control anything new (anyone can already control mana without any affinity, after all), you will get a reduction on magic costs equal to your affinity. So with the affinity at 10%, your spells would cost 10% less mana. And if you managed to get it to 100%, you would be able to cast magic for no cost to yourself entirely, as you could command all the mana in the world around you to access a virtually unlimited supply of it. This would let you rain spells upon your enemies incessantly, create high-level enchantments without having to resort to mana gems, and even use time magic to travel forwards or backwards in time for more than a few seconds. You’ll also find the control you have over mana increases as your affinity does, making it far easier to actually cast all those complicated spells. Another bonus is your ability to create Mana Gems, the only objects in the universe not aligned to any element, but rather, you probably guessed it already, pure mana. Even though they might not be of much use for you, since mana costs will soon be a thing of the past when it comes to yourself, they are for most other people, who would gladly pay a lot for them."

You are also able to draw magical energy from any who worship you in this world, though this particular trait won’t persist past this world without a certain perk. As a Goddess, you also have a series of purviews over which you hold divine power. You may pick up to three different things to hold power over, such as Water, Luck or The Arts. You’ll find yourself blessed in regards to these things, effortlessly skilled in anything relating to them and with vastly more power when you use magic associated with your purviews. You also have an innate affinity to your purviews which may provide passive abilities, such as being immune to heat damage if you pick Fire. You will also choose whether you are a good or evil Goddess, though this won’t affect your actual morality. Instead it will give you either a Holy or Unholy attribute, respectively. You’ll gain an immensely powerful aura for which attribute you choose, such that a Holy Goddess could kill high level undead with a single tear due to the holy energy infused within or badly harm them with a touch. It will empower any Holy or Unholy abilities greatly too. Lastly, buying this will boost any capstone perks or items that you purchase, as detailed in the notes section at the end of this document."

The costs for that one spell, whether in mana or materials, are negligible. Your love for it is such that you could cast it at least a dozen times a day. The spell will continue to improve as you use it too, never having an upper limit and slowly growing in all aspects as you keep using it. Brighter, hotter, louder and more destructive.

If you cast a fireball you learnt at level 1, using the same amount of energy, but were a level 80 wizard when you cast it now? You’d be summoning a conflagration that could consume half a town instead of a mid-sized fireball attack. Even things as simple as a low level voice changing spell could become a spell that allows the target to freely make any sound they wanted, rather than just a single different voice. You can still expend energy or points to improve spells, provided the spell can be improved in such ways, even more but their base level of power will rise alongside your own general power level."

Whenever you find yourself asleep, in a trance, or otherwise incapacitated, you’ll be guaranteed that your physical body will come to no harm until you wake up. This doesn’t mean that trouble will not find you, in fact, it’s entirely possible you’ll be locked away and be prepared for butchering, but at the very least your aggressors will have the decency to wait until you wake up."

You can now give yourself a degree of mobility, depending on your form. Works with humanoid bodies such as mannequins and dolls can now move about freely, the body ignoring the normal limitations of physics and physical composition as the entire artwork is filled with your life energy. Paintings are a little more limited, but with simple effort you can move to a degree within your painting, waving at a curious onlooker or grabbing something from close by. You might even be able to make your frame shake about if you get used to the dynamics of your inhuman form. With enough willpower, you can project up to half of your upper body outside of your artwork, though you must still remain connected to your piece. In this manner, a painting can use his or her hands to drag the painting around, giving you a fair degree of mobility. Give yourself enough time, and you might be able to find even more ways to move around. If you are in a different form that’s not your art self, this perk generally only applies if you are in a petrified, inanimate, or otherwise immovable state; even so, under those circumstances it can be very useful. Essentially, the perk also ensures that as long as you have a body, conscious thoughts, and the necessary will, you can move your body to some degree; this means that even if your body was paralyzed or frozen rigid with ice, as long as your mind is okay you can still make your body move."

This lasts up to an hour, at which point the crash hits. The crash’s intensity depends upon the length and strength of the boost, as well as the excess pain and stress the biokinetic endured, and will likely incapacitate the unprepared, knocking them unconscious. Of course, having the strength of an Olympian doesn’t mean that they can handle the strength of an Olympian, so it’s common for a biokinetic to injure themselves and, as adrenaline dulls pain, not realize it.

It makes the arm in question into a holy object, a force of significant power against unholy creatures of the night and even weakening weaker beings of such a nature by presence. It’s presence in your body also grants a greater resistance to death, making it significantly more difficult for death effects to be applied to you. While you take damage and injuries as normal, it makes you appear quite a lot more enduring than a normal human, and abilities like the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception would require prolonged focus to see your lines of death."

Once you grow up, the hidden kiss remains on the right-hand corner of your mouth. Though its inner magic weakens after your first kiss, it stays on you, and can only come free if given to someone you can genuinely and openly share your innermost childhood wishes with. With this ability, you can \"steal\" the hidden kiss of a target. The theft requires building up an emotional connection with the holder, such that his or her hold loosens enough for you to snag it; fortunately, you have a charismatic nature that can melt the hearts of most people (even a fierce warrior or man-killing monster), though the exact way they react to their growing passion for you varies. Each hidden kiss you hold yourself increases your own childish innocence, making you more adventurous and less susceptible to corruption. However, if you hold onto and strengthen the ties you made to obtain the hidden kiss, you can form a deep bond with the former owner, the kind that is generally found only with soulmates. Moreover, by willingly giving a hidden kiss to someone, you grant that magical wonder to him or her; such a miracle could restore someone from the worst of corruption, or even bring the recipient back to life; however, in the latter case it would only work if the deceased one’s body is still physically present and “warm,” with the deadline at most being 24 hours."

Bright Wizards have something of a reputation for pyromania, for good reason. While in your case it will never become a true addiction, you will now find casting fire magic an excellent way to lift your spirits. A simple fireball might relieve your tension and provide a savory adrenaline rush all at once, and even lighting a tiny flame may soothe the chilling fear gripping you. Fire warms the body - why should it not warm the heart?"

This bright yellow brew lacks the special trait of delayed activation that they Purple Potion has, but it compensates by being much more powerful. Whereas the Red Potion heals six hearts, and the purple gives you eight hearts, this potion heals everything. Doesn’t matter how much you actually have, the Yellow Potion restores you to the top of your game. That said, due to how rare and expensive this is in comparison, you’ll only be getting a single refill each month."

This mirror is intended to be used to reflect light, and adds in the faintest traces of holy magic, often stunning or damaging evil creatures and forcing ghostly beings to solidify for a short while. On top of that, the shield is also capable of deflecting full on light magic, such as the Light Arrows."

The souls can aid the wearer, granting them strength and taking damage in their place. In doing so, they eventually pay their penance and are allowed entry into Paradise for their services. The more a soul helps, the faster they earn their freedom and they all know this, so most are willing to do what it takes – or they eventually come around to be willing, in any case. The Suit already contains a few dozen souls that are willing to work for their redemption, which is enough to amplify your abilities well into the superhuman range when drawing on them, but you will need to capture more and continue to do so to retain and increase the suit’s power. Needless to say, this only works on the souls of the wicked. You also have absolute telekinetic control over the cloak, which is supernaturally strong and can stretch and contort, while wearing the suit."

Use her as much as you like, but be careful not to run out of Force Gems. You rather need those for something else. As a signing bonus of sorts, you’re also allowed a single healing for free which she will be giving to you in the form of a complete resurrection should you ever die, once per ten years. It’s not a great rate, but it might just save your life, quite literally."

You could consider it a magical blueprint of how something works. And it truly shows everything: skills, abilities, physical makeup, personality, memory, and much more. Animals and plants have flowing auras, full of twists and turns, whereas processed items like machines have jagged auras, full of hard lines like a 3D circuit diagram. One peculiarity of Aura is that any of its changes are reflected in the being or object possessing the Aura. Xeno-shifters, an advanced Druid class, make use of that to mimic the aura of lifeforms they have studied in order to gain both their forms and abilities, for example. It is also how Technomancers are able to replicate the effects of implants within themselves, by simply copying their Auras into their bodies. But for all of its potential advantages, tampering with your own Aura can also go incredibly wrong if you mess it up, especially when it involves your brain, such as causing brain damage, death of personality, or just the normal kind of death. It’s good, then, that with your skill at manipulating and changing Auras, yours and those of others, mistakes like that won’t ever happen. It wouldn’t be wrong to call you an Aura Artisan. So long as you have an example to study, you’ll be able to safely and successfully apply any of its abilities or peculiarities either to yourself or somebody else, and even combine parts of the Auras of many beings to create truly powerful forms. After studying a massive amount of different Auras to get a feel for how they work, you’ll even be able to go so far as to create original Auras and beings, or change parts of your Aura to give yourself entirely new abilities."

No matter what. You can pull the entire force of a blast towards you, no matter how many people would get hit. However, the consequences could be dire for bigger blasts. Can your body really handle the full, concentrated force of a world-shattering blast? You can pull it all into you...but can you really survive that? Take caution with this ability. The power of friendship and love can mitigate the damage to a degree but...do you really want to risk it? You have some value in this world, too. It would be a shame if you died through self-sacrifice."

You can not be compelled to lower your resistance unwillingly, even if under mind control or enchanted by someone else.

If you’ve managed to achieve a significant emotional bond with someone (preferably a positive one), you may choose to be ‘in sync’ with them, which they will have to voluntarily agree to. A declaration of protection, a confession of love, even a simple handshake will do. You will always know where this person is and how they currently feel, and they will likewise sense the same from you without fear of your abilities shutting them out or striking back at the reading (unless you want to - doesn’t that cheapen the bond, though?). In addition, when fighting or teaming up, you both count as one entity when working together, and their competence in any mundane skills you have soar to your equal level, able to work perfectly as a duo for teamwork purposes. This may even work for magical powers, though they have to be capable of it and already know enough to use it on their own for that to work, and nothing unique or ‘just you’ will carry over. You will understand and know each other better than anyone else in the world, and if you maintain this bond, it may last forever. That said, breaking it off with them or losing this bond to begin with will make all the associated benefits disappear. You may also only share this with one individual at a time - it’s perfect partner, not partners, after all."

Fortunately, you don’t need to worry about that. Your life force has been transferred to a special rose of a color that resonates with you. As long as your soul is tied to the rose, you can exist in world that would otherwise forcibly change the very nature of your body and soul without facing negative consequences; any changes to your mind or body to suit the requirements of that world are neutralized with the flower’s presence. The rose does not need to be kept near you, and as long as it is kept fresh you will be protected from the distorted reality’s changes even if you are far away from it. The rose’s petals vary depending on your age and health, but do not pluck them, as they literally symbolize your life. Whenever a petal is plucked, you gain cuts and sharp internal pains. In turn, whenever your body is hurt, your rose loses a petal; on the bright side, as long as the attack would not have been instantly fatal, you only lose a single petal each time. When they all disappear, not only do you face imminent death, but you lose your protection from the gallery’s imposed fantasy, and must face the consequences; normally, that would mean you become part of the gallery, but in the context of the jump it constitutes a game over. However, there are some benefits. The rose is eternally fresh, and whenever it is immersed in water (there must be at least a vaseful for there to be any effect, it rejuvenates, and its petals (along with your health) are restored; the water is absorbed into the rose in the process. Please note that the rose only affects the health of your physical body for better or worse; it has no effect on magic and other energies you might use. Also, if you have any special powers with flowers and plants, you might want to experiment and see what happens. Once you leave the gallery, the rose vanishes, as you do not need it in the real world, but you can summon it again if you feel the need. On flipside, if you could not normally exist in the real world, the rose might be able to have the reverse effect and allow you to go there without needing to make additional sacrifices. If you choose the Local Human background, you’re stuck with the rose during the jump even if you don’t buy the perk, but you will not get the extra benefits outside the jump unless you take the perk. In the case that you purchase the perk but did not choose the Local Human background, you can freely summon and dismiss it as you please. Please keep in mind that since the rose’s purpose is to keep you in existence in the world you are in, the rose must stay in the same overall reality/dimension you are in; if you move between dimensions without it, the rose will either appear before you or be dismissed until you activate the perk again."

You decide who is the fittest, and shall therefore survive."

Whenever you cast a spell pertaining to healing or plant life, the Jade Wind flows freely from you, restoring further health to yourself and any ally within ten meters of you. Broken bones knit themselves back together, crushed arteries renew themselves, diseases burn out before their course has run, parasites are purged from flesh and blood, and even burn scars fade away.

Figures such as Skrolk and whoever holds the title of Nurglitch may be hammered by plague, disease, infection, and cancer; But no matter how afflicted, rotten, or pustulous their body, these priests of the Pestilent Brotherhood still stand tall and strong. Would that if they knew this blessing of yours, they would accept you there in a heartbeat. Like Skrolk, your body is a container for all things that ravage and wear at the flesh and spirit, such that you are also immune to the slow degeneration and death that one who practices the Lore of Plague suffers. You may feel the bite and tear of Bone Ague, but it will never leave your body a bone-splintered, bent corpse. The sores of Red Pox will weep and bleed, but you will never die from excessive internal bleeding. All this comes to a head in the most terrifying aspect of this blessing: Every disease and affliction that gathers within your body mingles, mixes, breeds with each other, creating hybrid plagues and cancers that can spread from your body. As new sicknesses are created from this method, new spells for the Lore of Plague are developed to spread them. Like your god, you too shall be the Harbinger."

From there, they fight one of the existing Lords in a duel to supplant them. In your possession is a similar pillar, made of pitch-black warpstone and, carved in Queekish, the Horned Rat’s law. This is not the Pillar that the Horned Rat slammed into Skavenblight during the great Civil War, but a copy for one’s own personal council and servitors. Those whom you find worthy, and match the edicts and laws carved into the Pillar, will find their bodies and spirits empowered by the dark magicks overflowing from the Pillar, becoming the utmost peak of what their species is capable of in both physical and magical capacities. As well, after your duration in this world, the pillar of black warpstone will be wiped clean of the Horned Rat’s etchings - allowing you to print into it your own edicts and laws, and creating the guidelines for those who are worthy to be bolstered. It should not go without saying that if one is not worthy, or does not have your consent, will more than likely die horribly to the corrupting warpstone."

You have preternaturally good luck, bullets fly around you, people trip and fall on their own swords, and the cosmic dice are weighted in your favor. Fate cannot touch you as you make your own way, but the very same Fate will bend to make your plans come to fruition, even as it guides your hand into the heart of your enemies. When you actively ride the Wave -- which requires only that you focus and will yourself to do so -- these effects are amplified drastically. You can stand against beings of immense power and watch as it almost seems as though a writer changes the story to allow you much greater odds of coming out on top. Facing down the ultimate embodiment of evil would spell doom for most any man, but your chances of pulling the wool over the devil’s eyes and walking away with the last laugh are much higher than they would be for just any common schmuck, even if you were just an otherwise common schmuck – but we both know you’re already much more than that, don’t we? Although, you should be aware that while this greatly shifts the odds in your favor, it does not guarantee victory, nor does it allow you to win in a truly impossible situation. Don’t get too cocky. Even above this, once your chain is over you will gain mystical significance as \"The Laughing Magician\", who thumbs his nose at the gods of man's own creation and upsets the balance of all, the greatest trickster, who spits in the face of God and the Devil alike. By using that title, you will be able to gain near godlike power, controlling fate, magic, and even bending the fabric of reality."

      "description": "One dose, three sips, of Hourai elixir per-jump or every ten years, whichever one comes first. You may drink it yourself or give it to others. The first sip prevents you from aging, the second sip makes you immune to illness, and the third makes you deathless. Your soul is preserved for eternity at the moment of the third sip, and no ordinary force is capable of affecting it. Even abilities to kill anything simply slide off you, as the wielder finds they can neither target you nor cause you to die. Your body is like a temporary vessel for your soul; if it is harmed or destroyed utterly your soul shall simply instantly regenerate a new one. Your body does not lose any sensation though, and you may find being repeatedly killed and returned to be extremely painful for you. The elixir lingers on in the liver of the person who drank it, should their raw liver be taken and eaten it will render the eater deathless too though the original person does not lose their immortality either. As the elixir was made in part through Kaguya’s manipulation of eternity, nothing short of powers that can affect eternity itself can affect the deathless nature of one who has taken the Hourai Elixir. This is not complete and total immortality. Be additionally warned that while it renders you nigh-unkillable it offers no inherent protection against other creative ways to remove you permanently, such as sealing you away permanently, which does exist here and has been used before to lock Hourai immortals away for centuries. Sentencing you to a far, far worse than death where you are unable to die is entirely within the realm of possibility. Nor does it make your body inherently more durable than before beyond being immune to illness; if you are a fragile human you will remain so."

Since magic is so tied to their being, a monster's innate magic is invariably representative of their personality or appearance- A frog-like monster might use flies to attack, a skeleton might use bones, or a dog might use... dog-shaped attacks.

      "description": "This was the dominant system used by the Belkan Empire during its glory days, and fits the ideal of a knight of Belka - up close, personal, and unsubtle. Practitioners, often called Knights, would eschew ranged attacks in favor of melee combat and antipersonnel techniques, designed to shut down opponents through a combination of mobility and fighting power. It lacks the utility and flexibility of the Mid-Childan system, but compensates for this through raw power and monstrous combat ability in close quarters. Notably, it is fairly easy to adapt this style for use with the Cartridge System, adding to the prowess of a Knight in their prime."

Much like its predecessor, it’s almost completely combat oriented, but instead focuses on enhancing one’s physical capabilities using magic and Cartridges, sometimes even in hand-to-hand combat or using melee weapons like the prior system. It’s not good for much outside of combat, but is excellent for one-on-one duels or quickly shutting down an unprepared and squishy opponent."

However, it is far more efficient to reconfigure the Device to maximize the power and efficiency of a spell rather than casting it through brute force. Your Device gains a ranged mode, which causes it to reconfigure to better support ranged attacks, specifically bombardment-type spells, although shooting-type spells might also gain some benefit from this. When reconfigured, the weapon will generally become more cumbersome, weighty or otherwise awkward for anything other than ranged attacks. A sword would lose its edge, perhaps revealing a gun in the blade or combining with it’s sheath to form a bow. A simple staff could become heavier, needing an entire trigger assembly to support its weight. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

      "description": "Despite all the advantages offered by strength-enhancing magic, some Mages simply don’t want to spend all the magical energy to enhance their swing and instead opt to enhance the blade instead. An energy blade is a relatively simple mass of fields shaped into the confines of a blade that is both superheated and preternaturally sharp. The ‘hilt’ of the blade is simply used to provide directionality to the fields, with the actual blade being generated in place by the Device, which confers the advantage of the blade being effectively ‘weightless’. In addition, the energy consumption of the blade is directly linked to its size and output energy, meaning it’s relatively simple to ‘overcharge’ an energy blade. For all of it’s advantages, however, energy blades are severely weakened under the effects of AMF compared to physical blades, and being mana-based tend to be more easily blocked by magical defenses. To counter these effects, fifth-generation energy blades instead generate a blade made out of kinetic energy, instead of using the magical blades used in older methods. The practical upshot is that they become much harder to counteract with anti-magic, while still retaining their properties. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

In less complicated terms, you direct magical energy towards creating a desired mental image or interference into reality - usually things like magical bullets or things that otherwise act as destructive spells based on what you enjoy visualizing most. In addition, you can root yourself into the ground to absorb a high amount of magical energy, or lock onto targets for your bullets with concentration, guiding the shots. It’s a straightforward magecraft, capable of little beyond offense and disruption - but sometimes that’s all you need, isn’t it? With enough speed and magical energy, someone using this art could act as a living human-sized force of destruction and disaster - though it does little else on its own. You’re an expert at this particular, simple magecraft, able to lock and fire shots with great accuracy and a good amount of offensive power, as simple as firing a gun you’ve known for an entire lifetime."

Or maybe you follow the path of Hibiki Tachibana, Kokoro Aichi, and Subaru Nakajima and just CAST FIST. Either way. You gain proficiency in one martial art, as appropriate for your weapon. Not true mastery, but that will come with time and practice. You also receive a bit of experience in a few related styles, just so you have a few options if your normal moves aren’t working out. This package also doubles your strength and triples your toughness when active, because you are going to be getting hit quite a bit when you go to zero range. At this level, it takes rifle rounds or similar to leave bruises, and your blows hit like a car crash."

Now, any Ogre may try his chances to join the ranks of the Firebellies, the believers of this cult. You are one such believer. You can spray fire from your mouth, control the Lore of Fire that grants you destructive fire magic, bleed and spray molten lava on foes when your skin is pierced and shrug off all but the hottest of flames.

The more you kill, the more powerful you’ll become. You’ll find new, more efficient ways to cut men in half, discover the proper way to behead someone at full speed without breaking a step and learn how to get the best out of a weapon the more you use it, perhaps even finding new abilities or tricks it may hide. All that exercise will help you get stronger physically as well. Your already prodigious strength will grow in time, until you’re pulling truly ridiculous anime shit. This takes time though.

The shadows of exceptionally-willed individuals may have a mind of their own, but for the most part the shadow is now a simple item for you to claim. The effects of losing your shadow can range from harmless to dangerous depending on what world you are in, but a victim will never feel the same without his or her shadow, and victims will likely lose some degree of their full powers. Plus, you can gradually learn to make it so that cutting off a shadow will also take away at least some special powers the victim used to have.

'Immortal' beings that rely on the soul surviving, such as beings making use of reincarnation, can be slain with this weapon. It was reforged into a type of weapon of your choice, or else incorporated into another weapon from a previous jump. The spirit within may be a copy of Nanako or a similar spirit of your choosing."

All this talk of predators and prey awoke an ancient lineage in you, a calling back to the days when we all had to crush and kill with our bare hands. When humans and beasts were no different. It might have been a miraculous success of the bloodchip drug or the result of an awakened origin, but you’ve become rather like Lio Shirazumi. Your body is powerful now, able to leap several storeys and tear through stone walls or crush human skulls with ease. Your senses have quickly come to match some of the best in the animal kingdom and the sharp fangs and claws that appear when you grow hostile slice flesh like it was just water. These traits slowly increase as time goes on and you hunt more, perhaps even new abilities sourced from predator animals appearing on you. Unlike Lio, you can halt and start the progress of this when you desire. Useful given it has an effect on your mind. Much more limited than the Shirazumi beast suffers but you still find that the more monstrous you become, the more your mindset begins to reflect that of a predator. Sheer force of will can restrain your urges to devour and kill, with magecraft perhaps holding keys to treat this mental affliction. Should you give into the power, you’ll soon be more than a match for many of the denizens of this city."

A planetarium surrounding an Orb of Sorcery channels the arcane Storm of Shemtek, which slowly but surely bends the sky until the enemies of the Celestial Wizard riding it are pelted with bolts of lightning and hailstones the size of their heads. If the Acolytes manning the machine perform a certain ritual correctly, the device will even call down a blazing meteor upon the enemy force, and allied soldiers within a few yards are given visions of the near future by the leaking energy, allowing them to dodge incoming enemy blows. Is this not the sort of weapon you have dreamed of?"

Hysh leaks from it as it fires, protecting nearby allies from blade and arrow as they march with the arcane wagon. This artillery piece is immensely useful against the Empire’s most devious enemies - the Von Carsteins of Sylvania and their minions, and the Daemons that stream forth alongside the Norscan hordes. That one of these rare machines is in your personal keeping implies a great deal of trust in you, for each Orb of Sorcery used to power a Luminark is one less Orb powering the prisons beneath the Light College."

Twisted epithets and curses towards dawikind are carved into the pick’s surface, and it is perpetually stained with the dried blood of the stout folk. While it currently exists in Queek Head-Taker’s paws, these are skaven we speak of - there is no way in the Warp others like this do not exist. And in fact, in your paws is a weapon made for much the same purpose as Dwarf-Gouger. It doesn’t have to be a war-pick either - for your purposes it could be a jagged sword, halberd, or other weapon of your preference. Regardless, the weapon is built to pierce and brutalize armor - carving steel like butter and even managing to pierce dwarven gromgril or puresteel. And to make matters worse for your foes, into the tool of war is engraved curses and oaths of violence against a foe of your choice - causing the weapon to hunger and seek the flesh of said enemy, and tear through them with disturbing ease. Note: These have to be enemies that could conceivably attack or be attacked by Skaven. No, “Elder Gods of the Infinite Cosmos” doesn’t count. If you want to say Ork tho, it’d work on all Ork- and Orc-like monsters."

They are made from a thirteen-day long ritual in which bronze alloy is melted down with warpstone in the grand warp-forges of Skavenblight, the blood of sacrifices spilled across the metal both as it is set into the cast, and as it cools. The chittering incantations of Skryre and Seer alike wreath the metal in skittering, malevolent runes as it cools; Once it is finished, a great carriage built with a piece of the Tower of Kavzar’s masonry is constructed to hold the infernal relic - and a Rat-Ogre specially constructed to be the bell-ringer. And atop the bell’s archway is a paw-hold, for you as its Seer to stand atop the ringing bell as you observe the battlefield and squeak-preach the word of the Horned Rat. Yes, you heard me right - you have earned the honors of commanding the holy war-machine of the Screaming Bell, as you command the cart to move in the direction of skavendom’s sworn enemies. The bell’s ringing is magically augmented - even more so with you aboard the battle-altar, as your own magical power enhances the metal device. Every thundering toll empowers and hardens those under your command with a zealotry unseen by any other false God of this world. And to make matters worse for your enemies, every toll rings doom: For as the rat-ogre bellringer hoists on the rope, the din will grow louder and louder still, until stone and metal are cracked, pounded, and broken by the explosions of sound that emanate from the device. Should the Bell suffer destruction at enemy hands, or cause itself to detonate in a beautiful display of cataclysm, it will reappear good as new in a week’s time."

Thus does this great war machine serve as both burning siege engine, and noisome altar of worship. Crewed by a regiment of skaven clerics, the machine is built like the Screaming Bell of the Grey Seer Priesthood - except instead of a great bell hanging from the archway, there is a great metal censer the size of a dwarven wrecking ball, with a great many mummified priests skins wrapped inside about a chunk of burning warpstone. The brazier emanates a hot, sickly green mist as the priests heave on its chains, with even simple beasts knowing immediately that to inhale that mist is to die a most horrific death. Just beneath the swinging brazier is the Priest’s podium - from which they squeak and shriek the word of the Verminous One. You may decide upon the crew that mans your own great Furnace - either a regiment of plagued clerics, some to hoist the great brazier’s chain and some to push the war machine, or two rat-ogres specifically trained for this purpose only. Indeed, I said “your own,” for you lay claim to one of the holy siege engines of Pestilens. Taking your rightful place on the war-machine-altar will magnify your voice, enough to be heard across an entire raging battlefield. As well, the spells you wield atop the Plague Furnace are multiplied in effectiveness, from the great-many plagued runes and enchantments woven into the machine. The mist that billows from the brazier will inflict whatever debilitating pox will most wreak havoc upon the field of battle, but renders a different effect on your brothers and allies: Those by your side and under your command are, on inhaling the sickly fog, immediately taken by a religious fervour as their pain is dulled and their mind sharpened for the violence at hand."

Mages in other universes may not react so dramatically, for they have no true connection to the weapon, but they will still have a good idea of what they are looking at and aren’t likely to overlook it. ● Daemon Weapons care not for whether their victims are even of the material realm. These weapons can do harm to virtually anything they strike, including spirits such as ghosts. The magical protections of this world are unlikely to be sufficient to stop this weapon. ● You may make use of the abilities and weapons skill of the Daemon trapped inside the weapon when you are using it. You may import any weapon you possess (Barring Chaos Weapons) to be the host for the Daemon, including ranged weapons if it pleases you. ​These Daemons are normally troublesome at the best of times, but as a special consideration, you will find that your God(s) have totally broken the will of the Daemon you receive, so while they may show their usual problematic traits to others if you do not step in to reign the demon in, you are safe from their treachery. The Lord of Change is Tzeentch’s greatest Daemon servant, known for being wholly unpredictable and truly manipulative. Many short-sighted fools have attempted to outwit these beings, only to be crushed utterly by the incomprehensible amount of trickery these beings are capable of. These Daemons are true masters of magic, and having this Daemon within your weapon will result in an absolutely monstrous amount of magical power available to you from this world, secret spells and long forgotten techniques and rituals revealing themselves to you by the Daemon’s will. The Daemon will also give you counsel when desired, and it’s intelligence will quickly prove to be valuable to you. The Daemon is often sarcastic in its dealings with you, but press it enough and it will eventually tell you the truth about what you wish to know."

Mages in other universes may not react so dramatically, for they have no true connection to the weapon, but they will still have a good idea of what they are looking at and aren’t likely to overlook it. ● Daemon Weapons care not for whether their victims are even of the material realm. These weapons can do harm to virtually anything they strike, including spirits such as ghosts. The magical protections of this world are unlikely to be sufficient to stop this weapon. ● You may make use of the abilities and weapons skill of the Daemon trapped inside the weapon when you are using it. You may import any weapon you possess (Barring Chaos Weapons) to be the host for the Daemon, including ranged weapons if it pleases you. ​These Daemons are normally troublesome at the best of times, but as a special consideration, you will find that your God(s) have totally broken the will of the Daemon you receive, so while they may show their usual problematic traits to others if you do not step in to reign the demon in, you are safe from their treachery. The greatest Daemon of Khorne, the colossal beasts exist only to kill in Khorne’s name. The Bloodthirster is a true master of war, able to use it’s raw strength to destroy all who oppose it in battle and can outmaneuver even the most genius of human generals. Bloodthirsters on this earth are known to be totally unstoppable, and while trapped in your weapon it will grant much of it’s martial mastery to you. Even the most inept and incompetent fool will find himself able to butcher entire elite regiments on their lonesome, and by bearing this weapon you will also be tutored by the Daemon on tactical acumen, making you a virtually unstoppable force as a commander as well as a killer. The Lord of Change is Tzeentch’s greatest Daemon servant, known for being wholly unpredictable and truly manipulative. Many short-sighted fools have attempted to outwit these beings, only to be crushed utterly by the incomprehensible amount of trickery these beings are capable of. These Daemons are true masters of magic, and having this Daemon within your weapon will result in an absolutely monstrous amount of magical power available to you from this world, secret spells and long forgotten techniques and rituals revealing themselves to you by the Daemon’s will. The Daemon will also give you counsel when desired, and it’s intelligence will quickly prove to be valuable to you. Nurgle’s most powerful Daemon is the Great Unclean One, who are capable of bringing everything that crosses their path into despair and rot, their presence absolutely impossible to mistake. It’s innumerable diseases permeate in the air, and anything that comes into contact with the blade is all but guaranteed to rot and decay away, perhaps before the weapon makes contact with its intended target. You will also become nearly impossible to kill through any mundane means, save for being blasted apart so strongly that there is absolutely nothing of you left. A manifestation of both temptation and torment, the Keeper of Secrets are Daemons of Slaanesh who wholly represent Slaanesh’s two-faced nature. When they arrive, they entice the minds of all mortals who lay eyes on them with their impossible charisma, and despite their hellish appearance most cannot bear to tear their eyes away. In battle, the Daemon flows through the enemy like water, and carves them to pieces with unnatural precision. You will receive a gargantuan boost to any skill of your choice, the skill now likely unmatched by any mortal alive which is the result of the Daemon being practiced in almost any hobby and pleasurable activity. Your agility is now utterly otherworldly, a trait characterizes Slaanesh’s kind. How incredibly unusual. A Daemon that has ties to all four of the Chaos Gods is virtually unheard of, but it seems that the Ruinous Powers are willing to give you a Daemon that has remained entirely silent...until now. This Daemon was born from the very first murder that occurred long before Sigmar had even been conceived. The Daemon has a truly immense amount of knowledge and lore it can grant you and no shortage of power, but it has been in a sort of sleep for thousands of years and as a result is not necessarily a great expert in any one area. The Daemon grants you some of the benefits of all of the Daemons above, but their effects will not be of full strength. You’ve gained the immense power of a Greater Daemon, make no mistake, but the term jack of all trades is only appropriate. The Daemon is for the most part silent, but the process of forging it into a weapon has served to simply awaken it rather than break it. It is very curious about your otherworldly nature and desires to understand its wielder. You will find it surprisingly civil, so perhaps it did not necessarily even need breaking."

Whether as a side effect of a past curse or a quirk of your lineage, you are a bit beyond the average human being - your body alone qualifies as a holy weapon, able to strike spirits and monsters as though you were the living blade of a saint, greatly damaging the demonic and the malevolent by touch alone, should you so will it. You can sense the presence of supernatural monsters or great evil within a city block-sized area, and track them with all the skill of an expert hunter. Your physical abilities are likewise enhanced - your strength is enough to bend steel, your speed is enough to keep up with a car moving at full speed, and your durability allows you to survive bullets and piercing wounds with a fair amount of ease, though removal of limbs or vital organs still can’t be shrugged off with this alone. Finally, in your hands,any already-enchanted items or weapons designed as ‘holy’ are twice as effective, letting you tear through Dead Apostles with ‘common’ instruments like Black Keys and cutting a bloody swath through dozens of them with something like the Seventh Scripture. You are the one who hunts heretics and monsters in the night - and now, you embody that purpose."

However, you cannot truly see ‘death’, and as such cannot actualize it upon a living being or even an unliving or inanimate object - thus rather than instantly killing the target, it merely critically damages them until their bodies cannot take much more.

With at least two other people and chanting a prayer (What you say doesn’t matter, as long as you have the spirit), they immobilize the Vertex. The soul of the Vertex then slides out and becomes material. Taking out the Vertex’s soul is generally a bad idea if you’re not prepared to attack it then and there, as a countdown timer will appear on the runes around it. The surroundings of the barrier you are in will wilt, the rot growing towards Shinju-Sama’s direction and when the countdown timer ends, Shinju-Sama dies. The countdown timer varies in length from Vertex to Vertex, but it is not a good idea to dawdle when the soul appears regardless. The soul is a physical entity in this case, and it is entirely possible to shatter it without resorting to magic. However, it’s the only way to kill the Vertex, as it’s healing factor is too much for any ordinary group of magical girls to handle, and even to destroy the soul is a challenge. It could have different layers, or be unusually tough to destroy. It could move and attempt to fly away. It could have self defense systems. Worse, is that it is difficult to tell what challenges the soul will bring when the Vertex is sealed. Every vertex soul has a tough, solid outer shell. A standard attack won’t cut it down. Now you can do the Sealing Ritual on beings other than the Vertex. They cannot resist the ritual being done on them, and you may do it as easily as in the heat of the battlefield. The ritual for other beings works the exact same way as stated in the Sealing Ritual perk, except that when the countdown timer ends, the soul returns to the body of the being. And you can no longer use the ritual on them. You will have to find some other way to destroy it. You could potentially kill unkillable beings this way--but do not expect their souls to be easy to destroy. The challenge to destroy the soul scales with the mental strength of the being. There will be many defense mechanisms the soul has if it’s terribly strong. Obviously, one could merely shatter a regular human soul with a strong enough punch without much resistance on the soul’s part, but the soul of a monster will carry many challenges to defeat. The ritual merely gives you a weak point to attack. Also note that a being will have to have a soul in the first place for this ritual to work."

Despite being used after the attack Fragarach will always strike first by altering the flow of time to change events so that it makes it’s strike before the enemy made their ultimate attack. Keep in mind that it will not kill enemies who can survive a strike to the heart or who would not be affected by an attack on the level of an A-rank Noble Phantasm."

In seeking to use the old Nehekharan King known as Alcadizaar, the ratmen forged a weapon. Dwarven gromril alloyed with smelted warpstone, with the greatest of the Lore of Ruin’s destructive spells hammered into the alloy as it was shaped on the anvil. It was tempered then, in acid bile and magical poisons, and fell runes engraved that could kill the one who read them. When at last the weapon was complete, a perfect warpstone gem was slotted into its hilt - to allow the Council of Thirteen to see through the eyes of its wielder, and channel magicks through them to protect from Nagash’s dark spellcraft. The Fellblade was created, and thus did Alcadizaar strike down Nagash. The blade disappeared from history upon the Nehekharan King’s death - thrown into the vast crevasse around Nagashizzar. Until recently, that is, when it came into your paws, borne in a lead box by a blindfolded, masked agent of the Council. You wield The Fellblade now: A sword whose mere presence in your fingers multiplies your strength greatly, such that a runty Skavenslave would match an Ogre hand-to-hand. The magicks and toxins woven into the gromril-warpstone alloy allow the weapon to cut through any magical or physical protection to cut deep, while the warpstone and engraved runes tear, warp, and corrode the flesh of both its wielder and their victims. The warpstone orb in its hilt marks you as the Council’s warrior, for its presence lets them watch through your eyes, and channel their magic through you as their agent. A Word Of Warning: This blade’s deadly pou are marked as their agent with all the good AND ill that entails in the endlesower comes at several costs. The first: The sheer amount of warpstone that has gone into its forging means that even upon placing their hand around the hilt, the wielder begins to succumb to the radiation. Unless one can avoid it, the exposure is all but guaranteed to kill them. The second: This weapon w as such ys cut-throat society. Watch your step, watch your back, and obey the Counas made when the Council of Thirteen, including The Horned Rat’s seat, were in unanimous agreement. All thirteen heads are required to send the blade out, andcil’s commands. Survive your decade with this in mind, and the circumstances will change accordingly - see down in Parting Ways for the exact explanation. If you purchased The Fellblade, a few changes will come about. You may choose to nullif the warpstone-radiation of the blade, leaving it still a potent and destructive weapon - bu it will not kill you by simply holding it. As well, the Council of Thirteen will be unable to look through the great gem set in the blade - instead, you may have allies and friend capable of spellcasting attune themselves to the warpstone gem in the sword. Onc attuned, they may grasp their connection to look through the sword and you, its wielder - and may use you as a proxy for their own spells, rituals, and auguries."

Secondly, the master Sword. This is quite possibly the most powerful version of the blade I know of, boasting two upgrades beyond its normal power, leaving it four times as powerful.

      "description": "Onox's goal for all intents and purposes seems to be nothing more than to cause as much destruction as possible. Whether he succeeded and you stole some, or you wrecked another country to get it, you now have a flicker from the Flame of Destruction. This flame has one very simple effect - things break. Stone crumbles, wood rots, the flesh fractures, and everything comes tumbling down. And as the flame inspires destruction, it feeds on the stolen life energy from those it brought to a close far too soon. The more you break, the brighter the flame burns. The brighter it burns, the easier things become to break. You can turn this effect off, at which point it will burn through its stored energy before going out. Relighting it is a real pain in the ass though, so be careful with that. But, as long as it is lit, you can channel that extra life energy into whatever you want. Onox took that energy and sent it away somewhere, for some reason. You? Do whatever you want. Destruction, it's good for your health."

It will defeat most creatures of darkness- such as the creatures invading Hyrule- in one blow. If an evil enemy cannot meet its demise even by the sword’s blade, it will instead seal them away for a time, or else force them to enter a cycle of reincarnation. The weapon also has the ability to deflect magical projectiles."

      "description": "All things die eventually. No matter how clever you are or what paradox you invoke to escape it, all that which is born ‘alive into this world will eventually leave it. And now, having seen such a thing up close at some point in your life, your body has internalized it in those beautiful eyes of yours. You are able to perceive ‘death’ itself on living beings and physical objects, appearing as thin red lines. When You touch or cut along these lines, the object or being in question is immediately cut deeply regardless of their durability, and attempts at healing or regeneration are greatly stunted -perhaps even made impossible for some beings, though the lines are thinner and more difficult to target the tougher a target is. At first, these lines are all you can perceive and influence, but after some time passes they will become clearer to your eyes and you will eventually see circular ‘points’ on their body that the lines all trace back to. Cutting or stabbing this point of death directly will immediately kill the target in question - no form of reincarnation, resurrection, or regeneration will save them from the bitter taste of death. This is what it means to kill something. With time and continued use, you may eventually be able to understand and perceive the concept of death in less tangible things, such as the spells of Magecraft or the empty space between you and an object, though the same general rules apply- and some things can only be ‘cut’, not ‘killed’, for they have no point of death. However, perceiving how fragile the world and existence as a whole really is...that’s something no human mind can truly bear witnessing. When your eyes are active, the perception of death trains the mind and can eventually cause a human brain to suffer a fatal aneurysm from continued use, and can also damage one’s sanity as they are constantly made to understand the concept of death all around them. Even to an inhuman mind that can sustain the physical damage and the sanity-straining view of entropy, they are tiring to use in the long-term without preparation or precautions. Secondly, the ‘points’ of death may never appear for certain beings- beings that were never ‘born’ or are free of the concept of death entirely, such as a True Ancestor at the peak of their power during the night of a full moon - you would have to remove the source of their immortality or introduce them to the possibility of mortality in a different way, which is beyond the scope of using these alone. The strain also increases the longer you perceive the death of things beyond living beings or physical objects, which can do great damage to your mind if you’re unprepared for it."

Furthermore, you have a personality to match, able to exude cheery innocence and mysterious seductiveness as you see fit. All of this is meant for the express purpose of a mermaid’s favorite pastime: drowning. You might stun a victim with your beauty and turn the drowning into a sensual if fatal encounter. Or you might treat your drowning efforts as a playful game, with an endearing innocence that makes few people willing to hate you even as you try to drown them, or willing to intervene. You don’t even need to speak a word; a simple smile or gentle caress on the hand is enough to get them into the water and never come back out. The skill works best for drowning people, but in general makes it easier to kill people without facing significant resistance; it can also be useful for extracting favors or information from people. Even so, it only increases the likelihood of people cooperating – it does not guarantee it, especially once they get in the water. The perk’s power is strengthened with Siren’s Song and vice versa."

On the flipside, if you cover your eyes and say, “I can’t see you, so you can’t see this,” you stop all magical/supernatural attempts to see you for as long as you keep your eyes covered."

Without a doubt, Shamans are a bit mad, being prone to trances and sudden spasms of fitful dancing. This embarrassing behavior can cause scenes around the camp that are awkward at best. It is hard to ignore the kind of hooting and arm-waving employed by an Orc Shaman, but the battle-hardened, no-nonsense green-skinned warriors go to great lengths to do so. The sight of a Shaman hopping about a disgruntled Warboss is not unusual. Such actions are naturally upsetting to a race that solves its problems with the application of swift and severe violence, but all Orcs know it is bad luck and dangerous to kick a Shaman. It isn't that a Shaman might leak green lightning bolts from his eyes (although that does happen); it is more that the superstitious greenskins are sure that Gork and Mork are watching. It is best not to abuse the favored of the gods, and so the Shaman's outlandish behavior is tolerated with a rare and unusual patience. Actions that are totally outside the norm for most would invite socal stigma but for you these actions are seen as something that has to be grudgingly tolerated. While this won't let you get away with punching the Warboss in the face it will allow you to drap him in strings of pearls even the oddest pretenses."

Small children and their dares would be far too scared to ever cross your word, the common grave robber or thief would hesitate to tread within the boundaries of land the taboo is set on, but hardened souls with a purpose won't falter so easily. In other words it will keep the laymen off a property you own, but not the settings villains, big bads, or cronies sent by a villain to burn your house down. The rest?

Also, a few of them have magical properties. Although they are heavy for humans and thieves, they are lighter than bubbles for mermaids, and you may adorn yourself with all of them without feeling the slightest weight; after the jump, the same applies to whatever form you wear them in. Any treasure you find in the water can become a part of your collection, and it will be altered into a beautiful accessory with the same weightless properties as the others; any special properties that it had before are retained in the new version, though their powers may have been reduced in the process of changing their composition. However, the items are only weightless in the water; although they are still light if you prop yourself up on adjacent rocks and shoreline, once you are far enough away from water, they regain their full weight. If you have also purchased the They’ll Sweetly Drown You perk and the Mermaid’s Comb item in addition to Mermaid Treasures, your appearance becomes drop-dead beautiful, such that any person seeing you face with insufficient willpower or magical resistance will be charmed into an entranced daze and do almost anything for you as long as all the necessary items are on your person."

You are most proficient at manipulating brain waves, allowing you to induce madness or hallucinations depending on the strength of your opponent's will. You can also manipulate light and sound waves to deceive the senses indirectly, from concealing the paths of your projectile attacks, to creating after-images of herself, to casting wide-area illusions that cause people to get lost. As a cherry on top, you are also capable of releasing waves from your eyes in a destructive blast. Though you are flexible in the variety of waves you can manipulate, waves besides brainwaves, visible light waves, and sound waves are much more difficult to do so. Controlling more powerful or conceptual waves will be out of your control entirely."

For instance, wearing a pirate’s outfit would make you more like a pirate, while slipping on a child’s dress would make you into a child yourself; you could even change gender by wearing the opposite sort of clothing. More than that, you will begin to gain the skills and powers of the normal wearer – by wearing a mage’s robe you would naturally start to learn magic, and by putting on a caveman’s primitive attire you would gain increased strength. If the clothes stand out as unique and belonging to a specific person, you may also adopt more specific skills and powers associated with that individual. However, the longer you wear the clothing, the more it influences you, until you may very well become what you were dressed as; fortunately, if you can find the will to take the clothes off and keep them off long enough (the amount of will and time increases with the duration of the wearing, though), you will return to your old self. If the perk were feasibly linked with Mixed Identity, people would likely be unable to associate your normal self with the person you are dressing as."

This guardian can be quite over-zealous at times, acting to counter even unlikely threats with great force when it believes the need exists. But there are apparently ways to escape it’s sight, and that of similar beings, even when what you’re trying to hide genuinely is a threat. Similar to how the Ryougi managed to hide their efforts to create Shiki’s third personality and connection to the Root, you are able to hide yourself and your actions from higher beings. Metaphysical forces like the Counter Force, gods of older times, cosmic beings like Arayashiki or Gaia itself, even the sorts of greater beings that expand well beyond a single world. The methods involved vary depending on the scale. Just hiding yourself from the Collective Will of Humanity may manifest as a special form of self- hypnosis that is easy to maintain, whereas preventing higher cosmic creatures from noticing large magical rituals involving dozens of participants may require an expensive and time consuming spell of its own. In future worlds, you’ll find it always possible to quickly discover various ways to hide from various such beings. This protection can potentially be bypassed should you in some way draw their direct attention or be found by agents they have of a lesser nature, so overt action should still be taken with care."

By placing your hand on someone asleep, you can access the subject’s memories and move them around as you see fit. You cannot destroy or alter memories, only view and move them. Also, as memories are never truly lost, only misplaced only of your reach, this ability allows you to counter amnesia in your charges, even those suffering from the Forget Me Not drawback; however, it does not grant you immunity to memory loss yourself. To access a person's memories, he or she needs to sincerely trust you, but actual consent is unnecessary, as children don't always know what's good for them like their mothers do. However, the ability only works when the subject is asleep; if he or she wakes up unexpectedly, you will lose whatever unfinished progress you made with the memories. If you are handling more than one person at once, you can also move a memory from one person’s collection to the other’s; on the other hand, it’s going to take you much longer to properly finish the process if you do so (and you have less time to do so, seeing as just one of your darlings waking up will spoil the whole transfer) – plus, unless the moved memory was in someplace unnoticed in the clutter and its new place is likely out of obvious sight, at least one of your subjects will quickly recognize that something is wrong after waking up. Mother Knows Best allows you to apply the power to anyone who views you as their parent and ensure that nobody will prematurely wake up until you are finished. Shadow Sewing combined with this allows you to “sew” memories together."

But more than that, you can influence the dream setting. You could potentially dream new beings into existence, though you only provide the general framework; they will become unique individuals, perhaps with things you didn’t expect. And anything that was created by the dream can be controlled by you, though it takes direct focus, and it is hard for you to control too many or strong-willed beings at one time. In time, if you put enough thoughts into your dreams, they can coalesce into solid worlds in their own right, ones that you can easily access; however, once the reality of a dream solidifies it becomes harder for you to change or control it, though you still have some power over it. In addition, you now gain your Wonderland form (assuming you have one) as an alternate form you can transform into at any time; if you already have or didn’t have a Wonderland form, feel free to pick another. In addition, pick from your Wonderland form or any of the other Wonderland forms: now, regardless of form, you have access to all the normal beneficial natural abilities for that race (the ones that come with that form, not jump-fiat perks).

You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events inMisaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modernMagecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in that particular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Hypnosis is a basic form of mental manipulation that most other magi and supernatural beings can resist with ease, but can be used to manipulate and erase the memories of ordinary human beings, which enables them to operate in secret."

However, other forms are known as well. Tiny humanoids, bizarre shapes with feet and mouths, and the like. None of these are ever more than one foot long or one foot tall, and now you possess one as well! They tend to come in four types - Assistant, Spell, Power, and Warrior, tailored to aid in mundane tasks, cast minor spells, store small amounts of arcane power for later use by their masters, and protect their masters in combat respectively. You may choose which of these your familiar is, its appearance (though take care not to have it mistaken for a Daemon), and minor details of its personality, though it shall always be an example of its type. Please note that while it is possible to create more than one such familiar, this can result in them fighting to the death for your undivided attention. Should your familiar perish, this also comes with knowledge of the means by which another might be created. Ah, yes! Should you already possess a similar magical familiar, you may use this option to instead grant that familiar one of the four familiar “types” and thus add to its skillset in this way."

Outside of just a specialisation in magic, you appear to get significantly greater results than normal in anything regarding familiars. Your efforts to create them result in more powerful creatures made for less costs, while attempting to attract existing creatures to become your servants most often ends in a quite powerful new ally who is rather lenient in their required contract. You’ll quickly become well versed in using multiple familiars in your goals, particularly making use of them in combat instead of fighting yourself, and even find that maintaining familiars is relatively cheaper for you. A weak magus might not be much of a threat but if he had ten loyal spirits aiding him, they could most certainly take down even much larger game. In particular, any magecraft you know will soon reveal to you ways that it can be entwined with any familiars you have, sometimes stretching the boundaries of what’s normally possible in those disciplines when used for your focus here. Often methods to enhance your familiars during creation or battle, it may also show ways to create entirely new kinds of familiars. Perhaps a Doll Making specialist would learn to make familiars out of their own selves with this, an army of one!"

One would think halflings would be sensible and stick to their ponies and rams, but alas. We aren’t sensible. You have in your care just such a baby dragon, a tad too ‘ickle’ to fully use its breath attack and small enough that its scales are still a tad soft, but still savage enough with its teeth and claws. The hatchling’s a Fire Dragon of the World’s Edge Mountains, and in time it will grow into a ferocious fire-breathing monstrosity that has earned its place at the top of the food chain. But for now, it's small enough to bear a pony’s saddle and bear a halfling’s frame. How’s that going to change once it grows up? Well that’s not my problem now is it."

Somewhere along the line someone thought to weaponize them, resulting in this set of four pint sized statues of the Hero of Men. Each one bears a miniature Four Sword, a shield, and a secondary weapon - a false fairy for healing, a bomb for exploding, a bow for shooting, and a handful of Rupee fragments for throwing at people. Individually they’re quite weak, only able to take down the weakest of monsters, but together they can reliably take down more normal monsters. Each of them comes with a small supply of their miniature ‘ammunition’, but it’s not quite enough to fight for more than an hour or two per day unless you stock up first.

The less familiar you are with an object, the harder it is to summon.

To become a familiar, a ritual occurs in which a mage mystically bonds the familiar to their soul, allowing them to see through the familiar’s eyes and have it perform tasks on their behalf. Spirits in turn may use the mage as an anchor to stay in the material world for prolonged periods of time, experiencing all they have to offer. Spirits come in one of two forms: Twilight familiars are invisible and largely intangible unless they utilize their spiritual powers to affect the fallen world. These powers are diverse and include (but are not limited to) one of the following abilities; telekinesis, aura reading, minor curses, minor blessings, small electrical discharges and ectoplasmic formation. All of these uses however draw from the familiars innate pool of mystical energy, and when this is depleted, it cannot interact with the physical world until it has recharged."

Despite taking the same wounds, your body is unnaturally enduring. The second is an enormous natural talent for magecraft relating to the channeling and controlling of spirits, not enough to match a Risen Legend but enough to become quite well known should you be trained. More importantly, that talent is the basis of the core power of the Fujo. ESP, or the projection of their spirit from their bodies. Leaving your physical form resting behind you, you can move as a spirit in the world, your power dictated by your magical energy. Possessing and controlling humans directly becomes far easier and you already know how to bind the spirits of the recently dead to your service while in this form.

By forming a bond or a pact with a willing magical being, you may summon that being forth and fight or work alongside them. You have a particular talent with this, letting you summon magical beings from this world and others so long as said connection exists and is established, generally being appropriate for what world you’re in. This also gives you a talent for transportation magic, letting you teleport items and people to you so long as you have some way to connect to them. Good for surprise parties!"

For instance, a wolf will run away in terror if you bend over and stare at them backwards with your head between your legs; if you draw a line in the dirt around yourself and dare anyone to cross it at their own peril, a full pride of lions will not pass over the barrier; and bears will hesitate to attack their own kind, even if it is just you in disguise or with a teddy bear. Please note that an animal sufficiently antagonized with you may push aside its qualms and still try to attack. Also, as the composition of the creature moves away from the natural end of the spectrum and more toward an alien or magical beast (since Neverland’s beasts are somewhat magical, the shift is less sharp on the magical end), the solutions become increasingly complicated; even so, the solution will always be within your capabilities."

Spirits in turn may use the mage as an anchor to stay in the material world for prolonged periods of time, experiencing all they have to offer. Spirits come in one of two forms: Embodied familiars possess all the same benefits as Ephemeral familiars save that they also have a physical form (usually that of a small animal) allowing them to interact with the fallen world as any flesh and blood creature would without the need to spend the mystical energy to do so. Familiars may also help to aid in dealings with other spirits, acting as messengers or go­-betweens. If time and effort is invested into a familiar they may become more spiritually powerful. This however is a task best suited for those with a deep and thorough understanding of Spirits and the Spirit Arcana."

Because of her nature as a being born of emotion and magic rather than flesh, she has a strong ability. This perk gives you that ability as well. This allows you through magical power to divide your power into two or more equal copies. These parts are all equally you and yet not you. In this way, death will only truly come if all the versions of you are slain. This allows you to split up and run if you face certain death. That said, you will be unable to return to your full power until all versions of you have either fused back into one being, or there is only one of you left. If the other yous died to get to one remaining, your power will come back slowly, over time."

Cycles of reincarnation have been dreamed about by religion and philosophers for a long time, but an eternal sticking point is the inevitable death of the ego as the soul passes between lifetimes. How fortunate you’ve found a way to preserve yourself, abilities and all, into the next life you appear within. Now, normally that's a timetable measured in generations, but since we don’t have that sort of time, I’ll throw you a bone. When you are completely slain, your spirit will flee to the nearest compatible vessel- usually human, but any other ‘race’ you possess a form for is also valid - and will quietly began to overtake their consciousness as they manifest your abilities and monstrous nature,assimilating their personalities into your own as you consume their being and add it to your own. You are able to wander for a time as a bodiless soul and choose your desirable vessel, if you so wish. This ordinarily takes years, but you can completely overtake an ordinary human being within weeks - you won’t even need to possess an infant to do so, you may overtake adults and teenagers just as easily. Once you are made whole and have assumed full control,you keep all the benefits your host gives you, and you are free to reincarnate once again should you be slain yet again. Though I will warn you - while most humans you choose as a vessel in this world are doomed,stronger beings may excise you with ease or destroy your soul completely before you can take them, and that happening to you will make death will embrace you. While your soul incubates within its newest host, you are vulnerable, and should they be slain before you complete your rebirth, this immortality will not save you and you will truly die. Should your consciousness not take complete hold of the host before your time in the jump expires, it will be considered a failure. In addition, your soul remains vulnerable, and powerful magical weapons could burn it away completely. Until that day comes? Eternity is yours. Hmm? This sounds familiar?...you think so?"

The Godword, the Unified Language, is the original tongue that existed, but not necessarily spoken, before all living things were separated and categorised, before humanity was divided from the beasts and the plants and the dirt and the dust. It is Truth, something no human can reject. They’d have to reject their very existence as a human to do so. Those who speak this language, impossible remnants of a time that does not exist in this history, can thus command humanity. As one of only two living users of the language, you can take dominance over any human that hears your words. It is impossible to resist for true humans, though those with a connection to the Root or similar traits can mitigate the commands. For all others, it acts as an absolute hypnosis that lasts until a day after they last heard your command. It goes much deeper than just the mind or body however. Telling someone that they cannot see you would render you invisible to them. Telling someone that their magic cannot affect you would cause it to fail. These are orders that imprint on the deepest part of someone’s being. Your words must be heard however and even simple earplugs can rob you of your power against someone. The Godword only applies to humans and even mixed heritage with non-humans grants the chance to resist, with non-humans ignoring it entirely. A sign some might take to prove humanity’s destiny for civilisation and dominance over others. It also relies on intent, your desire to order others. If you wish, you can simply communicate across all language barriers with other humans without the control."

However, due to...a few mishaps in the seal, the Phantom requires no mana to sustain itself. However, it does have a desire that you can help it fulfill. You see, this Mephisto Phantom wants nothing more than to bend other Phantoms to its will. While you may use some common magical rings(Connect, Chain, and Barrier) with this belt, it has a few specialties. For one thing, you are able to unlock and enter the Underworlds of Gates without needing to wait for them to enter a despairing state. And its greatest ability is the use of the “Pact” ring, which can seal a weakened Phantom or a Ghoul and enslave it to your will. Ghouls will become your servants while Phantoms are converted into rings themselves, which you are able to summon by passing them over the Hand Autor the same as any other magic ring. Phantoms stronger(or healthier, at least) than yourself will resist a Pact and can break out of the magic seal before being completely transformed. While this suit itself cannot fight well, the summons have no limit...so you don’t quite need to be that strong, do you? (CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.) Aha, you have the power of the Missing Piece? Excellent. You see, Phantoms are not that common in this world...Relying on them for summons when a Rider is around defeating and destroying them...It’s not sustainable. Which is why now, you can force yourself into the Underworld of any person, not just a Gate, to bind their Phantom. They won’t become a Gate, but you’ll find SOMETHING to try and defeat in there, at Least. (CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 and The Sorcerer's Apprentice - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.) Wait, if you’ve obtained the Missing Piece...Is it true? Are you also the Sorcerer's Apprentice? Then this art won’t be a stranger to you… You’re not limited to forcing the Pact on Phantoms anymore, no. You can force other supernatural entities into the form of Summonable rings as long as they’re weaker than you(same as Phantoms), keeping them all in a safe and inescapable form as a Magic Ring. What a wonderful technique!"

      "description": "An ornate casket, summoned and dismissed at your will to appear before you at any time. Normally stored in some distant tomb, it is always accompanied by two elite undead guards. The Casket of Souls, one of many of its kind, was used to store away the souls of all of a Tomb Kings’ enemies, though only the greatest and richest of Kings could afford such an artefact. Among the most powerful magical items in Nehekhara, you are one of the Casket Keepers and thus have the right to summon it and its guards to your aid. Whenever it is summoned you find your magical energies empower significantly, though only once you incant a short ritual to open the Casket’s lid does its’ true nature become clear. Once opened, countless thousands of tormented, angry spirits will race out to devour the life force of any of the Casket Keeper’s enemies, leaving no physical wounds and yet destroying the souls of all but the truly powerful warriors and monsters. Even witnessing the light emitted from within the casket is enough to burn away at a man’s face, even if he is spared from the furious spirits within. Another incantation is all that is required for the spirits to be recalled to the Casket and sealed again. You also know the rituals to seal more souls into the casket, though be aware that its wards cannot hold everything, whether that is measured in power or quantity."

She is incredibly powerful, able to bless her children with new magical abilities, seal away ancient kingdoms such as Panthalassa, and even reincarnate the recently dead as babies. However, she can only be summoned for a short time and generally can only be asked to perform one major task before her spirit fades away again, until the seven sing once more. Now, by combining your powers with six partners and singing in unison with full faith and passion, you can summon Aqua Regina. Even without summoning her, your unified powers become incredibly powerful, enough to overcome otherwise unstoppable foes."

On the plus side, as your projected body is not truly alive, you do not suffer from any potential afflictions such as hunger, thirst, or disease, and any damage to your projected body does not actually hurt you (though it might still be painful). For humans, you automatically enter an indefinite sleep/coma as long as you are projecting yourself, but you can also project yourself if you are in a petrified, inanimate, paralyzed, or otherwise immovable state (including your soul being trapped in some sort of item). When either your real body or your projection travels to a separate reality/location from your other self, the projection will end, but you can choose whether your projection will snap back and be reabsorbed into your real body or if your real body will instead teleport to your projection’s location and merge back together there."

When the Sword is drawn from its holder, it will cause its wielder to split apart into four separate versions of themselves, each nearly identical to the original. The sole physical differences between the different clones is the tones of their voices, some are deeper than others, and the color of their clothing (in Link's case, his different clones along with himself are colored the four aforementioned colors). The great weakness of the Four Sword is the fact that you and your clone selves all carry the same life force into battle. Wounds on any one of the four are shared across all the four of you should one of them be fatally wounded you all will die. In addition you all share the same resources when it comes to things like your Mana/Ki/Psoinic Points/Etc. You can have it so that like the non-canonical manga has depicted the Four Sword as causing the different colored clones to represent different sides of one's psyche as well. The four can work together as a team or they can work independently should the need arise as well. When drawn you may choose whether you split up or not."

      "description": "In the world of Drakengard, a magical Pact can be made between a human and a magical beast. The benefits are numerous: both parties are magically strengthened, any wounds they have at the time of the pact are healed including ones that would otherwise be lethal, the Pact Partners can hear each other's thoughts and feelings, the creature gets to feed off of the humans negative emotion and the human gets a magical bodyguard by way of ‘If I die, you die too.’ Oh yeah, the negatives. Well, first of all, if either of the Pact Partners dies, the other dies too. They’re bound together for life. Also, Pacts have a price the human partner has to pay. They lose a physical part of themselves, one of personal importance. If you long to see your homeland again, there go your eyes. If your greatest joy is holding your child in your arms, guess what you lose? No, not the child. Your arms, smart guy. Why doesn’t the magical creature have to pay a similar price? Well, because life's unfair, Pumpkin. Go cry in the corner about it. I can already tell what you’re thinking: That sounds kinda shit. Why am I spending 900 points on this when I can just find a creature during my ten years in this jump and form a Pact later. And I’m getting to that. First of all, do you know how hard it is to find a magical creature that’ll form a Pact with a human. They do have their Pride after all, and humans in Drakengard have a pretty shit reputation, what with all the genocide against sub-humans going on. And even if you do manage to form a Pact there’s no guarantee that your Partner will like you, be easy to work with, or in extreme cases, commit suicide just to get rid of you because they hate you that much. Which brings us to the first benefit of buying a Pact now. Your Pact Partner, whatever you chose, will be a good fit for you personality wise. You may butt heads, you may argue from time to time but you’ll always make up quick enough. Most of the time though, you’ll just enjoy each other’s company and work together well while you watch each other’s backs. Or you can make a Pact with an Imported Companion. I’m assuming you already have a good working relationship with them, right? The second extra benefit is that the healing energy from when the Pact was formed has stuck around and is providing a benefit. Now, instead of ‘if one of you dies, you both die’, it’s ‘neither of you die until both of you die’. It doesn’t matter how badly one of you is injured, until the other one is dealt a mortal wound as well, you’ll survive. Minor downside, you’ll be forced to endure all the torturous pain your Partner is in and vice versa until the injured party can heal, but that’s a small price to pay for not dying when killed, right? Thirdly, your power sharing goes beyond the usual bland, nondescript power boost. Now you can actually use each other’s strengths and abilities. If your Partner is a dragon, congratulations! You’re as strong and tough as they are, you can breath fire and even fly under your own magic power. They’ll also gain access to all your abilities. Yes, including your Jumper Perks. Yes, really. And finally, you can bring your Pact Partner along when this Jump ends and you go to a different one. They’ll take up a Companion slot, but that’s fine right? Not only that, but each time you arrive in a new jump, you can add a new person or creature to your Pact, so long as they’re sapient. Let me make you read that right. I didn’t say ‘form a new Pact.’ I said ‘add a new Pact Partner’. So all three of you can share powers and all three of you need to die for you to stay dead. And the next Jump, it’s all four of you. And the one after that, all five. Now, you don’t have to keep adding Pact Partners in each Jump. You can, but it’s not required. Each new Pact Partner does take up another Companion slot, and if you ever enter a Jump without all your Pact Partners present, you and the Pact Partners that do join you lose the benefits of the Pact. But still, good deal, am I right?"

Think about it. You wouldn’t want to die just so some asshole you’ve never met claiming to be the “real” you can use your body, right? Well, you and… erm, you have managed to find a solution, somehow. By finding common ground, your Gestalt self and Replicant self have joined together once again. The results are impressive. Your body has been enhanced and you’re now able to use magic if you weren’t before. Similar to Kainé’s powers after getting possessed by a Shade, except you don’t have to worry about losing control and hurting people. After all, you are you. You’re one mind and soul, not two different minds fighting for control of one body. If you happen to miss being two separate entities for some reason though, you’re in luck. For a limited time, you can separate your Gestalt from your Replicant, letting the one fight as two. During this time, your Replicant loses the ability to use magic but keeps the enhanced physicality. Meanwhile, your Gestalt is a powerful one, similar to a Boss Shade, though not on the level of the Shadowlord. So of course it can wreck shop. Your Gestalt and Replicant may have different personalities while separated, however you’re still you, so you don’t have to worry about either half going rogue. When the timer is up, you’ll be forcefully re-merged unless something prevents the process. If that happens, you’ll both grow weak and vulnerable, until you eventually die. If you aren’t a Replicant and you take this perk, it still works. By strengthening your inner soul, you gain the power boost and magical abilities. When you separate, you summon your true self to fight alongside you. What? No, it’s not a Stand! Or a Persona! Shut up!"

The Red is a cosmic force which pervades nearly all organic animal life in the universe. As the guardian and avatar of it, you are able to communicate with, command, and transform into non-sapient animals. You can also draw on the aspects of animals near you, gaining speed from a cheetah, strength from a bull, the sense of smell of a bloodhound, and so on. Eventually, your mastery can extend to creating animal life from nothing, potentially calling forth even things long extinct. The Blue is much the same as the Red, but concerns water and aquatic life instead. The power over and ability to transform into or create animals is the same, only now applying to things that dwell within the water. And, for that matter, you also possess power over and ability to transform into water itself. The Green is similar yet distinct from the others. Where they are bound to animals, it is the source of all plant life. As the Avatar of the Green, you are able to control and create plant life, as well as fuse with the ecosystem of a planet, potentially appearing from or being aware of any and every plant in the world, or fusing with a tree in America and stepping out of a bush in Africa. With mastery of your powers, you may be able to create elementals to serve you or grow a forest in minutes. The Black is the embodiment of death and decay. As the Avatar of the Black, you are an agent of death. Not the cute goth kind, either. Plagues, famine, rot, necromancy, you’re walking proof that all things come to an end. All those manifested at your will, allowing you to potentially devour the life of untold numbers of beings and then raise their remains or command their spirits to do your bidding. With time, killing half a nation and flooding the rest with the living dead is well within your capabilities. The Grey is very similar to the Green, but instead serves as the source of fungus. Your abilities as the Avatar of the Grey are somewhere between those possessed by an Avatar of the Green and an Avatar of the Black, allowing you to consume life to rapidly spread your infectious fungus at terrifying rates. Nearly anything the Green can accomplish, so too can you, but with fungus instead. You also have the ability to infect other elementals and add them to a hive mind that you command."

There’s a hidden room in the back of the building that leads to a private shrine, where influences of the Forge and Knock congregate."

After all, you’re looking into absurd-sounding power sources like Magic and Cosmic Energy. You have a good store of data on its historical relevance and the abstract theories of both, if not any practical usage. Academics, however, have a bit more responsibility in addition to this...but a lot more potential. Academics may find they’re now in charge of or otherwise deeply able to affect the policies of a very well-off academy for talented and unique youngsters, with a good standing that is extremely difficult to tarnish. These students all have something to bring to the table, even if it’s not immediately obvious. Perhaps you can bring out their inner star...or their last hope."

With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that a fully grown and a fully empowered Maku Tree is infested with fairies. Specifically, atop its limbs are a number of small caverns made from branches and leaves, and inside each one is a weak fairy. Now, in and of themselves, they aren’t terribly strong. Make no mistake, each one can heal you of the most grievous wounds, but they would only be able and or willing to do so once. However, every now and then one of them might find or make something useful to you - fairies are often pretty important to the hero's journey, you know? But, since future jumps likely won’t have a Maku Tree unless you go out of your way to make one, the Shrine can relocate itself to any heavily wooded forest, jungle, or similar local, often near your starting location."

Even so, individuals with strong willpower can refuse to play by your rules and free themselves from your restrictions.

Despite appearing to be a small shack on the outside, it is actually quite large inside, with full shelves lining every wall from top to bottom. No matter how far you look up or down or left or right, you will find more shelves and goods. Essentially, the shop automatically fills with any common items that could be sold in whatever world you’re in (for instance, any standard equipment/gear available in Wonderland will be present); whenever you enter a new world, all previous goods remain (but aren’t necessarily replaced if they aren’t common in the new world anymore) and are supplemented with new items to fit with the new world. In addition, whenever a potential customer enters the store and has a conscious or unconscious desire for a certain sort of good that wouldn’t normally be there (such as a magical item), said item(s) have a 1-in-3 chance of becoming part of the shop’s inventory. So essentially, the shop has nearly everything you could want...if you can find it. And that’s not always easy, as the items are all randomly placed amongst the shelves (and shuffled whenever anyone enters or leaves the shop), and all tracking powers and the like are disabled in the shop. In addition, none of the items on the shelves are actually real – not yet, at least. As long as they remain unbought on the shelves, they remain only half-real. They only become real and usable once bought, and even the owner of the shop must pay for purchases for the items to function. Items removed from shelves and the store without payment will quickly vanish and reappear back on the shelf. And keep in mind that the rarer or more powerful the item, the higher the price; magical items, for instance, often have exorbitant prices that will always tax your resources heavily regardless of your wealth."

This energy would normally power the Spirit Tracks, but in the absence of that, it instead channels that energy directly into you. Well, not you specifically. A temple isn’t a very good house, so you’ve also been provided with a small refuge from the prying eyes of the world, a Sanctuary of sorts. The energy is channeled there, in part to maintain its defenses, both physical and mystical.

Keep in mind though, these gates have a Force Gem atop them, and you’ll need to strike them with a bomb from your canon to add them to the network.

You may change the interior of the castle to your will, making anything from a luxurious manor to an eldritch hell only a monster could find comfortable. Your connection also causes your power, even those not tied to your nature as a True Ancestor, to wax and wane with the phases of the moon - during the night of a new moon, there is no change, but during a full moon, your strength and powers are magnified several times over. And when you dwell within the Castle itself, your power is always at its peak from this boost, functioning the same as the night of a full moon. An ordinary human (as miraculous as it maybe) with this could lift a tank one-handed on the night of a full moon. The might of a True Ancestor is likewise increased even further than before in the light of the moon, letting you outmatch others of your kind save for your two ‘siblings’. Perhaps in a few centuries, this fragment’ could grow into something matching the original...though that night is far, far away. If you prefer a more...’talkative’ source of power, you may take the exclusive companion for this perk ‘The Moon’s Shadow’ for free."

You own a sizable building, likely a large apartment complex or mansion or mall of some kind. The main requirement is that it has space for a large number of people to live, or at least be stored. This is because that is the case, with up to 64 families living in the location at once. If they are not kept as cattle outright, the people here will be none the wiser as to what is going on. With the many secret rooms present in the building, it’s easy to hide whatever you desire to do to them, and the building itself has some sort of effect that makes any resident extremely reluctant to leave and very easy to mould as you please. But the second and more valuable step to this is that the entire structure is your workshop as a Magus. The most immediate effect is that, due to incredibly unique enchantments and links to you, you are able to instantly teleport anywhere within the building and retain a near-omniscient awareness of all space and events within it. In at least one of the secret rooms of the building, if not several, you will find a fully equipped Magus Workshop of great value to a Magus of your skill and specific specialties. The tools, reagents, materials, peer research if any exists and more will be found. While rare consumable materials will be understandably rare and truly exceptional things for your level will not appear, the Workshop will slowly grow as your mastery of magecraft does and slowly resupply whatever might be used up that the Workshop itself spawns through this option."

Turning magecraft to mundane profit can be quite lucrative, as can be said for psychic powers or unnatural talents. You have a business of some sort that’s well suited towards your particular talents in this jump or will come into the ownership of one in adulthood. It’s already got a building to itself, some four storey and relatively well furnished if dusty location. A storeroom, a nice office and space for workshops if you have the time to set one up. It might be a private investigator agency, a mercenary outfit, an ancient antique shop or a exotic animal store. What makes the business special is the employees, rather than the location itself. The business naturally attracts employees in situations that have great need of employment outside of the usual channels. More importantly, they often have quite unique abilities. Usually moderately powerful psychic abilities, Demon Hunter heritage or even lesser non-human creatures like a few fairies that spy on others in exchange for sweets. Every few years, you’ll be able to take on a more valuable ally. Someone with a powerful pair of mystic eyes, a Dead Apostle that wants to live among humans or some other powerful entity. They’re easy to get along with and gain the loyalty of, potentially even coming along with this business as followers if you can gain their trust and devotion. If you merely desire an ordinary business without the penchant for attracting unnatural allies, you can buy one that otherwise works the same as the above for 300CP instead, still discounted to students."

Once you've defeated the enemy, you can release your barrier and the world will revert to what it was before. Normal people will be sealed outside the barrier, and won't notice anything going on inside, but people with magical abilities or powers may be able to walk right into it, suddenly finding themselves in the middle of a war zone. Also, be careful - if you lose the fight, your barrier will collapse, and all of the damage will suddenly appear in the real world.

But that isn’t what makes this house truly special, nor is it the fact that it is filled with entire societies, or that it is alive and bound to you. No, what makes this house truly unique and of singular value is that it is a crossroads of reality. The House is connected to every single point in space and time and this gives it the ability to slip between the layers of reality and appear anywhere you wish, be it a planet on the other side of the great black beyond or another dimension altogether. There are few places the house cannot go and it'll be all too happy to do So. The final noteworthy abilities that the House possesses is that it can be summoned to your location with nothing but a mental call and that in a similar way, anyone who accepts your invitation into the House can be summoned back into it at any time you wish. Couple more things worth mentioning: this house cannot be permanently wrested from you; your bond may be temporarily blocked to prevent you from summoning it, but no one else can usurp it and you may allow inactive companions to roam inside of it."

Within this jump, you have the ability to pull the visions of dreamers closer to the island, until their imaginations blend to become an extra addition to the island. In any following jumps, you can create a new “Never Land” hub for dreams in that world, allowing the imaginations of children and the like of that universe to coalesce together into an island. However, each dream world is bound to the universe of that jump, and it must stay behind when you go. Also, while you can be selective on which dreams are the key pieces of the island, you cannot apply your own dreams to the Never Lands. Moreover, the dreams that embody the island are limited to those of childish whimsy, meaning that the creations can be somewhat limited, at least by grown-up expectations. That doesn’t mean that the magic in the dreams aren’t powerful or that conflict there is harmless, but rather that “cool” and “fun” matter more than overall effectiveness. So good luck trying to actually make productive use of that dream about an awesome superweapon...you’re going to need it. Plus, it’s typically harder to impose these dreams outside of your little Neverland hub. If you took the Escort for the Innocent Dead perk, you can guide dead souls into the dream worlds – whether Neverland or a new one of your creation and reincarnate them in a form of your choice in that world; once they have been reincarnated, they are now essentially in between life and death, so they could stay in the dream forever, go to the real world and potentially die eventually under normal circumstances, or eventually let go and pass on to the next life like they were originally meant to."

Your artworks now exist on two planes: in the real world as inanimate objects, and in another world as living things. The paintings in the real world act as windows of sorts for their living counterparts in the other world, but they cannot physically interact with the real world. The real and unreal are bridged through a special painting, the Fabricated World, which can appear and disappear anywhere in the real gallery at your command; whenever someone stares deep and long enough at the tapestry, you can pull him or her into your other world. Within your painted world, you can give life to your artwork (even without Paint to Life) and use their full magic potential without needing to drain your own reserves (as long as they stay inside the Fabricated World). If you purchased Claimed for Posterity, any person who dies inside the gallery will automatically turn into another of your artworks. These galleries are self-sustaining once you pour in the initial energy. The galleries you create will link together and follow you between jumps and are accessible from your Warehouse when not summoned; you can also continue to add new pieces to and remodel your old galleries as you see fit. You can allow yourself to dissolve and merge into the gallery as a whole to control it at will, place special messages on wall or paper, and exist in that fragmented yet all-seeing state indefinitely; however, you are able to regather yourself and return to normal when you wish. If you fuse your soul to the gallery, you may be able to find ways to apply other powers you have to the form of the dungeon – for example, if you had some sort of control over fire you could perhaps make your gallery’s features resistant to fire or keep the gallery permanently on fire without any of your creations being harmed."

If nothing else, remember that an actual gold mine rests beneath your workshop, easily accessed and ripe for the harvesting. Let the State Troops provide their own Faith, yes, but for Steel and Gunpowder they would be wise to come to you. Of course, this workshop will follow you wherever you go."

To you, at least, there may be nothing special about it at all, besides acting as a vertical storage space for whatever you might fit inside. However, the structure itself seems to be absolutely saturated with Ulgu, to the point that without your seeking it, the tower becomes insubstantial, fading from reality entirely. Whenever you deign to locate it, it is precisely where you need it to be. Whenever you do not need to access it, it simply does not exist at all. This trait extends to anything you store inside, but only so long as it is stored inside. Do be careful if you intend to build anything around a core that exists less often than that which is attached to it."

In a similar way, these jewels may form portals or gates to places that might otherwise be beyond your reach, though doing so will expend their magic. This also allows you to bypass barriers that block off locations as well, in case your enemy has blocked the way. But that is not all they can do. For once upon a time, these jewels were known as the Elements, physical embodiments of earth, wind, fire, and water. With these, the broken Picori Blade was transformed into the legendary Four Sword, a magic blade that could rival the divine Master Sword. You may do the same now, uplifting a blade with only a minor enchantment into something demon kings would fear. No matter what you use it for, the magic within them will recharge upon your next jump, or in ten years time if you’re in a longer lasting jump."

Either way, you may manifest this world and impose it on The World, keeping it manifested so long as your magical reserves could sustain it before the World re-asserts its normal rules - though a Reality Marble that is only imposed on your own body could be sustained indefinitely, as the World itself does not see it as a contradiction to its own laws. While most Dead Apostles develop this trait naturally after some time and research, the benefit to purchasing it is worth noting. First, you suffer no degradation (physical or mental) from your chosen Reality Marble - one that requires a particular sort of insanity wouldn’t afflict you in anysort of way, nor would your personality be lost in a sea of various beings contained within it. Second, you may create your own or recreate a Reality Marble belonging to someone else in this world, though practice and effort would be needed to create something akin to TATARI and be able to sustain it for more than a short amount of time with what you start with. Third, it is based entirely on your experiences - so a ‘collection’ Reality Marble such as Unlimited BladeWorks or Ionian Hetairoi would be based on only what you have seen or experienced first-hand one way or another.

Like guardians. It was for this purpose that they were chosen as the locations of the castles of the Senshi that ruled and protected their world. These castles were fitted with the most powerful technology of the Silver Millennium. So great and advanced was the tech around it, and the architecture built so masterfully that it still stands today, in working condition. As if it was never almost demolished by the dark forces of Queen Beryl. This is probably because of the amazingly efficient self-repairing technology of the palace. It could create matter from nothing. Even when it’s owners were dead, it continued to function for almost a thousand years, off the almost infinite energy supply. It appears to cater to the owner and their guests’ every whim--no comfort is spared here. If you want food, you’ll find that it’ll appear right in front of you. You can contact other people from this Castle, and it can act as a base of operations. Unfortunately, the Sailor Castle of Mysterious Protectors could not stand the test of time--the massive CP Price is needed to completely repair the castle, as it lacked the self-repairing technology. The price has been lowered slightly for them, as they do still technically own the Castle. And if they buy the Castle, they’ll find that it has been given the self-repair system (plus defunct superweapon) free of extra charge. However, the castle’s superweapon, the cannon, is defunct. It was never included in th self-repairing system, as there was a chance something could go wrong without manual input and fire off the cannon. Thus, you will still need to buy the superweapon within it to be able to activate it, or fix it yourself. This castle is appropriately spaced and can act as a warehouse add-on if you wish or can be a floating base located in the setting’s orbit when you go to other jumps. In jumps with “strange” orbits, like a virtual reality world, this will become an add-on. You may change between the two during character creation at a jump. You may teleport here any time you like by simply raising your open palm to the sky with the command “Castle Teleport!.”​ ​Sailor Eris’s Castle is called Discordia."

With some experimentation, you can even learn to utilize your abilities with much more finesse, allowing for very specific usage of this magic that not only exerts much less stress overall, but offers far greater utility. Feats such as aging a planted seed to see it rapidly mature into a tree, or freezing a volley of bullets in midair in order to evade it becomes child’s play to you. As a bonus, having power over time means that whenever the passage of time is affected by someone else, you won’t be affected by it unless you will so, and will be aware whenever time is altered. Finally, since time is intertwined with space, after significant progression of your powers, you may find yourself being able to alter space itself by manipulating time in certain ways."

Whether you inherited it from your parent, usurped it from their control, or gained it in some other way entirely, this is a world all your own. It can be something associated with your parent, such as a section of Hell or a slice of Faerie, or it can be a dimension all its own. Whatever the case, within this dimension, your power is increased significantly as you gain dominion over all of the magical power that exists within the dimension. The world can be reshaped to your will, allowing you to change the environment as you wish or control the weather on a whim. By default, this dimension is roughly 20,000 square miles in size and you may choose to have it be inhabited by residents that are fitting to it. This could be anything from humans to elementals, fae to golems, or a variety mix. Whatever the case, these residents are absolutely loyal to you and can number anywhere from none to several million. Even outside of this dimension, you may draw on its power, though not nearly so much as while within and it is possible to block your attempts to do so. Drawing on its power outside of it does not increase your power, it simply allows you to recover your pool of magical energy much faster. You may also summon the residents outside of your dimension to serve you. You may also import another dimension you have to gain these effects. Each new jump you may choose if the dimension remains the same, is a copy of one of your previous dimensions, or if it is in a separate locale based on your desired settings, such as jungle, ocean, mountain top castle, hellscape etc. Should your dimension be a copy of an older one it will be populated by facsimiles of its previous inhabitants, should it be an old one it will have the original beings. Do note that these beings are not companions, and attempting to use the Dimension as a pod will leave whoever it is you tried to bring along in a safe spot in the dimension they entered yours from. You make your choice on if your Dimension is a copy, one of your old dimensions, or a new dimension the first time you access it each jump. Time in inactive dimensions is frozen. Post chain you may merge these dimensions together in whatever way you choose."

Sealing Mode does limit Device output a not insignificant amount, attacks made in this form, along with access to a ‘sealing’ spell allow the anomalous properties of objects and artifacts to be sealed, rendering them safe for handling. It also cancels out active effects of the object, for example separating someone from an artifact that’s possessing them. Once sealed, an artifact is even safe to handle and can be even used to a limited extent. Sealing does not last forever, however.

This allows your weapon to expand to an absolutely massive form, from ‘merely’ four times its normal size to a titanic version that can crush sand dragons like walnuts. There aren’t many caveats to this mode, and while the scaling can be technically infinite relative to your magical power, said infinite scaling cannot be said for the Device itself, which may need careful reinforcement the bigger you try to go with it.

The user can create electrical currents and signals with their magic, able to precisely modify the amperage or voltage as they please, up to the output of a car battery. The most useful technique, however, is the ability to run this magic through a circuit and be able to sense any errors or faulty wiring in the circuit. Like Fire Magic, Electric magic does not affect living beings like actual electricity would- You cannot actually electrocute someone with this magic."

      "description": "While considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era, the Cartridge System has nevertheless experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years, especially after it’s successful integration into more modern, non-Belkan Devices. The Cartridge System integrates a chambering mechanism not unlike those found on mass-based firearms into the Device’s body, usually somewhere behind what would be considered the ‘main body’ of the Device, which houses the core and most of its hardware. The chambering mechanism loads packets of compressed mana, also called cartridges – which take the form of bullet-like objects – into the Device, injecting more energy to be used by the system. The cartridges are prepared before the battle, and are analogous to nitrous in their usage, increasing performance and power at the cost of putting much more strain on the Device and it’s user. Without the proper reinforcement, some Devices can suffer self-inflicted damage, and their users can suffer internal injury from the sheer power involved. Ordinarily, unless excessive amounts of cartridges are being used, this is not a concern, but when paired with high-output systems such as the Fulldrive, it can quickly become crippling to both the Device and the user without reinforcement.

An ACS is built to aid in the breaching of strong defensive barriers by piercing them with a high energy charge, optionally followed by delivering a powerful spell through the breached barrier. While the acceleration is very high, with a massive top-speed, the ACS is not a very useful mobility tool, due to the difficulty maneuvering at high speeds, along with it’s high energy consumption. Devices that don’t have a melee-weapon they can use as the piercing mechanism will be able to generate a thin energy blade called a Strike Flame to serve as a spear point.

This can be problematic, as the Mage only has so many hands they can use, and juggling their Device can be problematic. This mode was developed for those situations, separating the Device’s main body to act as an independent, flight-capable drone, which frees the Mage’s hands for other uses, while the Device either acts on it’s own or according to it’s user’s instructions. This may seem mostly innocuous, but it involves an almost complete overhaul of the link between Mage and Device. Generally, Mages need to be physically holding their Device in order to link properly with it, to the point that disarming is a very serious concern to combat Mages. With this upgrade, these limitations are expanded to three or four city blocks, to the point where a Mage could potentially activate their Device and begin casting while they are in different rooms. Simply as a passive effect, this also makes a Device much more resistant to de-linking, making it harder to affect it with anti-magic as the bond between it and it’s user is strengthened. It also comes with the understandable caveat of increasing power consumption. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

In addition to the armament all Relics give off a field that immunizes their user and their immediate surroundings against the carbonizing touch of the Noise as well as allowing them to ignore the immaterial nature of the Noise, striking them as if they were material. As a last resort measure you may sing your Swan Song, performing a ridiculously powerful technique in exchange for heavy damage to your own body, generally enough to leave you out of action for a few days of intensive medical care. Better singing improves sync ratio, allowing faster recovery. You may choose any Relic outside your origin for an extra 100cp, Gear Candidates still pay this price. You may purchase additional relics with the same pricing scheme after your first. Note: Symphogears have a few common features, the most important of which being the barrier coating that allows them to ignore the carbonizing effect of the Noise, and their ability to 'tune' Noise into our dimension to destroy them. Symphogears also have maneuvering rockets mounted on them and are sealed against vacuum and high pressures. Argo, the ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed on. The user is draped in sails, allowing them to drift effortlessly in the air. It can summon forth pieces of the original ship, casting great rods and nets of rigging at it's targets. Argo is mostly defense focused, being able to summon hulls as defensive shields and laying traps of rigging and rope. Further experience with Argo's creation allows the creation of small boats and jet skis. The Argo does not possess an Armed Gear that can be wielded like a weapon in the normal sense, excepting the components of the ship, but it is capable of creating Argonauts; small spherical drones with an attached beam of energy. These drone are relatively fragile, but can overwhelm targets with sheer numbers. Specialized drones can be created with greater experience with the Gear. Argo's Swan Song revives the original Argo, a flying heretical ship controlled by the will of the user. The Argo appears to turn and accelerate with no regards to propulsion or cornering, and can release swarms of the Argonauts. In addition to the swarms of loyal drones and it's extreme speed, the Argo's very presence creates a great typhoon that it and it's wielder are completely unaffected by. Prometheus, the first flame. By calling forth embers of the original flame, a raging dimensional inferno can be started, burning both human and Noise alike. The flames spread and intensity can be limited by the wielder, and can be extinguished with a single thought, but left unchecked they burn incredibly violently. The wielder is protected from this raging heat by their Symphogear, and other Gears should have little trouble with the heat unless it is actively brought against them. The chains wrapped around the wielders arms can be used like whips at their most basic level, heating to strike at foes, but Prometheus' true Armed Gear is the projection of these chains into disposable axes of all kinds, with its truest form being that of an ashen chainsaw. These weapons bear superheated blades and chains, being able to burn through even the toughest Noise's defenses if they can get in range. Prometheus' Swan Song calls forth the full might of the stolen flame, engulfing all within a massive radius in an inferno that sears the flesh of enemies from bone while rejuvenating allies, bringing them back from the brink of death. Be warned however, fire is indiscriminate, and any targets that fail to be designated as allies will suffer the same fate as enemies. Kibisis, the sack that contained the Medusa’s severed head. The concept of ‘sack’ is a slight misnomer, however. The user is given an elaborate combination of robes, cloak and hood that would be quite modest if the bodysuit wasn’t so skimpy. While unassuming, the fabric that makes up Kibisis is actually a portal to an enormous self-contained pocket dimension, with the user able to manipulate the fabric to make openings into and out of it. This is as versatile and deadly as it sounds, as Kibisis is able to not only store objects, but also use the fabric to effectively ‘flash step’ by traveling along a thin corridor of silk, or create a razor thin portal along it’s edge to slice objects in half. Kibisis’ Swan Song generates a massive dimensional disturbance, manipulating space-time to instantly stretch and destroy huge areas, while also disrupting similar dimensional shenanigans. Kaladanda, staff of the god of death. As intimidating as it sounds, Kaladanda’s Armed Gear is actually a metal pipe. In fact, Kaladanda may as well be the tool of a plumber, as it may plant and grow all manner of water works and plumbing from itself, naturally lending itself towards creating steam-powered mechanisms, such as gigantic steam hammers and saws. What makes these pipes unique, however, is the crimson water that flows freely from them, which carries a unique anti-life property that causes it to shred through all physical and philosophical protections, completing erasing it’s target from reality in a manner reminiscent of a certain mirror. Kaladanda’s Swan Song calls forth the source of it’s deathly water – a colossal steam boiler which flashes a massive amount of it’s deadly contents into supercritical steam, which it forces into a tight, high-power beam to bore through even the toughest defenses. Be careful of friendly fire, although an attentive user can selectively halt the eroding effects of the steam on allies. Thunderbird, caller of storms. The wielder appears to be cloaked in a stormy haze, obscuring them from view unless they choose to disperse it. Thunderbird is capable of recalling the original bird's talons, incredible sight and agility to the user. Thunderbird's true power lies in its ability to generate 'feathers', razor-sharp shards that extend in whip-like wings from the wielder's body. They can generate electrical charge and control their own magnetism, allowing the wielder to levitate through repulsion and discharge anti-Noise lightning strikes with some buildup. It is also possible to use the wings as a conduit for a magnetic cannon. Thunderbird's Swan Song causes the feathers to disperse, floating freely around the wielder as the haze expands into a storm cloud, from which the wielder can direct massive lightning strikes. Anything coming into the storm cloud will find themselves suffering from the lethal discharges within it unless the wielder directs it away from them itself. The Holy Grail, the cup sought by King Arthur. Upon activation, one might notice that the Gear appears to be completely unarmed or protected aside from a standard (albeit slightly more armored) bodysuit provided by a Symphogear system, with the addition of what appears to be a cooking pot worn jauntily as a helmet. The Holy Grail is capable of generating cooking paraphernalia in all forms to serve in it's purpose of providing unlimited food and happiness to people. Cooking utensils that can, however, be easily used as lethal weapons. The Grail is semi-unique in that it's user can control it's implements remotely, starting with one or two implements at first, and growing to a few dozen with time. The Holy Grail's Swan Song summons a massive stadium around the wielder, enclosing all in a several hundred meter radius inside a massive oven that heats to extremely high temperatures. Within, the wielder can control as many objects as they can manage, regardless of whether they came from her own Gear. The biggest risk comes from the massive size of the oven, carrying the risk of capturing innocent bystanders in the radius. Enkidu, clay servitor. Instead of any sort of Armed Gear, Enkidu’s wielder is accompanied by a large, formless mass of technological ‘clay’ that emanates from fissures in the bodysuit armor. While limited in amount, the clay can be manipulated to take on different shapes and properties- provided it doesn’t stray too far from it’s wielder. One moment, it can be a rigid shield, then transform itself into a lethal explosive. Clay may be destroyed, but more is very slowly generated within the bodysuit. Enkidu’s Swan Song temporarily re-enables the clay’s ability to self-replicate, allowing it to consume vast amounts of material to create a huge swarm of clay. For the duration of the Swan Song, the clay may be used as normal, explosively detonating or collapsing into dust once it ends. Moly, the miracle herb grown from the blood of a giant. Mossy plants overtake the wearer’s hair, sprouting flowers and other sprouts in its place and down their arms- plants that the wielder can coincidentally fire and control like fine wires. Beyond the obvious application of monofilament cutters, these plants are capable of taking root in living things and draining their life force for energy, so long as a conduit exists back to the wielder. Stranger applications, such as plant-based exoskeletons or constructs, are also entirely possible. The Swan Song of Moly causes all plants connected to Moly to begin flowering, releasing clouds of corrosive spores which eat into enemy armor, creating chinks for more plants to grow into, allowing them to rapidly drain them of life force. Exponential plant overgrow allows the collapsing of massive structures and even more points to dig into enemies from. The Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the ten commandments of God. Draped in papers displaying the ten commandments of God, the Ark displays the remarkable ability to boost or dampen phonic gain. Other wielders who sing alongside the Ark notice their power being boosted, with rising sync coefficients, while enemy wielders notice their synchronization ratio's plummeting. Against the Noise, the effect that disables their Phase Contrast Barrier is broadcast in a wide radius, effectively forcing all Noise around them into reality where mundane weapons will affect them. The Ark of the Covenant's Armed Gear is actually the papers hanging from the wielder's body. They can extend and fold themselves, taking the shape of weapons or shields, anything that is possible with folded sheets of paper. While they can swing with great force, it's important to remember that it's still essentially paper, albeit far more durable than normal, but still paper. The strength, durability and length the paper can extend to increases with experience. As another Relic made in the image of God, the Ark's Swan Song is capable of exerting similar forces to the Ruin's of Balal. By spreading the pages out like a dish, and holding themselves in a cross position, the wielder can rip away massive amounts of Phonic Gain from other wielders or people, gathering it to themselves and redistributing it to others. Unlike other Swan Songs, this has no practical combat capability on it's own, as it effectively immobilizes the wielder while it is in use and requires another wielder to direct Phonic Gain to. However, if the wielder can gather enough Phonic Gain, they may be able to activate X-Drive once the Swan Song ends... The Left Hand of Christ, no, not a euphemism. His actual hand. The wearer is bestowed a much more heavily armored suit than most Symphogears, complete with a helmet and rectangular shield. Unlike most Symphogears, the Hand's Armed Gear cannot be duplicated endlessly, with only one or two available at anygiven moment, the tradeoff being that Hand's lance is extraordinarily powerful, doubling as a high energy laser cannon. The Hand’s shield can expand and reshape as needed, additionally being able to project an energy shield capable of protecting against Noise. The size and shape the energy shield can take begins as a simple single direction square barrier, but can be manipulated more with practice. The Hand's Swan Song channels and amplifies the destructive power of the spear's laser cannon, sending a massive cross-shaped beam of energy in the direction of every thrust for the duration of the Swan Song. Striking the ground with the spear will produce a similar cross-shaped blast around the wielder. In addition to this, while the Swan Song is active, the defenses provided by the Gear have their power drastically increased. Gleipnir, the chain that bound the great wolf. Gleipnir’s bodysuit appears to be of a different material than standard, with a leathery appearance and fur-trimming along it’s edge, and appears bound to the wearer by chains. Lengths of chains may be unshackled to beat and ensnare enemies, draining Phonic Gain by contact and potentially immobilizing other Relic users with enough contact. The Relic’s Swan Song reveals that it is not just Gleipnir, but also the wolf the chain bound – Fenrir. All of the Gear’s chains fall away, and the wielder is surrounded by a recreation of the original wolf. While larger than the wielder and strong, this is not the full extent of the Swan Song. Fenrir reverses the direction of control, being able to take it’s chain and leash another Relic for temporary control over it, against any relevant user’s will for the duration of the Swan Song. If the chain is not used in this way, taking the form of Fenrir bears very little cost to the user, despite being a Swan Song. The Axe of Perun, weapon of the lightning god. Perun’s bodysuit is studded with numerous contacts and power lines, which can be used to generate extreme voltages, short lightning strikes and manipulate circuitry in the manner one might expect. Instead of simply being able to generate voltage though, Perun is able to condense large amounts of its power into a physical form- that or axes, polearms and other axe-headed instruments, in addition to the lightning ‘arrows’ one might expect. The downside to this is that Perun requires far more energy per weapon created, making it’s use substantially heavier and deliberate versus the frenzy of other Gears. Perun’s Swan Song calls all available energy in the surrounding atmosphere to the user, often causing the formation of a massive storm cell around it from the massive drop in pressure. The wielder is then able to create a massive axe, formed by both the storm and their own charge, which fully discharges into the location they strike as a titanic lightning strike. Draupnir, the ring of Odin. It uses its ability of self multiplication to create disk shaped drones that are equipped with sensors and projectors capable of producing energy blasts or holograms. A largely utility focused Relic, Draupnir's defense is somewhat poor and mostly consists of using the drones to intercept attacks or form force fields. Further sync and experience with Daupnir allows the creation of specialized drones and use of formations or combinations of the drones to perform various other tasks of means of attack. Draupnir's Swan Song causes the drones to multiply exponentially before surrounding the target in a dome and discharging all their energy in a single attack focused on the center of the dome. Draupnir's Swan Song is especially risky as it removes all drones from defense for a single Swan strike and the Symphogear takes a bit to reactivate the discharged drones, should the wielder survive. Brahmastra, the bow of Brahma. Unlike its counterpart Ichival, Brahmastra's attacks are slower, more accurate and far more powerful, with it's Armed Gear taking the form of a heavy bow by default, although it can also take the form of a battle rifle or revolver. Built into Brahmastra's headset is a visor that provides targeting data and alternate vision modes to the wielder. While the weapons can be fired as fast as the wielder can manage or pull the trigger, the power of these attacks make friendly fire a serious concern. The Swan Song of Brahmastra brings forth the full might of a weapon said to never miss and which completely annihilates it's target without fail. Summoning it's bow form again, Brahmastra unleashes a massive lance of energy at a specific target, traveling instantly and through all structures in it's way to annihilate that single target with force similar to a nuclear weapon. A Will-o’-the-Wisp, an otherworldly beacon. On top of a tattered hood, the wielder is given an Armed Gear that takes the form of a small, handheld lantern. Will-o’-the-Wisp’s purview is that of lighting- lanterns, braziers, lamps, floodlights and in a more combat oriented-fashion, lasers. On top of direct fighting applications, the wielder may cause lights to fizzle out and produce small ‘wisps’ of energy, which they may redirect into other lights (or even other Relics) to boost their power or use directly as energy bullets. Primarily, Will-o’-the-Wisp focuses on producing massive banks of lamps which it harvests for wisps to use in massive lasers, all of which leads into its Swan Song. Upon activation, Will-o’-the-Wisp becomes a miniature sun, glowing with an intense light and releasing untold amounts of wisps that can turn even household light bulbs into deadly area denial weapons. Xiuhcoatl, weapon of the sun god. The wielder of Xiuhcoatl is accompanied by their own personal Noise- that takes the shape of a burning serpent protectively surrounding them. It also bears slight resemblance to corn, for some reason. By consuming other Noise, or fragments of Relics, Xiuhcoatl grows larger and stronger, although it can shed ‘accumulated’ size for speed, and a greater size is more taxing on the user to maintain. Like other Noise, Xiuhcoatl can phase in and out of reality unless ‘tuned’ by something like a Symphogear, and also possesses the Noise ability to instantly reduce organic life to ash on contact, although it may withhold at the discretion of it’s handler. Instead of simply swelling Xiuhcoatl to a massive size – as it already does so – the Relic’s Swan Song allows Xiuhcoatl to subdivide into two snakes of a slightly reduced size, repeating as many times as wished for either a swarm of standard sized snakes or several titanic ones. This means that Xiuhcoatl’s Swan Song is generally most effective once it has swelled to a sufficient size, providing the most metaphorical ‘material’ to create additional minions from. The Nemean Hide, trophy of Heracles. The Nemean Hide is an unusual relic, for it grants it's user some of the properties of Noise as it's primary ability. In addition to being an exceptionally resilient Symphogear the Nemean Hide allows its user to utilize the dimensional phasing ability of Noise, moving partially out of reality in order to ignore mundane assaults in exchange for a loss of movement speed and perception. The pelt is especially fearsome in that it can ignore the assaults of Symphogear users with significantly lesser Symphonic Gain than the wielder of the Hide, while utilizing the enemy's Barrier Coating to interact with them as if the user was fully material, although significantly stronger assaults can pierce this defense. The Nemean Hide's Armed Gear consists of bracers with five claws situated on all four extremities of the user. The claws are versatile as weapons, having the offensive properties of Noise, allowing them to expend themselves to carbonize a normal human on contact or create a fairly potent explosion, the claws replenish fairly quickly and may be fired as ranged weapons. Finally, a claw may be inserted into a Noise to temporarily usurp control of it, although the claw won't regenerate so long as the Noise remains alive and controlled. Higher sync and experience with the Nemean Hide may allow manifestation of other parts of the Lion such as the fangs or tail, or manipulation of the claws, causing them to grow or otherwise shift to the user's will. The Swan Song of the Nemean Hide is terrific in both senses of the word. The Hide uses the excess energy generated by the song to fully reform the invincible Lion Noise it was made from around the user. The Nemean ion is nigh indestructible to most assaults barring another Swan Song or attack of similar caliber and can control large swathes of nearby Noise to do it's will. The Lion is somewhat indiscriminate in it's rampage, only partially controlled by the wearer of the Hide and the Swan Song usually only lasts about a minute at most, meaning the best way to deal with the Lion is usually to simply run until it's exhausted. Enlil, Lord of the Wind. While ordinarily the color scheme of a Symphogear seems to depend on the user, Enlil has yellow and black warning patterns included regardless of the user, along with a mining helmet. Enlil generates mining equipment of all kinds, pickaxes, drills, shovels, even industrial mining lasers. While the intended function is obvious, they still work as anti-Noise weapons, and most tools can be fired as projectiles using rockets. The size and complexity of summoned tools increases with experience with the Gear. The mining helmet's light also functions as an X-ray device, which feeds back to a visor that drops down from the helmet. Upon triggering it's Swan Song, Enlil explodes into a massive mining train made from a mishmash of industrial machinery and mining equipment. While plowing straight through the enemy at three hundred miles an hour is quite effective, it can also make use of it's crane arms to throw pieces of the scenery at opponents or fire the massive mining laser mounted to it's hull. The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities. Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at its core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear. The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into its mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon. Pandora’s Box, which unfortunately is just a box after it was opened. Thankfully, the box itself is still useful, which the wielder can attest to with their built-in bandanna with tracking code. The box can take forms from cardboard boxes to steel shipping containers to box up and ship enemies to oblivion, or box cutters, nail guns and other shipping paraphernalia. Duct tape, warehouse drones and a very large boxcutter can help make sure death is delivered to enemies, and the constructs only get worse from there. Once the Swan Song is triggered, enemies within range are drawn backwards into a tiny box, like all the world’s evils, and then pulled into a massive shipping mechanism. Once processed, they are fired through a shipping accelerator against a hard surface, crushing the contents instantly and dealing massive damage. A minor property of Pandora’s Box is that it’s user exhibits a slight stealth effect, becoming extremely hard to notice. Moreso, if they hide within the Box. Bajiaoshan, once thought to be a mighty wind fan. Instead, upon activation the wielder finds themselves holding a pair of handles which can sprout dozens of individual knives, holding them in the shape of fans. On the users command, the handle can explosively fire the knives at a high firing rate, essentially making them fully automatic ballistic knives. The blades generated can be of several different types, including armor piercing, explosive and incendiary blades with any number of imaginative shapes and sizes. When the fight gets close to Bajiaoshan, the handles can project two superheated knives that are much more durable than the fragile projectiles and are fully capable of melting through most defenses. It's Swan Song let's Bajiaoshan project a single, invisible knife that carries with it the force of a gale, and with a single thrust, can tear through a single point with incredible force, penetrating all enemies but leaving allies untouched. Quetzalcoatl is a fragment of the feathered serpent that runs through the user’s body, causing many red-hot feathers to erupt from their bodysuit and merge into an armored coat to protect them. It also extends a superheated tail of molten metal from their spine, which can change shape and warp as they wish. Users of Quetzalcoatl should be cautious of these properties, as it, like the Nehushtan Armor, begins to merge with the user over time, although instead of growing into their wounds, Quetzalcoatl instead chooses to reside beneath the skin. A symbiotic relationship, as opposed to parasitic. There is no true Armed Gear to Quetzalcoatl, with its user instead calling upon its tail and raw command over the power of the sun. Raw material fissures forth from within Quetzalcoatl, superheated metals and plasmatic gasses which it can launch in streams and use as whips or in other creative ways against its foes. It can also control light in a minor way, either blinding it’s enemies or concentrating it’s light against its foes like the sun against ants. The Swan Song of Quetzalcoatl harnesses the power of nuclear fusion, generating a small sun roughly the size of one’s fist and launching it. Without the Gear to keep it under control, it quickly expands into a massive conflagration of fire, gas and light, destroying anything in its path. Tonbokiri, the dragonfly cutter, is one of a few Gears that is capable of native flight thanks to the set of insectoid wings that sprout from the back of the wielder’s bodysuit. All kinds of spears may be created by the Relic, although unlike more typical examples of spears produced by Symphogears, Tobokiri’s are more designed for cutting than thrusting. On top of that, the bodysuit possesses an ambulatory ‘tail’ that may grasp it’s spears and act as a crude sting for the user, and can sprout additional insectoid features if they wish. Tonbokiri belongs to the group of ‘living’ Gears that actively seek symbiosis with their wielders, regardless of implantation status, which is reflected in it’s Swan Song. The user sprouts chitinous armor, and temporarily the restored spear emerges from their sting, sharp enough that it emits heat from simple contact with the air. Strangely enough, Tonbokiri’s style and movements seem... a bit ridiculous at times. Flash stepping, running on water and other feats that’d seem more beelievable if they were in some anime. Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn’s spear. While only one of the original barbs remains, it still carries the traits of the original spear, with the short, bone-like protrusions the Gear is capable of producing still coursing through the body of enemies it pierces into and tearing them apart. By snapping off a bone growth and burying it in water or the ground, a massive ‘swordfish’ drone spawns – really an extended bone outcropping held inside a ring drone, with the same properties as a normal spine. Combat relies then on a balance between falling back to spawn additional drones and taking the offensive when drones are in surplus. The spear’s Swan Song revives the original sea monster – a massive, bone-y serpent named Coinchenn – but not as a pet to be controlled or commanded. Instead, Coinchenn allows itself to be used as a massive version of the spear it was eventually made into, flying with unnatural speed and precision for something so large, with the curse spreading through everything present at the location it strikes."

In addition to the rod itself you will get a few different statues that can be controlled by the rod, some of them large in size and capable of wielding weapons. The Spinner is a sort of gear-like mechanism that one can ride on. It’s best used on special grooves that it can use to move at high speeds, but it can also be ridden normally and can cross quicksand and patches of ice easily. It can also soften one’s fall if they happen to be riding it when they go over a cliff or something. Finally, the Clawshot is essentially a grappling-hook that allows one to attach to various objects pulling them closer to you (or you closer to them, if they weight more than you do). It fires with enough force to kill small enemies, but against larger ones it may only stun, if it does anything at all."

      "description": "Coming from the same roots as the Fulldrive mode on some Devices, the Blaster System is designed to increase the power available to a Mage in combat. However, unlike the Fulldrive mode, the Blaster System does not only disengage the performance limiters on the Device, it also directly sacrifices the user’s life for power. When a Blaster System is in use, the Mage receives direct, physical damage to themselves relative to whichever one of the three Blaster levels they are using, along with backlash damage to the Device itself. It is analogous to overclocking the Device with power, rather than simply letting it perform at its maximum specifications, as with Fulldrive. Blaster One and Two are both relatively safe if only used in short bursts, being able to instantly charge nearly any spell, or push its power to the class above it. The tradeoff is the immediate overheating of the Device, along with burns, cuts and ruptured blood vessels on any flesh in contact with the Device during operation. Blaster Three, on the other hand, causes immediate damage and warping to the Device, along with potentially breaking the operator’s bones and causing the same damage from Blaster One and Two all over their body. In exchange, the power of spells are massively multiplied, completely bypassing even the most potent Anti-Magic Fields and still coming out with extra power. It should be noted that in some cases, the damage caused by a Blaster System can in fact be preferable to the damage potentially caused by Fulldrive. The simple truth of the matter is that it’s faster and easier to treat blunt trauma such a broken bones and cuts compared to the internal damage caused by Fulldrive, which has a tendency to ‘add up’ before it’s noticed.

      "description": "In its original design, the Blaster System included a subsystem called Blaster Bits. At Blasters Two and Three, the system would generate two and four sets of ‘bits’, respectively. These bits bear some resemblance to the Standalone Flight Mode, being independent, flight-capable drones that can cast magic on their own, but they do not possess any of the intelligence or independence that would be found with the Standalone mode. Each bit acts as a vector from which spells can be cast, essentially giving the caster more directions to attack from, as well as potentially acting as force multipliers. Like the Standalone Flight Mode, bits possess limitations on range, becoming proportionally less efficient the greater the distance between them and the user, in a way that is fundamentally similar to how Familiars share their master’s mana reserves. Their range is also smaller, between one or two city blocks. The first purchase of this system grants the control system, along with two bits, with additional bits being purchasable for 50DP per bit. If the Device also has the Blaster System installed, then each of the bits are upgraded into Blaster Bits. In Blaster Two or above, the limitations on range and efficiency are temporarily released, and the bits begin acting as perfect force multipliers, duplicating any spell cast by the main Device at no additional cost, but only so long as Blaster Mode is engaged.

When it comes to magic, however, acceleration damage and recoil are often mitigated concerns, usually factored out during the design of the spell. The performance limiters in place are to prevent internal injury to a mage from overexertion on their Linker Core, which can damage it. Fulldrive throws these limiters out the window, massively increasing power intake to run at the peak of what the Device is capable of, rather than it’s operator. Due to magic’s nature, this isn’t as immediately lethal as it is with mass-based technology, but the trade off for the massively increased power, speed and durability is a much higher chance for self-injury. Additionally, Fulldrive is a unique mode all it’s own, combining the benefits of all of the Device’s modes at once in a way that simply wouldn’t be possible under normal performance limitations.

The Relic that has been implanted is one of the ones associated with your Origin, but once again you may pay 100cp to change it to a different one. Argo, the ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed on. The user is draped in sails, allowing them to drift effortlessly in the air. It can summon forth pieces of the original ship, casting great rods and nets of rigging at it's targets. Argo is mostly defense focused, being able to summon hulls as defensive shields and laying traps of rigging and rope. Further experience with Argo's creation allows the creation of small boats and jet skis. The Argo does not possess an Armed Gear that can be wielded like a weapon in the normal sense, excepting the components of the ship, but it is capable of creating Argonauts; small spherical drones with an attached beam of energy. These drone are relatively fragile, but can overwhelm targets with sheer numbers. Specialized drones can be created with greater experience with the Gear. Argo's Swan Song revives the original Argo, a flying heretical ship controlled by the will of the user. The Argo appears to turn and accelerate with no regards to propulsion or cornering, and can release swarms of the Argonauts. In addition to the swarms of loyal drones and it's extreme speed, the Argo's very presence creates a great typhoon that it and it's wielder are completely unaffected by. Prometheus, the first flame. By calling forth embers of the original flame, a raging dimensional inferno can be started, burning both human and Noise alike. The flames spread and intensity can be limited by the wielder, and can be extinguished with a single thought, but left unchecked they burn incredibly violently. The wielder is protected from this raging heat by their Symphogear, and other Gears should have little trouble with the heat unless it is actively brought against them. The chains wrapped around the wielders arms can be used like whips at their most basic level, heating to strike at foes, but Prometheus' true Armed Gear is the projection of these chains into disposable axes of all kinds, with its truest form being that of an ashen chainsaw. These weapons bear superheated blades and chains, being able to burn through even the toughest Noise's defenses if they can get in range. Prometheus' Swan Song calls forth the full might of the stolen flame, engulfing all within a massive radius in an inferno that sears the flesh of enemies from bone while rejuvenating allies, bringing them back from the brink of death. Be warned however, fire is indiscriminate, and any targets that fail to be designated as allies will suffer the same fate as enemies. Kibisis, the sack that contained the Medusa’s severed head. The concept of ‘sack’ is a slight misnomer, however. The user is given an elaborate combination of robes, cloak and hood that would be quite modest if the bodysuit wasn’t so skimpy. While unassuming, the fabric that makes up Kibisis is actually a portal to an enormous self-contained pocket dimension, with the user able to manipulate the fabric to make openings into and out of it. This is as versatile and deadly as it sounds, as Kibisis is able to not only store objects, but also use the fabric to effectively ‘flash step’ by traveling along a thin corridor of silk, or create a razor thin portal along it’s edge to slice objects in half. Kibisis’ Swan Song generates a massive dimensional disturbance, manipulating space-time to instantly stretch and destroy huge areas, while also disrupting similar dimensional shenanigans. Kaladanda, staff of the god of death. As intimidating as it sounds, Kaladanda’s Armed Gear is actually a metal pipe. In fact, Kaladanda may as well be the tool of a plumber, as it may plant and grow all manner of water works and plumbing from itself, naturally lending itself towards creating steam-powered mechanisms, such as gigantic steam hammers and saws. What makes these pipes unique, however, is the crimson water that flows freely from them, which carries a unique anti-life property that causes it to shred through all physical and philosophical protections, completing erasing it’s target from reality in a manner reminiscent of a certain mirror. Kaladanda’s Swan Song calls forth the source of it’s deathly water – a colossal steam boiler which flashes a massive amount of it’s deadly contents into supercritical steam, which it forces into a tight, high-power beam to bore through even the toughest defenses. Be careful of friendly fire, although an attentive user can selectively halt the eroding effects of the steam on allies. Thunderbird, caller of storms. The wielder appears to be cloaked in a stormy haze, obscuring them from view unless they choose to disperse it. Thunderbird is capable of recalling the original bird's talons, incredible sight and agility to the user. Thunderbird's true power lies in its ability to generate 'feathers', razor-sharp shards that extend in whip-like wings from the wielder's body. They can generate electrical charge and control their own magnetism, allowing the wielder to levitate through repulsion and discharge anti-Noise lightning strikes with some buildup. It is also possible to use the wings as a conduit for a magnetic cannon. Thunderbird's Swan Song causes the feathers to disperse, floating freely around the wielder as the haze expands into a storm cloud, from which the wielder can direct massive lightning strikes. Anything coming into the storm cloud will find themselves suffering from the lethal discharges within it unless the wielder directs it away from them itself. The Holy Grail, the cup sought by King Arthur. Upon activation, one might notice that the Gear appears to be completely unarmed or protected aside from a standard (albeit slightly more armored) bodysuit provided by a Symphogear system, with the addition of what appears to be a cooking pot worn jauntily as a helmet. The Holy Grail is capable of generating cooking paraphernalia in all forms to serve in it's purpose of providing unlimited food and happiness to people. Cooking utensils that can, however, be easily used as lethal weapons. The Grail is semi-unique in that it's user can control it's implements remotely, starting with one or two implements at first, and growing to a few dozen with time. The Holy Grail's Swan Song summons a massive stadium around the wielder, enclosing all in a several hundred meter radius inside a massive oven that heats to extremely high temperatures. Within, the wielder can control as many objects as they can manage, regardless of whether they came from her own Gear. The biggest risk comes from the massive size of the oven, carrying the risk of capturing innocent bystanders in the radius. Enkidu, clay servitor. Instead of any sort of Armed Gear, Enkidu’s wielder is accompanied by a large, formless mass of technological ‘clay’ that emanates from fissures in the bodysuit armor. While limited in amount, the clay can be manipulated to take on different shapes and properties- provided it doesn’t stray too far from it’s wielder. One moment, it can be a rigid shield, then transform itself into a lethal explosive. Clay may be destroyed, but more is very slowly generated within the bodysuit. Enkidu’s Swan Song temporarily re-enables the clay’s ability to self-replicate, allowing it to consume vast amounts of material to create a huge swarm of clay. For the duration of the Swan Song, the clay may be used as normal, explosively detonating or collapsing into dust once it ends. Moly, the miracle herb grown from the blood of a giant. Mossy plants overtake the wearer’s hair, sprouting flowers and other sprouts in its place and down their arms- plants that the wielder can coincidentally fire and control like fine wires. Beyond the obvious application of monofilament cutters, these plants are capable of taking root in living things and draining their life force for energy, so long as a conduit exists back to the wielder. Stranger applications, such as plant-based exoskeletons or constructs, are also entirely possible. The Swan Song of Moly causes all plants connected to Moly to begin flowering, releasing clouds of corrosive spores which eat into enemy armor, creating chinks for more plants to grow into, allowing them to rapidly drain them of life force. Exponential plant overgrow allows the collapsing of massive structures and even more points to dig into enemies from. The Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the ten commandments of God. Draped in papers displaying the ten commandments of God, the Ark displays the remarkable ability to boost or dampen phonic gain. Other wielders who sing alongside the Ark notice their power being boosted, with rising sync coefficients, while enemy wielders notice their synchronization ratio's plummeting. Against the Noise, the effect that disables their Phase Contrast Barrier is broadcast in a wide radius, effectively forcing all Noise around them into reality where mundane weapons will affect them. The Ark of the Covenant's Armed Gear is actually the papers hanging from the wielder's body. They can extend and fold themselves, taking the shape of weapons or shields, anything that is possible with folded sheets of paper. While they can swing with great force, it's important to remember that it's still essentially paper, albeit far more durable than normal, but still paper. The strength, durability and length the paper can extend to increases with experience. As another Relic made in the image of God, the Ark's Swan Song is capable of exerting similar forces to the Ruin's of Balal. By spreading the pages out like a dish, and holding themselves in a cross position, the wielder can rip away massive amounts of Phonic Gain from other wielders or people, gathering it to themselves and redistributing it to others. Unlike other Swan Songs, this has no practical combat capability on it's own, as it effectively immobilizes the wielder while it is in use and requires another wielder to direct Phonic Gain to. However, if the wielder can gather enough Phonic Gain, they may be able to activate X-Drive once the Swan Song ends... The Left Hand of Christ, no, not a euphemism. His actual hand. The wearer is bestowed a much more heavily armored suit than most Symphogears, complete with a helmet and rectangular shield. Unlike most Symphogears, the Hand's Armed Gear cannot be duplicated endlessly, with only one or two available at anygiven moment, the tradeoff being that Hand's lance is extraordinarily powerful, doubling as a high energy laser cannon. The Hand’s shield can expand and reshape as needed, additionally being able to project an energy shield capable of protecting against Noise. The size and shape the energy shield can take begins as a simple single direction square barrier, but can be manipulated more with practice. The Hand's Swan Song channels and amplifies the destructive power of the spear's laser cannon, sending a massive cross-shaped beam of energy in the direction of every thrust for the duration of the Swan Song. Striking the ground with the spear will produce a similar cross-shaped blast around the wielder. In addition to this, while the Swan Song is active, the defenses provided by the Gear have their power drastically increased. Gleipnir, the chain that bound the great wolf. Gleipnir’s bodysuit appears to be of a different material than standard, with a leathery appearance and fur-trimming along it’s edge, and appears bound to the wearer by chains. Lengths of chains may be unshackled to beat and ensnare enemies, draining Phonic Gain by contact and potentially immobilizing other Relic users with enough contact. The Relic’s Swan Song reveals that it is not just Gleipnir, but also the wolf the chain bound – Fenrir. All of the Gear’s chains fall away, and the wielder is surrounded by a recreation of the original wolf. While larger than the wielder and strong, this is not the full extent of the Swan Song. Fenrir reverses the direction of control, being able to take it’s chain and leash another Relic for temporary control over it, against any relevant user’s will for the duration of the Swan Song. If the chain is not used in this way, taking the form of Fenrir bears very little cost to the user, despite being a Swan Song. The Axe of Perun, weapon of the lightning god. Perun’s bodysuit is studded with numerous contacts and power lines, which can be used to generate extreme voltages, short lightning strikes and manipulate circuitry in the manner one might expect. Instead of simply being able to generate voltage though, Perun is able to condense large amounts of its power into a physical form- that or axes, polearms and other axe-headed instruments, in addition to the lightning ‘arrows’ one might expect. The downside to this is that Perun requires far more energy per weapon created, making it’s use substantially heavier and deliberate versus the frenzy of other Gears. Perun’s Swan Song calls all available energy in the surrounding atmosphere to the user, often causing the formation of a massive storm cell around it from the massive drop in pressure. The wielder is then able to create a massive axe, formed by both the storm and their own charge, which fully discharges into the location they strike as a titanic lightning strike. Draupnir, the ring of Odin. It uses its ability of self multiplication to create disk shaped drones that are equipped with sensors and projectors capable of producing energy blasts or holograms. A largely utility focused Relic, Draupnir's defense is somewhat poor and mostly consists of using the drones to intercept attacks or form force fields. Further sync and experience with Daupnir allows the creation of specialized drones and use of formations or combinations of the drones to perform various other tasks of means of attack. Draupnir's Swan Song causes the drones to multiply exponentially before surrounding the target in a dome and discharging all their energy in a single attack focused on the center of the dome. Draupnir's Swan Song is especially risky as it removes all drones from defense for a single Swan strike and the Symphogear takes a bit to reactivate the discharged drones, should the wielder survive. Brahmastra, the bow of Brahma. Unlike its counterpart Ichival, Brahmastra's attacks are slower, more accurate and far more powerful, with it's Armed Gear taking the form of a heavy bow by default, although it can also take the form of a battle rifle or revolver. Built into Brahmastra's headset is a visor that provides targeting data and alternate vision modes to the wielder. While the weapons can be fired as fast as the wielder can manage or pull the trigger, the power of these attacks make friendly fire a serious concern. The Swan Song of Brahmastra brings forth the full might of a weapon said to never miss and which completely annihilates it's target without fail. Summoning it's bow form again, Brahmastra unleashes a massive lance of energy at a specific target, traveling instantly and through all structures in it's way to annihilate that single target with force similar to a nuclear weapon. A Will-o’-the-Wisp, an otherworldly beacon. On top of a tattered hood, the wielder is given an Armed Gear that takes the form of a small, handheld lantern. Will-o’-the-Wisp’s purview is that of lighting- lanterns, braziers, lamps, floodlights and in a more combat oriented-fashion, lasers. On top of direct fighting applications, the wielder may cause lights to fizzle out and produce small ‘wisps’ of energy, which they may redirect into other lights (or even other Relics) to boost their power or use directly as energy bullets. Primarily, Will-o’-the-Wisp focuses on producing massive banks of lamps which it harvests for wisps to use in massive lasers, all of which leads into its Swan Song. Upon activation, Will-o’-the-Wisp becomes a miniature sun, glowing with an intense light and releasing untold amounts of wisps that can turn even household light bulbs into deadly area denial weapons. Xiuhcoatl, weapon of the sun god. The wielder of Xiuhcoatl is accompanied by their own personal Noise- that takes the shape of a burning serpent protectively surrounding them. It also bears slight resemblance to corn, for some reason. By consuming other Noise, or fragments of Relics, Xiuhcoatl grows larger and stronger, although it can shed ‘accumulated’ size for speed, and a greater size is more taxing on the user to maintain. Like other Noise, Xiuhcoatl can phase in and out of reality unless ‘tuned’ by something like a Symphogear, and also possesses the Noise ability to instantly reduce organic life to ash on contact, although it may withhold at the discretion of it’s handler. Instead of simply swelling Xiuhcoatl to a massive size – as it already does so – the Relic’s Swan Song allows Xiuhcoatl to subdivide into two snakes of a slightly reduced size, repeating as many times as wished for either a swarm of standard sized snakes or several titanic ones. This means that Xiuhcoatl’s Swan Song is generally most effective once it has swelled to a sufficient size, providing the most metaphorical ‘material’ to create additional minions from. The Nemean Hide, trophy of Heracles. The Nemean Hide is an unusual relic, for it grants it's user some of the properties of Noise as it's primary ability. In addition to being an exceptionally resilient Symphogear the Nemean Hide allows its user to utilize the dimensional phasing ability of Noise, moving partially out of reality in order to ignore mundane assaults in exchange for a loss of movement speed and perception. The pelt is especially fearsome in that it can ignore the assaults of Symphogear users with significantly lesser Symphonic Gain than the wielder of the Hide, while utilizing the enemy's Barrier Coating to interact with them as if the user was fully material, although significantly stronger assaults can pierce this defense. The Nemean Hide's Armed Gear consists of bracers with five claws situated on all four extremities of the user. The claws are versatile as weapons, having the offensive properties of Noise, allowing them to expend themselves to carbonize a normal human on contact or create a fairly potent explosion, the claws replenish fairly quickly and may be fired as ranged weapons. Finally, a claw may be inserted into a Noise to temporarily usurp control of it, although the claw won't regenerate so long as the Noise remains alive and controlled. Higher sync and experience with the Nemean Hide may allow manifestation of other parts of the Lion such as the fangs or tail, or manipulation of the claws, causing them to grow or otherwise shift to the user's will. The Swan Song of the Nemean Hide is terrific in both senses of the word. The Hide uses the excess energy generated by the song to fully reform the invincible Lion Noise it was made from around the user. The Nemean ion is nigh indestructible to most assaults barring another Swan Song or attack of similar caliber and can control large swathes of nearby Noise to do it's will. The Lion is somewhat indiscriminate in it's rampage, only partially controlled by the wearer of the Hide and the Swan Song usually only lasts about a minute at most, meaning the best way to deal with the Lion is usually to simply run until it's exhausted. Enlil, Lord of the Wind. While ordinarily the color scheme of a Symphogear seems to depend on the user, Enlil has yellow and black warning patterns included regardless of the user, along with a mining helmet. Enlil generates mining equipment of all kinds, pickaxes, drills, shovels, even industrial mining lasers. While the intended function is obvious, they still work as anti-Noise weapons, and most tools can be fired as projectiles using rockets. The size and complexity of summoned tools increases with experience with the Gear. The mining helmet's light also functions as an X-ray device, which feeds back to a visor that drops down from the helmet. Upon triggering it's Swan Song, Enlil explodes into a massive mining train made from a mishmash of industrial machinery and mining equipment. While plowing straight through the enemy at three hundred miles an hour is quite effective, it can also make use of it's crane arms to throw pieces of the scenery at opponents or fire the massive mining laser mounted to it's hull. The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities. Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at its core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear. The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into its mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon. Pandora’s Box, which unfortunately is just a box after it was opened. Thankfully, the box itself is still useful, which the wielder can attest to with their built-in bandanna with tracking code. The box can take forms from cardboard boxes to steel shipping containers to box up and ship enemies to oblivion, or box cutters, nail guns and other shipping paraphernalia. Duct tape, warehouse drones and a very large boxcutter can help make sure death is delivered to enemies, and the constructs only get worse from there. Once the Swan Song is triggered, enemies within range are drawn backwards into a tiny box, like all the world’s evils, and then pulled into a massive shipping mechanism. Once processed, they are fired through a shipping accelerator against a hard surface, crushing the contents instantly and dealing massive damage. A minor property of Pandora’s Box is that it’s user exhibits a slight stealth effect, becoming extremely hard to notice. Moreso, if they hide within the Box. Bajiaoshan, once thought to be a mighty wind fan. Instead, upon activation the wielder finds themselves holding a pair of handles which can sprout dozens of individual knives, holding them in the shape of fans. On the users command, the handle can explosively fire the knives at a high firing rate, essentially making them fully automatic ballistic knives. The blades generated can be of several different types, including armor piercing, explosive and incendiary blades with any number of imaginative shapes and sizes. When the fight gets close to Bajiaoshan, the handles can project two superheated knives that are much more durable than the fragile projectiles and are fully capable of melting through most defenses. It's Swan Song let's Bajiaoshan project a single, invisible knife that carries with it the force of a gale, and with a single thrust, can tear through a single point with incredible force, penetrating all enemies but leaving allies untouched. Quetzalcoatl is a fragment of the feathered serpent that runs through the user’s body, causing many red-hot feathers to erupt from their bodysuit and merge into an armored coat to protect them. It also extends a superheated tail of molten metal from their spine, which can change shape and warp as they wish. Users of Quetzalcoatl should be cautious of these properties, as it, like the Nehushtan Armor, begins to merge with the user over time, although instead of growing into their wounds, Quetzalcoatl instead chooses to reside beneath the skin. A symbiotic relationship, as opposed to parasitic. There is no true Armed Gear to Quetzalcoatl, with its user instead calling upon its tail and raw command over the power of the sun. Raw material fissures forth from within Quetzalcoatl, superheated metals and plasmatic gasses which it can launch in streams and use as whips or in other creative ways against its foes. It can also control light in a minor way, either blinding it’s enemies or concentrating it’s light against its foes like the sun against ants. The Swan Song of Quetzalcoatl harnesses the power of nuclear fusion, generating a small sun roughly the size of one’s fist and launching it. Without the Gear to keep it under control, it quickly expands into a massive conflagration of fire, gas and light, destroying anything in its path. Tonbokiri, the dragonfly cutter, is one of a few Gears that is capable of native flight thanks to the set of insectoid wings that sprout from the back of the wielder’s bodysuit. All kinds of spears may be created by the Relic, although unlike more typical examples of spears produced by Symphogears, Tobokiri’s are more designed for cutting than thrusting. On top of that, the bodysuit possesses an ambulatory ‘tail’ that may grasp it’s spears and act as a crude sting for the user, and can sprout additional insectoid features if they wish. Tonbokiri belongs to the group of ‘living’ Gears that actively seek symbiosis with their wielders, regardless of implantation status, which is reflected in it’s Swan Song. The user sprouts chitinous armor, and temporarily the restored spear emerges from their sting, sharp enough that it emits heat from simple contact with the air. Strangely enough, Tonbokiri’s style and movements seem... a bit ridiculous at times. Flash stepping, running on water and other feats that’d seem more beelievable if they were in some anime. Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn’s spear. While only one of the original barbs remains, it still carries the traits of the original spear, with the short, bone-like protrusions the Gear is capable of producing still coursing through the body of enemies it pierces into and tearing them apart. By snapping off a bone growth and burying it in water or the ground, a massive ‘swordfish’ drone spawns – really an extended bone outcropping held inside a ring drone, with the same properties as a normal spine. Combat relies then on a balance between falling back to spawn additional drones and taking the offensive when drones are in surplus. The spear’s Swan Song revives the original sea monster – a massive, bone-y serpent named Coinchenn – but not as a pet to be controlled or commanded. Instead, Coinchenn allows itself to be used as a massive version of the spear it was eventually made into, flying with unnatural speed and precision for something so large, with the curse spreading through everything present at the location it strikes. This also affects the following 600cp perks as follows: The Power of Holding Hands – Now it becomes possible for you to take upon the backlash effects from multiple people, but on top of that, the backlash is reduced even further based upon the strength of your personal relationship with them, granting no benefit for random bystanders, but reducing a potentially lethal backlash to a minor tickle with true friendship, and all but negating the strain with a bond of love. Superb Song – You know, just having people who believe in you can give you enough faith to survive the challenges thrown at you. Personal connections you have with other people now feed you a tiny bit of Phonic Gain based on the level of that friendship, providing a slight power boost. Pagan Science – Looking through some of the notes made by Finé's reincarnation, you manage to glean the mechanism behind the energy-mass converter used to create the armor of a Symphogear. While you would still need a Relic to make a proper Symphogear, you can use this to store armor and weapons in the form of a small necklace, simply requiring that the user be able to sing the activation song to use. Legends Reborn – Across time and space, some legends hold true in the hearts and minds of people, much like how Gungnir retained it’s properties as Longinus, despite becoming Gungnir later in life. When you have the original, real thing – an artifact with a strong legend known across entire populations for many decades – you may extract it’s legend and turn the artifact into a philosophical weapon, giving it properties from it’s associated legends, such as anti-god properties for a weapon used to slay a god in legend."

No machine so accurately displays this madness than the dreaded DOOMWHEEL, for it is at once so simple of a design yet so deceptively complex that only the skaven could have devised it. And now the brain-spawn of Ikit Claw is rapidly becoming a tide-turner in the war against the surface-world. You’ve gained the ownership of one of these dreaded DOOMWHEELS, specially made for your seating. The massive, iron-enforced wheel is powered by two things: Along its inside, on a specially-made track, runs a swarm of drugged-up rats driven mad by the arcing warp-lightning and constant noise. At the center of the massive chassis, where the pilot’s seat is, is a warpstone generator that ensures the machine both keeps a steady pace (enough to run over and smash even armored dwarves and humans) and occasionally fires off the warp-lightning cannon that is attached to the front of the steel rims. Very few creatures are capable of stopping the DOOMWHEEL in its tracks, and for you there will likely be none: As its pilot, your magic also serves to charge the warpstone engine and warp-lightning cannon, allowing it to reach speeds only dreamed of by skaven brains and letting the warp-lightning cannon fire off the spells you cast as warp-lightning tainted explosions."

And now you are one of them. But not just a normal one, oh no. Your talent with Technomancy can rightfully said to be quite monstrous. Whether it is commanding machines to do your bidding with just a thought, probing devices with your magic to discover their functions and any possible flaws, or disassembling and reassembling them, you can do it all with contemptuous ease. If you trained a bit, you could of course also create your own technology to use, entirely through magic, as long as you have any necessary materials before you. Another interesting ability of Technomancy is its function to let you interface with technology and use yourself as a medium for information to be displayed. So if you, for example, wrote a program to let something pass through your Aura, such as the hologram function of your companion bracelet, you could simply use Technomancy to establish a connection with the bracelet and yourself.But your biggest talent lies in the replication of implants and other technological marvels within yourself and others. You could for example quite easily copy the aura of a camera and adapt your eye to mirror it, or do the same to the auras of memory banks and computers to enhance your brain. With your skill, you don’t even have to worry about overloading your puny biological body by using technology that is too advanced. Beyond that, what you can do is up to you. After all, the potential of magic is only limited by its users ability, creativity, and skill. Though I’m sure that with your potential, you’ll manage to go quite far in the rat race of life. Concerning technology at least, social skills are not included in this package."

This goes beyond simple precognition of day-to-day events or giving yourself an edge in combat - it is the manipulation of the progress of humankind as a whole,and prevention (or creation) of their extinction. A single human body cannot handle such information by itself - so instead, you made tools capable of accessing and storing the collective knowledge of humanity. You are capable of constructing devices that could create or manipulate pseudo-Spiritions, or virtual projections of the soul, and transmit that into a virtual space of your own designs as well. These devices are equal in magnitude and processing speed to a highly advanced Quantum Computer, and let you store or project a human consciousness,soul and all, into these spaces. With time and resources, you could recreate almost the entirety of planet Earth and the records of all its history, and store the whole of mankind within it...though doing such a strenuous, time-consuming process would take a lifetime by yourself.Recreating something such as a certain Moon-based digital space with this alone is a daunting,perhaps impossible prospect. However, the ability to create such highly-advanced devices has come with a neat additional perk - namely, with the information it can calculate, it is possible to ‘observe’ the entirety of aworld’s history and several probable futures, along with the conditions needed to make those futures happen or even prevent them entirely. It could even provide instructions or probabilities of success with new advances or superweapons not yet within the world on aiding these potential futures, creating Mystic Codes or wonders few could even dream of beforehand. With resources and time, perhaps you could make a device that can make those probabilities real by command alone, though that requires energy and conditions that a lone human being can’t generate.

You have learned the art of infusing mana into DNA, letting you create hereditary and unique magical abilities that are passed down from generation to generation, or specific individuals if you can’t be bothered to wait that long. Traits like a specific hair color, eye color, or body type is child’s play to you - and while complicated or powerful abilities may not always descend down the family tree, you could preserve the appearance and base talents of your bloodline for millennia to come. An affinity for a particular element, a talent for a set of skills, or even a unique magical ability tied specifically to the DNA of the user are valid examples for this. Whether you merely wish to experiment with magical DNA or begin a great dynasty, you will find that with the right motivation, your legacy could last forever."

The warp-lightning rails that connect the great under-cities, such as Under-Altdorf and Hell Pit. The Doomwheels. The Skitter-Gates. Ratling mini-guns and poison wind and augmentation chemicals and all the myriad of spells that make the Warlock-Engineers a minor apocalypse upon the field. All born from diseased minds. You count yourself as “inspired” as these demented predecessors of yours - a madness coming over your brain-meats. While this madness may be debilitating in any day-to-day interaction, it shines when you set to work. The magics you use and the technologies you set to experiment with and create will seem to branch, weave, intersect, and spark in ways that would never occur to a healthier mind. In short, through your mad eyes and addled brain, you can create and discover new spells, machinery, scientific theories, and interactions between the three that would never occur naturally even through rigorous years of study and experimentation. Creations that mock the very idea of common sense and decency, and violate every sense and sensibility."

      "description": "Spaceship captains, rulers of both kingdoms and planets alike, and people similarly reigning over the masses or in possession of a vast amount of land have access to a special kind of system in Neolife. A sort of management menu, it allows people to upgrade their territories in two kinds of ways: the first is a technology upgrade, which a ruler could use to add irrigation to a field, or to increase the defence of a city. If there is a design provided, it will be instantly built once the upgrade finishes in around a week. The second is a production speed upgrade. For example, after setting an order to increase agriculture, a burst of mana would sink into the ground and the growth of nearby fields and trees would instantly hasten, fruits and vegetables being grown overnight, and continuing to do so for several days. The mana to power both kinds of upgrades is drawn from both the people and the environment in the land affected by the upgrade, with the time needed for the upgrade increasing the more difficult and complex the upgrade is, due to it needing more mana. In your case, even if you might not be ruling over an area, your affinity with technology has granted you a similar ability. You may spend mana to add new functions to technological devices and machinery, or improve already existing functions. The more complex or expansive the change is, and the larger o advanced the target object is, the more mana is required. Like with the management menu, you can also affect things that haven’t incorporated any technology in their function yet, such as the aforementioned irrigation added to a field. This could be used to turn a mage staff entirely made out of natural material into magitech, or into a technological equivalent. Similarly, you may affect extremely large areas like cities or even planets after you become powerful enough, and may also order for the required mana to be drawn from the environment or any living beings in it. Beyond that, you also have a knack for upgrading things the old fashioned way with your own two hands."

Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you’ve taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset. First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it’s something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it. The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you’d be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection. But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there’s no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create."

Milk stays cool and fresh for weeks, fish remain alive swimming around in stale water indefinitely, and sliced fruit is as fresh as the moment the cork in the bottle is put on. It shouldn’t have to be said what kinds of benefit this can reap. In addition, the glasses are remarkably sturdy and could easily survive being handled roughly across a Hyrule-wide trek!"

You now have a small bag of seeds, about 20 or so, that can be planted here. What do these seeds actually do? Well, when fully grown, the nut that grows on the tree seems to contain magical rings inside of them. There is a great deal of variety, and they aren’t much use unless you know what they do, but surely something here will be of use?"

Druids also use them to introduce new elements into their Grove, and need them to cultivate their affinities past the 25% point. As such, each of them is fairly valuable, with the price skyrocketing once you go beyond the basic seven elements and to incredibly rare ones such as Time. They are also pretty time intensive to make, requiring about an hour of work for each, even for people relatively skilled in their creation. But now, you won’t ever have to worry about that, as you’ll get a dozen Seeds for each of your affinities delivered either to your warehouse or another place you designate, every week. Their quality depends on the level of your affinities: from 5% to 25% you’ll get low-grade ones, from 25% to 50% medium-grade ones, from 50% to 75% high-grade ones, and finally, from 75% up to 100% you’ll get top-grade seeds."

It would be needed for the moment you wake up, as you would be required to immediately look to protect your King from any possible dangers. For that sake, those weapons and armour were enchanted in a similar way to your own body, to prevent them from rusting and aging to dust. Your gear is all the same way, sharing in your magic to ensure that it will never age or become damaged from the passing of time. Swords never rust or lose their edge, armour does not gain weaker bonds over time and even food will not spoil when held in your bags."

This does not slow or freeze the movements of those around you, but it basically means that as long as you are focused on cooking, you’ll finish everything on time and nothing will interrupt you. For instance, if you are cooking a special potion to boost your troops in time to stop an invasion, you’ll get the potion ready on time even if the siege was just an hour away. When you stop doing food-related things, time returns to its normal pace. Other ingredient-focused activities such as spell preparations, alchemy, and medicine-making still technically count as “cooking” by Wonderland rules, though."

Additionally, the leaves seem to have an affinity for the wind, as simply swinging it around will create an unusually large burst of air."

While it may not seem like much of a boon, the elven blood of the Homunculus is shared with the very gods themselves. A mortal soul inside of half-elf has the agelessness of the Aesir and every bit of potential power as they, with time and training becoming indistinguishable from them in strength. Even the gods (including Valkyries) would benefit from a half-elf body, as the Homunculus' human blood has the potential for limitless growth, breaking their naturally static power and body and allowing them grow beyond them. This property is no doubt beneficial to the uppity mortal as well in their quest to match the gods. It is Odin's most closely guarded secret that he is actually a naturally born half-elf, and was one of the weakest gods before his human side allowed him to grow stronger and surpass all the other Aesir, after all. You can choose to either receive the Homunculus in its sealed tube, which would allow you to keep it until needed, though you won't necessarily possess the knowledge a soul, yours or another's, into it, or instead start your ten years already inhabiting it. In this case, you would have been placed in this body during your background, which may come with a host of issues if someone else was behind it and if anyone finds out. If you take this along with Prophetess, you may choose to be a born Half-Vanir instead, which essentially functions the same as a Half-Elf. This is your natural body that you start in, no transfer required, but you will have to think of an excuse for why you've suddenly appeared in the current era so long after your mother was decapitated."

Whenever someone's shadow is sewed onto a new person, the new person now owns the shadow both physically and spiritually. Also, you can sew on the shadow extra tight, such that it can only be removed under certain conditions (such as with Shadow Biter); therefore, with that adjustment the attached shadow will always be fully visible and in full-body no matter the position or absence of light, though this may sometimes be a detriment. You can also sew different shadows together (even if they're still attached to people or things); unless said individuals found a way to detach themselves from their shadows, they would therefore be limited in their movements due to how their shadows are linked. You could even physically alter shadows, such as sew pockets into shadows for storing things, or use an iron to make a shadow hard and stiff, or “wash” them. If you also took Mother Knows Best, you may eventually learn to magically apply your wonderful sewing skills to other unlikely things, such as reflections, giggles, and clouds.

Although you can create works that have magical powers, to fully use their magic in the real world they would require continual magic support from you.

Few, if any, practice this craft anymore now that the nature spirits who once taught it have withdrawn. While there is more to the art than simple weather forecasting, that is where your knowledge begins. With an investment of power, a few rare components, and a little skill at woodcarving, you can create totems that seek to alter the weather of the next day. Never into anything out of season, asking for snow in summer is simply impossible, and turning a predicted hurricane into sunny skies might be asking a bit much. But toning it down to a thunderstorm instead or making clear skies cloud over is within your reach. You might, with experimentation, find more interesting uses for such devices of stored magic."

From the most simple and base Mystic Eyes of Charm to the almost sacred and miraculous Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, they are deeply desired and feared across the world. But they are ultimately just tools, that is what you have found. And tools can be broken, altered, even made new. Again, it is more than a field of study in magecraft. What you have is a universal gift relating to eyes and the magics they hold. You’re already well studied on the many kinds of Mystic Eyes and their effects, with your immense talent regarding them allowing you to start to create tools to affect them or even make Mystic Eyes themselves. Glasses that seal their effects or enhance them, surgical tools to safely extract and transplant the eyes, contacts that focus their effects towards specific uses, eyedrops that reverse their powers for a time. New Eyes often involve binding some magecraft or power you are knowledgeable on into the eyes you know how to grow, then inserting and connecting them to the user. It’s even possible to combine and stack eyes with each other, since your skills extend to biological alteration of ocular organs. Two Mystic Eyes of the same sort placed within each other could form an un-ending mirror, trapping their targets in a spell for eternity. Effectively, you have incredible skill in most medicine and magecraft relating directly to Mystic Eyes and immense talent in furthering that, both in this world and in regards to any other eyes you might encounter."

From there, many alchemists learn the difficult and resource intensive formula for altering one material into another, and that's where their knowledge ends. But the true potential of alchemy is that it holds the ability to manipulate life, much like necromancy manipulates the dead. With the right knowledge, an alchemist can experiment and create horrible monsters and abominations, even imbuing them with magic and other mystical abilities, or even create a perfect simulacra of a human. The one thing outside of Alchemy's power is the creation of souls, so their creations may be alive or even think, but they don't truly feel the way a natural creature would. There's nothing preventing an alchemist with knowledge of other disciplines from transferring a soul into an empty vessel, however. On the other hand, there is much more to alchemy that nobody has yet uncovered, and further research can uncover further uses of alchemy."

For example a topaz is a gem that has anti-spirit properties and is useful for spells against spirits.

Even a little bit of water in here somehow multiplies into a vast quantity of sake, though it never produces more than the gourd can hold at a time. With this treasure, you could easily ensure you never spend another moment of your life sober. The second is Douju’s Jar, a large waist-high pot full of an endless amount of edible oil with no unusual properties beyond tasting smooth and nice. Perhaps you might want to establish a deep-frying business? The third is the Hoshiguma Dish, a simple red sake dish that has the miraculous ability to raise the quality of any sake poured into it, making it taste much better and be far easier to drink. Note that the sake does not need to remain in the dish to benefit from the increased quality; pouring it into the dish and then pouring it out into another container is a perfectly valid way to amass a lot of high-quality sake. However, sake can only benefit from its blessing once. The fourth, and most potent, is the Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines, a decorated sake box that can hold two litres of liquid at a time. Should a healthy person drink alcohol from the sake box, it temporarily grants them the strength of an Oni for a day at the price of shifting their personality to be like an Oni’s (read: crude, brash, coarse, loud and belligerent) until it wears off. If a sick, injured or otherwise unhealthy person drinks from it, however, it cures all of their ailments barring incurable mutilation from powerful magical relics at the small cost of permanently transforming their body into that of an Oni – though some might say this is simply another bonus. If a lot of people were to drink from this box, you can be assured it would cause incredible amounts of chaos."

Now, you can benefit from this even beyond the bounds of Hyrule. When you personally cook a meal, it will take on a nearly mystical dimension to it depending on both the quality and ingredients involved. The food and the ingredients have to be notably fresh, too, though pickled and salted ingredients would still work for this - but whatever magic is in these dishes doesn’t work if you don’t cook it yourself. Spicy or bold foods could give you a warm sensation that would let you comfortably run half naked in the frosty mountains, while an especially hearty or nutritious meal could even let you survive mortal wounds far beyond normal! Some days, all a traveler needs is a warm stew, right?"

      "description": "Enchanting is a skill probably best described as the enhancement of an object’s Aura. At first, one would need to find out which enhancement fits an object best, though skilled enchanters obviously do not need to care about that, and then lay down a basic enchantment that increases a stat, like wisdom and strength, or attack and defence. Like normal magic, there are two forms of enchanting, arcane and runic, though enchanting is by no means a magic, but rather a skill like sewing or tailoring. The former requires you to know the right school of magic related to your enchantments, like magic that increases toughness for a durability enchantment, but is more powerful because of that, while the latter simply requires you to know the right runes and how to use them. Although normally people would specialize in one of these forms of enchanting, you’re skilled in both of them, enough that you’ll soon be able to easily start using more advanced form of enchanting, such as giving objects elemental enchantments or even very specific abilities, though for the latter you need to be at least somewhat familiar with them yourself. With some experimentation, you’ll also be able to learn techniques that will increase the power of your enchantments by dozens of times, like material enchanting, where you enchant an object at every stage of its creation, such as enchanting the steel a sword will be forged from, the fire that will be used to melt it, and the water used to cool it, and finally the finished sword one last time after its completion. Another trick to enchanting is that natural objects like wood or animal parts can fit up to two or three times more enchantments than man-made ones. After a creature dies, and its soul dissipates, the aura is left withered, a shadow of its former self. But because of that hollowness, that emptiness, those items have far more room for improvement in their aura, allowing for the creation of staffs that can match up to any plasma weapons, or bows that will never miss their mark. You excel at finding similar loopholes and techniques to advance your skills, whether they are enchanting or not, and even if you were ever stuck, with seemingly no way to advance your skills to the next level, as long as you continued to research and experiment, you’d be able to either innovate or learn something that will allow them to continue on growing. This works even when it absolutely shouldn’t. Rest assured, there will be no barriers to bar you from growing ever more competent. Work at it for a few years, and even enchantments on the level of the Seeds would not be beyond you. Considering your skill at enchanting, that will become useful far sooner than you might’ve thought, as you’re starting off at a level others would need years to reach. You can probe the Aura of anything with a mere glance, knowing at a moment’s notice what enchantments would fit best, and the speed at which you work your magic might make other people think you’re doing it with just a wave of your hand. And you’ll continue to be able to work at that speed no matter how complex the work you’re attempting to do is. Who knows, you might even become the first combat enchanter with that kind of skill."

      "description": "Even among the everyday alchemists of Atlas, you have a talent for the creation of new and interesting items. Mystic Codes, modern Conceptual Weapons, even living Homunculi...with the time, study, and resources, you can create new and amazing items and magical beings that modern magi would happily chop off a limb just to possess. You also have the skill to reverse-engineer magical enchantments that others make,and with enough time, you may almost perfectly recreate them - though it takes a proportionate amount of resources and study to make something that departs from the norm,and something on par with a relic from the Age of Gods may take a king’s ransom and a near lifetime of work. To explain, a Mystic Code is a ‘support’ item utilized by magi that come in two types. The first is an Amplifier, which can strengthen or support their magic by storing reserve energy for later use or directly amplifying a spell, as the name indicates. An example of this is the jewelry used in the magecraft utilized by the Tohsaka family. The second is a ‘Specialized’ Mystic Code, which can perform a given spell or function upon being activated by the user’s magical energy. This Could even be utilized by those without magical circuits under certain conditions - for example,the Salamander Gloves used by Azaka Kokuto in a different world, which could generate flames using her ‘talent’ for spontaneous combustion alone. A Conceptual Weapon, to contrast, is a weapon that has accumulated a history within it, and do more than simple physical damage or interference - it has a singular ‘concept’ embedded within it and is able to damage or disrupt things like physical laws or magical beings, or even formless things that normally couldn’t be damaged by mundane means. It does so by imposing its given concept onto the world, and inflicting it on those the user attacks with the Weapon. A common modern example are the Black Keys utilized by the Holy Church itself. Finally, a homunculus is a magical being, an artificial lifeform created without the normal biological process of birth. The concept of ‘age’ is largely meaningless, as they begin with all of their required knowledge for whatever task they were made for upon being created, aging to adulthood in months instead of years. They also possess powerful Magic Circuits as a result of their artificial creation - though as a consequence, homunculi are usually physically frail, havemental defects, or short lifespans - some trade-off to their creation process. Perhaps in time you could eventually make one with a human lifespan or iron out some of these defects, but that will take years and resources you likely could have used a simpler creation for. For some reason, ones you create are guaranteed to be unshakeably loyal (or at least benign) to you in particular."

The medication in the box appears to have each type, of which there don’t seem to be a limit, corresponding to a unique power or ability that you have. A specific kind of Mystic Eye, an individual psychic power, perhaps a stand alone magic power. While taking the medication, that power will be sealed and unavailable to you. But it will grow in strength and capability constantly under those pills. A steady and, over years, quite significant growth rate. Especially since it can improve well beyond normal limits. Mystic Eyes of Distortion that might normally be limited to twisting off limbs, heads or tearing a car in half at best could grow over four or five years to be capable of tearing apart an entire city river bridge, a metal suspension construct twisted asunder. Something as broad as all your Magecraft would be too much for this medication however, as it seems to work on a very specific basis. It never runs out at least and there don’t appear to be complications from taking many pills at once, though it will not improve the growth rate for each individual power beyond the base boost one dose gives."

Pausing time, however, is not forbidden because of the impact on time one could have of its abuse. Pausing time is a powerful ability, as the entire flow of reality itself is put on hold for the actions of the few. Such a power, to halt the movement of an entire dimension itself, requires the sacrifice of the life of the one using it. Sailor Pluto’s Garnet Orb allows her to do this forbidden ability. This orb is similar to hers, but the cost is merciful. You may pause time for up to a total amount of one hour per jump with this orb. While you can stop time at any moment you like, the gem will, during the paused time, begin to crack as you use more and more of this paused time. When you have paused time for up to a total of one hour, the gem will shatter. For example: If you paused time for twenty minutes the last time you used it during a jump, and then paused time for forty more minutes, the gem will shatter. You will find a new orb when you go to the next jump. It can also summon up a circular force-field to protect the user and their friends from any time altering acts, such as freezing or slowing them. If the user has the Senshi Origin, they may also summon up a great power from this orb,​ ​Sailor Pluto’s Dead Scream. An attack that speeds up time around the target to disintegrate them. This power is a great draw on its reserves, and can only be done thrice per month. Dead Scream usage will not harm the orb, but time pausing will."

There are of course limitations to it, most significantly you can only draw out items that are small enough to fit through the open pages of the book in question. Any item you create will also drain your magical energies slightly for however long it exists. While this is slight if you keep too many items active at once (usually ten) it will become more noticeable and will negatively impact your health. Similarly, if you do not return items that you have used back to their books after using them, you will likely burn the books out and make them unusable after a mere twenty five uses. This power comes with a number of other restrictions and drawbacks (paramount that the books must be published, read by a large number of people in hard­copy and be actual books, not comic books or manga or the like) but other than that nearly the whole of literature is available to you. (Additional rules and restrictions may apply. See notes)"

You know everything about the magical artifacts of this world. This isn’t just rote knowledge of what to do, you have the experience and intuition like you personally have made all kinds of transformation trinkets. This leads into you being able to innovate and improve transformation trinkets well beyond what they can already do, if you put in the time and effort. In addition, you can combine other kinds of magic besides this world’s into personal equipment you make (not just transformation trinkets.) Though you don’t gain any extra experience, using aspects from another magical system shouldn’t take you more than twice as long as normal. Finally, you can create transformation trinkets that awaken magic in the user, even to those that have no innate talent or potential for it. Users awakened this way will be completely dependent on the transformation trinket to start with, but after a decade of use will be able to use the magic on their own. More complex items will take more time, material, and resources to create. In addition, it will take roughly a decade before you can make transformation trinkets that grant a basic level of skill. (CG Note: The remainder of this perk requires The Power of Friendship - Generic MG first.) Intelligent Devices (The Power Of Friendship) What better friend is there in combat than a weapon? You can make sapient equipment, and the better you know the intended user, the better you can tune the new personality to work with the user. The more compatible the equipment is with the user, the more comfortable the user will be using it, and the less training they’ll need for it. In addition, with a sufficiently compatible personality in the equipment, it will become bound to the user, constantly returning when needed and incapable of being destroyed while the user still lives. And if the user returns from death, so can their gear. The level of sapience is up to you to decide during the design stage. You may want an armor that only gives feelings of danger to allow the user to dodge better, or a staff that is not only a good magical focus, but a peer to the wizard that uses it."

Additionally, if you try hard enough, you can imagine even more things, and perhaps make imaginary doors and windows to keep people in or out, among other possibilities; these imaginary constructs will be invisible to other people, but have a solid feel to anyone who touches them. This also lets you potentially perform various tasks using “pretend” items in place of the real ones you’d need otherwise; for instance, with this you could do sewing (even Shadow Sewing) without real sewing equipment. However, you are limited to mundane, ordinary things; at most, you could pretend to drive an ordinary car, but don’t ask for a James Bond limo, much less a nuke.

A mermaid is born from the chaotic irritation within a clam creating a pearl, which then is enchanted by Never Never Land’s magic and becomes at once a fully-aged mermaid; being the manifestation of that irritation, mermaids are naturally vain and jealous. This insight, combined with your magic, gives you the ability to enchant pearls with magic. But more than that, you know how mermaids are born, and can reproduce the process yourself. By growing clams under the right magical conditions, you can create new mermaids. The more magic the pearl is exposed to before the clam opens, the more mysterious and wiser the mermaid; the longer the pearl grows and the irritation intensifies, the more beautiful and vainer the mermaid. Generally, with a stable supply of magic, you can grow an average mermaid in 2 to 4 years, though she will not have any magical powers besides breathing underwater. To grow a mermaid with special abilities such as singing or controlling water can take up to seven years. As for creating a mermaid at the level of a nymph queen or water spirit, it would take 10 full years. That said, with a large enough aquaculture facility and ready access to natural magic, you can grow multiple pearls at once."

The Magic Rod is enchanted with a lethal spell, by waving this rod you will fire a blast of powerful energy at your enemies - with the power of the “Fire” spell in “Wise Man’s Teachings”, the Magic Book giving you the lessons to further refine your magic. By reading through, the Magical Rod’s attack now becomes a ball of fire upon impact, allowing you to torch dry grass that could hide secret paths as well as allowing you to defeat multiple enemies at once. The Power Bracelet is an enchanted bracelet, while wearing this you will have the physical strength to push large boulders. Unfortunately, it does not increase your damage with any of the swords, nor does it allow you to fight any more effectively with your bare hands. Finally, the Blue Ring acts as an enchanted ring giving you the effects of “Shield” from the Wise Man’s Teachings as long as you or any other wears it."

Searching for the hero and the treasure of Hyrule will be difficult normally...but with this collection, you’ll find no corner of Hyrule is beyond your reach! The items you receive are the Hammer, the Ladder, Boots, the Cross, a Compass, the Red Candle, and the Magic Key. The Hammer is enchanted to smash through stone easily(and nothing else) to remove boulder obstacles, the boots allow you to walk across water, the Cross reveals mystically hidden and otherwise “invisible” objects/creatures/places, the Compass will always point to the closest valuables around you(prioritizing magic artifacts from strongest to weakest if there are multiple around), the Red Candle is a magical flame that cannot be doused and used to ignite flammable material, and the Magic Key is a “Skeleton key” that can shift itself to fit for any physical lock and key system. All this together ensures one thing - the treasures of Hyrule are yours to seize, including the Triforce your master howls for."

      "description": "Monsters are creatures that are not given birth to through evolution like normal animals, but are rather birthed by mana. Though after that, they can reproduce normally. The birth of a monster has two stages: first is the catalyst, where elemental mana comes together in certain quantities and patterns, which then triggers stage two, the gathering and formation of other mana types to create the body, such as fur, bone, or blood mana. And now, you know three methods of causing the same process yourself. The first is simply drawing together the mana manually, whether that is through a Druid’s affinities or a Mage’s spells. The second is to draw runic spell formation circles to gather the mana. This can be used in various ways, such as simply making ones to gather and store the mana types you want and then create a number of monsters at a trigger, or to just spawn them endlessly the moment enough mana is gathered to level up at a fast pace. The third is Summoning Magic, which you are decently good at. It works through the same principles as the first two methods to create monsters, but as teleportation magic is part of it, you can also use it to do things such as actually summoning monsters or other beings and things within a certain radius matching your specifications to you, teleporting yourself, or creating contracts (forced or willing) to easily summon creatures or their spirits, in case you killed them and placed a mark on their body before they died. Another thing to mention would be that in this world, Dungeons are also a kind of monster, which you would of course also be capable of creating. Now, those are some useful skills, but the one thing separating you from others capable of doing the same is your talent for creating and designing entirely new life, whether that is monsters or animals. With careful study, you can find the right mana combinations for nigh-anything you might want to create, whether that is a hermaphroditic moose reproducing with itself throughout all of time and space or simply a fluffy fox girl. As a last bonus, anything you create will be loyal to you. It would be pathetic to die to the improved version of the Lunar Titan you made, right?"

      "description": "In Neolife, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that magic is in everything. One interesting facet of this can be seen in how on many worlds, dug earth and other natural resources are replaced by the ambient mana over the course of a few weeks if there isn’t anything like a support structure preventing it. While this is certainly convenient, you thought to yourself, “I can do better”. After all, many important resources can’t even be found on planets, like mana gems or the insanely rare mineral osmium, which are only found on asteroids. But with the ability you created, this won’t be a problem anymore, because you can just restore them anyway: simply by spending enough mana, it is possible for you to regenerate any natural resource or duplicate existing ones. You could pump mana into an asteroid to restore whatever it is that was mined there to get effectively infinite resources out of it, do the same to the extremely valuable gem lying in front of you to get multiple copies of it, or send out a massive wave of mana to cover a whole planet in a forest. The mana required scales linearly with the amount of the resource you want to work with, its complexity, and its power. So while you could easily get massive amounts of diamonds and wood even with a little mana, duplicating something like the Top 5 metals (see Notes) or similar materials would require truly insane amounts of mana."

This can lead to the creature weakening & failing, or even dying outright. Not so in your case, monster. Your flesh is... receptive to such changes - in fact, your flesh would make a Master Moulder or Mutator salivate and squeal for the chance to study. Surgical implants and mutations will suffer fewer negative consequences when introduced to your biology, to the point of nullifying the potential of rejection. Additionally, such augmentations will change over time to accommodate your actions and capabilities - cancerous tumors aiding in the building and development of musculature as well as regenerating wounds, as an example. A mutated immune system would eventually grow to the point of resisting magical infections, as a potential other example."

      "description": "Somewhere along the way, you got your hands on a most peculiar whistle. While it's not as powerful as your normal magical and musical instrument, it still manages to be quite useful. When blown, this whistle can be heard by the last eight people to touch it - or seven and you if you prefer - no matter what distance there is between you. They could be off in some far flung land or even in one of the many dreamscapes that dot this world, and it would still make itself known. Additionally, the blowing of the whistle is synonymous with the casting of a spell that might come to be known as Farore's Wind, offering those who hear it the option of flying to your side. Be warned, the whistle has a limited reserve of magic and fills slowly. You may need to use your own to make up the difference if you really are in a dreamscape, or try to use it too often."

With this, you can talk to them as if they were right beside you and get constant status reports as they besiege a keep while you fight in the trenches. In addition to basic conversation, you and others connected by this perk’s communications will also be able to tell the basic status of the others connected, allowing you to march to their aid even if they don’t speak up for themselves."

How this manifests depends upon the psychic in question, but a given psychic almost always has the same manifestation every time. These manifestations can be cramps, a tingling sensation, “a bad feeling,” or any number of other things. Certain magics( such as a true mage’s Time or Mind spheres) or the Anti-psychic power can suppress this. Depending upon the precog’s skill, they might only know that they are in danger, or they might know the best way to avoid it, such as ducking or jumping. More skilled psychics may know the exact source and direction of the danger, precise details, or even knowledge enough to recognize the person responsible( if any).

[5] Clear Sight - Very few precogs ever reach this level. But those that do are able to accurately predict the most probable future. The precog chooses a target to foresee the future of, be it themselves, another, their location, or an object they touch. If their target isn’t themselves, they must touch it. Upon doing so, the psychic gains vague but accurate information about any and all major events in the next year of their target’s existence.

Most of all, as an artwork may very well lack eyes, ears, head, or nose, you do not need your regular senses to use this tracking ability."

Whenever you fly up to the star, or just look up at it in the sky, it now manifests itself as a head-sized ball of light that can speak. Stars were placed in the heavens for a crime they have forgotten, and they enjoy having any company. They know many secrets, and can even spy on specific locations on different worlds, acting as a sort of look-out. The stars are rather ornery, so your relations with them may vary. To make sure that you can successfully communicate with the stars without killing yourself, the perk also grants you protection from extreme heat, gravity, lack of air, and other negative effects that would normally impede your conversations with stars, but only when you are interacting with them. The perk also makes it possible for you to “blow out” stars like candles; the star in real life will not be harmed, but all light from it will be sealed for the next year until it recovers (and don’t expect it to be very talkative now). In the case of the Sun, though, seeing as children view it differently from stars, it is quite old and powerful, able to shoot a million arrows either for directions or for defense/offense and very difficult to blow out; therefore, he makes for a great ally or a great foe if you cross him. In other jumps, this means that any star that is viewed by a large population as a sun will be elevated to a rank higher than normal stars. After the jump, you are able to actively ignore the enforced rules of reality and chat with the stars just as you could in Neverland. Outside observers are still blinded by their grown-up logic, and will be baffled at the impossible paradox they are witnessing."

Things that seem to lurk in the shadows, or just in the corner of our eyes – things that seem to happen when we have our heads turned – all of the things that usually go about unnoticed. You however, seem to have a knack not only for seeing these things, but also attracting them to you on occasion. Things that don’t belong, things that would otherwise be hidden away, these don’t escape your eyes. A talent that at first only manifests as an odd sensation when you notice something amiss will eventually become a trained skill to discern what is off. Naturally, this works on mundane people as well, and you’ll be able to discern when there is something wrong with them."

To do so, you need both a focal item and a focal point. For the focal item, you need an object closely tied with the person related to the events you want to learn about (such as Alice’s old hair band for Alice, or the very person in question). Second, you need to be at the site most tied to the events/person in question – you don’t need to be directly at the location of the events, just at least in the general vicinity of. Once you are in the proper location and have the focal object ready, you may start the ritual by chaotically drinking (and spilling) tea and singing nonsense rhyme. You or a companion will then enter a trance and, in a singsong voice, repeat a poem of sorts narrating the events of the past. The speaker will remember the recitation even after exiting the trance You have no control over what events are retold, but it will always be something narratively important for your present circumstances/goals somehow. You do not actually see the past but rather receive its narration in the poem; it will be up to you and your friends to interpret the message accordingly. Please also note that it is possible for enemies with temporal abilities of their own to intercept and block your vision. If blocked, you will break out of the trance prematurely and become temporarily comatose."

Among the most powerful forms of precognition known, this psionic abilities grants the right to decide the certain future at the cost of your own free will. With your right eye, you can see the future. Searching for any specific possible outcome from the current point in time, you can look through varying timelines up to six months in advance. The test scores on an exam, the result of a sports game, the way a foe you seek to assassinate will fight. It is not impossible to block this vision with powerful magic or other time-based abilities but such things should be very rare. More importantly, it is your left eye that dominates. It visualises a path to you that, if followed in your actions, will certainly lead to the future you have seen with your right eye. The longer you watch the specific future result you desire and the more information you gather, the better, as your path will have more information to act on. The left eye does not care for your interests, emotions or other goals and will simply pursue the ideal path to reaching the future you saw. By abandoning all restrictions on your morals and desires, you make that future utterly guaranteed, bar the intervention of immense magical forces or time interference. A quick glance to seeing a hotel destroyed would give you a random path to that result. Spending hours searching for the specific method and result for destroying that hotel would give you a path to achieving that. Keep in mind that you can only see possible futures, your paths will not lead you to things impossible for you to achieve. There are two limitations to this seemingly infinite ability. The first is that you must be present to witness the final result of the path with your own eyes. Whatever future you pursue, you must be within line of sight of the final moments. Without this quality, the future will always rebel against the control your left eye exerts and changes occur. The person you wished dead survives, injured but aware of you as their attacker. The desired to be destroyed hotel remains unscathed but the bombing plot is unveiled to the public. The second limitation is that, as a method of making the future certain and forcing a single timeline to occur, it becomes clear to those that can sense such things that you are taking action. It may even be possible, for those with truly rare powers, to destroy the timeline because you make it such a tangible, determined path."

While capable of keeping a powerful sorceress prisoner for a thousand years the prisoner may be released if they can answer truly if they regret their actions.

By utilizing magical relics or large amounts of magical energies, you can look into the future of the mortal realm and even some places..beyond. The more used for this view, the further you can look and the more information you can glean from it. What kind of fool thinks that they can defeat an enemy that sees and knows all?"

The descendants of the seven sages who sealed Ganon all seem to have some form of psychic powers - enough to talk to Link from halfway across Hyrule at the bare minimum, a skill you now share with them. If you so wished, you could forge a bond between you and another that would never fade, allowing the two of you to speak and feel each others emotions no matter the distance. But that power is only a derivative of its true nature. With this, nature spirits, minor gods, wise old men who may be sages but aren’t one of the seven sages, and all sorts of beings will conspire to add you to their circle of gossip. A dark power rises in the east, this year’s harvest will be a poor one, the Hero recently slayed a monster in the far north...

More powerful Sorcerers and Sorceresses however can do more than just look though. Those with great magical skill and power can use the Gate of Souls as a conduit for summoning objects, individuals and creatures from past eras into the current one. It was through this application that Cia was able to swell her army’s ranks with monsters. Beyond the incredible abilities of even Cia, only made possible with something as powerful as the completed Triforce, the Gate of Souls can even be used as a gate for transporting entire places from past eras as they existed back then, with all they contain, and juxtaposing them over the current era."

      "description": "As part of your contract with Kyubey, your soul has been partially separated from your body. It is contained within a tiny gem with a color and aesthetic matching your personality and your wish...well, what WOULD have been your wish if you chose a background, or just a look that ‘fits’ for Drop-In. The benefits to this state are as follows: Unaging - You do not physically age from the point of your contract onwards. Magical Body - You can transform into a Magical Girl form by activating the Soul Gem, where it will rest on a part of your body either embedded onto your skin or as a piece of jewelry (it can remain in this form in your ‘civilian’ persona, as well). This creates a ‘projection’ around your physical form that is much more physically athletic and can take a lot of physical punishment with only some of the damage and the pain. Being knocked around or juggled by a powerful Wraith is still an unpleasant and painful experience, but you’d have a good chance of surviving the first few attacks instead of immediately dying like an ordinary person would. It’s in this form that you can use your Magic, detailed below. Even better? As long as your Soul Gem is still intact, you can use magical energy to regenerate your body even if you were just a smoldering pile of ash, though this takes time and is a huge drain on your resources - you’re more likely to disappear without a full ‘tank’ of energy ready than completely regenerate from a single cell. You will also be conscious through the entire experience, so...try not to get to that point. Magical Girls, Represent! - As a bonus, your ‘transformed state’ has a neat costume and aesthetic of your choosing. It doesn’t change its function, but if you want to wear a pretty dress into battle or look like an armored knight of some kind, you can. Just note that what you choose remains the same unless you find another way to modify it. That said, this isn’t all sunshine and pink dresses. There are some downsides. No Wish For You - I’m holding onto that wish of yours until we’re finished with your chain. Believe me, it is not worth cashing in here. Energy Requirements - Everything I explained above, and the Magic it powers, is a product of the Soul Gem. The Soul Gem only has so much energy to spend and for the duration of this jump, you can only regain energy by using the remnants of Wraiths after defeating them. While you generally won’t have to worry about this if you pick your fights wisely, using a huge amount of power or coming back from atomization will put you in the red fairly quickly. Your mood will also dampen and become increasingly manic and depressed the more severe your energy deficit is. This also ties into… It’s Called a Soul Gem For A Reason You Moron - The Soul Gem literally houses your soul. If you’re separated from it (more than a small room’s distance would do it), your body will drop dead and start decomposing, utterly helpless until the Gem is returned to it. You have no motor control or awareness in the Soul Gem itself, to boot. What’s more, it’s amazingly fragile and if destroyed, will instantly kill you. Hm? You can survive this somehow? Then your Soul Gem will reform with you, but it will lose the same amount of energy needed to restore your body from the ground-up. You’ll need to ‘refill’ quickly. Game Over - If your Soul Gem is destroyed (without some way to cheat death) or you exhaust all of your energy, you suffer the same fate as other Magical Girls and vanish from existence...although, in your case, you just go home safe and sound as if nothing happened. Thankfully, this only applies to this jump - I’ll get to alternatives and how things work onwards in a little bit."

In order to access it, one needs to build up energy by fighting Vertexes or hostile foes. You will be able to tell from a stamp somewhere on your clothes displaying a flower on it. The more flowers that bloom on the stamp and the more elaborate it gets, the more energy that has built up. Energy cannot be gained via training alone. This form is capable of destroying the bodies of the weaker Vertexes to expose the soul that dare to threaten humanity in a single strike and tearing into the outer shells of the strongest Vertexes. This form is also capable of growing different, but thematically fitting powers, such as a protective flowerbud holding two people in to protect them from the flames of atmospheric reentry. One may also be able to fly in this form. However, this form comes at a cost, called Sange. See, all your power is borrowed from the god Shinju-Sama, and you must make a sacrifice to gain this power. When the form ends, you lose a part of your body or your mind. This can range from memories, to losing your sense of taste, to losing your eyesight in one eye. Thankfully, your outfit will change to accommodate for any physical losses so you won’t be affected by bigger sacrifices like losing the use of your legs, and your instincts will never leave you if you lose your memory. And post-jump, you will gain everything back and no longer need to give up any part of you to use Mankai."

Most halflings, both male and female, oft have a beergut to match their desire for both good food and a comfortable life. I’ll leave that particular detail up to you. Their feet, large and hairy on the tops, are naturally thick-skinned and leathery - rendering boots and other forms of footwear redundant as they can even walk on broken glass or jagged mountainous trails without damage. This and their naturally quick fingers and quiet movement lend halflings a natural intuition at stealth and sneaking about - fitting with their lack of physical strength. Lastly, halflings have a native resistance to magic, both beneficial and harmful. It is not to the same extent as dwarven near-immunity, but a fireball that would severely burn a human soldier will leave a halfling singed and momentarily blinded. After your decade here is up, you may choose to have your halfling form available as an alternate form to transform into."

Perhaps your face is a little too forgettable, even... Jade: Rather than an obvious elemental manifestation of some sort, you may seem to be more ‘alive’ in general – at least during the spring and summer. More vibrant flesh, hair, and eyes reflect the increased life within you. Of course, you might wrinkle and wither somewhat during the fall and winter, but it is nothing too noticeable.

By activating your pearl with the catchphrase, “Jump Pearl Voice,” your pearl turns into a microphone and you undergo a transformation into a human, magical girl. You can maintain this form even underwater. Now your songs are truly magical – and I mean literally! Evil people and those devoted to darkness will find your songs incredibly painful, and take damage as if you were directly attacking them. The songs also have the effect of dispelling hypnotic effects on victims, creating a protective shield of sorts around the singers, and other special abilities. If enough passion and power is put into the songs, there is even enough power to summon or dispel tsunamis. However, if you take enough damage or use up enough of your energy, the transformation ceases and you return to your normal self. In addition, while you can sing songs you already know, the perk does not come with the ability to invent songs; mermaids instinctively know certain songs, but others you will have to be taught by someone. If the perk is used by a species that is not a mermaid and lacks a pearl, you manifest your microphone in some other manner, such as from a part of your body."

      "description": "Your node carried with it an artifact from the old Hero system used 300 years ago, at the beginning of the Divine Era. Somehow the Taisha did not completely wipe this node for whatever reason, perhaps due to an oversight. Before Mankai was implemented in the system, a Hero would instead draw on Shinju-Sama’s collective memory from all mythological figures that had walked the Earth. They would gain the part of the power of a mythological figure, potentially anytime they needed to. Their outfit would change, and their weapon would change, just like with Mankai. They could also call upon it at will once they have unlocked their ability. This can grant many powerful abilities, ranging from the ability to split yourself into seven clones, all needing to be simultaneously killed in order to kill them permanently, to make an enlarged yo-yo spin in the air and ride on it, or to carry a force of a nuclear bomb in one’s fists. But like Mankai, this also came with a cost. The Trump Card would give great physical damage to the Hero using it depending on the strength borrowed. They would be hospitalized for days in extreme cases. And excessive and extended use over a short period of time would deteriorate someone’s mental health, the severity of it also based on the power of the borrowed historical figure. Your Trump Card cannot carry with it any divine magical beings associated with the sky, such as Zeus or Apollo. As Shinju-Sama’s collective memory includes those who walked the land and is made up of the gods of land, it does not include divine beings for that reason. Underworld figures, like Hades or Cerebus, are acceptable choices to make for your Trump card, but it is not limited to those. You get one to start out with, and over time you may unlock more with training."

In exchange for its loyalty to you, you can bless any aquatic animal (as long as it is the size of a dolphin or smaller) with magic. Through this gift, they gain a humanoid form akin to that of the Sea Creature background, and generally some unique magical ability. However, this boon is a gift from you, and can be withdrawn. Either by your own will, by the servants voluntarily giving their life energy to you to restore your strength, or by having your powers sealed, the blessing can be retracted, causing the beings to return to their mundane forms. Generally, with a moderate capacity for magic, you can bless 3 to 7 water creatures at a time. In time, you may be able to find ways past these limitations. As most sea life in this world is already intelligent, you do not need to worry about boosting their intellect, but in worlds where the sea creatures lack sentience, you will need to put a little extra oomph into your boons; however, the intelligence boost remains permanent even if the rest of the blessing vanishes."

When consumed by a person, the lily causes one to transform into a ‘perfected’ human, a Progenitor of sorts through advanced Alchemy. Perfect humans are incredibly intelligent, able to pick up the vast complications of Alchemy with about as much difficulty as a regular human studying mundane sciences, and have enough physical power and stamina to be on par with a Symphogear user. They are also... well, female. Yes, Saint Germain deduced through her research that the perfect human form is female, backing up her claims through the restrictions of a Philosopher Stone.

Other than attacks, this is mainly employed for effects corresponding to the Skills Magic Resistance, Clairvoyance, for raising parameters, and etc. All of those are merely temporary and cannot you employ multiple of those simultaneously. Protection from Arrows: C - Protection from Arrows is an increased defense against ranged attacks by predicting the projectiles' trajectories through exceptional means, such as hearing the sound of air being cut, or sensing the killing intent of the enemy. Noble Phantasm: Gae Bolg: Barbed Spear that pierces with Death: B - Gae Bolg: Barbed Spear that pierces with Death is an attack focused on a single target, created by Lancer to suit his own style, that strikes a fatal blow that always pierces the opponent's heart and ruins their body from within with its thousand iron thorns. It literally freezes the mana in the air, and it can easily be perceived as a sure-kill technique by all those around simply from being charged with magical energy. Once Gáe Bolg's name has been called, the cursed spear reverses the nature of causality, the meaning of \"cause and effect\" in the order of things, to make it so the cause of the \"lance being thrust\" comes from the effect of the \"opponent's heart being pierced\" by it. It determines the opponent's fate simply through its use, an always fatal move that pierces the heart with one thrust. It is also possible for him to activate it without actively striking the heart. It is an attack on destiny itself, and while not a surprising fact due its wielder's demi-god heritage, it is a top-notch power even with its seeming limitations in power due to being a step away from the Authority of the gods. Gae Bolg: Soaring Spear that strikes with Death: B - Gae Bolg: Soaring Spear that strikes with Death is the true use of Gáe Bolg, is the largest and most powerful attack delivered using the spear. It is the “attack that unleashes countless darts at the enemy” that is spoken of in the legends. It is the attack that made him a hero which utilizes the full potential of the lance's curse, converting all of Lancer's magical energy into energy and releasing the accumulated power after the spear is hurled, detonating on impact with enough power to blow away a multitude of enemies. It does not carry the property or concept of “always pierces the opponent’s heart”, but both the power and the area of effect are increased."

At rank B it is capable of calm analysis of battle conditions even when in danger and deduce an appropriate course of action after considering all possibilities to escape from a predicament. So long there is even a 10% chance of a comeback, this ability greatly improves the chances of winning. Magecraft: C - Magecraft is knowledge about modern Thaumaturgy. At rank C is capable of using orthodox Thaumaturgy. Archer’s rank in using Projection Magic when the target falls under the category of \"sword\" is A+. Noble Phantasm: Unlimited Bladeworks: E~EX - Unlimited Blade Works: Infinite Creation of Swords is the Noble Phantasm of the Heroic Spirit EMIYA. Emiya does not have a true Noble Phantasm that is the crystallized embodiment of a hero's existence like many demonic or holy swords, but if a Noble Phantasm is considered to be a symbol of the Heroic Spirit, then the Reality Marble is his Noble Phantasm. It is high-class thaumaturgy that embodies their internal worlds and imprints them upon the world as a bounded field. It is their one true specialization of magecraft, the result of \"Sword\" being both their Origin and their Elemental Affinity, and the basis of their projection and reinforcement skills. It is the definite answer obtained by someone whose life was saved by a sword, actually merged and lived with a sword, and acted as a sword all of his life. Emiya has no penalties from the world while utilizing his version of Unlimited Blade Works. The Reality Marble's purpose is a steel manufacturing factory that produces the countless famous swords without owners that extend into the horizon. It contains all of the raw materials and sorcery needed for the formation of the weapons, and it records and analyzes all weapons and defensive armaments encountered. The number of unique weapons encountered and recorded by Archer exceeds numerous thousands, most of which are Noble Phantasms. Their entire histories, compositions, and designs are all perfectly recorded, allowing for instant proficiency with the weapons by inheriting all combat skills and techniques utilized by their original owners. This allows for the reproduction of Noble Phantasms, which would generally be impossible for a faker. They can also be modified to the user's taste with reinforcement as shown by Archer's Caladbolg II and Kanshou and Bakuya. Close combat weapons such as swords, spears, and halberds are the main focus of the Reality Marble in accordance with Emiya's Origin of \"Sword\", which also makes it impossible to record or reproduce modern weaponry like guns and other mobile weapons. Shields and defensive armaments can be reproduced with a much greater struggle, as the cost in magical energy is high, two or three times greater than a sword, and the effects are merely transient compared to the originals. Weapons encountered are immediately analyzed with a single glance, enabling them to be projected immediately afterward, and once projected, they are stored within the Reality Marble for later use. Shiro is able to instantly recognize dozens of weapons being fired from the Gate of Babylon at an extremely high rate and instantly counter with projections of the same weapons before they can strike. The analysis of weapons is limited only to the direct use of human senses, meaning that blueprints and materials will be unable to provide the necessary information for a proper analysis. Shared memories, such as dreams shared with a Servant, can allow for weapons to be analyzed and projected, even if they have been lost like Caliburn. The quality of projected weapons will always be degraded by one rank due to humans being unable to fully conceptualize the existence of an object through only one sense, and they will never equal the originals without a technique such as detonating them as Broken Phantasms. The Reality Marble allows for projection and reinforcement in the real world. Weapons are produced within Unlimited Blade Works and then brought into the world, greatly lowering the cost of reproducing them and allowing for numerous weapons to be prepared at once to be projected. Weapons can be summoned directly to the user's hands, or they can be summoned to levitate within the air and fire upon the enemy as arrows much like the Gate of Babylon. Once the Reality Marble is deployed, all of the weapons are available for use, and any weapon can immediately be called to the user's hands or levitated even while the user is in direct combat. The weapons reproduced once the Reality Marble is first activated will not consume magical energy, but those used or destroyed within it will add to the cost of maintaining the bounded field. The amount of energy used to reproduce weapons that did not exist after the bounded field was expanded and the amount of energy used to recreate weapons destroyed while it is activated is extremely costly."

While active the user will have to rely on brute force rather than any technique. Toggleable. Personal Skills: Battle Continuation: B - Battle Continuation is the strength of vitality for predicaments. Also, the ability to withdraw from combat and reach allied territory alive after being defeated. At rank B Makes it possible to fight even with deadly injuries. Bravery: A - Bravery is the ability to negate mental interference such as pressure, confusion and fascination. Not usable under the effects of Mad Enhancement. Divinity: B - Divinity is the measure of whether one has Divine Spirit aptitude or not. At high levels one is treated as a mixed race of a Divine Spirit, and the level declines when the Heroic Spirit's own rank as a Monster, Demonic Beast raises. It can also decrease due one's dislike for the gods. It also has an effect, which reduces special defensive values called \"purge defense\" in proportion to the Divinity's Rank. It can break through Skills such as Protection of the Faith and Enlightenment of the Sacred Fig. Eye of the mind False: C - Eye of the Mind (False) is a natural talent to avoid danger on the basis of an innate 6th sense, intuition, or prescience, where accuracy of instinct has been augmented by experience—somewhat overcoming the problem of visual obstructions that appear in the course of combat. The difference between Eye of the Mind (True) and Eye of the Mind (False) lies in that the former is an ability that humans can obtain through accumulation of experience. The 'False' version is superficially similar, but in fact represents a natural instinct that cannot be obtained regardless of effort or experience—even though experience can refine its accuracy. Calm analysis of battle conditions, by which competent grasp of the status of the self and the opponent are obtainable even in the midst of danger; utilization of such to deduce the appropriate course of action that permits escape from a lethal predicament. (Even though Heracles's sanity was lost due to Mad Enhancement, this skill remained effective as it is nearly an instinct. When crossing swords with a seasoned swordsman like Artoria, he would not fall for half-hearted feints. Noble Phantasm: God Hand: C - God Hand is a blessing of the gods representing immortality, as well as being a curse, that was granted to him for completing his Twelve Labors in life. It is the ability that required attacks of the highest grade to harm him and prevented him from even being scratched by anyone during the Age of Gods, described as \"nearly foul play\" even by acquaintances at the time. It lacks an overt external manifestation such as a weapon or armor, but, in attributing a shape to it, can be said to be the body of the user itself. It transforms the body into a tough suit of armor that acts similar to a conceptual weapon in practice, coloring his body like lead and covering it with strange protrusions. It provides three effects of resurrection, attack- nullification, and the ability of \"immunity against an attack he has experienced previously.\" This ability nullifies attacks under C-rank and gives an extra life. This extra life restocks once per jump. Nine Lives: The Shooting Hundred Heads: C~A - Nine Lives: The Shooting Hundred Heads is the most trusted of all of Heracles's Noble Phantasms. It originally had the form of the bow and arrows used to simultaneously exterminate the one hundred heads of the Hydra, an immortal nine- headed serpent that would grow back no matter how many times they were cut down. Upon slaying the Hydra, he became able to utilize techniques that emulate the ability of the Noble Phantasm with other weapons, transforming it into Style: Shooting the Hundred Heads, an all- purpose Noble Phantasm capable of adapting and changing how it appears depending on the target and circumstances of its use. Regardless of whether this technique is delivered with a bow, large sword, shield, spear, axe, or possibly even unarmed, the technique boasts power on the level of Noble Phantasms by drawing out the maximum power of the weapon. It can display power from Anti-Unit to Anti-Army, even up to fortress sieging all depending on the circumstances. In essence, it is “a high speed attack consisting of nine consecutive strikes, as swift as if the attacks are overlapping."

Parameters: Strength: C Mana: C Endurance: E Luck: E Agility: B Class Skills: Magic Resistance: C - Magic Resistance grants protection against magical effects. Differently from the Resistance effect that merely rejects Magical Energy, this ability cancels the spells altogether. At rank C it cancels spells with a chant below two verses. Cannot defend against Magecraft on the level of High-Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals. Riding: A - Riding, the Class Skill of Rider and Saber, is the ability to ride mounts. Rider-class Servants will typically possess a high rank, and A-rank can allow for Phantasmal Beasts and Divine Beasts to be mounted. Personal Skills: Divinity: E - Divinity is the measure of whether one has Divine Spirit aptitude or not. At high levels one is treated as a mixed race of a Divine Spirit, and the level declines when the Heroic Spirit's own rank as a Monster, Demonic Beast raises.

It can break through Skills such as Protection of the Faith and Enlightenment of the Sacred Fig. Independent Action: D - Independent Action is the ability to remain independent even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from the Master. At the higher ranks, it is also possible to remain for extended periods of time in this world without an established contract. For the purposes of the Class Cards this allows you to keep them installed for longer. Monstrous Strength: C - Monstrous Strength is an ability possessed by monsters and beasts, temporary boost of the Strength parameter by one rank for a time limit determined by the ranking of this skill. Mystic Eyes: A - Mystic Eyes is the possession of Mystic Eyes that are capable of interfering with the outside world. The Mystic Eyes of Petrification are Rider's Mystic Eyes, said to be a \"curse of the gods sealed by the powers of shrines.\" Though petrification sorcery is no strange thing for modern Thaumaturgy, even if its users are rare and few in numbers, Mystic Eyes capable of petrifying others are something that nobody, human or not, possesses in the present era. They are designated as Jewel under the Noble Colors system, which surpasses the Gold- ranked Eyes of the Dead Apostles and are exclusively possessed by Holy Spirits and Magical Beasts from the Age of Gods. Those who possess Rank D or lower in Mana will be immediately petrified, while those with Rank C may or may not be affected depending on the conditions. Those with Rank B or higher won’t be petrified, but will sustain \"pressure\" from the Eyes and receive a one rank-down to all parameters. The entire body of the target will be affected, including clothing and weaponry, \"killing them while alive\" as they are turned to stone. The ability is viable in petrifying a group of enemies, but it would not be useful against an infinite number like the horde of shades spawned by Avenger. The amount of energy it uses is comparable to also fighting them off with her Noble Phantasms, so it would quickly drain her faster than simply fighting them off in melee combat. Noble Phantasm: Bellerophon: Bridle of Chivalry: A - Bellerophon is a shining golden bridle and whip paired as a set that is capable of fully controlling a Divine Beast. It is an oddity even among Noble Phantasms, having no effect without a mount. Its power is great, providing extraordinary offensive and defensive capabilities of the highest level. You also gain the ability to bring forth the Pegasus given to medusa by Poseidon Breaker Gorgon: Self Seal, Temple of Darkness: D- - Breaker Gorgon is a powerful Bounded Field on the scale of another world used by Medusa. It was a complement to the temple of blood that \"enveloped the world\" on the Shapeless Isle, having \"sealed the world\" instead. It only requires a steady supply of energy from the user to affect a target, unlike Mystic Eyes that require a direct line of sight. It has the ability to \"seal all magical properties\", catching its targets inside to become trapped within the mind of the user and removing any abilities they possessed in the outside world. Those trapped within are said to see a nightmare mixed with both delight and taboo."

At rank C one can flawlessly ride animals and vehicles that received a proper training and adjustment. Personal Skills: Charisma: C - Charisma is the natural talent to command an army. Increases the ability of allies during group battles. A rare talent, and an ability inherent to Servants of the Saver class. It is said that a rank of B in this skill is sufficient to lead a nation as its King. Instinct: B - Instinct is the power to \"feel\" the most favourable developments for oneself during battle. Mana Burst: B - Mana Burst is the increase in performance caused by infusing one's weapons and body with magical energy and instantly expelling it. Simply put, recreating the effect of a jet burst by expending large amounts of Magical Energy. Noble Phantasm: Excalibur: A++ - Excalibur is a Divine Construct, the pinnacle of holy swords, and the strongest holy sword; one of the ultimate god-forged weapons, a Last Phantasm, forged by the planet as the crystallization of the wishes of mankind stored and tempered within the planet. While there are many other Noble Phantasms crafted more splendidly and with better skill, Excalibur is an illusion far superior to them. It cannot be called beautiful because of its appearance, for the description of \"beautiful\" will only dirty it. It is instead sacred, made from people's conception, legends weaved only out of hope. It is not a myth or inhuman work, but a \"crystal trained by the heart alone\", making it reign as the strongest fantasy. It is the crystallization of the prayer named \"glory\" and everything etched in the hearts of those who are scattered at the sword's radiance; the nostalgic, sorrowful, and hallowed dream of those who were placed on the bloody hell called a battlefield, of all warriors past, present, and future fully exposed to the fear of death and despair, and who still cling to a desire: \"to be exalted.\". Excalibur is a \"sword that amplifies\", converting its user’s magical energy into offensive power and releasing it. It is a weapon of directive energy that converts the magical energy of the wielder into light by accelerating it with her factor of the dragon, intensifying the kinetic energy by convergence and acceleration, allowing for the use of Divine Spirit-level thaumaturgy. It is an \"ultimate killing technique\" that releases light holding energy equaling Artoria's total amount of magical energy from the tip of the blade once the sword is swung. While the result is what looks like a large beam of light, only the tip of the attack, which is a wave of light that can mow through the surface of the Earth, is capable of doing damage, as the beam is the result of the \"dislocation\" of everything the attack destroys in its path. Invisible Air: Bounded Field of the Wind King: C - Invisible Air is a sheath of wind that covers Excalibur and conceals it so that it cannot be easily recognized as the famous holy sword of King Arthur and expose her identity. It is a bounded field closer to magecraft than a Noble Phantasm that is made up of multiple layers of wind compressed into super-high pressure air with a massive amount of magical energy, which distorts the refraction of light and renders what is inside completely invisible. Upon Excalibur, it takes on the shape of the blade and renders it as an invisible sword that doesn't appear even as sparks fly off of it. It lacks the capacity to annihilate the enemy like Excalibur, being more suited as a \"sharp tool\" in battle. It isn't used for any particular strength, but it is easier to use in battle than Excalibur and it is a trump card that can bring about victory if used well. It is also possible to implement the barrier on something other than the sword. She can form the barrier in the area around her or as a quick defensive wall of wind, which she can keep active for a number of minutes with her magical energy. Once the barrier is released so that Excalibur can be used, the previously compressed wind surges around her chaotically, creating a vacuum as it diffuses into the air with enough force to knock over normal people and shake heavy, firm trees like a typhoon. The compressed wind can also instead be released as a single use projectile weapon called Strike Air: Hammer of the Wind King. Acting like a hammer made out of wind, it creates a gale made out of super high pressure condensed air that is powerful enough to easily crush and blow away armies and fling a stone slab weighing several tons into the air as if it were nothing."

They can, essentially, be broken down into three key aspects: sapience, an artificial linker core and the capability to Unison, which is a physical merger of Device and master in order to handle high volumes of manner – involved in casting high-energy spells or using high-power modes such as Fulldrive. While most ordinary Mages can achieve the same effects by careful preparation and focus, the Unison Device acts as a part of it’s users subconscious, subtly tweaking the flow of mana and directing their master so the process becomes instant and effortless for them. This purchase includes the latter two characteristics, refined to be used in a traditional Device, which makes your Device slightly strange among Unison Devices, as it isn’t truly sapient – should you not choose to make it so in the previous section, that is. This also gives your Device a truly strange feature – an artificial Linker Core, which would let it cast spells and power it’s systems entirely independent of you, should you wish. It starts at A-rank, and does not grow naturally, due to being mechanical in nature. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

Earth Magic stays simple in practice but what was once a few rocks has become hundreds of pounds of stone and dirt acting as a single living flow. An avalanche leashed to your will, use it wisely. You can also petrify your foes with a spell, though magical resistance is still possible. Wind Magic enhanced this way provides endless flight and greater control over the atmosphere. Creating voids that injure those around them through vacuum and very sudden gale force winds are all within your ability now. The Element of Darkness adds an element of weight to your attacks, slightly dragging those who get too close in, and can home in on foe skilled at dodging the normal way."

By taking a regular animal and empowering them with magic, you can give them a human body and intelligence level, then forge a bond between them and anyone you wish. Besides granting someone a loyal companion and partner, Disciples are naturally gifted warriors, with a level of power above that of a regular human, though still less than an Intoner. More importantly, Disciples boost the magic of those they’re bonded with. For Intoners, that means allowing them to summon ‘Angels’ into this plane of reality with their Songs. For others, it may unlock any hidden abilities or just strengthen their spells beyond what would normally be capable. While the canon disciples get along with their intoners to… various degrees, you can be a lot more prudent when giving them personalities, ensuring that they mesh well with their bondmates. Or ensure that they don’t, if you’re feeling like a bitch. Disciples are reliant on their bondmate’s energy to live. If a Disciple’s bondmate dies, or if they’re released from their duties somehow, a Disciple will turn back into the animal you crafted them from. Even if you recapture the animal and turn them into a Disciple again, they won’t have any memories of their previous time being uplifted. Disciples can also turn back into animals if they push themselves too far, such as if a Disciple attempts to summon an Intoner’s Angel on their own."

Through a mixture of medicine, hypnosis, certain magecraft-like practices, selective breeding and perhaps a touch of the inhuman you are meant to hunt- you’ve learned to slowly create new Demon Hunting clans with their own psychic bloodlines. It can take generations to stabilise and hold true but you are not limited to only the powers found in the four main branches of the Organisation- the Nanaya, Ryougi, Asakami and Fujou. Instead, you are even able to slowly design new ones of a similar level. A family of electrokinetics or who can naturally command low level spirits and fairies? Taking the young Shirazumi boys predatory mutations and creating an entire line of carnivorous demon hunters? All possible, with time and available subjects. The final note to make is that, like the clans above, there can be a great deal of individuality in the clans you breed. While most members will be stable and similar in psychic power, some will rarely appear with much more impressive variants of the normal power, either naturally or just through their life experiences."

In addition, pick one of three sub-trees to obtain. -The Biological tree grants you great strength and speed, enough to outpace a car on the freeway and then throw that same car like a rock. You also have the ability to manipulate chemicals within yourself, though this limits itself to the body’s natural chemicals and a few forms of poison and acid. With time, you could even shoot out brief streams of high-powered acid or leverage your adrenaline to keep you fighting for far longer than you could naturally. -The Hydraulic tree increases your Focus and physical stamina to great heights, allowing one to bombard an enemy with powerful spells or run for hours. You also gain the ability to manipulate water from inside your body. This can eventually allow you to restore your stamina and manipulate ice through reducing the temperature of water, or increase your body temperature at the cost of Focus and stamina to massively improve your strength. -The Psychological tree bestows powerful Instinct and durability, allowing you to empower a simple mana blast to blow up a garage, and get run over by a tank with some broken ribs at worst. In addition, you are granted control over your own bio-electricity and the element of shadow. Bio-electricity is as it sounds, but shadow in this universe is more on par with psychic attacks than a manipulation of a lack of light."

Though even they don’t completely understand how it works, magic in this world is generated by the power of the soul and intense emotions within sentient beings. Incubators themselves aren’t really capable of such things (most of the time), yet somehow found a way to harness it. Magic can create weapons from thin air, make dimensional spaces, halt the flow of time and even reverse it completely to a predetermined point. It can even create a wish tailored to the words and desires of a user. That said, this isn’t a free lunch. Magic is the same as any other energy in that an equal amount of power is spent in the end result that was needed for it in the first place. Constant use of Soul Gems makes the user increasingly melancholic and prone to irrational behavior. A world-changing wish takes a ‘cost’ equal to what it created, and could even destroy the one who made the contract entirely if they somehow tried to change the physics of the world. Still, if you have the energy for it, magic can perhaps change the world...or make a very small part of it better, if you heed the costs. All of this said, you now have an understanding of how to enable other beings to use this magic, and how to create Soul Gems of your own. You can, if you desire, grant the wishes of others through a willing contract...but it won’t be able to escape the equivalent exchange required, and you (or they) should be prepared for the costs and entropic backlash. Or not. It’s not your problem, after all. Though something you should remember is that if you make a contract for a wish with someone, it’s largely out of your hands in both execution and end result. That’s a lesson a certain Incubator learned the hard way...not that he’d remember anything if you asked him. Strangely, even though a large amount of despair seems to create a larger ‘return’ of energy, anyone who falls to despair while using a Soul Gem or having it shatter just seem to vanish from existence. I wonder why that is...?"

Any animal exposed to the substance transforms into a mythical, humanoid creature similar to its origin; for instance, a fish may become a mermaid, or a bird may become a fairy, though not the normal kinds found in Neverland. Furthermore, humans exposed to it can fly and can gain artistic inspiration; however, overexposure can lead to greed and paranoia. Outside of this purchase, the substance is extremely difficult to find in the traditional Peter Pan, unless the setting was changed. Also, unlike its form in the story, the Starstuff cannot be used to destabilize the fabric of the universe."

Now, you may use this power on foes which you have personally brought close to death to merge with them and thus provide yourself with a temporary new transformation which grants you with their strengths at the cost of their weaknesses also passing over to you in that form. This merged form heavily resembles the original enemy, but can retain key elements of your appearance such as eye colour or notable scars. Such transformations use up a great deal of energy, and thus should be used sparingly, although they can draw upon almost any source of power you possess to do so. ‘Jumper-Ganon’ can work with those who voluntarily wish to merge with you without the need to fight or defeat them."

Now, with a swish of the wrist and a release of magical energy you may transform yourself, allies and weakened enemies into two-dimensional paintings, capable of travelling through fissures between Hyrule and Lorule as well as walking along walls and other flat surfaces. If you turn someone 2D against a painting, they will become trapped within a form of stasis, where they are conscious but unable to move or interact with the outside world. Perhaps these powers could even be expanded to other uses with enough time and research..?"

Speaking of, beyond having a quite frankly ludicrous level of talent for the winds, you also have the body of a demon. Malleable, fueled by hate and all sorts of negative emotions and a host of abilities. Summoning minions in your image, giant copies of your limbs, warping your body more or less freely to create all sorts of weapons and armor. Your body is made from your will - if you want to be a giant eyebat, you shall be one. If you want twelve limbs that are magical canons, or flails for you to spin about you, you shall have those as well. You’ve also a talent for possession, placing your essence inside statues to act as armor, or inside your minions to ensure their loyalty."

Nonetheless, this mask contains a small fraction of your own spirit, allowing any who wear it to temporarily become a copy of you. Well, in shape at least. Any power or items it grants are entirely up to you - simply wear the mask as you practice and use them, and they will be imprinted upon the mask. This prevents you from handing away too much at once or from changing it on short notice, but thankfully it isn’t being carved off your spirit to power them."

Some think it’s a combination of all other masks, empowered not by one, but by dozens of souls. What really matters is what the mask does. Simply put, it enhances. An avenging swordsman could become a wrathful hero, a mage of some small power could become a supreme sorcerer... I almost wonder what would happen if Ganondorf tried to use it. And, what will you become? Of course, if you wish it, then the mask can always be set to a ‘default’ state, that of the Oni shown by Link."

With Valoo’s Scale, an affinity for the wind could be created. Still, it must have been an immense undertaking, if it was done on purpose. Let's assume it was, because it would be even stranger to be an accident. Regardless, with an artifact of some kind, and an immense amount of power, you can work that artifact into a person, thus making it a part of them. Something to consider would be making a contract with a spirit of some kind, both for a supply of foci and for them to handle the power. Kin of the river does more than just provide them with a power, it gives part of that power to their kids You’re basically creating a new species. It’s not a perfect process, seeing as the Rito still need scales from Valoo during Wind Waker to get their wings, but it can eventually go away without making them weaker, seeing as Valoo is nowhere to be seen during BotW"

Once per jump, you can activate a super-mode powered by Determination, but there are two conditions- You must already be on the edge of defeat, and there has to be more than the lives of you and your companions on the line if you fail - The lives of a small nation of innocent people are the bare minimum stakes. However, the super mode itself is extremely powerful- Upon activating it, not only do you instantly heal all of your wounds, but you become much stronger, move much faster, and can take more punishment than ever before. Your magical attacks become much more potent, and you can take hits to your face with a grin. After the fight, though, you'll be crippled- at the very least, you won't fight again for the rest of the jump. But isn't that a fair price to pay for innocent lives?"

This is the potential you contain within yourself too, the ability to take in the power of the elements and become stronger for it.

As it turned out, magic was deadly and damaging to humans, leading to the destruction of the human race. Who could have guessed? But it’s the nature of humans to adapt and learn when confronted with danger. And then weaponize that danger. Which is what the humans did all that time ago. You now have the knowledge that those humans developed. You can now take innocent children and ‘develop’ them into magical weapons. Or monsters, if you want to be accurate/empathetic about it. The process is complex, intricate and for most folks, completely unconscionable. Besides bodily alteration, mental stress and what arguably constitutes, torture, you need to infuse the bodies of your new Weapons with maso, an extradimensional chemical that serves as the source of magic in Nier’s world. (If future jumps you can substitute similar magical materials.) But if you completely ignore the moral issues, the results are worth it. Examples from canon include No. 6, a giant skeletal monster, No. 7, a boy with petrifaction powers, and the Grimoires, living books capable of using powerful magic called Sealed Verses. With some experimentation, you can come up with different variations too. I’ll even give you some samples of maso to get you started. Go on, get to work. You have Weapons to make."

However, Zant, the usurper, has also cursed you with an imp-like form… which might not be such a bad thing, depending on your tastes. Among your powers are the ability to traverse the Twilight at-will, the ability to teleport using Twilight Portals which you can open with a little effort, the ability to ‘disintegrate’ objects into black particles- including massive ones, like a good portion of a bridge- the ability to take on a shadowy form to exist in the world of light, which also allows you to meld into shadows or slip through cracks, the ability to float, change your shape temporarily, and project dark energy that can break metal chains, and finally the ability to extend your hair and use it as an additional, massive hand. As you collect more pieces of the Fused Shadow your powers will grow. The drawback to these amazing powers is an increased vulnerability to the light, and especially Light Magic; however, there might be one who can remove this drawback, at great cost to themselves... You’ve been ‘cursed’ with an imp-like body, though your mind is still your own; you can choose whether or not your imp form is your real appearance or not."

You can also decrease your own body's density to become a mist, allowing yourself to be relatively undetectable, yet unable to interact with the world around you. This power can also be used for very specific effects, such as compressing your attacks to focus their power significantly, or to even create a spot so dense that it acts like a miniature black hole, pulling objects and even the power of your foes towards it. Given time to develop your power, you can even turn entire mountains into sand, and at your peak, even 4th wall breaking concepts such as the HP and MP gauges can be dispersed away and reassembled to a degree, though this will always be tiring to perform."
