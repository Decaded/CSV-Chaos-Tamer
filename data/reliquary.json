As a bonus, you can take the form of a wolf at will, and you can resist body or mind-altering magics much more easily than before. Finally, you possess one-third of the legendary Triforce- an omnipotent power left behind by the goddesses after they created the world.

The crown does compel a form of dark curiosity that turns one’s will to studying the forbidden aspects of magic, but through your investment here rather than the all-consuming torrent of passion that drove Malekith down a dark path it shall “merely” be a sinuous whisper unlikely to do more than focus your mind on the possibilities of dark forces-unless you already had good reason to devote much of your time to dark magic.",

Even at its weakest, it is still as protective as a full suit of leather covering the entire body, but it grows more powerful if worn by a virgin and if the wearer gives in to their enhanced passions. Fully powered and worn by a virgin, it protects their entire body like a full suit of layered steel plates, rivaling a suit of plate mail.

This is pretty simple, but absurdly powerful. Not only do the portals allow you to go anywhere, but they can actively suck things in if you wish, with such power that even a being as strong as the dread dragon Malchior would be unable to resist its pull and be sucked away, likely never to be seen again. The one weakness is that you actually have to blow the horn to summon the portals, so if the horn got blocked or gunked up it would be rendered temporarily useless.",

The Doom Slayer is the last survivor of the Night Sentinels, guardians of an ancient civilization that was conquered by Hell eons ago. Imbued with supernatural fighting prowess by Seraphim and fueled by endless bloodlust and undying hatred of all things demonic, the Doom Slayer waged a one-man crusade against Hell ages ago and proved completely unstoppable. Even when a titanic demon the size of a skyscraper challenged him to single combat, the Doom Slayer prevailed. Ultimately the demons realized they cannot hope to kill him, so instead they lured him into a trap and dropped an entire temple down on him. Then sealed him in the sarcophagus, praying that he would never break free. Should you free him he will become your protector and will destroy your enemies.

Firstly, being a sword, this thing is sharp enough to cut through even the hardiest of gods like hot butter. Like Mjølnir, the Necrosword will empower you to godly levels, so you may fight on equal terms with the gods it was forged to destroy, as well as granting you a healing factor so you may recover to kill another day. The blade also has a plethora of shadow-related abilities as befitting of its name. It lets the holder teleport through shadows in the same way Shadow Monsters do. Those said monsters may be created from the gloom to serve as your army of darkness. You may also make constructs of darkness, such as tentacles, cages, and claws to aid you in your pursuits. The blade negates any immortality its prey has, so you may cut down what would normally be an invincible god. Nothing is unkillable to this blade. Now go forth and slaughter. Lastly, this blade is entirely loyal to you and will not corrupt you whatsoever, in body or in mind.",

However, its arrows are a peculiar form of weapon. Upon being struck by an arrow from its bow, the target is not harmed physically but is instead inundated with emotion. Intense, fierce, and pure distilled emotion. While a mortal could be made maniac or depressed or otherwise have their emotional state thrown into chaos, certain supernatural beings like demons simply cannot handle emotions and are vanquished by this sort of weapon. Supernatural beings tied to or born from negative emotions are harmed badly by these arrows, and those with an already acknowledged weakness towards positive emotions are affected even more severely.",

It has 3 bedrooms, a Dining Room, living room, sitting room, kitchen, basement and attic, and also two small rooms that can be put to whatever purpose you please. But this is not just a pretty house, this is a place that has steeped in magic over a long period of time, thanks to a confluence of local leylines and has gained some unusual traits thanks to it. No matter how damaged the building any effort to repair or maintain it goes supernaturally easily, quickly and consuming far less resources in terms of material and money than it should. No-one including those doing the work will notice anything unusual about this. The power of the house also shields, protects and enables your own Magic slightly, giving you a home field advantage against attackers.",

But that isn’t what makes this house truly special, nor is it the fact that it is filled with entire societies, or that it is alive and bound to you. No, what makes this house truly unique and of singular value is that it is a crossroads of reality. The House is connected to every single point in space and time and this gives it the ability to slip between the layers of reality and appear anywhere you wish, be it a planet on the other side of the great black beyond or another dimension altogether. There are few places the house cannot go and it'll be all too happy to do So. The final noteworthy abilities that the House possesses is that it can be summoned to your location with nothing but a mental call and that in a similar way, anyone who accepts your invitation into the House can be summoned back into it at any time you wish. Couple more things worth mentioning: this house cannot be permanently wrested from you; your bond may be temporarily blocked to prevent you from summoning it, but no one else can usurp it and you may allow inactive companions to roam inside of it.",

The majority of the cost of spells and rituals will be diverted to the nexus of energy contained within. This nexus is constantly refilled with the energies from the centre of the universe. Without the appropriate keys or permission from its owner (now you), Greyskull cannot be breached. The interior responds to the desires of the owner and can be as palatial or maze-like as you need or want at the time. The castle can attach to the warehouse if not deployed, but if placed in a world will either appear on land you clearly own (such as a personal Island, or Monopoly property), or land owned by your chosen background. If there is no place in the current world owned by you, it will appear in a place of great significance, astride a divide - whether it be magical or political, the position of Greyskull will always demand attention. Castle Greyskull has many secrets, one of which is a series of doors that lead to various places throughout the world. Or even to parallel worlds. Whether it be a hidden door to Snake Mountain, or portals to Etheria, the power of Greyskull will resonate in subsequent worlds giving you the ability to sneak into the stronghold of one enemy faction per jump and will ensure that one or more parallel worlds exist that you can visit, though in some the very laws of nature there may differ.

One moment it mimics the markings of a Dwarven master smith and enchanter, similar to the stones used by Durlag’s clan to signify a bearer has permission to enter specific parts of their tower fortress. The next, it is inscribed with arcane symbols most commonly found among the Cowled Wizards, a carved piece of obsidian seeming to leak shadowy wisps of fog, or even more esoteric forms like a giant shark’s tooth or a bound lock of hair. Indeed, this ‘stone’ doesn’t have a specific ward it is attuned to, allowing it to change to fit any new barrier you encounter. As such, it effectively acts as a key to any magical seal, regardless of the spell’s nature. Any time the wardstone shifts, it loses access to any previous wards it might have attuned to, and the time it needs to recharge between changing forms is dependent on the strength and complexity of the barrier. Unlocking a minor magical lock on a cabinet will see it ready to shift in a manner of hours at most, but unmaking the seals crafted by archmages or even the gods themselves can take months or years before the stone is ready to provide passage across any new barriers.",

There have been many an occasion of a pure-blood claiming to have never even touched a Muggle artifact and yet upon further investigation, they were found to be in possession of a magically modified Rolls Royce.And now, so do you. The car’s model is up to you, but you can rest assured that your car is quite the piece. At its base, the car is already fast enough to fly from London to Hogwarts in less than 8 hours but it’s also been enchanted with an Extension Charm, enough that you can already fit in an entire family of eight with room to spare. It’s also durable enough that you can slam it full force into a tree and it’ll still be drivable. But most importantly, the car is very receptive to new modifications, whethermagical or mundane. Surely you could take advantage of that, right?",
