The stone is believed to be a living, shifting entity with a will that surrounds and guides the dwarves. She supports them, shelters them, and offers them the most priceless gifts of the earth, such as gems, ore, and lyrium. Dwarves living underground possess this “stone sense”, which provides them with the ability to navigate subterraneously. It’s described as the ability to hear the distant song of lyrium. This connection allows dwarves to sense a passageway before reaching it, and they can navigate the Deep Roads without getting hopelessly lost. Normally, dwarves who spend long periods of time on the surface lose this stone sense over time, and those who are born on the surface appear to not possess it at all. However, because of Jumpchain fiat you will never lose your stone sense, no matter how much time you spend topside. In addition, you also have excellent vision in the dark.",

Mythal, one of the elven gods, was betrayed and murdered by her fellow Evanuris. This pool is a reminder of what was lost, a path to be walked by those who toiled in Mythal’s name. Near the end of their life, every servant of Mythal would pass their knowledge on through the Well of Sorrows. Thus, it contains all the collective knowledge and way of life of the ancient favoured elves. Those who drink from the well will gain access to all the knowledge stored within, though it may take quite some time to fully absorb and comprehend everything. There’s so much knowledge to shift, through, after all. It is said that those who drink from the Vir’abelasan are bound to the will of Mythal forevermore. And while that appears to be true for the original, since you are paying so much CP for this, you will gain a copy of the Well that doesn’t enslave the user. What’s even better is that this version of the Well doesn’t just contain the collective knowledge of the servants of Mythal, but the collective knowledge of all of the ancient elves, including the Evanuris.",

It’s an incredibly complicated “game”, or “dance” of intrigue, ambition, and scandal. It’s an approach to politics, high culture, and morality that is quintessentially Orlesian. The Game’s purpose is one-upmanship of rival nobles, often accomplished through various proxies. In order to rise in the decadent Orlesian society, much is permitted. The rule of the Game is simply this: All is accepted as long as the player is not caught, up to and including murder. Paradoxically, though direct culpability is undesirable, credit and recognition are demanded. Indeed, an individual known as a skilled player is granted discreet respect amongst their peers. Due to this tension the Game is a losing proposition for the uninitiated, and it is said that more blood is spilled in the Game than in any war in Orlas. However, you are not one of the uninitiated, playing the Game on the same level as the upper echelons of Orlesian nobility is child’s play to you.",

Any man, it is said, exists within their reach, and the Crows have proven this adage time and time again. More than one king of Antiva has even hailed from their ranks, and it should come as no surprise that those particular kings have in fact numbered amongst the nation’s most effective rulers. Outside of Antiva, assassination as a craft is rarely held with the same esteem. The Orlesian bard, for instance, may perform assassinations in the course of their duty but rarely is it the actual purpose they are set to. To a true assassin, murder is their craft and they make no bones about trying to distinguish themselves otherwise. Poison is their tool, just as is a slit throat or a silent strike to a critical area of the body, and all are designed to kill with maximum efficiency. Whether you’re an Antivan Crow, an Orlesian Bard, a member of the House of Repose, or just a killer for hire, one thing’s for sure: You are skilled at the art of silent killing. You have a natural talent for moving with stealth, and are either an expert marksman or supremely skilled with knives and daggers.
