      "description": "(See also: SB RWBY, Generic RWBY, /tg/ RWBY, The Games We Play, etc) Every living thing, from humans to Faunus and even animals, have a Soul. Only the Creatures of Grimm are soulless and as such can’t make use of this power. For you though? You are now, thanks to the physics of this world, able to use your soul as a powerful tool called Aura. This has a variety of uses. To begin with Aura at default works as a sort of energy shield against attacks and damage. You won’t suffer direct harm while its active, but you will still feel sensations like pain and heat while your Aura is up. It requires training to always subconsciously have a cloak of Aura on. It can even protect you from climate conditions, like walking through a snowstorm, though particular extreme conditions will damage Aura like combat damage would. Aura can also be used to amplify your abilities, like your defence and strength making you essentially superhuman. In addition to that just possessing Aura gives you a minor automatic healing, able to fix small wounds like scratches in seconds. All tools and equipment are capable of being used as conduits for Aura, allowing a user to be capable of sending out crescent shaped energy slashes from their blade for example. Furthermore it can be used to enhance these things, allowing you to, for example, even use a loaf of bread as an effective weapon. Dust usage is also enabled by Aura. Those already possessing Auras may also unlock someone else’s Aura. Doing so however takes a toll on the user, potentially weakening their own Aura for a while. Users with particular advanced experience in utilizing Aura may also be capable of other ‘higher-tier’ techniques. Examples would be to use Aura consciously as a shield, create shockwave-like attacks, gain extrasensory perception and even sensing and identifying other people’s Auras. That being said, Aura alone does not make you invincible. Continued damage or attacks far outweighing your Auras capabilities will be able to eventually break it. Using your Aura repeatedly also puts it at risk of decaying, to the point where the user can be left weakened and without Aura until they are able to rest. Aura being completely depleted is visually represented as a coloured sheen glowing along the length of a person's body or with coloured particles flying off the body, indicating that they can now be physically injured. Aura flickering means it is close to being depleted. Still it is a versatile tool that has helped humans and faunus alike over the years and now you as well.",

As the name implies, in combat, Keyblades are used like swords. Even though most possess no actual cutting edge, Keyblades still make efficient combat weapons, and are shown to be particularly effective weapons against the forces of darkness. The main power of the Keyblade, however, is the ability to seal or open the barriers between worlds, as well as to \"lock\" a world's Keyhole, preventing any unsavoury elements from attacking that world's heart. As an offset of this ability, the Keyblade can also be used to lock or unlock any lock, allowing the user to access any sealed interior, whether it be a locked room, gate, or treasure chest. In addition to its base powers, it is possible to modify a Keyblades appearance and powers by attaching various keychains in the wielder's inventory. You can customise your Keyblade in the Keyblade Customisation portion of the Kingdom Hearts Supplement.

By touching any living creature with DNA (except plants, for some reason) and focusing on it for a few seconds, you can ‘acquire’ its DNA. Creatures will go docile while acquiring, which makes the process a bit safer when acquiring dangerous beasts. Once an animal has been acquired, it’s DNA is permanently recorded in your own, allowing you to transform into an exact replica of the creature. The process usually takes about two minutes, and because it is based on DNA, you do not gain any non-­genetic aspects of the morphed creature ­ injuries being the prime example. Morphing also gives you all the instincts of the morphed creature, allowing you to use it’s abilities without difficulty, though the instincts can be overwhelming at first. Oh, and don’t worry about clothes, implants, or other such non­genetic additions. Anything that is closely ­connected enough to you counts as ‘part of you’ as far as morphing is concerned, and will still be there when you morph back. Shoes and non-­skin-tight clothing will be left behind, so wear some spandex under your clothes and you’ll be fine. This only applies to base forms; morphed forms reset to their base after demorphing, and cannot carry even skin-tight clothes or such. There are two major limitations on morphing. The first is that you cannot go directly from one morph to another; you must return to your base form first. The second is a time limit ­ if you remain in morph for more than approximately two hours, you remain trapped in that morph. Forever.",

Initially you'll only have enough power to pilot a Gunmen but with enough time and the right circumstances you can figure out how to generate large powerful drill weapons from your mech that are capable of easily destroying other Gunmen and can cause massive explosions. After a few years of continued use you could potentially learn how to increase your physical abilities, Intelligence, and natural lifespan to superhuman levels. Once you've fully unlocked your Spiral power you'll be able to live for over a thousand years, punch apart small Gunmen with your bare hands, discover and forge incredible technological wonders, and generate drills and other constructs from Spiral Energy without the assistance of a mech. (Notes) Regardless of whether or not you decide to go through one of the endgame scenarios, you'll gain the ability to grant one individual in each world you go to a fraction of your Spiral Energy. The person you gift this power to can only improve if your directly train them yourself and the upper limits of their Spiral Powers cannot exceed your own. However, if you decide to go through the Anti-Spiral scenario (Tell Me the Secrets of This World) you will lose the ability to grant others Spiral Energy. We Will Survive by Any Means Necessary (Scenario Reward) People around you can awaken their own Spiral Power but they will be bound by the same restrictions as you are. While people who possess Spiral Energy can become incredibly powerful, keep in mind that not everyone can reach their full potential and even if they can they're typically only capable of doing so under extreme circumstances. Animals and artificial organisms can also potentially develop their own Spiral power, but this is extremely rare and difficult and typically only happens if they possess a great amount of willpower and stay in the presence of a strong Spiral user for extended periods of time. Anyone with Spiral Energy could potentially trigger the Spiral Nemesis but they would have to generate universe levels of matter and energy in order to do so.

Meditative Kata can extend your natural lifespan, heal minor wounds and fight off sickness, while strikes and attacks could shatter walls. This increases your maximum Mantra level by 1. As an added benefit, this perk also allows you to create your own personal Mantra Form. Your first form will take approximately five years of study and meditation to fully construct, but when completed, you will be able to manifest an external mantra interface. To most people, it will look like an ornate halo, evocative of your personality and mantra affinity. A Mantra Form usually has a core theme, such as improved combat ability, damage resistance, speed or other such boosts. Establishing a form enhances your abilities, even beyond what a given level of Mantra would normally allow. With a mantra form active, you may easily perform superhuman physical, mental and social feats, even before the direct application of Mantra. These stances and techniques however cannot enhance stranger powers such as psychic blasts or arcane magic, short of ensuring you can survive to perform them. Successfully creating an initial form and manifesting it increases your capacity for Mantra by 1. Subsequent forms and other perks can increase this cap further, to a maximum of 8. You may use any mantra form you know, but you cannot stack them. Creating a new form takes ten years, times the number of forms you have already mastered. Your halos can be attacked however, and if knocked aside or even destroyed. If that happens, you immediately drop down to Mantra Level 3, and any excess Mantra is wasted.

This is the Willow’s purpose.” - Gaius Helen Mohiam. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood are masters of the fusion of thought and deed, and nowhere is this more evident than in what they call ‘The Weirding Way of Battle’. The weirding way incorporates two essential parts of the BG lore and training into a single unified package. By combining Prana-Bindu, the cornerstone of BG physical training which all adepts, from Acolytes to Holy Sisters to Reverend Mothers, are trained in, and which grants a supreme control over every nerve and muscle in their own body, with Simulflow, the cornerstone of BG mental training, which grants the ability to maintain multiple parallel threads of consciousness at the same time, the Weirding Way is the Duneverse’s unrivaled martial art. You have not only received training in this secretive way, but find that you are a natural at it, able to maintain dozens if not hundreds of parallel thought processes without strain, and able to individually sense and control every nerve, muscle, and organ in your body with a conscious thought. This allows you to push yourself to the very limits of what your body is capable of, to instantly sense anything that might be wrong (and potentially correct it), to staunch bleeding, block pain, and even control your own neuro-chemistry and adrenal load at will. And, as a martial art, the Weirding Way is unrivalled by any purely physical martial art, being able to strike faster and harder and more precisely than anyone untrained in it. Combining Simulflow with training in analytical methodology and Other Memory was what allowed the Bene Gesserit to compete on more than even footing with the Mentats, and provides a truly frightening degree of intelligence, even in the most average of Bene Gesserit Adepts. Through a combination of ‘Hand and Finger Signals’ and ‘Tactile Encoding Methods’, two people with Simulflow can conduct entire conversations completely undetected... even while carrying on a separate verbal conversation. The BG Adept will also be trained in ‘The Waiting Stance’, which allows one to remain effectively motionless for as long as one needs to, without a trace of boredom or physical discomfort. A BG Adept can also instantly fall asleep or wake up at need. A master of the Weirding Way is also an expert with knife or whip. A BG Adept’s internal biologic control makes them all but immune to mundane poisons and diseases, as well as granting them control over their own menstrual cycle, able to control conception at will, and even choose the sex of the child. You can also store diseases dormantly for later usage or study. A master of the Weirding Way can teach those willing to learn much of the techniques involved, and your version can be taught to members of any biological species.",

Throughout the course of a few weeks, if you trained regularly, your power would grow by leaps and bounds, allowing you to easily move around cars, fly, or create a protective forcefield around yourself. And just a mere month after that, you would be able to throw around buses like they weighed nothing, easily fly through skyscrapers without harm, and create telekinetic pulses and vibrations to push away dozens of cars or threaten the structural integrity of multiple high-rises. If you kept at it, who knows how much stronger you could become. If you want to, you may instead gain these powers from a strange crystal, far down a hole in a Seattle forest, perhaps alongside a few others, some teenagers or your companions. That will cause you to develop what could be called a psychic connection: should one of you experience an extreme emotion such as anger or fear, your nose will start bleeding heavily as if you had overused your powers, and you will even start to vaguely hear voices and sounds around them. Advancement Materials (/tg/ Cradle) (400 CP)Elixirs, Pills, Spirit Fruit, and so on. This is a treasure trove of materials that will take a Copper up to Truegold within a matter of months, though it's uses fall off after that point. The good news is that it restocks every month, and giving it to someone outside of this Jump will allow them to start developing a Core of their own.",

It has been dressed up over the year, with a poetic oath, and an air of gravitas, but at its heart the process requires only three things. One; a Keyblade wielder on the level of a Master, two; the recipient of the ritual, and three; for the recipient to touch the Keyblade as it is being held by the wielder. Once performed, the ritual bestows the recipient with the potential to one day have their own Keyblade – or to inherit the blade of the wielder, whichever comes first. Now not only can you perform this ritual regardless of your status and skill with a Keyblade, you can ensure that your beneficiaries gain their own Keyblades quickly with only a short period of training, typically done with wooden swords or crude wooden Keyblades.",

Like C.C. you recover from any and all bodily damage, it’s impossible for you to retain any sort of brain damage or memory loss as a result of head injuries or a lack of a cranium, and when you regenerate it’s fiat-backed that you are the same you who got injured. Unless your body is completely destroyed on a molecular level, you will always reconstitute yourself over a period of seconds to minutes depending on the severity of the injuries, and always all at once. You will also never age past your prime, nor have a need to eat, drink, or sleep for anything other than pleasure. As a Code Bearer, you have the power to bestow a Geass upon others. You don’t control what Geass someone gets but it’s almost always a different and new expression of it even if it’s really similar to another one, and all Geass you grant upon other have the same stipulations as the ones in-setting. With this Code, you also gain the ability to detect people who are connected to Geass and people who are important to them. You can detect the location of your contractors, even at a distance, and you’re also able to confirm who has a Geass power and who doesn’t, regardless of who granted it to them. When in close proximity to another person, you’re able to afflict them with a hallucinatory experience of chaotic and ominous images, pertaining in part to the memories of the target involved; the content varies with the afflicted. Physical contact, either direct or via a construct the target is controlling, may facilitate the process. Through the power of your Code you also have the ability to telepathically communicate to those nearby you, with it becoming significantly easier to do the larger the connection there is between you and the recipient. Coming with this code is the red bird-like symbol that is found on all Code Bearers in a location of your choosing which glows when utilizing the active powers of your Code.

      "description": "“A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.” - The First Law of Mentat. A Mentat is often described as a Human Computer, but that’s not quite true. Or rather, it’s not all they are. In addition to having the computational power and memory of a Thinking Machine, that is a fully realized AI, a Mentat was capable of incredible feats of perception, pushing their human senses to the absolute limits. By combining towering intellect with a perfectly indexed and rapidly searchable memory, an astounding ability to process raw data in very short order (imagine being able to watch an entire movie at x100 speed and remember every frame in perfect fidelity), an encyclopedic knowledge of political, economic, and military theory, and, through cultivation of ‘The Naive Mind’, even set aside preconceptions and biases, a Mentat is capable of supralogical theory crafting, strategic and tactical planning in excess of what a Thinking Machine could accomplish. This ability to sift enormous amounts of data in a timely fashion and a deep intuition and insight into the human condition allows a Mentat to chart future consequences without resorting to precognition. Although there are varying levels of intelligence even among the Mentats, Piter Devries is said to be able to out-think one of the Thinking Machines that enslaved humanity before the Butlerian Jihad just as one of those Thinking Machines could out-think a baseline human. Though a Mentat should beware. Even though the Naive Mind promises purely rational processing of data, if the data itself is compromised, so will be the Mentat’s conclusions. Hopefully you, Jumper, will be more considerate of the errors, biases, and contexts in your data than the typical Mentat. As a Mentat Adept, your baseline abilities are immense, and they can be further enhanced by Sapho juice (an addictive extract of the root of the Ecaz tree) which can double or even triple your already prodigious computational abilities, though repeated use will turn your mouth and lips ruby red. The Spice Melange can be processed to create an effective booster for Sapho Juice, but use of this enhanced Sapho Substitute renders Sapho itself less effective permanently. Mentat training is a form of extreme conditioning that comes with fairly stringent ethical and moral programming to prohibit some more... sociopathic behaviour. Reverend Mothers and Guild Navigators were often trained as Mentats, particularly because all three groups relied upon melange for their enhanced abilities. There are six ranks of Mentat, though the first three are considered basic training. The lowest rank, Memorizer, are trained to be able to recreate the layout of a city having seen it once for a few seconds, to be able to recreate entire conversations while mimicking the cadence and inflection of each participant, or repeating entire books, errors and all, having seen each page for less than a hundredth of a second. A Processor (the second rank), was trained to take tens of thousands of discrete pieces of information, then combine, divide, sort, and file them with an error rate of less than 00.00015%. The third rank of training is that of the Hypothesist, who were trained to extrapolate as many possible alternative explanations as possible from a specific data set, and then deliver the two most likely hypotheses (with the primary having a likelihood of at least 92% reliability). As a Mentat, you can specialize as a Generalist, a Simulationist, or an Advisor, and train others to be Memorizers, Processors, or Hypothesists. Mentat Generalist: By eschewing specialization, the Generalist embraces the broad sweep of all that is occuring within their awareness framework. At a general estimate, a Generalist is usually possessed of accurate knowledge of at least 94.75% of everything occurring within their ‘universe’... where universe is defined as the social, economic, political, cultural, climatological, and spiritual realm they reside in. This includes, of course, knowledge of the self, since the Generalist is part of that set of phenomena. This near comprehensive knowledge allows the Generalist to make incredible leaps of logic and insight to intuit the nature of almost any problem placed before them. It does, however, come with a high risk of believing that one possesses all knowledge and thus being blindsided when a hole does appear. Mentat Simulationist: While most Mentats are experts at plotting and scheming, a Simulationist is specifically trained in running detailed predictions of future events. Freed from the dependence on absolutes, and trained to correct for assumptions hidden in the inferences of others, the Simulationist sees all other beings as sets of behaviour patterns. By running potential future event simulations and factoring in the data sets of all relevant actors, the Simulationist can plot a highly detailed explanation of coming events and plot, at the very least, a dozen plans to deal with every possible outcome of those events, including contingencies for following through on those plans, altering those plans, combining those plans, or actively avoiding any of the previous options. Mentat Advisor: You’re the equal of Thufir Hawat, famed as one of the finest minds of his time. As such, you have an instinctive ability to locate those who possess the aptitude to be trained as a Mentat and a comprehensive knowledge of the training methods needed to produce Mentats of any of the other ranks or Mentat Agents. You’re also skilled in understanding and intuiting the motivations of individuals that comes close to mind reading, of economic forces that comes close to precognition, and political movements and the intricacies of diplomacy are an open book to you. Less than one in twenty Mentats is an Advisor and they are extremely sought after, with every Great House wanting at least one. When you so desire, you practically radiate an aura of wisdom, confidence, and calm dispassion. Those you offer advice to will instinctively understand the wisdom of your words, though that’s no guarantee they’ll follow that advice.",

      "description": "When it first became clear that the ad-hoc militias once used to neutralize terrestrial Existential Threats would be utterly insuffict in a war against the stars in the sky, the Memorial Foundation NGO made a number of moves to standardize and intensify the recruitment and training of Existential combatants. This high-tech complex exists as a testament to their efforts, then: a replica of one of the various facilities once installed in Earth’s Lagrange points. Though currently unmanned, in all other respects this institution represents the absolute technical, functional, and conceptual state of the art for its purpose. No matter how straightforward or esoteric the form of warfare in question, all military learning, training, and instruction - even in the principles of Special Relativity and Pilot Interfacing - which takes place on the grounds of this institution and makes use of its resources is maximally effective and quick, up to the absolute limits of possibility. Those who pass through these halls will develop as rapidly and comprehensively as they ever will in the arts of war. And yet, by the very nature of the impossible things humanity has set out to fight, such a regime is never enough - and solving that problem is the function this place is truly set out to fulfill. For those who make use of this place can push themselves or be pushed... past their limits, learning more and learning faster, reaching excellence and going further beyond. Such unfathomable gains naturally come with a necessary and equal cost to the emotional and mental well-being of those who make use of them, but doesn’t prominence have its price? These effects - both positive and negative - are magnified further for children over adults, and for the otherwise socioculturally disposable, should they be honed beyond reason in this place. Special Relativity (Heaven Will Be Mine) Humans may rule over themselves and each other in a multitude of ways, but there is still only one form of authority in this world, and it is gravity: it is the force that holds people in shape, brings them together, and allows them to act upon each other, just as surely as it does the same for planets and stars. You see, all kinds of mental, spiritual, cultural, and physical influence are fundamentally just different forms of ‘gravity’, as different expressions of the same fundamental power. Even the figurative gravity that predominates between people and the normal, physical gravity that you are accustomed to are simply two different forms of the same force, as the literal blurs with the metaphorical - and through your realization of this truth, you now share in the nature of this world. All of your vectors of power and influence over other people and the world - physically, socially, and more - are weakly and generally linked with each other, and with your ordinary gravitational pull. This power changes little-to-nothing on an ordinary human scale, of course, and not least because gravity is the weakest of all the fundamental forces. Humans are small and powerless, and in the vast scope of a human society, any given human is even smaller, and even more powerless. But in the extreme, who knows what could be possible? Perhaps you might drag people into your gravity well with your irresistible attitude, physically crush them under your expectations alone, or bring them into your sway through your simple, massive immensity. Pilot Interfacing (Heaven Will Be Mine) When you’ve never personally manned a ship-self, it’s easy to think that ship-selves are mere machines, but in reality, nothing could be further from the truth. By their very nature as mechas, ship-selves are made in the image of humans, and they exist to allow humans to assume their power and stature. If ship-selves are machines, they are also extensions of the people who pilot and build them, and that makes them more and less than any ordinary machine will ever be. Your internalization of this deceptively simple principle brings multiple benefits. First and foremost, while explicit security systems may still be able to lock you out, and some mecha may be harder to use than others, you’ll never be completely ‘incompatible’ with any mecha that requires any vague, intangible ‘compatibility factor’ - a human being requires no justification to inhabit the human form, nor a person to inhabit a persona. Secondly, when your level of compatibility or ‘synchronization’ matters (and it does, in this world and in others), you will be able to increase your synchronization with and control over your mecha by ‘aligning your intentions with it’ - by acting through the functions and features of your mecha, fulfilling their purposes, understanding their limitations, and being, even for a short time, the kind of person that your mecha represents, or else by making your mecha into a representation of you. Before a woman can use a sword, she has to first become the kind of person who is willing to cut. Finally, as an extension of this dialogue between inner and outer self, the control systems for any given mecha you pilot are no longer limited by what they appear to be. Depending on your personal inclinations, some control systems may be more or less difficult or intuitive for you to use and master than others, but no control system will be objectively ‘better’ than any other, nor more objectively limiting. You can tell a love story in any language.",

      "description": "For all the good intentions of the Existential Expansion division, its critics were always quick to point out that it was torn between two competing dreams: to export human culture to the rest of the universe, and to import the rest of the universe into human culture. Perhaps this installation fulfills that contradiction, capable of both in its own way. Put straightly, this is a fully functional and self-contained space colony patterned on the successes of this world’s space program, with everything that implies. Between life support systems, manufacturing and fabrication capabilities, bottle ecology regulation, and gravitational stabilization, it’s fully capable of supporting both a large village or a small town’s worth of people and the society they inevitably create among themselves. Although unable to withstand a sustained assault or sufficiently extreme conditions, its window of operations is still more than wide enough to allow it to survive both the physical vacuum of space and the more metaphysical forms of void that might go hand in hand with it. Likewise, though many would regard the isolation that surrounds this place to be a thing to overcome, others would see it as a thing to learn from: when a person is closed off from the rest of the world, they can learn both to see from the outside what they’ve left behind and to flourish free of it. Those who immerse themselves in the seclusion of this colony on an extended basis are capable of learning Tidal Sensitivity and similar abilities, and - if the Culture of the colony promotes their flourishing - may even become Human In The Ways We Want To Be. Tidal Sensitivity (Heaven Will Be Mine) By definition, everyone in this setting necessarily has some level of ‘tidal sensitivity’ - the ability to sense the pull of gravity as it acts upon them, rather than to merely be acted upon. And for the most part, this is really just a fancy way to talk about ordinary human abilities; it’s your senses of balance, acceleration, and kinetics, and it’s your ability to ‘read’ other people; it’s your ability to tell the difference between who you are on the inside and on the outside, and it’s the ineffable sense that tells you when you’re being watched. However, in time, it’s possible to take such abilities well above and beyond the ordinary - something that’s probably just as much a matter of character development and insight as it is a matter of training. Should you ever attain this level of tidal sensitivity yourself, you will be able to directly sense gravity, both literally and figuratively; you’ll be able to feel inert mass-energy and the complex dynamics of human agency alike. This power isn’t ‘true’ telepathy, empathy, or clairvoyance - not any more than what ordinary humans do when they guess what each other are thinking, feeling, and doing - but it doesn’t need to be, because it might as well be. Your intuition and perception will border on a sixth sense, and you will be able to reach out and open your mind and heart to others and the world, even from across great distances. And at the most exceptional levels of tidal sensitivity, at a peerless level of skill held by only a few, it becomes possible not just to feel the texture and topography of space-time, but to directly read it as a narrative: the collective story told by all storytellers and the narrative spun out of everything that exists. Should you attain such insight, you won’t just feel gravity; you will know it, laid as bare as a heart on a lover’s sleeve or a story written across a friend’s face. Human In The Ways We Want To Be (Heaven Will Be Mine) To live in space is to escape from Earth’s gravity, and the kiss of space is liberation from the laws of Earth’s reality. In space, without Earth’s gravity to hold you down, you can do as you like with your body and soul. Your means may vary depending on how much you’re set in your ways, and on who you are, what you can do, and where you are in life - and it may be terribly hard and painful, to boot - but you’ll always have the ability to become the ‘you’ that you want to be. You might be able to simply grow into yourself as you grow up and become an adult, or you might have to work hard to change all the parts of yourself that seem so horribly fixed, but no matter how you do it, you will find that you can choose your self - your body, soul, heart, mind, and gender - within the normal limits of possibility for your kind and then a bit more. If anything can stop you or drag you back down to who you used to be, it will only be other people, weighing you down and holding you back. Don’t misunderstand, of course; you won’t be ‘perfect’. You’re only you, and you’ll only ever be you. But what more would you ask for?",

It would be prudent to use this power circumstantially: There are monumentally powerful forces with a vested interest in keeping all of humanity mystically quiescent, which while too grand to care for minor transgressions would likely respond harshly to an attempt to an attempt to mass uplift the People.

Though even they don’t completely understand how it works, magic in this world is generated by the power of the soul and intense emotions within sentient beings. Incubators themselves aren’t really capable of such things (most of the time), yet somehow found a way to harness it. Magic can create weapons from thin air, make dimensional spaces, halt the flow of time and even reverse it completely to a predetermined point. It can even create a wish tailored to the words and desires of a user. That said, this isn’t a free lunch. Magic is the same as any other energy in that an equal amount of power is spent in the end result that was needed for it in the first place. Constant use of Soul Gems makes the user increasingly melancholic and prone to irrational behavior. A world-changing wish takes a ‘cost’ equal to what it created, and could even destroy the one who made the contract entirely if they somehow tried to change the physics of the world. Still, if you have the energy for it, magic can perhaps change the world...or make a very small part of it better, if you heed the costs. All of this said, you now have an understanding of how to enable other beings to use this magic, and how to create Soul Gems of your own. You can, if you desire, grant the wishes of others through a willing contract...but it won’t be able to escape the equivalent exchange required, and you (or they) should be prepared for the costs and entropic backlash. Or not. It’s not your problem, after all. Though something you should remember is that if you make a contract for a wish with someone, it’s largely out of your hands in both execution and end result. That’s a lesson a certain Incubator learned the hard way...not that he’d remember anything if you asked him. Strangely, even though a large amount of despair seems to create a larger ‘return’ of energy, anyone who falls to despair while using a Soul Gem or having it shatter just seems to vanish from existence.

Any who are amenable to the Light’s values may become new Nobility and seek justice on their own terms in the world-although, as the Light’s partner in this you may also direct it to Enlighten specific individuals, though you yourself will have little influence over what Calling they rise to. The Light knows to do no harm above all though, and should you deem it necessary in a new world you may rescind all effects propagated by this perk-save selectively those affecting you alone. Last but not least, for the gift of bearing the Light to other worlds you gain three blessings. The first, that anywhere you settle in and put a modicum of effort into loving, caring for and generally maintaining or refurbishing in accord with the Light’s values will gradually become a Blessed Place: A land of outstanding beauty in which aesthetic, intellectual or moral excellence (depending on the location’s function) is supported. Some locations may be easier to do this in than others; most prisons may require significant improvements to life quality, while a hospital will qualify simply by you administrating or working in it. Beings touched by the Light feel their sorrows fade away in that location, and based on the location’s function certain positive aspirations and efforts affiliated with it will be bolstered with subtle but profound inspirations-while opposing negative ones blunted in effort. The duration of your stay and the magnitude, necessary risks to self and consistency of the good deeds within will determine the length and intensity of this spread; just arriving you may cover only a small, well-cared for room but in months a hospital that routinely saves the lives of patients requiring critical surgery could beautify an entire city. The second is simply a plethora of Wisps shared with you by the Light that shall grow as you master it’s principles; a novice Princess would have the total amount of Wisps as five or six of her peers. As for the third, while any Queen worthy of her crown would win her power from the adoration of her people the intensity of the Light shining through you allows you to develop a unique Avatar charm based on your understanding and values of the Light’s principles rather than the example blazed by a Queen. Even if you lack the usual mastery of such charms’ users, you may pay the usual costs to undergo a second transformation that grants a great power for the short while representing the fulfilment of your beliefs and ideals. Great changes in character by yourself or significant alterations in perspective may alter this transformation’s aesthetics and powers too. While this power is commensurate with those of the other Queens’, as it is not filtered through their specialities it does not apply the Invocation restrictions theirs does.",

The process will still be gruelling; they must train to the limits of any mundane martial art they know with the scroll unfurled before them, though supernatural arts that wield ki or similar innate energies adroitly may take less transcendent mastery. But many in this world would deem that a small price to pay to raise your students to the apex of martial splendour in this world, whether you wish to begin a new generation of Legendary Masters to protect the world with or raise thugs that even the Yama Kings should fear. Perhaps with some feat of mysticism or the ki control of the Mugen themselves, it would be possible to use this scroll as a catalyst to transmit the wisdom of the Mugen on a far greater population at once in order to uplift them. Murder One Thousand Hells And Topple Their Thrones (Exalted - Burn Legend) (Scenario Reward) Whichever Exalted martial art you master, you gain three blessings: A unique rite that allows you to replicate your Exalted fighting powers in others while personally sculpting their style, a profound connection with the aspect of the world that enhances your fighting prowess and a means to purify the world with that aspect’s ki - making it baneful to demonic powers and a bounty to those born of the natural order.

With this, you know how to design the geomantic structures for secret prayer mills that feed power to the Yozis-or perhaps, yourself with minor adjustments. Constructing engines that can seal off death-tainted realms of existence or growing a demonic bioweapon are old hat to you. You know how to create many methods of travelling swiftly around the universe similar to the typical means of the Infernal Exalted, encompassing both artifice and sorcery as well as many wondrous marriages of both. But so is the forgotten art of forging demon souls into more archaic weapons and armour, or the schema to recreate monsters of myth long lost to Creation’s memory like Oliphem: A giant of stone and iron who can walk on the sea or sink to its bottom freely and without harm, and has a great light-casting lens in his face that can guide ships or sear enemies. The doomsday devices you could build with this beggar imagination. Your skill with genetic engineering and human enhancement with divine components is particularly outstanding, and you can singlehandedly perform the process that infuses human embryos with blood cells extracted from imprisoned Elemental Dragons to create new Dragonblooded from birth. Perhaps in time, you’ll discover ways to modify or improve the Terrestrial Exaltation that shall be discovered by you with time and effort. Or apply such modifications to other Exaltations provided you have the correct reagents, rituals and technology. With some innovation, in time it might even be possible to live up to the Infernal lie of human potential by creating a serum that can turn an adult into a Dragonblood. After all, you already know the foundational theories and proven techniques that can alter Exaltations: To cut away the machine-flesh and divine ichor of Autochthon away and infuse it into a Lunar Exaltation, melding it’s evolutionary potential with the modular mechanism of god-machinery to transform it into an Alchemical Exaltation. Similar procedures and the theoretical framework to tamper with these divine superweapons are known to you, and you have an excellent grounding for altering other Exaltations. Your understanding of the Exaltation’s underlying structure, composition and the crafts with which it can be tampered with is exemplary even for an Infernal. Last but not least all three circles of sorcery have been drilled into you, including many spells unique to the Yozis themselves. Some of these great powers can create magically reinforced silence that even prevent spoken spells from being cast in their area of influence, and the corruption of lands to favour the Yozis as well as their servants and Total Annihilation: A mere fleck of Ligier’s flame that deals great destruction with green hellfire.",

Do take note that this is not without risks or drawbacks, as potent abilities have equally large drawbacks, such as mana requirements; creatures with immensely powerful abilities are, effectively, trapped in high mana environments as they require more mana than their souls produce, and 'starve' otherwise. Giving yourself the power of a dragon is a good way to be unable to leave the Dungeon for longer than a couple of hours.",

      "description": "A Bio-Injector is a bio-organic device containing a blank, non-synergized Symbiote, completely lacking in personality; whereas normally, a Bio-Injector would erase its contents upon use, this one is specifically modified to skip this process, rendering it indefinitely reusable, and has had the Berzerker Protocol removed. It also modifies its own programming to the genetic code of whatever it's injected into, allowing you to make Symbiotes of even non-humans, though they do still need the 90% predictive rate typically required of Symbiotes. This is a good thing, though; Symbiotes are AI and, baseline, have a relatively alien mentality, and, without the ability to predict human interactions might take a harmless joke for a serious threat on their host's life and attack the person that made it, potentially killing them. In case it wasn't obvious, people that you turn into the Host of a fully synergized Symbiote pair have the option of becoming a Companion if they're willing to come with you; it should be noted, though, that this 90% predictive rate takes, at minimum, five to eight years, even with the knowledge that it should be predicting its host, and could easily take in excess of a decade, depending on the person in question. Biotechnology (Battle Angel Alita) (600 CP)There’s really more to cybernetics than just the metal machine. Care has to be taken that the flesh adapts, and there are many lessons to be learned from biological machinery. You’re an expert in the fields of genetics, biophysics, toxicology, neuropharmacology and biochemistry – the causes and effects of human mutation are very familiar to you. Designer drugs, experimental surgery, toxins, cures – improved soft organs and cutting-edge research into cloned nervous system material, with a laboratory the human body is your masterpiece. You may create a variety of drugs similar to that referenced in the Werewolf perk, or directly induce it and Warped as a permanent mutation. If you also have the Cybernetics perk, then with a little time and the right equipment – quite difficult to obtain in the Scrapyard – you may also apply the equivalent of the TUNED perk to a subject, and have additional knowledge of weapons engineering to reverse-engineer or independently develop most current weapons systems available in the Scrapyard. Warped (Battle Angel Alita)The ravages of the wasteland brought mostly radiation poisoning and disease. Those lucky enough to find shelter made it through with minimal genetic damage, and stepped out to reclaim the world from the sickly few who had to survive in the wilds – and so the majority of humanity in this day and age are little different from before the end. But by some tenacious vitality, enough of those damned survivors made it through the fallout and long winter to pass their damage on to a new generation. Over time, the worst of it was bled out – leaving you. Mostly human, but with a few traits that stand out. You might be almost twice as strong, or fast, or have thick and powerful claws – but it doesn’t compare to the power of a cyborg. The advantage is that you don’t depend on maintenance, and you can actually use your full potential – your brain can keep up perfectly with the speed and power of your body.Werewolf (Battle Angel Alita)A catch-all term for a wide spectrum of biological mutations, originally referring to a mutagenic combat drug that resulted in extreme muscular hypertrophy, accelerated nerve impulses and a rather hirsute appearance. There are still some users of such drugs, where the improved reflexes and relative stealth make up for the accumulating physical damage. In your case, you may be descended from one of the bloodlines that inspired the research, or due to a lucky quirk adapted to the drug. You can switch from a mostly human form, into a large, intimidating warform with less than a minute of concentration. Remaining in either form is effortless – but the actual transformation does heavily strain your system.In human form, you’re six times stronger, three times as fast and heal a thousand times quicker. Your warform triples that – most non-fatal injuries will be completely healed in a few hours, but you require huge amounts of food to maintain it and when pushed your metabolism runs hot enough to burn. You aren’t terribly resistant to damage though – your skin is only as tough as leather. In both forms your senses are at least peak human. The cosmetics of your condition are up to you. You might have thermal vision, tough scales and snakes for arms, or slow chameleonic skin with tentacles for legs and a cartilaginous skeleton immune to most holds. Whatever the case, some small signs of this will show in your human form, though they can be easily hidden.TUNED (Battle Angel Alita)This is cybertechnology beyond the capabilities of the Scrapyard. Tiphares keeps a very tight lid on anything that challenges their authority, and in reaction to the potential threat of Den and Barjack – more for stirring up the population than out of fear – will eventually dispatch TUNED agents based on Alita’s body and skills. Baselines are around 20x peak human, and they have a discount on the TUNED equipment package.With Motorball: 200CP bonus to spend on Companions. Baseline of 30x peak human.",

This will not grant you power over them, and every time you do so you will be drained of energy and need to recover for several days before you are at full capacity again.

With your extensive training and conditioning with the use of the psycho-evaluation tools bestowed upon you by Heaven, you may pry into the minds and deeds of those who come forth for reincarnation – laid back upon the gold-and-samite throne of the machine, their memories and nature are yours to peruse. In addition, you have the great clone-banks and gene-crafters that may shape new and beautiful forms for your petitioners. Judging from their deeds, you may reincarnate their atman into animal form, or human – or even Godly perfection, though you lack the knowledge of Aspect and Attribute that would let them acquire such powers. It is among your duties to give gifts of grace and strength, and punishments of blindness or epilepsy. Unlike most of your peers, you understand the construction and operation of these heavenly machines well enough that you could create your own given tools and time. Reincarnation is not traumatic in itself, though the atman takes time to reassert itself – supernatural powers are diminished to near-nothing for some time after rebirth, but always return in full eventually. So long as the brain is alive, reincarnation is almost always successful – brain damage scars the soul, and may prevent successful rebirth. You have duties and responsibilities, though you may live a princely life, it is at the behest of Heaven that you serve. Never forget your patrons – they do not allow Karma to be the servant of mortal greeds. After your time upon this world, adjoined to your Warehouse is a lofty vault of marble and gold, within which rests a system of the same powers – a psych-probe throne, eight accelerated-growth clone tanks and life-weaving computer. With artful care, you may even use these machines to imbue greater or stranger shapes upon the life within, but initially they may only create animal, human and godly forms – freely granting Bestial Gifts and Divine Physique. Bestial Gifts (Lord of Light) Bestial Gifts - Despite your lowly nature, you have strengths. Some animal traits express themselves strongly in you - be it acute senses, speed, claws and so forth. Those who are not themselves animals, have mutated to express these features and would be well advised to keep them hidden. The Masters of Karma may judge fairly, but the common man can have little mercy. You may take whatever animal features you like - but they are clearly and distinctively animal. If you are an Animal, then of course you have the entire form, for what little it aids you. Divine Physique (Lord of Light) The body selected for your enjoyment has been carefully shaped beyond the apex of humanity. Strong, vital and beauteous - it is a form that one could live within for hundreds of years, though at any time you may approach the Masters of Karma for a replacement, should the flames of your divine lifestyle burn it out. Care has been made that it expresses the initial mutations and brain structures to develop Aspect and Attribute - though once they have been induced, they will carry with your soul through whatever form you take. (Word of God) >Actually speaking of companions is it possible to give ones gained from after the jump demigod stuff, if so what would you need? IIRC you get the required equipment installed in the Warehouse post-Jump. >So basically if we take the demigod import post-LoL companions(a.k.a. ones gained from after that jump) can be upgraded to demigod with the right equipment? Yeah - it's basically a subtle Mutant Superpower, and a demigod may not be the best at teaching the mental exercises and performing the drug regimen that brings it out to its peak, but they'll have a starting point. You have enough genetics perks and you can do it yourself. (better this than worry too much about in-universe compatibility of powers, which is always a bit of a pain in the ass to think about).",

Your Exaltation holds many of the lost knowledge of crafting and forging great Artifacts, as well as lost sciences of the First Age such as biogenesis. You begin with the basic knowledge and fluency in Old Realm, as well as mastery of the various sciences and ways of crafting from the First Age, able to forge weapons, warstriders, and other items of legend to add to your own panoply. As a bonus, you know how to substitute magical materials for such items with their mundane equivalents or metals in other worlds - useful in worlds without materials such as orichalum. (Capstone Boosted - Unconquered) Contrary to what some of the Solars of the First Age may have believed, the world is not improved by being painted in gold or forged in orichalum. The world is made whole by the sum of its parts, not merely the brightest piece of it. This realization comes with twofold benefits - you are able to attune yourself to any sort of supernatural metal: soulsteel, jade, moonsilver, or even things in other worlds - as though it were orichalum. Just as well, you can easily forge Artifacts with these different metals as well. But this is not all your teachings have discovered - you now understand the necessary principles to build tools and methods that can interact with the higher piece of the soul, even excising a piece of it without killing the subject. In time, you may even find ways to bolster, empower, or strip away elements attached to it, though generating means and power is up to you. If this sounds underwhelming, take note of this - Lytek would likely kill to know what you will eventually set the groundwork for.

Additionally, you have greater understanding and control of your own soul, granting a slight boost of strength and control of your magic, and a much greater boost in control of any domains or divine magic/abilities you possess. With practice, you can learn to push your soul into mundane or magical artifacts either to siphon strength from them, imbue them with power, make them into a part of your expanded metaphysique for purposes of arcane sympathy or control, or directly struggle against their own power or owner’s power to steal control of the item (though losing such a conquest can have terrible consequences). Most importantly, you can induce a divine awakening in mortal souls (including your own, if you are not already a New God). While this does nothing on its own, an awakened mortal will, over time, grow into a New God, increasing the strength of their soul and connecting to a Domain relevant to their skills and personality. Awakening a skilled mage could lead to a New God of Magic. Awakening Green Arrow would lead to a New God of Archery. Awakening a veteran Green Lantern could result in a New God of Will. A New God of Archery could fire one arrow and simultaneously hit seven targets around a corner. A New God of Will could match the Guardians of Oa. In addition to granting a domain and increased arcane power, an Awakening will heal most injuries or arcane maladies, and elevate the subject to the ideal status of their species. It will turn white Martians into red Martians and have similar effects on other species with inherent biological or arcane castes. The rate at which a new New God grows into his or her powers can be increased with exposure to raw arcane power. Additionally, while a Fatherbox or sufficiently skilled New God could perform or teach this skill in the Jump, it does so by forcing them to focus on one or a few specific aspects of their being, such as a skill, power, or personality trait, and hinders them in gaining completely new skills or powers unrelated to their domain.

When used it releases the Planeswalker Spark and the Spark enters the person who used the Powerstone. The person who receives the Spark gains all the benefits from the Planeswalker Spark perk, a Color origin alignment appropriate to them, discounts based on that origin and 500 CP to spend on perks. This can’t be used to give someone a second Planeswalker Spark as Planeswalkers are unable to use this Powerstone. This Powerstone will generate a new Planeswalker Spark after every jump or every ten years whichever is sooner. Planeswalker Spark (MTG Iconics) The post-Mending Planeswalker Spark, not the Jumper Spark. This is the Spark of the MtG universe, and your own Planeswalker Spark has ignited. Due to this your ability to understand and mold Mana becomes incredibly intuitive such that your potential far exceeds all mortal spellcasters. You know the basics of summoning creatures that you have a connection with, creating new creatures from mana, casting spells, and forming contracts with higher powers for boosts to your capabilities. As a new Planeswalker, your current capacity to use Mana starts at 5 motes of Mana before incurring Mana Burn. This will easily grow to 10 motes of Mana within a year and from there, given thorough magical research, you will be able to sustain an additional mote of Mana per year of study. Mana is generated from Lands, of which you can bond to one after half a week. Lastly, as a Planeswalker you can of course travel the multiverse. In a ritual requiring at least three motes of Mana and six hours of mental preparation, you can take with you anything on your person. This can be trained to have a lower cost and mental preparation time. In addition, you can instead Planeswalk instantly when following someone in the immediate wake of an interdimensional jump. When navigating between planes you can either go to a plane randomly or go to a plane you know or one you have seen by visualizing it in your mind. This ability is limited to the local multiverse until you ignite your Jumper Spark. Alignment (MTG Iconics) All magic is sorted into one of five Colors to which they are naturally inclined, likewise all mages have a Color to which they are more in tune with than others. For the Color of your origin you gain this perk free. For the Colors allied (adjacent) to your origin’s Color you can gain this perk for 100 CP for the second alignment and 50 CP for the third onward. Lastly for the Colors opposing (opposite) your origin’s Color you can gain this perk for 200 CP for the second alignment and 100 CP for the third onward. This perk gives you a solid understanding of the fundamentals of this Color, allowing you to easily serve as a peer in a respectable magical academy, start creating your own spells, and more easily form connections to creatures of the same Color without tutelage. This perk also lets you apply discounts to second Color’s perks for which you have bought alignment in addition to your origin, but does not give you the free 100 CP perks instead counting them as discounted. This can be taken multiple times up the the maximum of five times",

Born without the ability to make use of the energy around them. In ages past, these poor things were often killed early on in superstitious fear. Their family had no idea of their true potential. But you survived, the true nature of your power slowly restoring and empowering your body, until your wounds disappeared and you regained the Quincy powers that are your birthright. With a touch and acceptance from each side, you can impart a fragment of your soul to another being. All ailments of the recipient, be they physical or mental or spiritual, will be healed by the process. In return, the fragment would be engraved with all the knowledge, skills and talents of the person who received the fragment. The price? A severe reduction in lifespan for the recipient and on their death, the fragment would return to you with all it has gathered. Not just the mental traits but also the stolen lifespan and even a significant amount of the spiritual energy the host once held. These fragments can only be gathered and absorbed in your sleep, the dead treasures combining into your being once you enter the slumber. If you go beyond mere contact, and trade a drop of your blood, you can awaken the powers of a Quincy in another individual. While this only grants the base traits of a pure Quincy, and is quite incompatible with Hollow Reiryoku, it also binds them to you. Resisting your commands will prove a terrible struggle if bound and you may find a way to sustain your life so long as your bound Quincy remain. Your presence will do them more than enough good to pay recompense, as one who can share as you do will naturally reinforce greatly the speed at which Quincy develop. Both their Quincy powers and spiritually in general. The final step you have available is to allow Quincy to drink deeply of a cup of your blood, imbued with a significant fraction of your soul. This ritual will inscribe a Letter into their spirit, allowing them to awaken a unique power suited to the Letter and their own personality. The potential for these ‘Schrift’ varies, based half on overall spiritual power and half on affinity for Quincy abilities. While all Schrift start weak and must be developed, some will end as merely a hardening of the skin or manipulation of fire. Others reach a stranger height, even making the imaginary into reality. There is a downside to your nature. You must continue to share and reclaim from others or else face the prospect of slowly returning to your natural state. Blind, deaf, dumb and helpless in every way. Though it will never kill you, you must always be aware that you rely on the spirits of others to maintain your existence. Hardly fitting for a King. With time and experimentation, it may be possible to uncover new ways to use this power. Yhwach would eventually create techniques that allowed him to resurrect from death so long as the Quincy bearing his soul fragments still lived, as well as a method to steal back the fragments and Quincy power in general to redistribute as pleased.",

Each man wished to find a way to break the boundaries of the spiritual world in some way and, somehow, each found their way to the same creation. A device capable of realising the deepest desires and dreams of those around it. Yet, this tool has a will of it’s own, an intelligence to read the desires of others and serve the one considered it’s master. Whatever the truth of it’s intelligence, the completed Hōgyoku rests in your palm now, a fusion of two component orbs and incredible power to bind them. It’s power is to manifest dreams as reality, not in a temporary sense or only maintained by focus but as truth. It could break down the barriers between two races to create a new species, awaken powers in those that desperately desire or evolve a man to ever greater levels of power. Indeed, these dreams manifest through evolution, change and growth in those affected. The orb requires a large amount of Reiryoku to activate, either injected in to activate in regards to a single desire or constantly infused by being near a powerful source, allowing the orb to manifest wishes as it sees fit. However, the orb manifests desires that people are capable of achieving. If one does not have the raw potential or power to achieve something, the Hōgyoku will instead attempt to lead it’s user towards being able to do so. They might be forcibly evolved in stages first to prepare them for the true goal or be guided without realisation towards what is needed to gain the potential for what they desire.

Macro Karmatron Theory – Also known as “psychohistory”, this is the science of human destiny, a mathematical model of sociology. Where an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, Kinetic Theory can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy – so too with the behaviour of intelligent beings. Psychohistory allows the long-range prediction and manipulation of the future, provided the population is of sufficient size, without directly infringing on the free will of the individual. Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil. Nano Karmatron Theory – Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming – they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness. It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs. These Imaginos Bodies are a perfect fusion of the will of the mind and the power of the physical form. However, at least with the current state of Karmatron Dynamics, very few are capable of making the transition successfully – their wills disintegrating their body into a screaming crumble. At the moment, only karmic singularities – individuals of exceptional and unpredictable influence on the destiny of mankind – can be reasonably expected to make the leap into the new flesh. Their base appearance reflects the self-image of the mind. As the mind reflects upon itself it may learn to change colour and – gradually – shape. Assimilation of cherished weapons, generation of new systems and limbs, intuitive hacking – the full capacity of the Imaginos is limited only by the imagination and will.",

Warder You’re really good at warding things. Specifically areas, creatures, and items. You could ward a small town so that those with hostile intent against the residents would be cursed the moment they step inside, or could potentially create wards that just keep such people out completely assuming you’ve got the time and are willing to spend the effort making them. You’re also really good at creating wards against specific effects such as mind control, instant-death, curses, and ironically enough wards that will let you ignore other wards. You could even erect wards on individuals to allow them to temporarily ignore a weakness they might otherwise have, such as allowing a lesser vampire to walk about in daylight or allowing a fire elemental to resist cold damage. Starseed​ ​Awakening​ (Sailor Moon) ​(600 CP) Within you is a great power. The power to take an ordinary Star Seed and blossom it into a flower of glory just below that of a Sailor Crystal’s. You have a supernaturally powerful ability to bring out anyone’s potential with a reasonable amount of personal magic-assisted teaching. This act allows them to gain powers based on their personality and who they are. A fiery person could gain fire powers, a statistician gains the power to manipulate probability, a cat gains the ability to defy physics, ect ect. It is up to you to define the limits of these powers, but these awakened powers are initially weak. Training can help someone increase in power. This power also grants the recipient a human form, if they lack one. Or, if you wish, you may instead wish to help add to the glory of a Sailor Crystal. You may grant a one-time power-up to someone with powers other than the ones granted by this perk, but if you use this ability, you cannot grant them the powers this perk gives someone. This power cannot be copied without a means to emulate parts of the Awakened Person’s soul you wish to copy. You may not steal an Awakened Person’s power without their full consent, and threatening or coercing or mind controlling them into having them give you their power does not count as consent. Eating a person or ripping out their soul does not count as consent. A person can only be Awakened once. Comes with optional magical girl transformation sequence if you wish.",

While the ethical, moral, and environmental effects can get right back to the first age, the martial effects you can cause cap out at making things about two thirds of what a modern day Superwarrior can do. Your physical and mental attributes are increased to the point where you now stand as far above a normal Superwarrior as they do above the rank and file of the Third Age. Your speed is as lightning, your blows could shatter mountains, and your skin withstand blows that could crack a continent. In future jumps, you find yourself the absolute epitome of whatever race, type, being, or entity you come to be. Whatever the reasons might be for someone to not be such, like blood, magic, curses or the decline of the very world itself, none apply to you in any way, shape or form. You are the greatest, mightiest, wisest and most perfect being there can possibly be for your race/species etc. If there was a first generation, you belong to it, though this does not change your starting location or time.",

The fusion shares traits from the component monsters, though they may manifest differently or in new ways, and are strengthened by the combined strength of the two monsters. The greater the synergy and trust between the monsters, the greater the power of the fusion and the longer it will last and the more you practice, the more monsters you can include into the fusion (up to a maximum of five at a time), though more monsters tends to shorten the time of the fusion. Already fused monsters cannot be fused again. It is possible for monsters to become permanently fused, however, this requires exceptional trust and synergy between the component monsters as well as a desire to become a permanent fusion, a rarity for such willful creatures. Alternatively, if you possess the Creature Synthesis perk, you may make this fusion permanent. If you possess Burst Fusion, you may include yourself as part of the fusion, either acting as a voice in the back of the mind of the fusion to extend the fusion and increase its power or as the main member of the fusion, becoming the single controller of the fusion.

Fortunately, the Man in the Moon doesn’t even need to be on the same planet to lend his support, and neither do you. If you have Perks, powers, spells, or abilities that in some way support or strengthen others, but only in a limited range, only if some specific condition is fulfilled, only if triggered or activated, or only for a short time, then your allies and Companions will still receive the benefits of all of those abilities no matter the distance between you, even if an ability would normally only be able to affect a select amount of people. (If a beneficial effect might not always be desirable, such as invisibility, then the recipient may suppress these effects at will.) Of course, you won’t be able to stack these benefits twice. (Capstone Boosted - Guardian) Supporting your friends is nice. But many strangers are just friends you haven’t met yet. If there is someone who you would approve of benefitting from a supporting ability you have, then they do, even if you haven’t even met them yet, even if you don’t even know their name.

Even more barriers are broken down. Previously, your supporting abilities could benefit someone almost anywhere, so long as they were in the same universe. But now?

If you are a Servant already, you will be fused to a human form that will make you a Pseudo-Servant.

You know and are skilled in the use of all of these abilities and items, though you might not quite know all the tricks as the original did just yet.

A Pseudo Servant is much the same as a Demi Servant, a Servant is summoned into a human vessel but in this case the Servant is the one who gains control over the body with the human spirit already discarded.

You will still be summoned as a Servant by whatever Master you chose, they were the ones to prepare the vessel you now inhabit or to have someone else do it for them. An important note is that Pseudo Servants effectively count as having living bodies, for the purposes of Magical Energy regeneration and any other effect that might care. Whichever option you have taken, the changed nature, be it Servant or Human, has magnified the powers of certain perks you could take. Any 600cp Origin perk will gain an upgraded form for you if you take them and this perk at once, as described in the Notes section at the bottom of this jump. Taking either of the above options does not lock you out of getting a Servant or Master if you normally would, these are entirely separate from such a thing.

The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.” -from Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib by the Princess Irulan. The Dune Saga is, at its base, about humanity surpassing its limitations, becoming more and greater. Humanity for all its myriad of flaws and faults has managed to accomplish much in its existence. Space travel, thinking machines, an empire of many worlds and planets. But to stagnate is to die, for without push there is no progress. One either evolves or one dies, there are no other options, at least not for a mortal race. Of course, there are threats inherent in this, for as one evolves, how human does one remain? And what happens when evolution seems to grind to a halt? What about when there doesn’t seem to be any evolutionary forces in play at all? What keeps the engines of progress turning? Despite these questions, there really does not seem to be any limit to the Human Will or what it can achieve when applied correctly... and that’s what this perk is all about. First, a guarantee -- you will always remain as human (whatever that means) as you desire to be. That’s the simple bit. Second, a promise that, no matter what you’re seeking to learn, or how you’re seeking to improve yourself, you’ll never stop seeing results, you’ll always find clever new ways to improve by a reasonable amount over a reasonable timeframe. All it takes is you putting in the effort. And third, enough of a willpower boost to ensure that you will never need an external source of conflict to push you to improve yourself or encourage others to improve themselves. But wait, there’s more. Guarantees are fine and dandy, but a good foundation is also needed. To that end, you’re given a general upgrade that makes you roughly fifty percent stronger than the strongest normal humans, tougher than the toughest normal human, and faster than a normal human can get, with peak human senses and health. After all, this is the far future... there have been some improvements on the genome. A sound body is, of course, wonderful, but a human is more than mere flesh. To that end, you are now a multifaceted genius, at least as smart as any human that has ever lived, and a true renaissance man, being able to apply your intelligence to any field that strikes your fancy. You will never fall into the traps of myopic focus that plague the Tleilax, the Mentat, the Gesserit, the Ixian, the Guildsman, or the Noble Scion, dodging the destructiveness and limitation that comes with specialization at the expense of all else, But this is Humanity Unchained, freed of all fetters, and so limitations to your body are lifted, both physical and mental. Your learning ability is expanded exponentially, allowing you to discover new modes of thought, new techniques, or simply experience new sensations so much more easily than those around you. You’ll find that it takes you but a single repetition to master any skill that others can teach you, and discovering new depths for yourself will require at least two orders of magnitude less time than it would take a normal genius.",

However, more often than not, wisdom by itself is not enough. There are factors and events that even the wisest sage in the universe could not possibly anticipate, and for those situations, having excellent instincts for risk and the reaction time to make the most of those instincts can cover much of the difference. Your instincts verge on the preternatural, allowing you not merely split seconds of warning when things are going south, but minutes or even hours of slowly mounting unease as looming danger nears. The greater the danger, and the closer it is, the more pressing your sense of unease will become, and the clearer your ‘sense’ of what you’ll need to do to get yourself (and potentially others) out of hot water will be. When you rely upon this sense, you will find that you can survive almost any disaster, as long as you are wise enough to seek a way out rather than stupidly standing in the path of onrushing doom. With your instincts honed to finer than a razors edge, you have been granted reflexes and reaction times that verge on superhuman. Better Lucky than Wise (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained) Of course, all the wisdom and instinctive action in the world cannot save you if you are well and truly screwed... and that’s where having Lady Luck firmly on your side pays off. As a Human, you seldom rely upon instinct, of course, but by following the flow of the moment, your ability to survive is magnified many times over, giving you tremendous, noteworthy amounts of Luck. By moving at just the right moment, you’ll be able to dodge otherwise fatal sword strikes from Ginaz Swordsmasters, avoid a Mentat Assassin’s laser, correctly guess sixty-four digit passwords, and find your way blindfolded through randomly shifting minefields.

You also have access to all your Female Genetic Ancestral Memories. That’s the memories of every single female ancestor you’ve ever had (though not subject to any traumas, memetic, conceptual, or sensory attacks they may ever have suffered). Each Reverend Mother and each Female Ancestor is persona complete, meaning each of them exists as a kind of ghost within you, one you can talk with, even making a council of multiple memory ghosts to talk to all at once. Combined with Simulflow, you could be having dozens of such conversations as you go about your normal life. Sure, you could go through the training of a Bene Gesserit Sister or a Sayyadina of the Fremen and unlock all this without paying the points... but there are three advantages to paying for it. 1) surviving the Spice Agony is far from a certainty, and if you have non-togglable poison resistance you can’t even trigger the Spice Agony in the first place. 2) without purchasing this, you are not guaranteed to be immune to Abomination. Buy it for CP and you’ve got a guarantee that you won’t become possessed by one of your own ancestors. 3) without paying for this, you won’t be able to do it in future jumps and you won’t gain the Ancestral Memories of your original Persona. Of course, if you’re Male and don’t have Golden Path, you’re not going to be able to do this naturally anyway without paying for it. In future jumps, the Ancestral Memories you unlock are tied to the genetic background of whoever you import to in each jump. If you’re a Drop-in, or have Unbeholden active, you don’t have any genetic memories to unlock. Sorry. You may choose not to unlock a given jump identity’s Genetic Memory in future jumps even if you otherwise would have them. The Genetic Memories of all past jump identities that were not Drop-Ins can be unlocked at any time, but once a jump identity’s Genetic Memories have been unlocked, they cannot be relocked. Your original self’s (the pre-jumper you) Genetic Memories are automatically awakened for your core persona (not who you are in this jump). Note: If you did not get a discount on this [by being a Reverend Mother or Sayyadina Priestess], you will unlock the genetic memories of either the male or female half of your genetic memory, depending on which sex you decided you would count as in this jump. Living History (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained) You now have access to all your ancestors, male or female... and to a much greater degree than any mere Reverend Mother or Honored Matre. You can allow yourself to become partly Abomination at any time to take on the persona of any ancestor, including all their skills and behavioural quirks, and just as easily shift out of that state at will. You can also, with effort (and a large dose of spice) go upstream, calling up the memory ghosts of those who died without contributing to the gene pool. The more generations you have to move upstream, the harder it will be, with one generation being taxing, two being hard, three being incredibly hard, and four or more requiring days or weeks of effort. More than seven generations would probably take daily doses of Water of Life or Megaspice.",

From now on, wherever you go, you’ll gain a download of all scientific and technological knowledge ever developed in that universe by a member of your race... no matter how lost or secret it might be. Richesians are masters of miniaturization, and are able to make machines up to a hundred times smaller than they should be without losing any effectiveness. Ixians are experts in non-digital programming, able to create non-computerized machines capable of replicating almost anything a computer can do besides think for itself. Thinking Machine (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained) Well, congratulations... you’re not even human anymore. Rather, you’re now a Thinking Machine. Thus, you are an immortal, endlessly upgradable AI in a body that is otherwise equal to that of a member of Humanity Unchained. Your consciousness can be uploaded to new bodies, backed up without fear of corruption, and in general you never have to fear death again, unless those pesky humans decide to try to obliterate you by hunting down every backup and fork of you and destroying them all. They did it once before, after all... and they have precog and Mentats. If you also have Butlerian Understanding, you gain technopathic control over all non-thinking machines with any form of computer inside, no matter how shielded, as long as you have a control-node within a hundred kilometers and the ability to sense the presence of any form of computer circuitry at planetary distances. In space, your ability to control machines is increased to within visual range and within 100,000 kilometers. Taking this Boosted Capstone is optional. With Humanity Really Unchained, your followers may choose to become Thinking Machines, but do not automatically do so.",

      "source": "Frank Herbert’s Dune",
      "description": "Though times have changed, the concept of pure blood and good breeding among nobility has endured throughout the millennia, reinforced by the often not so subtle hand of the Bene Gesserit (and occasionally tampered with, no doubt, by the Bene Tleilax). Even without the Bene Gesserit Breeding Program, the brutally darwinian selection process of a hundred plus centuries of Wars of Assassins has largely winnowed out all the weaklings. You are the product of these mutually reinforcing pressures, a truly spectacular specimen of Humanity, the refinement of the finest bloodlines distilled and characterised in each generation in a bid to produce the Universe’s Superbeing... and, you know, outdo the other Houses and secure future offspring. Not only are you very nearly genetically perfect, with no area or aspect of human development left untouched by drastic improvement, but you are beyond what the humans of the early twentieth century would consider peak humanity. Your muscles experience a tenth the fatigue a baseline human’s might, your senses are at least twice as sharp, your reaction times untrained are equal to those of seasoned genetically engineered assassins, and your resilience to trauma and disease guarantees that, should you actually suffer a mischief, you’ll recover in short order unless someone actively kills you. And that’s just the physical side. Mentally, you’re smarter than even a thinking machine... what some in earlier times would call a Post Singularity AI, with a near photographic memory and reflexes, allowing you to mimic behaviours and master new techniques with frightening speed. Furthermore, since you’re only a generation or two removed from the first Kwisatz Haderach, your genetics breeds true, meaning that you can pass on all your various gifts and abilities to your children without worrying that you’ll pass on anything bad to them in turn. Non-Human forms will be similarly adjusted from baseline. Better Breeding (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained) Oh, sorry, did we say that you were a generation removed from the Kwisatz Haderach? Well you are. In the other direction. While other Scions of Houses Major are content with being the best possible specimens of the Human Race... you’re not so concerned with ‘possible’. Every facet of your biology has been not merely maximized, but dialed past the end of the scale and then tweaked a bit more. Your speed, strength, toughness, resilience, and reaction times are all well into the superhuman range, allowing you to perform feats that should kill a normal human. You could run hundreds of miles through the open desert without protection and be fine, shrug off designer diseases and hard radiation, withstand a hail of bullets or dagger strikes, walk through walls of fire, and catch hypersonic needles out of the air. Your mind too has been enhanced, allowing you to intuitively understand cultures simply by being exposed to them, memorize anything (even physical motions) instantly, suffer absolutely no skill degradation over thousands of years, and learn new languages as fast as you hear them spoken. Your senses are at least an order of magnitude sharper than those of a baseline. Even without Mentat Training or exposure to the Water of Life, your mind is easily powerful enough to begin to unlock the secrets of prescience, giving you glimpses of the future that amount to danger sense... but also include prophetic visions of potential futures that include you or your descendants. In fact, your genetics are so good that even the smallest amount of your genetic material transferred to another living person will see their body begin to improve over time, correcting all manner of genetic or congenital defects.",

      "description": "“Anger is one thing, violence another.” - Count Hasimir Fenring. Dune is meant, more than anything, as a treatise on the dangers of extreme charisma... at least according to Frank. Nowhere is this more evident than in Muad’dib’s Jihad, an essentially unstoppable holy-war that gained a life of its own and resulted in the deaths of billions as the Fremen took their vengeance upon the Universe that had so long oppressed them. That it also solidified Paul’s position as Emperor was extremely useful to the Atreides, of course, but the cost was something that Paul deeply regretted. For the Fremen, the Jihad was a goal unto itself, an idea laying dormant until the opportunity presented itself. And now, like Paul or Pardot Kynes, both of whom were able to transform Fremen Society almost without effort, you can harness the furious power of this terrible force. Your charisma is beyond superhuman. Instinctively, you now know how to bend people to any task you dream up for them. People will be willing to live, to die, to kill at your command, and their loyalty will be a terrifying thing, a barely contained fire, a passion to serve you that burns within each and every one of your followers. Your every word will carry praise, insight, or condemnation, and your followers (which you will gather almost without effort) will eagerly record them, pour over them, repeat them as blessings and curses. Perhaps best of all, everyone you lead, everyone who follows your word, will gain an incredible resistance to the charisma of others, as long as those people don’t speak for you... or claim to. You may choose to instill a resistance to your charisma in those you trust. Speaks to Fishes (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained) “Life -- all life -- is in the service of life.” - Pardot Kynes. Charisma is a hell of a tool for controlling others, but it pales before that ultimate opiate of the masses... faith. By means of a sense of appropriateness that clues you in to the traditions, cultural elements, and taboos of any culture you encounter, you now have the ability to infiltrate the very cultural zeitgeist, the societal matrix of a community, and install a kind of unshakable faith in you and your ideals. The more time you spend among the people, the more rapidly you can transform entire societies into not just willing followers, but warrior-fanatics. Thankfully... or not... you gain a sense for how your people will interpret your words and deeds. This faith serves as a powerful shield, protecting those who are ‘infected’ with it from all other credos, charismatic manipulation, and even conceptual or existential effects that might harm their psyches.",

      "description": "As a third stage Navigator, you can now extend any of your senses to the edge of the Known Universe... i.e. all of a Galactic Supercluster, assuming you have enough Spice Gas. Any form of spatial disturbance in the same star system as you, be it teleportation, space warping, or gravitic shifting, will instantly register on your passive senses and you can specifically target any such disturbance anywhere in your active scan basket simply by looking for it. Each form and each point source will have a unique distortion fingerprint that you’ll be able to learn and recognize. Of course, as a third stage Navigator, you’re a giant humanoid blimp-thing that can’t actually survive without the Spice in gas form anymore (at least not until the end of the jump). If you didn’t get a discount on this perk [by being a member of the Spacing Guild], ignore that restriction. If you did get a discount, or just want to look like a disturbing floating fetus, you gain that form as an altform after this jump ends. After the jump ends, your need for spice falls off, allowing you to sense anywhere in your star system that isn’t shielded from precog or clairvoyance even without the spice, but the spice will always boost your powers immensely. Fourth Stage (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained) You no longer have need of a Holtzman Drive and there is no limit to how far away your senses can be extended with enough Spice. Simply by focusing on any place in the Universe that you can sense with your Prescience, you can will yourself and anything within a bounded field around you to that location. Yes, this truly is Movement Without Movement. The size of the field is dependent on how much Melange you just took, but none at all will allow you to shift anything within a meter of yourself. A small dose (four grams or so) will increase it by an order of magnitude, and every doubling of the dose will increase it by another order of magnitude. Yes, that means to shift a hundred kilometer long Heighliner, you’ll need to ingest sixty grams of raw spice. You can even, though it won’t be easy, move something you’re in contact with to any other point in the universe you can perceive without moving yourself. If you’re a member of the Spacing Guild (i.e. you got a discount on Third Stage), your form isn’t even vaguely humanoid anymore. You probably look like a giant swollen brain floating in dense spice vapor. You cannot survive outside of the Spice Gas for more than two minutes for the duration of the jump. Afterwards, this becomes an alt-form and you gain the ability to exhale highly concentrated Spice Gas if you bought the Spice Gas Item.",

As a Tleilaxu Master, you’re an unquestioned master of all the biological sciences and can literally play with genes the way a sculptor plays with clay. If it is at all physiologically possible, you can make a custom tailored lifeform that will be able to do it. It might take a while ...it took the actual Masters (all of them) millenia to figure out how to mutate the Worms of Arrakis or to create pseudo-Melange, but you’ll get there eventually. Not only are you such a master, you can do all this without any form of computer assistance, which yes, means you can comprehend and manipulate genetic structures with your mind alone, rendering you immune to all forms of genetic diseases and giving you the ability to read someone’s genome and genetic heritage from just touching them. With a sample of the genes of anyone you can create gholas of them… assuming you have an Axlotl tank... or if you’ve got a womb of your own... I know, Heresy! Your creations will never betray you as long as you don’t treat them like worthless peons. You could even create Face Dancers if you wanted to. Super Face Dancer (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained) While technically the Face Dancers were lower down on the Tleilaxu caste system than the Masters, they were far more powerful, since they could (in theory) replace anyone... well, except for a Kwisatz Haderach or a Reverend Mother or a Thinking Machine or a Master or a Mentat or Guildsman... you know… people with mental powers that the Face Dancer didn’t have. But aside from that limitation, and the fact that the Bene Gesserit could always detect a Face Dancer, as long as a Face Dancer wasn’t seen actually transitioning, they could effectively look, act, and sound like any other human, even if that person was notably larger or smaller than the Face Dancer. This impersonation was so good that even genetic or mental scans couldn’t tell the difference, assuming the Face Dancer had time to study the target and gain a sample of their genetics. You’re now a Face Dancer. But not one of those defective ones. You’re a Super Face Dancer. You can’t be told apart from the original by any means, and the shift from one form to another takes you only six seconds rather than upwards of a minute. If you also have Ghola v1, you may now approximate any genetic ability that you’ve seen whoever you’re copying might have. It might not be a perfect copy, and you’ll have to figure out how to use it since you don’t have their memories, but given time and practice, few, if any, will be able to tell you apart from the original. This does not come with the kill switch of the quasi-canonical Super Face Dancers.",

While it is still possible to resist you, it would take someone with a will strong beyond words and belief, someone willing and capable of laughing in the very face of God Manifest. After all, that is precisely what they would be doing.",

Whatever impression you leave on people, whatever effects you have, they are magnified enormously. What might be a normal rivalry between young men could develop into a tale remembered in legends for millennia to come, a god who might feel respect for your humility in obeying his wishes normally would feel himself so filled with shame for taking advantage of you that he would force himself to grant his finest weapon in recompense. A stature as what you have, as a hero or an antagonist, is certain to gather many allies around you. When a few words of friendship and a battle at each other's side is enough to become lifelong friends, you are sure to become an icon to those around you. Indeed, your very nature is that of one to whom friendship results in far greater results than normal. That which you receive from your dear friends willingly becomes vastly greater in scope. Fighting alongside your brothers in arms would see you defeat foes thrice your might in normally impossible battles. A weapon received from a dying friend would ignite with a hundred times it’s normal shine, bolstered to incredible levels by the bonds you share. If you found yourself fighting the heavens themselves, with only the gifted power of two gods that have declared themselves your friends, you might yet succeed.

It’s a fickle thing in most worlds, but in the Universe of Dune it is perhaps the most valuable thing imaginable. Knowing who you can trust is vital in a world where traitors are a very significant issue that can undermine Houses, bring down entire Empires, and lay low even a Kwisatz Haderach. You, however, need never fear the traitor’s blade, not now or ever again, for it is within you to instill an unbreakable loyalty in your followers. This loyalty is unshakable by any external force, meaning that none of your followers will ever willingly betray you, and even if you somehow turn them against you, they’ll come to you with their grievances rather than allow them to fester and spread. Should you drive your followers away, they will walk away, heads high, rather than seek to turn against you. And as an added bonus, you have a talent for seeing the potential in those you command and causing it to flower. Your followers will feel compelled to strive to be the best version of themselves that they can be. Under your capable leadership (assuming you are capable), it might even be true. In any situation where there isn’t a clear chain of command, people not already under your command will tend to defer to your authority, and (in general) most people will assume you have the right to do pretty much anything you want, unless they actively know differently or would object to you doing so enough to actually stand up to you.",

You might have to spend time recruiting and training some men if not but your talents are no less great in that field than they are in commanding a war itself. Not only are your skills capable of turning the tide and pulling out a win against odds tens of times too great for your forces to even survive, those that follow you also become inspired with each win, deepening their loyalty to you, providing opportunities for you and them to meet and strengthen those friendships in person, and steadily growing in their main skills and powers the more you lead them to victory, even eventually reaching beyond the limits of ordinary mortals and into the realm of the magical.

The term Valkyrie Frame usually refers to a core that has integrated a suit of enhanced power armor that has been equipped with thrusters, weapons, and other equipment. Technology foreign to this universe is harder to integrate and upgrade. Post jump this limitation disappears. Vampire, True- 800 A true lord or lady of the night. At the last desperate moment of your life, the blood offered itself to you and the contract was made. The blood surged into your body and a new demon rose into the night. You posses powers that, even as a fledgling newly born, match or surpass those of any artificial vampire. Your physical abilities match them already and will greatly surpass them once you begin to feed on the blood of the living. Your regeneration is significantly more potent, even healing from many of your weaknesses at speed. The weaknesses of artificial vampires have a weaker hold on you and this will only continue as you age and continue to feed, until many cease to bother you at all. A similar principle applies to your other abilities, strengthening or even developing new vampiric powers as your life grows longer. The ability to change your shape, to other people or animals or even swarms of monsters, and powers of the mind are quick to avail themselves to you. Sight beyond mortal eyes, telepathy, hypnosis and telekinesis are classic traits of the vampiric ruler. Control over the weather or shadows, even dark magics, are all possible developments in time. As are many other powers besides. But your most potent and horrific trait is in the way that you feed on others. Unlike lesser vampires, who can only create ghouls, you are able to devour far more than just a person’s blood. Their very souls are dragged down into the depths of your own, bound and enslaved until the day you have use of them. These souls have many uses. Making them part of your legion will confer the knowledge and powers they possessed to you, allowing you use of them while their soul remains within. They can also be used as a substitute for your own life, sacrificing a soul to heal from terrible wounds or fatal blows. The souls can even be unleashed, as loyal familiars, to fight for you in the external world. This action prevents the use of these familiars as healing resources or power sources. If desired, rather than a vampire of your own making, you can be a child of Alucard instead. True Vampires can only create more of their kind from virgins of the opposite sex, though this condition will be taken card of if you choose this option.",

Untreated, even a tiny amount of this substance is lethally poisonous, and there is no antidote. It is said to cause an agonizing death. It can be transmuted by a Bene Gesserit, Sayyadina, or Kwisatz Haderach via a highly risky process called ‘The Spice Agony’. Untreated, the bile is an Awareness Spectrum Narcotic that awakens Genetic Memory and advanced psychic powers in anyone who survives the Spice Agony. The only men who can survive the Spice Agony are Kwisatz Haderachs. Once the bile has been converted into the Water of Life, it becomes a potent narcotic that awakens latent psychic powers at a much lower level... most especially collective empathy, telepathy, and limited prescience. Those who consume the converted Water of Life find their inhibitions lowered, their stress level drastically eased, and pent-up emotions safely released. When many people consume it in close physical proximity, they may fall into a Spice or Tau Orgy, where wild-dancing and unrestrained sexual activity are common. The Tau is the Fremen concept for ‘oneness of the community and devotion to others’. You gain 20 liters of untreated Water of Life every three months, and 500 liters of treated Water of Life every month. Normally, latent powers awakened by Water of Life fade after the high passes. Yours can be diluted and timedosed so that the high is smaller and more prolonged, thus allowing for training those powers to the point that they can be maintained even once the drug’s effects wear off. Mega-doses of converted water of life may have health risks (and induce Spice Addiction) but may awaken higher tier psychic powers, though not as high as those awakened by Spice Agony. Warning, undergoing Spice Agony while pregnant can cause your daughter to be Pre-Born... i.e. achieve full awareness and unlocking of genetic memory while still inside the womb. This includes gaining genetic memory of the mother. Male children who are not Kwisatz Haderach Potentials will probably be killed by this process. Those trained in the Sayyadina Rites of the Fremen or Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers can transfer their collective Other Memory (complete with a copy of their own Memory Ghost) to a successor or successors through the Spice Agony. This usually results in the death of the original Sayyadina, who usually only does this when she is about to die. The Sayyadina are the Fremen Priestesses and keepers of the secret lore.",

Each color of ring has the benefits listed previously, and every color ring has further specialized abilities, though listing every potential use of a Power Ring would exceed the capacity of this document. Red Rings form a corrosive aura and allow their bearers to spew rage plasma, an incredibly caustic substance that burns through almost anything. Orange Rings are capable of identity theft, which can turn any foe capable of feeling avarice into a persistent orange construct loyal to the ringbearer. Yellow Rings grow stronger if the bearer inspires fear in others, or if the bearer is surrounded by fear. Green Lantern Rings form stronger constructs than most other rings and have less mental effect on the wearer than other color rings. Blue Lantern Rings can strengthen Green Lanterns and weaken Red, Orange, and Yellow Lanterns and their light will heal with far greater speed and efficiency than other rings. They can also slowly recharge from ambient hope without relying on a Lantern Indigo Lantern Rings can mimic the effects of other rings, are particularly well suited for forming portals and wormholes, and increase the compassion of those exposed to the Indigo Light. Violet Lantern Rings are immune to the powers of the Orange Light, and can sense and empower love in themselves and others. Additionally, rings purchased here all contain a macro that allows them to fuse a complete set of seven rings, one of each color listed here, to form a White Power Ring. (This does not come with a MAGA hat.) White Lantern Rings can use all seven previously listed colors and their powers, absorb light/power from other power rings, overpower other rings, and allow the wearer to see and sense souls and life force. They are aligned with the White Light of Life (though “existential joy” would perhaps be a better descriptor of the emotion that empowers them)",

Unfortunately, the things you learn while using NZT are typically not fully available to you once it wears off. For free, you receive a replenishing supply, and the formula for, a version that has a few minor, minor side effects during withdrawal or even with continued usage: memory loss, extreme paranoia, blurred vision, hearing difficulties, psychosis, missing time, skin lesions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Limp Dick Syndrome.

You understand how and why the nanites work and act. You could even create your own nanites, with enough resources and time. You also know how to control other nanites, be using some kind of control interface, like a control nanite, or reprogramming them. If used in the right way, reprogramming the nanites within an EVO could turn them back to their original form, amplify their abilities or even give back their normal appearance to them while maintaining the benefits of being an EVO. Reprogramming the nanites of a normal living being can instead give specific mutations to them, instead of random ones. It’s possible to create other forms of technology using nanites as a basis, like nano-tattoos or human-to-machine interfaces. As a legacy of the Nanite Project, you can find a way to complete the nanites to turn them into a way to end starvation, diseases and even death, but this is a work for many years. I think it isn’t necessary to say that the Meta-Nanites are beyond your understanding. (Capstone Boosted - Omega-2 Nanite) Well, I was wrong, because you weren’t just more one of the responsible for the creation of the nanites, because, instead, you could even say that you were the main responsible for their creation, as the head scientist of the Nanite Project. No one in the entire world understands the nanites better than you. You know the full potential of these microscopic machines and know how to programate them to grant any kind of mutation that was shown in the canon universe. You can build any of the two kind of control nanites, like the Omega Nanite (a human-to-machine interface capable of apparently amplifying an EVO’s abilities and create an unlimited supply of nanites) and the Alpha Nanite (a machine-to-machine interface in the shape of a sentient nanite swarm), with enough resources. You could even program your nanites to just obey you. Now, let’s talk about the more important part: the Meta-Nanites. Firstly, you learned the main concept behind their working: Nanites specifically created to tap into/contain a portion of the power of cosmic forces (for example, the Dominion Code in the Generator Rex’s world). Post-jump, you can create special nanites to contain or have access to similar forces, like the Phoenix Force, the Speed Force, the Source, the Paths or even magic systems themselves. Unfortunately, unless you have fiat-backed access to these forces, the nanites will be unable to maintain full access to them outside their home universes/dimensions, having just, at least, fiat-backed access to 20% of their full power. These special nanites will be very hard to create, requiring many rare resources and extra study in-jump. Secondly, no, you can’t replicate the Meta-Nanites, because the Dominion Code is fully contained inside the original Meta-Nanites.",

Each one is a master of a skill to a level considered impossible to all others, taking something useful but mundane and making it akin to the work of a god. One is a swordsmith, whose works are the Zanpakuto that form the core of Shinigami power. One a seamstress whose ordinary clothes withstand attacks with ease from all but the greatest Captains. The oldest among them is a monk who has given names to all things and controls the very names themselves, giving great power over the world. While you may not necessarily have been offered a place yet, though also possessing sufficient power may change this, you have mastered a certain skill or idea to a similar level as the current members. Skills are obvious and described both above and below but ideas are also possible. Ichibe’s title as the one who names others has allowed him to manipulate names as a concept, altering or controlling others through their names. In his sealed form, this is largely limited to an innate knowledge of all names, the ability to draw power from others speaking his name and to lay notably powerful curses or other effects on names that activate when spoken. Whatever you pick allows for incredible uses and techniques just on it’s own, such as the above techniques described. It’s almost certain that you have also created some great invention connected to your chosen skill, which may have already spread through Soul Society and brought fame to your name. A master of Kido who created stick-shaped implements that allow even a beginner to work powerful magics, a swordmaster whose written lessons have revolutionised Zanjutsu by introducing magical techniques not connected to release forms or kido, perhaps even something like an author whose stories have inspired and directed the afterlife again and again. However your skill and the accompanying great invention appear, there is a second aspect to this option. Whatever your skill or idea is, it is also linked directly to your Zanpakuto. Releasing your Zanpakuto will greatly expand what you are able to accomplish with your skill. This works in concert with it’s existing abilities, which may alter the form of the blade and the powers to complement each other better. Ichibe’s Shikai, a large brush which could manipulate ink, allowed him to suppress and erase others by covering them, and thus their names, in black ink. His Bankai grew this to the point that he could directly change or give new names to beings, with the properties of their new name becoming true. The most powerful warrior reduced to the strength of a helpless ant, as that is what his name had become. Your Zanpakuto releases will likely be supercharged by this process, greatly improving the existing powers as a result of them combining with such divine skill. It is also worth remembering that these powers are not without limit. The released state of this skill will require your spiritual energy to operate and some uses, though theoretically possible, may be of too great a magnitude to actually work. Those without a Zanpakuto can eventually unlock independent release states that give access to two increased levels of power with your chosen divine skill. These two release stages will drain your energy similar to a Shikai and Bankai but at least allow access to your full potential.",

When you bite down on other beings with that head, or yourself with some contortions of the body, you gain the ability to alter any powers they have. The difference between your power and Hansode’s is that you do not possess truly freeform ability alteration. Instead, you work with the component parts and traits of any power you have access to and any power your target has access to, letting you freely combine powers or individual traits from powers to create new abilities, create upgraded versions of existing powers or add flaws to powers that had none. Combine a weak power with a very strong one to increase the raw power of the former ability, combine a power with many flaws with another that has no flaws to remove the drawbacks of an ability, even alter the look or source of power of an ability by combining it with an appropriate partner. You can combine traits from multiple sources at once, the only limitation being that you or your target currently possesses an ability with that trait in it. Do note however that what you use as your components will be used up to create the new mix. Changing two powers to create something new will give you the new power at the cost of what you used to make it.",

      "source": "Sidekicks",
      "description": "The Triad Prana as it is called is made up of three separate prana that share a little of each other's functions but each has their own unique capabilities. Only a select few at the top of the world know the true origins of these powerful objects and who has them. A user of the Prana can sense the superpowers that exist within a person and can gauge a person's strength because of it. Consequently, they can also tell if a person doesn't have superpowers. In addition, they can also detect another prana user if they are in the general vicinity which is around a few miles. In future jumps, you'll be able to tell if a person has something special sealed inside of them, has superpowers, or is powered by something unusual. Although the prana’s power is absolute it isn’t without downsides. Without all three prana in one person the effects that come with the prana are temporary as they can disappear or weaken at any moment. Only with all three will a person be able to do permanent changes. You receive a copy of the Prana that you buy that is equally as powerful as the original. The Prana copy you receive cannot be taken from you without your consent. This basically means the prana will be with you forever unless you decide to pass it onto someone else. Your version of the Prana can’t be sensed by holders of the original in-jump Prana’s, though it will work in conjunction with them just fine if you were to somehow get hold of the originals or you gave your Prana to someone else. One final thing - Prana users tend to be all but immune to the ‘Skills’ of other Supublic’s unless those skills are themselves backed by a Prana. This doesn’t give any increased resistance to just being punched in the face or having someone shoot a Beam Burster at you though. The First Prana The First Prana’s main ability is the creation of superpowers. You only need to have a general idea of what you want like healing, pyromancy, or flight and the prana will create it. If you can’t think straight for whatever reason or are feeling lazy the prana will automatically give you the best superpower for whatever situation you happen to be in. If you’re about to be stabbed through the chest it’ll most likely give you teleportation or phasing just as an example. You will never be caught off guard with The First Prana as it will make sure you have the superpower to survive any situation within reason. These temporary powers can be gifted to others or yourself as a temporary power-up. The powers can be gifted permanently although the catch is that you have to transfer your own superpowers or perks to another person for them to gain it forever. A workaround for the time limit issue is that you can implant your created powers into capes. You could even implant multiple powers into a cape if you have something that is strong enough to handle all that power. This one is currently owned by the strongest superhero Darkslug. He is actually the original holder of the first prana and is the only person that has ever held all of The Triad Prana. With all three prana, any and all superpowers you create will be permanent along with the ability to give permanent powers to others continuously as you can restore whatever superpower you happened to give to someone else. In addition to that you can also gift any amount of perks or skills you have to others without having to sacrifice your own. The Second Prana The second prana has the ability to amplify, recharge superpowers, control, or mimic the superpowers and super-skills that others possess. The Second Prana can control a superpower by negating it from working in the first place allowing the user to not get caught by surprise. The owner can ‘borrow’ the power of others which is a term for just copying the superpower and any skills that another person has. It is even possible to copy the skills of people stronger than you but it must be within reason. If they dwarf you severely in power then that person’s powers won’t be copied. The Second Prana is currently owned by Theo, the son of the previous owner, Guardian, Theo's father, who transferred it to him before his demise. With all three prana, you can permanently amplify all of your allies abilities making them soar to new heights. You’ll be able to recharge your own superpowers instantly using the completed Triad Prana. Any superpowers you copy will also permanently be a part of you instead of just a temporary ability. The Third Prana The Third Prana can decrease, steal, and transfer the superpowers of one person into another. Powers and skills taken by The Third Prana can then be transferred to another person or used by yourself if you’re inclined. However, these stolen powers have been noted to weaken or disappear if the gifted power is stressed to the absolute breaking point and beyond. This prana, unlike the second which favors control, is better for outright nullification and weakening of a person’s powers. It’s been noted to even nullify exotic items such as a candle that nullifies superpowers. The Third Prana is useful for taking everything important to a person. I do mean everything by the way. You don’t have to stop at just their superpowers. You can go further beyond and take what makes a person unique. You can take their very bodies and make it your own by transferring your own mind into their body gaining their powers in the process as well. These powers will be permanently with you even if you leave the body. There may be a lingering consciousness that fights back sometimes upon seeing or hearing important events from their life after you usurped control but all that pales in comparison to the benefits. This prana is owned by Metheos aka the former superhero Dunkelheit who took control over Theo’s father’s body, Guardian. With all three prana, any powers and objects you weaken or outright nullify will stay that way unless you revoke the limitation. Any superpowers you transfer will also never weaken or go away but will be forever a part of the person you gave it to. You will never experience any person you take over speaking out or trying to fight for their body back. Once you’re in control it is staying that way. Similarly you are also immune to any method of possession, body snatching/control, etc unless you allow it. The Triad Prana’s absolute power comes with one final bonus in addition to all of aforementioned benefits. Having all of the Triad Prana will make it so that your abilities, powers, skills, body, and anything else you want can never be sealed, removed, weakened, copied, suppressed, stolen, replicated, or mimicked in any way, shape, or form. Your powers, body, and everything else you have will be forever yours unless you allow them to be used by others.",

These mighty beings emanate from the Yozis themselves, who define the demon realm by their very existence. Third Circle demons are forces of nature, with several terrible and simultaneous bodies. Usually, they are totally immune to death by physical assault; their weaknesses are few. Some of these Demons Princes live atop great spires, castles and aeries that overlook their fiefdoms of lesser demons. In other cases, these demons are the structures themselves, or the streets, rivers, chasms, and other landmarks seen everywhere in the city. Some rare demons possess even more abstract and ephemeral forms, such as a living emotion or a piece of music. Each of these monumental beings has seven souls, each a Second Circle Demon in their own right. You can now follow the Yozis example and externalize an aspect of your soul to form the core of a new being. Weaving a chrysalis out of thin air and essence, to incubate a sleeping and inchoate demon of the Third Circle. Depending on how much power it is desired to have, this phase may take anywhere between three weeks or more than two seasons. Once they emerge from this fully formed, they may then themselves form a set of seven demons of the Second Circle as normal. Who may, in turn, create entire races of First Circle demons to serve them. You may create up to eight of these mighty Demons, before you cannot endure the strain of creating another. However, if one should be destroyed in some way despite their power, you may replace them with another by weaving their chrysalis anew. None of the demons created by you can be more powerful than you in general, for no part can eclipse the whole… But they may outpace you in specific areas and in their own specialties, if you are unskilled there. So it might come to pass that a warrior without compare could create a lower soul that far surpasses them in sorcery, but never one that could defeat them in single combat. And while Demons created in such a way are not required to obey their creator, they carry an unbreakable tie of loyalty towards them and should their progenitor ever die a final death, they shall perish with you. This influence is mutual however; as you will gain an unbreakable connection to their goals just as they feel loyalty towards you. Should you ever learn The Path of a Thousand Whispers, the limit on how many Third Circle Demons you may have shall be expanded. So that you may retain a maximum of twenty-three in total, matching the most numerous of Yozi and awarding you eight more than any other Devil Tiger might be able to spawn. Duality (400 CP) Thamiel created demonkind by shredding the soul of Sataniel, dividing him into a fractal descending hierarchy, ever decomposing. Now, your soul and power are similarly divisible.

Creating weaker demons bound by the limits of the animal kingdom is a simple matter; you can only excrete a few dozen to start with, but Thamiel created an army of such beings from a single soul, and you may also rise to such heights in time. Greater demons with their own abilities are much harder to create, requiring the investiture of your own power and abilities into them, thereby diluting and dividing your power as an individual. Slain demons return their essence and power to your greater soul, ensuring no permanent loss save for some stress or trauma.",

This interests you very much, and after much experimentation and the deaths of more than a few non-sentient bugs, you’ve cracked your own version of this and figured out how to create a suitable body for it at that. Within fallen kingdoms, one can find Flames, the Flames of a kingdom’s fall. These Flames contain the memories of the kingdom, and can serve as ample fuel for your ritual. By collecting a number of these flames and creating a suitable vessel for them, you’ve skipped a few steps and have essentially created a living phylactery. If you die, your essence will be transferred to the vessel, and you live once again. It might take a little time for your new body to grow back to its full size, but surely that’s worth the cost of cheating death? Not to mention, as long as kingdoms fall, there will always be Flames to take. (Capstone Boosted - Voidheart) The void’s insight has allowed you further experimentation with Flames, and further refined the ritual of reincarnation. You have found a way to consume the Flames yourself. While this renders them useless for the ritual, doing this can grant large amounts of information about the area as well as a notable, stacking boost in power in regards to Pyromancies. Flames burn brighter, longer, and larger with each you consume. A small boost, but with many flames, your power over fire could grow immensely. Of more note is the ritual, which you have streamlined. No longer will you need to wait for the vessel to grow, as it will do so on its own before entering it. If left for long enough, you can simply walk in your new body as if it never changed. In addition, the vessels can be repurposed as servants with their own personalities and a proficiency with pyromancies. Filing them with flame can grant the same boons as if you had.",

The call of the Mosskin for their creator falls on deaf ears, and they wilt. No longer. You have been granted a measure of the great Unn’s power, the ability to simply will plantlife into existence with naught but thought and a bit of SOUL. You may choose whatever kind of plants you desire to grow, be they simple moss or ivy, to massive trees and great fields of fruit and vegetable alike. You can even choose their colouration, or deem them to shift colours according to season or time of day. Let life grow in your presence, and may the world bloom with everlasting life. (Capstone Boosted - Voidheart) The Void is ever malleable, and when combined with the power of life, one can truly embody the great spirit of the Greenpath. With larger exertion of SOUL, you can now form and create Mosskin within your mind and realize them into the real world. Mosskin are very similar to other kinds of bugs, distinguished by their mossy coating and loyalty to their creator. You can shape them as you please, and although their mossy exterior is required, it can be shaped however you wish. They can be anywhere between half the size of a person to thrice one’s height and width, the larger the size, the more SOUL is required. They can also possess the same kind of physical abilities bugs can, such as walking on sheer surfaces and ceilings, or true flight, among other things.",

Malkuth’s experiments resulted in the creation of the Grimm, whereas Keter’s resulted in this, the creations of Elementals. By offering a contract to the largely impersonal elemental forces that drive creation, you can give them a piece of your soul in exchange for their power. This gives them a human perspective, capable of perceiving the world like you do. And it gives you a faithful companion that can manipulate the element they’re born from, reaching tremendous heights with time, training and effort. For 200 CP you’ll get the knowledge and skill necessary to cultivate an Elemental Affinity and summon a Basic Elemental of your own. With time and effort you can improve your skill and power, increasing the strength of your Elementals and the distance they can operate from you. They can also be improved beyond Basic, becoming stronger and capable of fusing with Elementals of similar strength to create new kinds. For an extra 100 CP, for a total of 300, you can have already summoned a Basic Elemental of your chosen Element, also conferring a decent matching Elemental Affinity. This can be purchased multiple times to summon multiple Elementals, each one after this one costing 50 CP. Refer to the notes for information on the Elementals and their types. (Notes) The Elementals that have been observed thus far are Water, Air, Fire, Earth, Lightning and Metal. Once you’re skilled enough, your Elemental Affinity is high enough and your Elementals are strong enough, you may fuse two Elementals of similar strength into a new Element. You don’t have access to the unfused elements while this is happening but you can unfuse them at any time. You may also fuse together 3 or more Elements in varying ways. Observed fusion elements include Sand (Air/Earth) and Glass (Air/Earth+Fire). WoG from Ryuugi regarding Elementals : It varies greatly from person to person. Some have minds to the point that they are completely distinct from the person wielding them. Some are seemingly mindless. Some obey orders while others simply do whatever their wielder truly wants, regardless of what they try to tell them to do. Some manifest to their maker's will while other have the ability to manifest themselves as desired. Some take the shapes of things their maker loves or fears or feels strong attachment to--lost lovers, children, and pets, but also, say, a swarm of spiders--while others seem completely unconnected or have no shape at all, simply expressing themselves through their element. Some even act as separate bodies, requiring their maker to 'shift' themselves over to it and control it thereby, leaving their body defenseless during that time. Some Elementals just express themselves through their maker's Auras, whether as just a burning Aura, a Stand, or a coloration of their Semblance. If you have paid for your Elemental, you may choose how they manifest.",

Through the Investiture of Infernal Glory they are transformed into powerful slaves of the Yozi. First they are wracked with agonizing pain as pure vitriol from Hell’s heart pours into their body, warping and reshaping it to suit their soon-to-be patron’s twisted aesthetic. Then their mind is reconfigured and memories are edited, the akuma’s life experiences and memories cut apart and reshaped like the artistry of a demented child. Through a process that takes several hours, their body and mind are twisted to better serve their purpose. Yet, this is only the beginning. What comes after are days filled with further agonies as they suffer the violation of their very soul, while their essence is extracted from them and alloyed with vitriol before being returned to their body. This is also the point where the new servant suffers a total loss of self and free will. They will still be sentient in some fashion, but are now unable to defy the Urge they are now instilled with, and must press on relentlessly and obsessively even if situations change. Until their orders change, either by their patron Yozi directive if they are bound to obey, or the reapplication of this process if they are bound to a task. Still, they are useful tools with all their power. They retain access to almost everything they had before with the exception of those thing antithetical to the Yozi, gain access to the Charms of their Yozi patron, a demonic inheritance to bolster their immediate usefulness, as well as access to sorcery and martial arts one step above their natural potential. So mortal akuma may become Terrestrial sorcerers, Dragon-Blooded can use Celestial sorcery, and Celestial Akuma may initiate into the Adamant Circle in service to the Yozi. Something similar lies within your power now, as you may create Akuma of yourself. You may take a victim who offered their body, soul and mind out of their own volition, and invest them with access to all your powers in the same way the Akuma of the Yozi have access to their Charms. Their mind, body, and soul is yours to twist and rewrite as you wish throughout the process, and their newfound Urge shall be yours to compose. At the end of it all, you will have a powerful slave with unfaltering loyalty. Should you later learn The Song of the Shadow, you and the Demon you assign to learn the Investiture of Infernal Glory may create Akuma of yourself as a whole and Akuma limited to your Devil Tiger Charms interchangeably. Furthermore, your deepened understanding of the process by which you pass on your enlightenment, will allow you to create Akuma that retain their free will in addition to their new Urge. In the same manner as the Green Sun Princes do, as they shall suffer the Torment manifestation of your Devil Tiger.",

You, then, are a living catalyst of revolution, giving power to the people; you can reach out to and tutor anyone, no matter their former background or level of education.

You are providing the key to an otherwise-locked door and drawing out an otherwise-hidden road to power, not directly bestowing power and skill. There’s no guarantee that your methods will be safe or easy, and they will take some time to see benefits, from weeks to decades depending on how esoteric and hidden the supernatural ability in question is. If your methods get out to the world, there’s no telling who could take advantage of them… but that’s a feature, not a bug, right? (Notes) The intended purview and purpose of this perk is really for teaching magic to people, including teaching other people how to access various magic systems, and including other systematized supernatural abilities, like psionics and ki, if you like. But, that already includes various powers and power sources that are actually innate or inherited (like e.g. Potterverse magic). If you want to use this perk to “teach” other unlearnable abilities, like bloodlines, innate magical affinities, or specific superpowers and perks, go ahead. Basically, this is a broad power sharing perk that uses knowledge as a vector and a medium for the power sharing, but gates that power behind an appropriate process of training and/or study before a student can even get their foot in the door. You can choose the purview of this perk (what abilities you can share/teach) based on what best fits your Jumpchain experience; with God, all things are possible, but God works in mysterious ways, almost as if he were an inane narrative conceit. The only absolute limit I’ll give is that this perk can’t ever be used to teach any abilities that specifically stem from one’s individuality or personality, like a Semblance/Reality Marble/Classpect/Bankai (or whatever the fuck else you’ve picked up on the jumpchain). If you think it’s appropriate, you can teach someone how to use those abilities in the general sense, but you can’t teach in specific; you can teach someone to acquire a Bankai, but you can’t teach them your Bankai, because they’re not you.

Regardless, you have all the skills of a monarch and administrator capable of handling the vast lands of the unquiet dead. Your laws are written harshly but justly, your stentorian tones brook no argument and you dispassionately make good resource allocations even for a community that doesn’t need to eat or breathe.

Your resolve is a bonfire that will ignite hope in the hearts of those you strive to defend. When you take a public stand against the problems inherent in the status quo, you ignite a fervent zeal in those who witness you against that which you recognise as causing pointless suffering. Even without any hard evidence you could rally crowds to take a stand against the evils of the world with your sheer rhetoric, but with hard evidence of the Sidereals’ machinations or the Infernals’ treachery your cause will spread across national and social divisions. Should there be no true villain to blame for all the wrongs of the world, you can still make humanity rise up in unity against the broader problems in society you denounce. Those bolstered by your example find themselves highly resistant to mental influence that would subvert the truth or disrupt their unity, and when the masses march with you directly even soul-twisting mystical corruptions shall find them resistant to their effects. Such movements also take on an orderly character, heeding your guidance for restraint far more keenly than the average violent mob and taking the initiative to organise themselves for the cause. But this is not limited to public speeches: People you personally save don’t just go out of their way to pay you back later on, but powers and rites of the Solar Exalted such as Tiger Warrior Training are much less straining to use on them. Forging a bond with such individuals and helping them grow as a person could even see them awaken to the use of Essence as a heroic mortal-and over time, begin cultivating the traits of an ideal candidate for Exaltation. And while always subtle, the more people stand with your cause the more society improves. Bureaucracies are just a bit more efficient that they could’ve otherwise been. Poverty decreases, crime quietly fades and opportunities to improve one’s life spring up overnight.

Angels that can call down meteors that destroy entire continents, magic that can shatter planets like glass, ice cream that never melts! Some of these may be gross exaggerations, but one thing cannot be denied: This is a place of great heroes and villains, even if they’re just silly parodies more than half of the time. That said, you can have the flashiest, galaxy-destroying lightshow on the planet and it won’t actually do squat for damage to anyone or anything unless you work for it. (You’ll probably be a hit at parties, though!) This place works on RPG logic, not ‘real’ logic. Most humans, demons, and even Angels don’t really bother improving their potential past what you’d consider common for most ‘mooks’ in stories, but the exceptions to this rule are powerful indeed, and more than likely match up to the legends you hear. Where do you fit in? Well, that depends. Your true potential from perks and powers from this world depends on one thing: experience. Or, to be more accurate, obscene amounts of level grinding! Every perk and class in here come with a set of powers that all depend on your ‘level’, that is, the amount of skill and training you have, in addition to how many powerful foes you’ve defeated from this point on. You start at Level One – fresh but full of potential, with plenty of room for growth! While your level won’t reflect what you gained before now, things that improve training, learning, and fighting ability can speed up your growth a little for each source of ‘help’ you have, though don’t expect to blaze through levels every five seconds. Early levels involve things you’d see in most ‘low-key’ anime or video games, or what you youngsters call ‘peak human’. And from there, the sky's the limit, but you must work and train hard to hope to match things such as powerful demons or Overlord candidates...or worse, actual Overlords, who may be far beyond you if you don’t dedicate every waking minute to grinding like a madman. Be warned. However you choose to see how power and people work in this world, it goes both ways: Any peak of power you can obtain using these perks can be obtained by others who are dedicated enough. And mark my words: while the common man, Demon, Angel, and Prinny will never come close to you if you work hard enough, you WILL run into main character material that will kick your butt into next week eventually if you get cocky. How your abilities will manifest will depend on your Features​, which we will get to later. For now, let’s look at the basics!",

It’s most often used for the incredibly flashy abilities that people throw around like candy in battle.

Though it’s rare for Humans to be able to use it, choosing that as your Species will give you access to this all the same. You start with a fairly small pool of it, enough to create small bursts of power or strength in your attacks, and the occasional finishing move blast. It will steadily recover with rest or standard RPG item use. As you grow in experience and level, your mana pool will grow a bit larger with you, letting you accomplish greater feats. Exactly what that manifests as is up to you, but note that mana-effects tend to be biased towards flashy, combat-y things, and doesn’t really wander into the world of the conceptual or utility most of the time...with some exceptions.

However, the glory days of the First Age are long gone and the former Lords of Creation are hunted as demonic Anathema, and thus no retinue may be easily available to them. But even this can be overcome. You may train effective armies from the ground up in a staggeringly short amount of time, turning a village into an elite fighting force within a week or two, tops. How effective this is depends on how far you spread your efforts… training a single individual will quickly see them become your equal (though obviously without Charms or any other advantages, unless they already have those or you grant them somehow) in combat and strategy, training a small village will create a disciplined squad that will put the veterans of Lookshy to shame, and training an entire country would create a crude but functional army. Obviously, this can be improved further if you have more time to raise these troops. This can also be applied in training or delegating any sort of organization or group of people - letting you raise ‘troops’ for art galleries or dancing as easily as you could battlefields. In addition to this increase in discipline and competence, they will develop or strengthen a sense of loyalty towards you - those newly blooded generals will lay their lives down for you, and that village will be all too ready to fight for you.",

Most are outright immortal, if not incredibly long lived, and that can often be seen in the sheer breadth of experience most intelligent non-humans possess. But even among immortal beings, you’re a stand out example of a life well learned. You hold very broad knowledge of almost all things in this world. Different magic styles, countless combat techniques, medicine, science, the use of many different weapons and implements, almost any skill that can be named without being unique to an individual or being a special power instead of a skill anyone can learn, as well as having to exist in the time that you take this. While many might consider you a master of these things, you cannot compare to true specialists. While your skill in varying forms of magic is broad and deep, legendary witches like Medea would greatly overshadow you. Your talent for combat with fists and weapons is that of a master to most but only that of a journeyman compared to Achilles or Heracles. If an ordinary master were a ten and these legendary heroes were a hundred with their specialties, you’d be something like a fifty. However, your true blessing lies in your ability to pass on that which you know. You are a teacher of near-supernatural excellence and should you allow others to learn from you, will be the one to create numerous legendary heroes, very much the equal of Chiron himself in this field. Bringing others to your level of skill, even training their abilities and bodies beyond normal human limits, is quite easy even within just a few years, but you also find yourself able to awaken potential in your students that lets them grow beyond what you can teach with ease, especially once they begin to adventure on their own.

Your learning speed, capacity, and intuition expanded by an order of magnitude and quests to find or locate such things equally shortened. But what good is knowledge if you can not exploit it, you now possess the ability to teach anybody almost anything, even if they are incapable of using that knowledge. You could teach a mortal how to wield divine power to create life and they would understand exactly how it works and would be capable of doing as such if they gain the ability to wield said divine power. Whenever you teach people anything, you gain power over them and what they have learned, gaining more power over them the more you teach and the more they wield your knowledge and skills. You could teach someone to be a great fisherman, but make it so they could only catch catfish and these restrictions can be selectively applied as they teach others in a chain of learning. You could teach the world magic and runes and make it so those gifts could never be used against you, or that no matter how skilled and knowledgeable they become they are unable to teach anyone these things, their mind becoming momentarily blank. Even a third party observing you or your students would be unable to learn anything without your permission, even something as simple as making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, however this won't stop them from making a PB&J on their own they just won't be able to recall how you made it if they saw you do it, they literally would not, and could not, associate the name of the sandwich with those ingredients. If the knowledge from you is so intrinsic to a person that it is how they make a living or is what they are known for or is used in everyday life you would have the ability to manipulate their fate similar to the Norns with lesser control based on lesser connection of that knowledge, you could manipulate the fates of an entire kingdom, world or further with this. Students under you will be able to learn what you have to teach faster as if their intelligence, talent, capacity, and learning speed was increased by an order of magnitude. You are a plotter and can easily come up with both direct and indirect ways of obtaining what you want. To your eyes obstacles look like opportunities and challengers like people bearing gifts. Moreover, when seeking something that you cannot obtain or achieve at the moment the steps and measures you must take to accomplish your will naturally fall into place in your mind given a bit of time. But plans are nothing without the will to see them done. You have that will. Your determination is such that you can ignore or power through anything that would seek to stop you, should you choose to do so. From pain to loss to uncertainty to even the greatest social pressure there is nothing that can deter you from your goals but your own judgement. This will even let you break free from unnatural mental influences with effort Haunted Printing Press (Generic Xianxia) (600) Well this is a rather interesting contraption. This ancient screw-press, table and collection of movable type appears to be possessed by the ghost of its creator, a thousand year old inventor who was executed for his “heretical invention”. Now he haunts it eternally, begging for it to be used. Its true use only becomes viable when provided with paper, ink and a manuscript. When these are assembled before the press, the spirit of its inventor will immediately begin working, consuming the manuscript in the process and begin working nonstop to produce as many copies of the manuscript until it has run out of materials. The Printer however is rather particular and will only create scrolls that have the intention of teaching something to the reader. As such, the manuscript must be written by someone who has extensive knowledge on a given topic, and must be of sufficient length to impart this knowledge. Should the manuscript be of sufficient length and detail, the printer will edit it in such a way as to maximize its effectiveness when used for training purposes. Anyone who reads the subsequently printed text will receive the equivalent of two years of dedicated, earnest one-on-one training with the manuscript's author, almost as though reading the book substituted for all of the training and repetition that must have been undertaken in those first two years. The printer is an excellent editor and will keep all of your best material unchanged (thus allowing the reader of any text printed herein to gain the benefit of any teaching perks you yourself might possess). Any student may only gain this benefit from any single book that is written once, but the book may be reread to keep the student sharp. Beware, however, for these benefits apply to ANYONE who reads the book. You could end up handing your enemy the seeds of your own destruction, so use it wisely.",

It is said to take a minimum of ten years in order for even the most prodigious to unlock, and a hundred years to master. Some people don’t have time for that. The Tenshintai is a flat, but elaborate doll that is vaguely the height and shape of a man. This device developed by Urahara Kisuke, is used to potentially attain Bankai within three days. A hopeful shinigami must stab the doll with their Zanpaktou, causing it to forcibly manifest their Zanpaktou’s Spirit, which in itself would ordinarily be a difficult task. This manifestation is able to last for three days, during which the Zanpaktou will rigorously test their wielder in a manner befitting the spirit’s character. Should the wielder pass the test, they will attain Bankai, but should they fail to succeed in three days then the Tenshintai will return back to its original shape as the spirit once again goes dormant. It is advised not to attempt the test twice, as there are “dangerous consequences.” This Tenshintai has expanded functionality beyond Zanpaktou training; allowing for an extreme three day test that can potentially allow the user to awaken other dormant releases or transformations they have the potential for. As with attempts to attain Bankai however, there’s danger to one’s life during the testing period, and potentially lethal consequences to pushing beyond three days of testing.",

As you do so, you’ll find that your Persona will gain new strength, learning new spells and attaining capabilities parameters. Remember that there is always room to grow, and not to become stagnant. Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There (Capstone Boosted - \"You are a slave. Want emancipation?”) What good is being happy if your friends aren’t there with you, growing with you? You find that your close friends benefit from the effects of the baseline perk, though a bit diminished, working through their issues with greater and watching as their Personas (or if they lack one, any personality based supernatural powers, though at a lesser rate) grow, though they must reach their Ultimate Personas on their own. Finally, as you grow in skill and power, you find that they mirror your growth to a degree, as if they were training with you. It’s important to have a proper crew if you want to pull off the heist, after all.",

      "description": "You know what the best thing about being a teacher is? It’s knowing that your knowledge and experience will be passed down, entrusted to the next generation. When you teach someone an ability or technique of yours, you also have a unique way of doing so that will also pass down your own experience and control. All the little techniques, all the tricks and stunts you’ve learned will always be included in what you pass down. This only applies to knowledge that you yourself already have and mastered – any obscure ability or untapped potential you’ve never made use of is invalid for this perk. You can also only teach one person at a time using this perk. As stated before, this perk only works on things your student CAN actually learn in the first place, and will take the same amount of time it would take for them to master the basics. The leap in experience will only occur once they’ve FINISHED mastering the basics, coming as a sudden epiphany where it all finally clicks together. Trying to split your teachings to different students will make this perk’s eventual snowball effect stop before it had a chance to begin.",

After all, anyone can become good at something with enough time and effort, but no one can ever reach true mastery of a skill if they do not already have the inner potential. From now on, this no longer applies to people you take under your wing. Training in anything that should require innate potential to learn, such as Ultimate abilities or some powers in other settings, can now be compensated for with significant amounts of time and effort. Over the course of several years, this power will therefore let you help anyone to achieve their dreams through hard work regardless of genetic influences, such as training a tone-deaf student into the Ultimate Musician, turning someone with abnormally low IQ into the Ultimate Chess Player or even transforming a horribly disfigured person into the Ultimate Charmer.",

      "description": "True greatness comes from helping others, nothing encapsulates this more than the ability to awaken another’s Aura. Anyone can theoretically do it, but it’s incredibly exhausting and a bit of a complicated process. You though, you’ve elevated it to an art style. It’s far less exhausting for you and you could probably do it in your sleep if you wanted. Awakening dozens or hundreds of people a day is easy for you and perhaps one day, with training and effort, you might be able to awaken thousands or more a day. Still, beyond your unusual skill at awakening Aura, you’ve also some kind of ephemeral trait that empowers those you awaken to further heights. Those who you personally awaken will have larger Aura reserves, as well as a greater skill at manipulating their Aura and Semblance. The physical empowerment of their Aura, as well as its defensive abilities, will also be empowered. But the greatest ability you have, beyond all of that, is the ability to “awaken” any other systems you may possess in other people. Cultivation, chakra, magic, psychic powers, whatever. You can’t awaken any specific abilities, just a general system, but that should be just fine as a base, yes? Much like all who possess Aura here, those you awaken are also capable of awakening others. Those who are awakened by those you awakened yourself lack this fiat backing in regard to spreading your gifts any further, but that first generation you uplifted will be able to do so without limit, barring the rather steep energy requirements necessary. You may toggle whether or not other people can spread it. (Notes) You can only pass on broad systems, not specific abilities. Passing on Naruto-verse Chakra is fine, the Sharingan is not.",

You have a grasp on the finer point of the art of passing information on to other people that would be the envy of even the likes of Philoctetes and Chiron, let alone ordinary teachers. Any subject, skill, technique or ability you know, you know how to teach to others several times as fast as normally possible, to the extent that you can cover decades worth of material in months, years at the most. The curious part about this is that this is not limited to things that can conventionally be taught. Even techniques or abilities that require specific biological or magical factors can be taught thus, as you can pass on inferior copies of your own abilities to your students. It takes time for them for these copies to grow into proper abilities and potential, but it happens far more quickly than one would think.",

The gain on their skills is linear - reaching higher levels of mastery does not come with diminishing returns. In addition, they never give up gains in skill that they made. (Notes) These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations. You Do Your Master Proud (Generic Xianxia) (600) Many kinds of power in the world can be shared and taught to others, and most don't require any sort of special gift to be made good use of. Even if they don't have much talent, a person who invests the time and effort into learning something can be passable, then able, and then even excel at it. Even magic and the soul can be trained. You, however, you are something else entirely. You are able to teach any learnable skill you possess, even those that may be supernatural in nature, so long as they can be learned and taught rather than innate. Your students advance in their learning by leaps and bounds in their studies under your personal tutelage, acquiring in months what would take others years to obtain. Your students may as well be legends in the making, such is their progress and the results of their training. By the time they have completed their training, they will be just as competent as you are in these skills and will never forget what you have imparted. Your students do not have to be human to benefit, they just have to be capable of learning.",
