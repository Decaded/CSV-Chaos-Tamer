So go ahead and fight, fight and win, again and again, with the knowledge that people won't have any hard feelings for you after you do, since that's just what you do. People may be upset at the loss, or an injury obtained from it, but it wasn't your fault, right?"

You’ve always been sly with such people, women or men as suits their tastes, and particularly for you are those older than yourself. Despite likely being inexperienced and naive, you have no problems with seducing those that might have decades on yourself. To them, you seem as mature and suave as someone many times your actual age, they just can’t help but find you attractive."

Any time you fight, or just cooperate in general, with your peers and allies you all receive a boost to your respective skills and abilities. Swordsmen become better with swords, able to twist and parry and strike with a fluidity they could never reach on their own, scientists work off of one another to make incredible insights and discovers, and craftsmen collaborate to make works of surpassing quality that they could never have even dreamed of making by themselves. This is a modest but noticeable boost for all individuals involved, but it particularly shines when in use with other Dragon-blooded. In such a case their respective abilities are doubled, and the sheer speed and efficiency of their collaborative works seem as if choreography."

You will be taken completely serious, despite the ridiculousness and length of any names and titles you introduce yourself by, both here and in other worlds.

      "description": "To the Abyssals, the living essence of Creation is effervescent and cloying at the same time, making their skin crawl. Direct sunlight compounds this nauseating discomfort.To overcome these annoyances, most deathknights adopt the trappings of the dead and the Underworld when they venture into Creation. They wear funeral shrouds and adorn themselves with skulls and bones, whether actual articles of bone or skeletal images in their clothing and jewelry. When they travel as heralds for their Deathlords, they hire a train of mourners to follow and wail their misery. They dress all in black or all in white. They sleep in coffins. They wear leather plague masks with cruel beaks and staring crystal eyes. They cool themselves with folding fans made of bone and human skin. Any affectation or adornment that would remind an onlooker of death, the grave, the Great Contagion or the Abyss itself suffices. Such dreadful trappings help an Abyssal to center themselves and align his Essence in a more comfortable way. They do not allow him to respire Essence in Creation, but they do eliminate the annoying discomfort that being in Creation inflicts on him. Of course, adorning themselves with such paraphernalia of death can come across as trying a bit too hard for some deathknights. However, this is unacceptable for the Moonshadow Caste, as they must be the envoys and representatives of the Deathlords and the Neverborn themselves. Accordingly, you have been blessed with a wraithly sense of style and morbid presentation. Knowing exactly how to wear you funereal outfits, you will be a vision in black, looking absolutely amazing when adorned with bone, funerary shroud, and other trappings. But more than owning merely the gothic look, this will also aid you in adopting a properly dark demeanor and yet still be taken serious, and even the elaborate titles of the Abyssal Exalted will be given the trepidation and weight in the minds of onlookers they deserve, no matter how long-winded or pretentious they might be."

The deathknights tend toward the very extremes of appearance. Some are beautiful, some hideous, and all have a supernatural cast to their features. The beautiful might have ghostly white or gleaming ebon faces and long silken hair of shadowy black, liquid red or metallic silver. Those with hideous features might bear unearthly scars that look like weird glyphs, or their features might have rotted away to leave mildewing muscle or exposed bone. Some hideous Abyssals hide their unpleasant features behind the shadows of a cowl, wrap them in long bandages, cover them with tight leather masks or encase themselves permanently in armor. But even amongst the exquisite allure, and horrific hideousness, of the Abyssal Exalted, you stand apart from the others as the finest of examples of these extremes. You might be so beautiful as to shame even the most charming of your fellows and the most elegant courtesans of the Underworld. Or you might be so hideously ravaged and disfigured that even other deathknights step back in fright at your revealed visage, amplifying the impact of your threats and intimidation."

It can be a little daunting for a simple, modest hero! Not to worry, you have a way to practically guarantee your survival...you just need to lose. Badly. When overwhelmed by a superior foe, they are liable to stop short of actually killing you, sparing you and forgetting all about you shortly afterwards. So long as you make no attempt to resume the fight, you’re free to live and let live...assuming that they aren’t after you personally, or that you didn’t already try this on them once before. Throwing this fight doesn’t have to necessarily be genuine or needing you to fight at your fullest - but it must be convincing and appear humiliating to those watching you."

Creatures won’t give you a death curse for killing them, they won’t be able to let loose one last curse with their final breath, no final explosions to destroy the entire continent around you. They just die. Of course, they may come back to life but…if you did it once, you can do it again, eh? At the very least any of that death-linked ‘grow stronger every time I revive’ stuff won’t need to be dealt with. Nasty shock for the bad guy."

The ones to drive men and women both to a madness of pleasure, where they can revel and indulge in the lust and sin that comes from defeat at your hands. Your body has taken on an irresistable form to most others, with charms and features that cloud the minds’ of others on mere sight with intense lust, making even great warrior’s fumble with their blades against you, both the metal one and the other one! Actually putting effort towards attaining someone you desire is simple, as your lustful visage becomes far more intense when you apply your extensive skills in seduction alongside them. And should you get them into your bedroom, or just behind some bush somewhere or out in the open, you can drive quite literally anyone capable of feeling physical pleasure to temporary madness and defeat solely through the thorough, skillful and very enjoyable…application of your body to their body. As long as they don’t physically fight you off, at least. As a useful extension of your lust-infused body, you are also able to create a golden ‘mead’, through apparently unknown processes. This mead is the liquid form of your lust powers and drinking from it can instantly bind those of less than iron-clad wills to your commands, at least for a time."

You could start and maintain a harem of 500 people while easily remembering all of their names and details while ensuring none of them feel neglected. You’ll even remember all of the names and details of their children, grandchildren and great-children."

As a mortal this will take you a long way, especially if you're anywhere with a heavy Dynast presence, and as an Exalt people will be more likely to think you're less of a threat or concern than you are unless you give them explicit reason to think otherwise. Even if they know you're an Exalt they won't think you're any more dangerous than a typical example of your kind unless they have personal experience otherwise. Additionally you will have an instinctual knowledge, if not a specific one, of how to avoid those in authority and those that represent such authorities no matter what land or place you travel to.

Charms become cheaper, skills become more refined, disputes and even hard feelings are suppressed. Over time your bond will deepen, able to finish each other's sentences, divine each other's thoughts, and eventually reaching the point where you don’t even need to speak to each other, as everyone involved has such a deep connection that they have transcended the need for mere speech. If any member of the brotherhood is in danger all of the rest will instantly know of it, and will have a perfect understanding of the members location, relative to their own, that is in danger. If you truly desire to do so, you and your sworn companions may dissolve this bond. You may reform another in the future, however, when and if you desire. Additionally this bond, unlike the one that exists in canon, is not restricted to only the Dragon-blooded."

This process is called crippling of the cultivation base, and anyone who is subjected to this fate is forever doomed to be a mortal for the rest of their lives. Meaning that they shall never again taste the power they once had, and never again taste the closeness to immortality. Not for you, however, as such wounds will always find a way to heal in time, and depending on their severity, you could find yourself back to treading the immortal path once more in several months. Post-Jump, you’ll find that any wounds or injuries that would normally leave you crippled or forever bound to their effects will wash away in time. Extremely powerful effects such as curses from a God may take a lot of time, however."

Might take a couple of decades. Finding the legacy of a supreme expert whose very power makes the hearts of others clench in fear? Might happen at least once a jump, or once per cultivation stage.

If it is your looks expect to have men and women alike fawning over you in public while in private those you've shunned and those with power plot to acquire you for themselves. If it is your movements that catch the eye then expect to steal hearts while fighting, inspire unending jealousy in your rivals, and for those you are killing to occasionally stop and stare while you end their life. With ideals like this you can gather an army while preaching peace without anyone thinking you a hypocrite, after all they just want to protect you. And if you are of a more militaristic bent then you could convince those you've just conquered and enslaved to join you with a smile on their face."

These groups you form invariably consider you their rightful leader and methods to exert influence on the rest of the organisation naturally present themselves to you. Despite this supposedly being a military with a strict hierarchy, you’ll find ways to leverage the people and resource you gain into getting your way with almost anything. Yachiru had secret bases carved out even under Noble houses, a high amount of influence over the Shinigami media and effective free reign over the budget outside of critical military expenditure. You won’t be able to overtake the full group with this alone but it certainly can put you as a politically important figure in a few years."

Commanding them all, from a dozen mighty Captains to the full thousands of lesser soldiers in your army, is a simple matter. Both strategic and tactical matters are clear to you, though you perform best at matching up individuals with their most suitable opponents. As you continue to rule and impress a greater fealty onto your men, you’ll become like a symbol to them. Many will likely be affected by your style of leadership, a strict commander increasing discipline in all his forces and a laidback king cooling heated tempers across the nation.

Stabbed through the throat and left riddled with deep wounds across his body, he was left to bleed out and die, completely defeated. Yet the strongest of sorcerers survived due to two factors: the first was an epiphany on how reverse cursed techniques worked, allowing him to heal his wounds. The other was Toji’s failure to make sure he finished the job, thinking that the lethal wounds he dealt would be enough. You have a similar sort of luck to Gojo; somehow, you have an uncanny knack for surviving scenarios that really should have spelled your end. Your opponents frequently forget to do their due diligence in making sure you’re truly dead, giving you a chance to escape or recover. Even injuries that should be lethal may turn out to have instead just barely missed your vitals, incapacitating but not quite killing you. Though this protection isn’t absolute – an opponent who defeated you once is likely to do a better job confirming their kill the second time around, and some attacks might be too powerful for survival to be a possibility – it’s enough to get out of a sticky situation every once in a while, at least."

The latter option was the method of choice used by Kenjaku during the Shibuya Incident to deal with Satoru Gojo, the greatest threat to his plans. While you’re not totally immune to such effects, with this perk you’ll find that attempts to seal, imprison, or otherwise cause you long-term incapacitation without killing you are much less effective than normal. Weaker attempts to take you down in such manners fail outright, while even stronger attempts are far more temporary than they should be. Perhaps your allies find just the tools or techniques needed to set you free, or maybe the bonds holding you conveniently begin to weaken over time. Whatever the case, you’ll find that even the very strongest of seals can’t hold you for long – it’s never a matter of if you’ll escape, but when."

It is not for nothing that arts like Kalaripayattu trained both men and women in it’s style and the wrath of a mother whose child is in danger is legendary. Your nature is the same now, when those you love are in danger. In those situations, you’ll find that your powers grow greater and greater the worse that danger is, provided you’re close enough to act in their defence at all. It’s a noticeable boost, perhaps even enough to double your normal strength if their lives are at risk, but you can force this further with the sacrifice of parts of yourself. The more valuable the part you permanently burn off, the greater the boost. Some of your blood might only be a brief but notable burst while a limb could result in several times as much strength for hours until every enemy has been beaten down. Something as integral and vital as your very divinity could bring you to the strength of the greatest of gods for a time, as Parvati herself once showed in her rage. The permanent nature of this sacrifice means that you will be unable to heal it on your own and that even others with enough power to match you will find it a far more difficult task, though not impossible. In a less dire method, you can instead heal the wounds and fatigue of other people by letting them partake of your body. These are temporary wounds, such as letting someone supp at your bodily fluids like blood, or a bite of your flesh. Even a few drops of blood would heal most mortal wounds and a slice of flesh could undo even crippling wounds to the entire body and unholy curses. These wounds will never kill you when given for the purpose of this ability, within reason, and slowly heal over a day or two."

You’ve found yourself beloved by the eldritch beings that hail from outside reality, the gribbly things in the cracks of space-time and the monstrous gods that do not exist yet continue to act. This is to the point that lesser such beings and creatures of the mythos often act as loyal and quite cuddly pets to you while the senior ones, such as the Old Ones or other higher beings, usually dote on you as older siblings or parents might, protecting you when they notice you in danger or leaving little helping gifts in your path. Those you specifically anger, while difficult to do so, will ignore this mostly and they, unless you befriend them more, usually do not make extreme efforts for you without reason. Of course, while this affection can bring great boons, it can also bring great danger. The minds of these beings are often strange even in regards to the weak creatures, much less the ancient and unknowable outer beings, so their gifts may seem more like threats or danger, though rarely would it be without a silver lining."

Even when a god is laid low, the common myth is that their return to greatness is prophesised, for good or ill. Your return to greatness is similarly fated, at least in part, for whenever you are diminished, you find yourself eventually returning to power. Should you be weakened, harmed, crippled or even killed, you will find yourself provided with at least one chance to return to your state before the act was done to you. Provided you can take that chance that clearly provides itself to you and are not interrupted. You may be fated to return but that fate can be broken and if such is done, it cannot be used again for the same thing. Should someone re-harm a supernaturally crippled arm of yours before you can use this chance to heal it, this power will not provide another chance for you. This power does however, work on more than just physical injuries. Losing wealth, social positions, material objects or even loved ones can all be affected. While you are in the chain, should you fail to return from death by succesfully grasping the chance presented to you, it will count as a final death unless you possess something else to mitigate death once more."

Not only are they almost never violent with you without serious provocation but they are almost eager to become friends with you and help you out. They can make for powerful allies and unlike most people, are quite helpful with you if you should attempt to navigate their byzantine rules and tricks. One might even say their pranks truly are good natured with you, rather then the sadistic tricks they do to others. Past this fairy love, you have also received a blessing of great luck from the fae race, one that applies in battle alone. This luck blessing is quite powerful, allowing you to defeat foes you should normally struggle greatly against with relative easy for most of the time. It is fickle, a fairy blessing is given by fairies after all, but by relying on your own skills as well, you can find yourself scything through entire ranks of the enemy like a flash."

Already, you’ve been made one of the most dangerous men or women on the seven seas with a blade or gun or both. Firing through a captain’s eye from half a mile away in the middle of a ship battle as a hurricane rages above? You barely had to aim. Ten expert duelists surrounding you from all angles, as you wield naught but a short sword? They’ll be mewling on the ground, clutching fatal wounds in less than a minute! The chaos of battle only benefits you, hardly hindering your awareness of your surroundings and revealing to you all the ways to take advantage. Makeshift weapons leap out to your sight, the crush of crowded bodies limiting only your opponents agility and errant fire from surrounding battles is easy to misdirect into your enemy. Most potent of all, you find yourself moving with greater power, speed and skill the worse the battle is going for your side. The greater you are disavantaged, the more damaging your own returning fire. Both you and the ship you command find this benefit, allowing you to tear your way through overwhelming odds and escape, or even manage to win battles that by all rights you should have died miserably in. A cornered pirate is no different than a cornered rat, they’re just at their nastiest and most violent point."

Either you simply happen to accidentally do what you need to do to survive, dumb luck saves you, a friend, acquaintance, or even a total stranger decides to protect you from yourself, or maybe a higher being decides that enough is enough and intervenes. As long as you don’t deliberately commit suicide yourself, none of your own actions may harm you. A lesser version of this effect even protects you against whatever your enemies might do to you. Their shots seem to miss one after another, they underestimate your strength and pay the price for it, most mooks going after you act like total morons (even more than the usual mooks, really), and if your ship blows up, you’ll be sure to find the only escape pod that won’t be shot down. But while your luck will do its best to save you, if an enemy still finds themselves standing before you after being bombarded by coincidences left and right, and drives their sword into your heart, well, there’s not much it can do. At least not more than one time, that is. Once per jump, should you experience critical existence failure without your explicit consent, circumstances will arrange themselves to revive you at the earliest convenient time. But an enemy who managed to get through your defences one time will most likely manage to do it yet again, unless you change your strategy, and should that happen, not even all the luck in the world will save you."

You don’t have any innate ability to manipulate karma, at least not with just this, but instead have the ability to ensure that when debts are incurred to you, they’re acknowledged not only by your debtors but also the Universe. Whenever your actions benefit another, threads of karma will be formed that denote their debt to you. They will instinctively recognize this and be aware of the need to repay you, and in general make a good faith effort to repay you as best as they can. If they don’t repay you in a timely manner then they’ll find themselves suffering increasingly drastic bouts of bad luck. These spells of bad luck will inevitably benefit you, as well. And even if they don’t, debts owed to you always have metaphysical components that you can draw upon as soon as you learn how."

You have a knack for finding long-lost items of great power and mentors of awe-inspiring might that can let you grow more powerful much more quickly. Techniques and training methods that might as well be cheating will practically fall into your lap. Your enemies will have a hell of a time trying to put you down, any victories they have will be Pyrrhic, and as long as your defeat wasn’t far too crushing, you can bounce back at least somewhat stronger than before. You will never be permanently killed by anything so mundane and pathetic as a mere fall down the stairs or choking on your food. Your plot armor is ridiculous, letting you get away scot-free with stuff that would maim or ruin others. You will always find some way to defeat your enemy and will always find a means of gaining more power, skill, and influence so long as there is someone or something out there that can challenge you. If you are not already, you will even find or get a way to not die of old age, and your life will be easier on you in all ways. This Perk stacks with similar Perks, enhancing the effects."

The bigger those odds, the more confident in yourself you get. This isn’t arrogance or overconfidence. This is an absolute, ever growing self-surety of what you can do and what your friends can do. More than that though, when those odds really start climbing, you find that your strength starts climbing too. It’s never going to scale to match, it’s not a heroic tale if you beat these odds with ease, but the greater the opponent and the disaster you face, in comparison to you, the stronger you’ll become. Find yourself facing a few dozen priests at once? Your body seems to miraculously restore its stamina at the start of the fight and you can push yourself just a little harder. A Bishop standing in your way? Your body will feel stronger than it should possibly be and you’ll find wells of energy you didn’t think you had. And if Zeus himself, or another High God, descended to stomp you into the ground? You’d be able to pull out every single bit of power and effort you had at least twice over to try and give yourself a chance. There is a limit to this however. You can only withstand so much of this boost, even against the great odds you might face, and if you try to draw too much power from you, you might irrevocably damage your body or spirit. What’s the point of beating the bad guy if you die in the process and never get to see your happy end? Boosted: So you beat the bad guy. Triumphed against all odds. But what was the point if that desperate battle if what you were fighting for was lost? You'll find that now, things have an odd way of working out if you won the climactic fight. Collateral damage was not nearly as bad as it may have appeared, reconstruction efforts go ahead smoothly and easily. Unless they were directly killed in the fight, your loved ones would never be hurt. Even when it really should not be possible, it seems like things lead strongly towards a happy end for you with even the slightest chance of happening, so long as you managed to actually win. Boost Requires Reincarnation(High God) to Activate"

You find that people around you tend to practically fall over themselves to grant you artefacts, powers and abilities, be they superpowers or letting you summon their servants as your servants, or something in between. This happens most often with beings of great power and age, demons and demon gods, spirits and plain gods, but affects just about everyone. They never seem to care what other powers you have, even if they come from their enemies. Nor do they have much restraint in handing out the good stuff, making you among the most powerful ever empowered by them at a minimum. They do this most often through letting you share their bloodlines, or souls, or something in that vein, granting you power that won’t fade with time but instead only likely improves, though the latter is far from automatically assured. The bloodlines and powers you recieve in this way never harm you in any way, shape or form, and they always play well with each other, even if it makes no sense."

Experienced generals, old shinobi who could kill whole armies by themselves, princesses who are just perfect to sort out any political troubles you might have... all are drawn to you like moths to a flame, only with a better outcome, hopefully, for the moths. Not only do they follow you, but all of you bond to each other to ridiculous degrees, letting you work together with legendary synergy, almost reading each other’s thoughts, moving as one on the field of battle. This also lets you work together when it comes to training, letting each of you advance almost an order of magnitude faster in any field when teaching each other, and in general letting you improve ridiculously quickly via spars or joint training. You automatically encounter many people who this works on, but any companions or followers are included in all of this by default."

Should you ever truly reach your final death that ends your chain or your journey after that, from which you can’t return, you’ll be given one last reward as part of your Roman heritage. It’ll allow you to ascend as a special Divine Spirit capable of watching over and guiding any empire that you have built across all of your time, eternally acting as a honored ancestor to your people in their times of need."

Yours is the soul of a gallant hero, a mien of such intensity that all who see you are forced to acknowledge that you are someone important in this world. Whatever impression you leave on people, whatever effects you have, they are magnified enormously. What might be a normal rivalry between young men could develop into a tale remembered in legends for millennia to come, a god who might feel respect for your humility in obeying his wishes normally would feel himself so filled with shame for taking advantage of you that he would force himself to grant his finest weapon in recompense. A stature as what you have, as a hero or an antagonist, is certain to gather many allies around you. When a few words of friendship and a battle at each others side is enough to become life long friends, you are sure to become an icon to those around you. Indeed, your very nature is that of one to whom friendship results in far greater results than normal. That which you receive from your dear friends willingly becomes vastly greater in scope. Fighting alongside your brothers in arms would see you defeat foes thrice your might in normally impossible battles. A weapon received from a dying friend would ignite with a hundred times it’s normal shine, bolstered to incredible levels by the bonds you share. If you found yourself fighting the heavens themselves, with only the gifted power of two gods that have declared themselves your friends, you might yet succeed. For what could even an entire pantheon hope to achieve against the power of friendship?"

It would not be wrong to say that you were born to be loved by everyone. As you grew up, you found that life naturally guided you to success. You were born with the quality of being the protagonist of the story, not just your own tale but the story of the world around you. Your incredible fortune heaps blessings on you at every opportunity, ensuring that you are never lacking except in the most extreme of cases. One born a pauper would find himself part of the richest, noblest and most mighty family in the kingdom before he reached maturity. At times, you will find things gifted to you as soon as the thought crosses your mind that you have need or desire of them. Perhaps the gods themselves watch over you, eager to shower you in gifts, manifesting food before you when you feel hunger or magical tools in your hands when you seek to engage in a task. Your luck might not accomplish everything on it’s own but just that fortune would render you enormously gifted and capable, something only further added to if you have other gifts already. But in some ways, your fortune is also cruel. There can only be one hero, one to whom all the fortune is awarded, and he must have his villains to conquer. The antagonists of your destined story are heaped with as many misfortunes as you are blessings. Curses and poor luck rain on your enemies heads, even those who would only be minor obstacles to you find themselves blocked at every path. The famous story of Karna’s efforts against the perfect Arjuna are an ideal example, the charitable Karna cursed and sapped of strength and stripped of his finest tools and betrayed by his most loyal aides. Those who are truly great can ascend beyond this bad luck and challenge or even defeat you in spite of it all, despite the wailing of the heavens above at them daring to stand in the way of the chosen hero. But all too often, you’ll do as everyone expects. Prove victorious as the hero of the story must, even if that hero might sometimes feel doubts about how much his own efforts matter when fate favours him so much."

      "description": "Divine is your presence when you ride out onto the battlefield, in how your soldiers see your shining aura and how your foes crumble before your wrath. With sword and spear few but the gods themselves can match your skill, even wielding eight of your favoured weapons at once becomes somehow a deadly style. Even more such when you split your being into eight clones, each as capable as the original and sharing your mind and presence between them. Fight and command in eight places at once or force your hated enemies to duel one on eight. Your skill and numerous bodies are backed by enough raw power to contend with most of the heroes and monsters that walk these lands. Most men believe that your powers are granted by the gods of war, some that you are yourself such a being, and they’re not far from the truth. You have a measure of divinity already, which grows as your feats in battle and war do. Winning impossible sieges, conquering great empires and slaying famous swordsmen in duels will all improve your divine power. Your physical strength mainly at first but should it grow great enough, you may find yourself turning into a true divine spirit of war as a result, with all the abilities natural to such things. The advancement of the modern age won’t prove a threat either, as firearms find reality itself warping their arcs away from you. Even a bullet guided by magic would curve it’s trajectory away from your body, so long as you can keep clear in your mind the idea that mere bullets could never hit or stop you. Slipping in this surety can reduce the protection, making it possible for enough massed fire to still hit you. Finally, that divine nature has a intense effect on those that fight with you. When you personally fight alongside allies or loyal servants, you’ll inspire an intense, eventually fanatical, devotion to your ideals. A few battles side by side and most men would die to protect your honour. Something of the opposite applies to your enemies, awakening intense terror in those that defy you, growing the longer they directly challenge you while in your presence. It would be difficult to not end a campaign with an army of men who truly believe that you are their Goddess of War."

Luck takes a special form for the heroes like these, not solving issues for you but providing to you the tools that let you solve things yourself. At least, most of the time. Your great amount of fortune focuses on this, ensuring that enemies accidentally leave behind their magical blades for you to use, friends loan you just the obscure trinket you need before you go on an adventure that reveals a desperate need for it or you ‘accidentally’ seduce a village girl who turns out to be a noblewoman that can get you out of trouble later, should you prove your affections again in the jail cell you’ve been held in. The greater the danger, the greater the benefit your luck will bring to you, though these uses must remain in the realm of what could be possible, and even in truly dire situations, where just an added tool or ally might not help, your luck can even temporarily bend what is possible. A sword strike might suddenly skip your neck instead of cutting it off, an ally moves faster than should be possible or you seem to have just enough energy for one last attack even after you already did your one last attack. These sudden surges of fortune are a staple of heroes when pushed to the edge but appear infrequently, no more than a handful of times each adventure. A hero relies on themselves after all, the luck is just an added bonus to smooth the edges over."

And you just happen to be great at forming symbiotic relationships with just about anything. Whenever you give anything to or do anything for anyone else they tend to reciprocate in kind and do so willingly. What they give/do back depends on how they value what you did for them and what they value what they are doing/giving back in turn. So something insignificant to you but massively significant to them could still get them to give what they consider significant back. The opposite holds true as well, if they consider it insignificant, it doesn't matter how important it was to you. You cannot use this to demand anything specific in return, it only works by giving freely. The recipient also has no specific time table to repay you, they will do so as is appropriate to their situation. And by giving without concern for whatever they will give back you will find yourself quickly endeared to whoever you give to, especially if they consider whatever you gave them significant. This also guarantees that where you go, there will be an Earth Spirit to give tribute to, the strength of the Spirit will depend on the place you go to, so no guarantees that it will have the potential of a Spirit like Tianlan, but you will always be able to improve an area by working with it.

You may grant this protection with a touch and at no cost, and it lasts until you revoke it which may be done at will regardless of where they are in relation to you. In Creation Fate is a powerful thing and you are perhaps the only being that is not subject to it, and can not be made subject to it, in any shape or form. In future jumps this works on similar abilities. As a side benefit individuals that use such abilities will not realize you possess this protection, their predictions and visions seeming to be accurate but, in truth, failing to account for you. Additionally so long as you're striving towards greatness you will find that matters smooth themselves out for you. You will not be hindered by petty regulations and bureaucrats, search teams and hunters will miraculously skip past you or arrive just after you have left, and events will occur in such a fashion that you rarely if ever suffer from major setbacks. Be warned however, while your Fate is in your hands you must truly strive for greatness if you wish to really benefit from this. Living a life of mundanity will not accord you any benefits at all beyond protection from the manipulations of destiny that your enemies might use to find you. Finally you may use this ability to, once per jump, avoid death. Any time you would otherwise be killed this ability will activate and prevent you from dying. Your various pools of energy will be refilled, you'll be restored to full health, and any mind altering or compulsion effects you labored under will be broken. This is a perfect conceptual effect. Post-Chain this is once every ten years"

      "description": "Though your Exaltation is mighty indeed, there is a part of it that sorely lacks in comparison to its progenitor. The Unconquered Sun was created to represent perfection in all its forms, including the four virtues of Valor, Temperance, Compassion, and Conviction. As the First Age all too handily demonstrated, these virtues were either in great excess without their original meanings, or simply lacking in them where it counted most. But your Exaltation is very close to its origin, and it breathes new life into both your body and your heart. Your emotions and the virtues you hold dearest to your heart will burn with bright intensity, never losing their vibrancy to the woes of time or the stresses of adventure, yet it will also allow you to exercise wisdom and view the world objectively without being blinded or controlled by your own passions. Your Compassion may make you weep for every innocent life lost, but it will not blind or cripple you with angst or foolishness. Your Valor may bring you stand fearlessly against overwhelming odds, but you will not need to make a suicidal last stand in an impossible battle. This also applies to other aspects of life you consider your ‘virtues’, not being limited to the four of this world. In short, you may invoke or suppress these virtues with no detriment to yourself at will, from awe-inspiring levels or a simple ‘mortal’ level. Finally, this strength of will is absolute, allowing you to casually brush away any attempt to manipulate you emotionally or mentally, whether through mind control or coercion, always able to think clearly and decisively when the moment calls for it. The only thing that will ever sway you is what you choose to allow. You will, now and forever, shine as bright as daybreak."

But it was, and Creation was forever changed by it. Embodying that power to surpass overwhelming odds, your martial prowess is now defined by overcoming superior foes. When fighting a foe with a distinct advantage against you - power, size, scale, or even the amount of soldiers in an army - those advantages become mitigated or even manageable, letting you fight them on more even ground. An enemy who could slay you with a wave of their hand will find it difficult to actually focus their will upon you, a giant finds their size a hindrance instead of a help, while a gigantic army is no more difficult to overcome than a well-armed squad. Be warned that lacking the means to actually fight such enemies - an army of your own, Charms, or such - will merely give you the means to survive or stall the bout. However, should you possess both the means and the will - even the mightiest of legions will falter against you."

Those of exceptional power and will may resist or even completely ignore you, as long as you are not obviously greater. Even those mighty beings are somewhat affected though, granting you a measure of leniency and respect they may never grant to any but their own peers. In doing so, you may even question their will and ignore the commands of those great demons of the Third Circle, Unquestionable as they otherwise might be. Most unique of all... you could even approach the Yozi themselves, when they take humaniform, to engage in courteous conversation with those the inhabitants consider above all. And while you might not be able command them, you will find it easy to speak to all those who consider themselves Unquestionable and above all others. As a true favorite of the Demon Princes, you will find yourself the peer and perhaps quickly a trusted advisor of the highest ranks of demons and even their progenitors. Should you play your cards right, you might even be able to take the Shadow’s place as the mastermind of the Reclamation."

So, why not become the very thing they fear? You may now be the Anathema amongst the Chosen, embodying the ideal of a horrifying being of dark power far beyond the Princes of the Earth. Aside from a tremendous increase in physical attributes beyond that of even other Chosen, this brings some other benefits. You shall grow in power with every victory, bolstering your strength and skills.

Every aspect of your being shall be enhanced, and word will spread across the lands of your terrible deeds. The mighty of Creation will hate and fear you, or tremble in fear of this unknown yet atrocious enemy. But in hell, you shall become the star of the Reclamation, the envy (and sometimes hero) of your so-called peers, and demonkind shall either worship you or rage at your meteoric rise in status and power. Yet, hell is a ruthless place and this greatness has a price... For should the unthinkable happen and you suffer a defeat, this bolstering effect shall be broken and you will be reduced to your base ability until once again you may taste victory. If word spreads of such a thing, it could even damage your reputation as an unstoppable force of ruin and corruption.

Moreover, you will find that insane ghosts and spectres will heed your words, your terrible connection to their ultimate masters evident through their madness, and that maddened death cults will treat you with equally fervent respect and devotion. Perhaps more usefully, you may speak in the tongues of the Neverborn themselves, echoing the Whispers of Oblivion with your own voice to drive both ghosts and mortals to insanity and bless them with the attention of your chthonic masters.

You are one gifted the fate of becoming the most brilliant light against the forces of darkness, for you have found yourself in the role of the greatest of the Ashavan as ‘everyone’s hero’. Yours is a destiny of greatness, one that collects all the hopes, dreams and prayers for a brighter future around you, and uses them to shape the path to the most magnificent epilogue. The more heroic acts you perform, the greater feats in battle you partake, the more this image of you as the greatest hero that ever was extends like wildfire, covering nations, even entire planets in mere weeks, growing faster and faster in what seems to be an endless momentum. And the more people join this collective ‘prayer’, the greater your power becomes, making you a living ‘miracle’. The unreachable Arch-Demons become just difficult threats, and even the dream of an ending to the eternal conflict of black and white seems like an actual possibility. But this is far from your most potent ability. As the hero, it wouldn’t do if your victories were to go unrewarded. And what better place to start amassing your power than from your defeated foes? Each time you claim ‘victory’ over another, you take something special from them, and incorporate it into yourself. Be warned that this ability doesn’t make distinctions between foe and ally, as anyone that is ‘defeated’ by you gets something taken from them. It may be a special item, a power, a commandment or even things such as emotions, loyalties or a cosmic ‘role’. Furthermore, it doesn’t even require that you defeat someone in a physical confrontation. As long as you prove your irrefutable victory over them, you will still take something from them. The more shaking and absolute your defeat is over your enemy, the more from their own core you can take. With time, even having the thought of admitting defeat before you will be enough for you to strip them of everything that makes them. Now, once you have claimed your victory, these stolen abilities don’t stay as they were, and instead they are changed to suit your nature. You have little to no control over the result, but you can be sure that whatever you gain won’t be saddled with any weaknesses that it previously had, and at times you may find them even increasing in potency. As it is your right as the victor, you only take the good portions and leave the rest to your defeated foe. Using this privilege, you could take Commandments from others, without needing to abide by their vows, nor suffering any consequences of breaking the original restriction."

You can choose any Manse you want from the Core books or official supplement books for Exalted that you have paid the appropriate cost for. Of note is that while you can have more than one Manse only ones you purchase here will follow you between jumps, inserting themselves flawlessly into new worlds (or as an addition to your Warehouse, your choice either or). Additionally you will need at least one open hearthstone socket for every hearthstone you have if you want to make use of them. Manse's can range from the size of a small forest clearing to the size of a reasonably large nobles estate (call it 100 acres), you choose what size yours is, the more expensive the Manse you bought the bigger it can be."

This old gateway appears on a property that you own or standing alone near your starting location, activating at your command and creating a portal to an alternate dimension fitting to your training purposes. The gateway links to a dimension that provides a properly powerful foe for you, no matter how strong or strange you are, and often that foe will have specific abilities that encourage growth in you along certain lines. If you wish to train your regeneration, perhaps the gateway will lead you to a monster that attacks at great speed and leaves a large number of small wounds that build over time. Training your strength and you’ll find yourself pitted against a towering behemoth of stone and steel. Only one gateway can be held at a time and the dimensions you go to hold little beyond the creature and the environment around them."

While most of the Bulwark is taken up by defences, barracks for demonic armies, and training grounds, there are still luxurious rooms set aside for the owner of the Manse and their guests. More importantly perhaps, the center of the courtyard has been inlaid with circles of vitriol-etched brass to form powerful host-binding circles in a sunburst motif. With these, you may call forth many demons at once to serve in your hellish legions or even summon Second Circle Demons during any normal night instead of only during the new moon. Using the hearthstone it provides as a focus, you may even summon the Bulwark into Creation or other worlds on the night of the new moon, as the brass circle expand outward from you and the fortress walls will raise themselves in a new world to invade. Regrettably, this summoning shall only work once every decade. As a final measure, should this fortress ever be in danger of being taken by others... you, and you alone, may start a self-destruct sequence which will cause the manse to build up roiling essence and detonate in a brilliant explosion of green fire and radiant destruction that annihilates everything within five miles. It shall reappear a year and a day after this, having returned to attach to your warehouse with its demons reformed."

In this way, the layout of the manse keeps changing. Opening a particular door at different times can lead to different rooms, staircases going up can open onto lower floors should you tarry too long. Sparse furniture and decorations of desert creatures of silver-metal wood and Cecelyne glass are likewise moved by the shifting sands, never straying while being watched, yet also never remaining when observers glance away. Despite its mercurial nature, the Monastery itself will attempt to form itself in pleasing ways, forming shortcuts to where you wish to go, lengthening the path of intruders, and deliberately moving the nicest decorations into the room whenever you wish to impress visitors. Though it has only rudimentary intelligence, it will comply with any requests you ask of it. Perhaps far more impressive is the consecrated nature of this manse as a temple to the Yozi without compare. For within its sand walls and the holy grounds up to five miles away from it, prayer to the Yozi will be greatly enhanced, the acts of Yozi priests will be aided, and servants of enemy powers like the Gods and the Chosen of Creation will not respire any essence. They are unlikely to notice this inability to regain their essence though, for while within range of the Monastery they shall be continually assaulted by flensing desert winds. These winds could slay a mortal within minutes, and similarly flays the wills of those enemies who do choose to stay, compelling they to leave as their will is eroded. Finally, the manse may also sense anything within its holy grounds, whether spirit or material, and may communicate the locations and shape of anything within five miles of the structure by forming elaborate down-scaled replicas of its surroundings out of its sands. Once every decade, the Monasteries’ hearthstone may be planted on top of a sandy area of sufficient size, upon which the sands will turn as silver as Cecelyne and the manse will slowly form itself there whilst disappearing from its previous location."

It resonates with the minds of those within, sensing the thoughts of sentient beings and unsubtly overpowering their wills. It may be commanded to search visitor’s thoughts right down to memories and report its findings to you by whispering in your mind with a demure, crystalline voice. Likewise, it may control sentients within its walls, directing the activities of any thinking creature not attuned to it. Though this can be resisted with a supernaturally strong will or shaken off for a single moment with an act of will, most beings are made into simple tools for it to use as you command it the limited intelligence contained in these shining walls. Furthermore, the throne room in the central tower has been inset with a pattern of emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds to channel the manse’s Essence into sorcerous power. Any spell cast within its wide halls requires much less essence to fuel itself and its effects will be enhanced to greater heights than could be touched outside. If you should desire this palace to be set somewhere else, you may shine upon its hearthstone the light of your anima. Once every decade, it will act as a prism that scatters rainbow light everywhere around to eventually coalesce into crystals walls of white light in a brilliant display of beauty."

It gives no sensory impression, with the sole exception of touch and even the land where it should be seems normal to observers. Even battles fought within aren’t obvious, though geomancers and other sensitive to the flow of essence may notice its presence. Even then, complicated geomancy and disguising of signs make it hard for anyone to decipher the manse’s aspect or figure out anything at all about it. Even fate itself finds it difficult to detect the building, as it is disguised from the eyes of heaven, and brought outside fate. Entering it rarely makes it easier, for the spiraling corridors, shadowy illumination, and winding stairs found throughout the build make it easy to get lost in the essence-blurred maze that is its interior. Traps, both benign and dangerous, are around nearly every corner, and the shadowy flows of essence within make it hard to eavesdrop on other people and every hamper scrying and other forms of distant perception. Even the anima light of the Exalted would not help, for the fundamental property of active essence to has been carefully removed from the reality within these walls. Only the spare lighting provided by the mansion itself, or mundane torches may light the way of visitors. Those aware of the building’s trick, on the other hand, can use the many secret passages and hidden corridors within to subtly get around, quickly bypass much of the manse’s dangers, or even use a hidden escape tunnel to escape should that be necessary. And thus this Residence is the perfect hiding spot, a refuge for those of shadowy persuasion. Should you require this dwelling at other places, you may hurl its hearthstone into a shadow cast on a suitably open spot, once every decade. With your next step forward, you may then pass the threshold of your Residence, to find your hearthstone deep within."

The front of it burst with steam like a locomotive, as the interior of the building is filled with titanic machinery and gears that may or may not be required for its movement. It avoid the destruction of those things in its path by distorting space to shunt away all that would be in its path. Ground, water and air part before it and flow around it like a stream washing around a stone, carrying buildings, trees and players characters along for the ride. Unbroken barriers warp like taffy to accommodate the manse’s movement, and after it has passed, the warped space will return to their previous locations and shapes. The titanic engine in the front is stoked by a mighty demon of the Second Circle descended from the Black Boar, while it cannot leave the manse, it may help you as best as it can... Which includes showing you to work the central controls built into this mighty engine. Should you be willing to brave the grinding gears and steaming heat, you will find geomantic controls to steer the demesne the moving fortress rides on. With these, you may roughly pilot the manse itself towards your desired direction, for as long as you stay at the helm at least. You may even disable the warping of space the manse uses the leave obstacles in its path intact, but beware that you do not hit something that cannot be uprooted or torn apart by the armored and nigh-indestructible train of doom you have been giving. For if that happens, the Fortress would catch on it and halt, being dislodged from the demesne and turning it into a static structure without the magical power it had as a moving manse. Nevertheless, you may summon this manse again every decade by simply holding the hearthstone up in the air, and commanding it to appear with an iron will.

Skilled at getting the drop on even the most seasoned warriors, you excel at destroying trust between allies by pressing the right buttons and exploiting vulnerabilities. Moreover, your proficiency in executing sneak attacks has made them more effective than frontal assaults, allowing you to strike swiftly and decisively without warning."

Those that still refuse your calm smile and moderate disapproval come face to face with the other side you have, the one with a murderous intent far beyond your normal means. When desiring to do such, you can emit killing intent that would normally be seen in someone much more powerful than you. Powered by sheer thirst for blood, even at the level of a Vice Captain, it will cause feelings of deep terror in experienced warriors. A Captain class user might force horrific hallucinations to those subjected to her intent and it’ll only go up from there.

      "description": "One of the most interesting concepts in jujutsu is that of binding vows. By intentionally putting oneself in a disadvantageous situation, such as by imposing extra restrictions upon the usage of a cursed technique, a sorcerer can gain power proportional to the extra risk they took on. One of the most common variants of this is the increase in power sorcerers get by disclosing how their technique works to their opponents, since giving up such information discards an advantage they might otherwise possess. As a fundamental part of jujutsu, any sorcerer is capable of making such a binding vow by default. With this perk, however, you are able to apply this concept to any of your other powers. By voluntarily explaining how one of your powers works to your foes, that power will become noticeably more effective against them. Fires will burn hotter, energy blasts fly faster and hit harder, and so on. With clever wording, you can even use this to mislead your opponents on how your ability functions while still gaining the power boost, such as through lying by omission. Naturally, if those you’re up against already know how the ability you’re using functions, you won’t gain any power by telling them how it works. You’re also capable of applying other restrictions to yourself and your powers. Perhaps you limit yourself to a certain level of output for part of the day, increasing your power proportionally for the rest of it. Or perhaps you drastically increase your speed by significantly reducing your durability. However these self-imposed vows work, the power you gain will always be directly proportional to the risk you take on. Be aware, though, that placing or removing such a restriction upon yourself takes a fair amount of time and focus, preventing you from changing them on the fly during combat. Removing a restriction also removes any power gained from it."

The longer you can retain the advantage, the longer you can stay on the attack and keep the initiative, the easier it becomes for you to continue as such. In both combat and argument it becomes harder and harder for the enemy to fight back the longer you manage to keep hammering them, be it with your fists or your words. Mind you, at some point they might just get frustrated enough to do something crazy to get rid of you, so there’s that. This works on a longer, more permanent basis too, since the more often you seize the initiative and win conflicts this way, the better you become at doing so in the future, at rates of improvement that are well and truly supernatural.

You may infuse your attacks with the all-consuming void, making it so that whatever you slay can never be brought back. Things wounded or broken by you can never be healed or mended. If you snapped a sword in half, not even a master artisan could put the sword back together from its pieces, for it is forever broken, it’s wholeness consigned to the Void.

Metiron, a Yellow Zone adventurer, struggled to control it even with the use of the Mana Jade(Note: A lower tiered mana engine). Its attacks surpass the Rank 3 Solo Number skill, Elemental Outfit."

The skill forcibly squeezes out the mana of the user and causes one's body to forcefully twist and break. When the nine Mana dragons of different colors collect on the tip of the weapon, it forms a tiny black sphere that shoots out at the speed of light to pierce the enemy. This tiny black sphere leaves behind damage tens of meters wide. At 0% mastery, the sphere is the size of a marble. As the mastery of the skill increases, the size of the sphere increases and the body experiences less strain. The dragons appear thicker and deeper in color as the user becomes stronger"

As is natural for this, both sides immediately went to war with each other, unwilling to allow who they saw as invaders to live in their world. To make a long story short, Mother Nuwa broke through to an entirely new level of power at the apex of the war, and then proceeded to chase the survivors of the Seamless Chaosworld into the Primordial Chaos. However, the battle thoroughly ruined and shattered both Chaosworlds , causing them to be reshaped into the Three Realms of the present by the victors of what was from then on known as the Endwar. The most important fact, however, is that during this recreation, the Seamless Chaosworld was used as the stable pillar upon which the Three Realms would be built. Due to this, the Heavenly Dao of the Demonheart from the Seamless Chaosworld remains slumbering, not yet wholly gone. Like another certain someone, you’ve gained insight into this Dao, and with it you can manipulate the hearts of mortals and Cultivators alike. With only minimal insight into it, you could easily cause wars among mortals and twist weaker cultivators to fully subordinate themselves to you. With full mastery, causing a war that engulfs a whole Chaosworld and making the closest of friends split apart to join different causes would be child’s play. To reach this level is still a long ways away however."

Until they die, or stop being enemies, their strength shall never grow from when you fought them. Keep in mind, this has to be a fight.

Immortal monsters suddenly feel that they have trouble closing their wounds when you produce them, supposedly undodgeable attacks that twist space become something that you can move around, and even abilities designed to track you have a hard time pinpointing your location. The major downside from this ability, besides not being able to use any powers while it is active, it’s that it is only at its maximum strength when you are dueling someone. In group battles, the effectiveness of this will be severely reduced, to the point that your foes will notice that their powers aren’t working correctly, but they won’t be completely gone. Hope you have something to compensate for that. And don’t try to take on things that are too far beyond your scale with just this, a mortal man wouldn’t do well against a black hole."

And now, having seen such a thing up close at some point in your life, your body has internalized it in those beautiful eyes of yours. You are able to perceive ‘death’ itself on living beings and physical objects, appearing as thin red lines. When You touch or cut along these lines, the object or being in question is immediately cut deeply regardless of their durability, and attempts at healing or regeneration are greatly stunted -perhaps even made impossible for some beings, though the lines are thinner and more difficult to target the tougher a target is. At first, these lines are all you can perceive and influence, but after some time passes they will become clearer to your eyes and you will eventually see circular ‘points’ on their body that the lines all trace back to. Cutting or stabbing this point of death directly will immediately kill the target in question - no form of reincarnation, resurrection, or regeneration will save them from the bitter taste of death. This is what it means to kill something. With time and continued use, you may eventually be able to understand and perceive the concept of death in less tangible things, such as the spells of Magecraft or the empty space between you and an object, though the same general rules apply- and some things can only be ‘cut’, not ‘killed’, for they have no point of death. However, perceiving how fragile the world and existence as a whole really is...that’s something no human mind can truly bear witnessing. When your eyes are active, the perception of death trains the mind and can eventually cause a human brain to suffer a fatal aneurysm from continued use, and can also damage one’s sanity as they are constantly made to understand the concept of death all around them. Even to an inhuman mind that can sustain the physical damage and the sanity-straining view of entropy, they are tiring to use in the long-term without preparation or precautions. Secondly, the ‘points’ of death may never appear for certain beings- beings that were never ‘born’ or are free of the concept of death entirely, such as a True Ancestor at the peak of their power during the night of a full moon - you would have to remove the source of their immortality or introduce them to the possibility of mortality in a different way, which is beyond the scope of using these alone. The strain also increases the longer you perceive the death of things beyond living beings or physical objects, which can do great damage to your mind if you’re unprepared for it."

Maybe there just happens to be a rope to let you swing across the ballroom dramatically as you make off with the nobles treasure, or maybe there's just the right amount of handholds and footholds on two opposing walls, at just the right distance from each other, that would allow you to dramatically wall jump your way up. So long as you strive to do things in an amazing and/or over the top fashion you will be slightly rewarded for doing so, Fate conspiring to make you that little bit better at whatever you're doing because apparently Fate is really fond of over-the-top action sequences. You can still fail when you're doing over the top stuff though, so don't get too out of hand, this just represents a slight-to-moderate increase when you're purposely trying to be amazing."

You may choose any breathing style you like for any level or you can create your own on the same level as described, they don’t need to be for swords either, and note that all the higher levels can be reached by training. Post-jump you don’t need to breathe in order to use them if you do not require air to survive. Kanoe: Lower on the totem pole for demon slayers, around the same level as Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke during the fight with the Spider family. Your physical abilities and skills are on par with average or slightly above demons, and your stamina is increased to be able to fight for multiple hours straight without being totally exhausted. Tsuguko: Now your proficiency is much higher, not only are you naturally stronger in all respects, but you have mastered Total Concentration: Constant! The difference between using the breathing technique constantly, every second of every day, even when asleep, and not is like night and day. Your physical abilities are many times greater than they would be otherwise, granting stamina that could let you train for days on end and increased lung capacity. This also comes with greater refinement of your technique to the point where, as the name suggests, you could be the apprentice or successor of a Hashira, and maybe you are. Hashira: The highest position of a demon slayer, usually gained by killing at least 50 demons or killing one of the 12 moons as a kinoe(the highest normal rank of demon slayers). You have reached the pinnacle of what a normal human is capable of with your breathing style, able to easily cut through scores of demons easily and take out the lower ranked moons without much effort. Your body is much stronger than the previous option, so much so you could be faster than the eye could see, and you may have even developed techniques of your own that no one else knows, but the most notable change is in your stamina, being able to go through extremely harsh training for weeks or even months straight."

For 100 CP these tablets can be any canonical Profound art not connected to the divine realm, but some of the absolute best stuff possible within this constraint, easily a peer with the finest arts practiced by the geniuses of the greatest sects and Sacred Grounds. If not a canonical art, you can design one for yourself, within these constraints. For 300 CP, the art can be any and all that exist in this setting, from the arts of the highest King Realms to the Legendary Beast arts like the Word Ode of the Phoenix or the Golden Crow’s Record of the Burning World. Again, you may design your own if you want, so long as the power levels correspond. Everyone gets one purchase of the 100 tier tablets for free. In addition, those who have bought a bloodline receive the related profound art for free."

Alternatively you could shift your internal organs out of the way of lethal strikes. The magician Harry Houdini was notable in using this technique to prevent internal bleeding. Furthermore, the effects of your particular brand of ki may be greatly enhanced, increasing the benefits of Sei or Dou Ki as needed."

Whatever weapon you specialize in, be it a sword, a spear or a even your own bare hands, you have honed your style to inhuman levels of perfection. Your technique leaves no room for mistakes, every movement has been refined to utmost excellency to the point no effort is wasted, and every attack can be delivered to its intended target, usually your opponent's vitals, with a surgical precision. Your specialization in this style does not mean that you are inflexible or easy to read. Your style is so all-encompassing that it can adapt to almost every enemy, breaking through any of their defensive techniques and delivering devastating counter-attacks, while standing like an iron fortress against anyone trying to find the smallest gasp or chance to catch a break from your onslaught. With this style in your hands, you are a deadly fighter indeed. So much so that even when you are far behind in strength or even speed before a much superior rival, you can still manage to overpower them merely by using your superior skill in combat, easily delivering a humiliating defeat to those that would otherwise make a short work of you. Only someone on a near divine level of technique like yourself, or with abilities a few leagues beyond your scope can match or surpass you in a duel."

Perhaps the most useful skills are those in relation to the work of an assassin, both lethal and nonlethal methods to neutralise foes without being seen. You’re an expert at striking exact points and vulnerabilities to take out powerful foes, well trained in varying arts of assassination.

A great many of the known techniques are ones that emit Kei from their Katana. You have even taken a step further and can use these techniques with other weapons or even your bare fists. As a wielder of Psyharden techniques your Kei has reached the limit of how dense and pure it can become, and can easily use energy techniques and martial arts with any weapons you wield."

The Kaio-Ken allows the user to multiply their overall power at the cost of straining their body. The Spirit Bomb on the other hand is an attack that gathers energy from the surrounding area and any living beings. Both of these attacks are designed to fight enemies far beyond the user’s level. Purchasing this perk will make you a master of each of these techniques."

Here worthy students are accepted into an academy to learn the infernal martial arts and various armed fighting styles. While unworthy students are either rejected, accepted only to be used for sparring practice and manual labor or killed outright. You were one of the worthy ones, accepted in a Malfean school and taught the ways of martial combat. Perhaps you found the Ten Shadows Academy in the wake of the Ebon Dragon and learned of the ten principles exemplified by the Ten Shadows, those principles of assassination, obfuscation, misdirection, interrogation, seduction, betrayal, deception, secrecy, persistence and the poisoning of the spirit. Perhaps you joined the brutal school of Suntarankal, and endured the ruthless and callous nature of this Unquestionable to train for seven years in hellish regimens from which many students leave injured, crippled, or outright destroyed. Perhaps you joined any of the hundreds or thousands of other schools. Perhaps you simply relied on your own talent and gained understanding of the brutal Infernal Monster style in the frequent battles on the streets of Malfeas. Or perhaps you apprenticed directly to a demon master, as Mara may teach you the Black Claw style that is her creation. But regardless of where you learned to fight, you do it well. The forms of your martial arts come easy to you, the shaping and manipulation of your essence into new patterns accomplished with supreme skill, and so too may you learn or even develop entirely new styles of combat and the martial arts with far less time and effort than most would require."

So much so that only those who are utmost willing to learn its secrets in the years needed to master it can even take their first steps in its ways.

Your martial arts prowess is incredible, your Ki becomes far more potent as well as automatically unlocked and your body and health are extremely resilient. After many years of additional study and training in this secretive art, you may yet become a Sennin. Doing so would grant a host of near mythical abilities, such as manifesting your by then extremely potent Ki into a corporeal form and emulate telekinesis, survive in barren and inhospitable environments that would kill normal humans and what is effectively immortality that allows you to put a stop the process of aging and stay in peak physical condition well over the time others would have crumbled to dust."

Unohana, even centuries after she put down her blade, still easily killed the mighty Zaraki many times over despite his physical advantages.

Each Shunko technique has a unique element associated with it, all with their own advantages. Wind, lightning and fire have all been seen so far.

You learn about twice as quickly as other top students, absorbing academic and mundane skills with very little trouble, even on a time crunch. Supernatural teachings or things like complicated science takemore time, but you’re still an excellent learner as long as you have a good teacher - whether an actual mentor or a very informative book."

You are now a master role-player and infiltrator, capable of putting on a flawless act that could fool anyone short of the most discerning and perceptive people alive, and often even them. You’ll never even hint at possessing any ability or knowledge you couldn’t reasonably be expected to have. Neither will you ever express a visible emotion that you don’t want to. And unlike many long-term infiltrators you will never ‘lose yourself’ in a role or emotionally confuse a cover identity for the real you. You could easily spend your entire life since infancy pretending to be the village idiot while actually having the power and knowledge to beat up a Kage, and leave everybody none the wiser. In addition, you have exceptional talent at both henge and mundane disguises."

You’re good at it too, enough to handle ordinary soldiers in small groups on your own well enough or take down a minor magical beast or five at once, but that’s not enough. Being a hero is about adventure and that’s where you’re shining. You’ve got a wide array of skills when it comes to exploring and adventuring, from acrobatics and navigation of land and sea to organising expeditions and how to sell off all the treasure you find. In later times, you could definitely make a name for yourself as a great discoverer. Helps that you’re an able seaman, horseman and can handle weeks or months long travels without a problem. You’re great at adapting to the strange things you’re likely to encounter on your journeys as well, since thinking outside of the box, particularly when it comes to using magical or superhuman solutions to things, comes naturally to you. Some people might not think of rerouting an entire river just to clean some stables but you? You’re the smart cookie that can figure out how."

It just means there’s been a dozen or two others like that already. World class talent might be the peak of what normal human’s can do but it’s just the start for those in the magical world. Like the famed Salieri and his music, you have that world class talent in one art form of your choosing. Singing, the piano, painting, architectural design, acting or some other method. With just this and the right connections, you could certainly go down in the history of the mundane as one of the greatest performers of your art to ever live. But you’ve got the potential to go further, as you find yourself having a moderately easier time learning magical spells and abilities closely associated with your chosen art, as well as such things becoming easier to use and somewhat more powerful as well. Magic cast through a special instrument of the musical art you’ve mastered would be stronger, whereas a great painter would find magic relating to manipulating paintings and drawn images to be significantly better for them than any others."

Your impressive talents do, one must admit, lie more outside just performance. However it takes form, you have even more talent at turning your art to combat than you do making beauty with it. A violin that somehow becomes a lethal sword, songs that can be used to transmit magical spells to many targets at once.

The strongest man in the room goes from an undoubted leader to mere muscle for the true power, the man with all the knowledge. A combination of natural prodigy and years of effort gave you a position among Britain’s most vaunted minds. While your most famous talents are focused in a single academic discipline, such as Moriarty and his world renowned skill with mathematics or an unsurpassed brilliance with biology, you are broadly skilled with many other fields. From several respected academic paths to the different styles of the arts and even a deep understanding of philosophy, you match the learning in each of what most men try a decade or more to come close to. Though a touch barbaric, you even indulged in learning a martial style of the empire, having enough experience in boxing or baritsu to knock back-alley heads together without trouble. It’s made possible with a particular mental technique that allows you to easily absorb and retain information, the creation of a continually expanding ‘memory palace’ style territory within your mind. Information is easily memorised and efficiently stored, granting the ability to rapidly make connections between even seemingly disparate pieces of data that you have gathered. Knowledge of disciplines you once studied thirty years ago remains as fresh as the new fad you spent an afternoon exploring."

The annals of Heaven do not describe these rites, however, by express command of the Maiden of Endings. If any records survive, no one knows except the most senior members of the Morticians’ Order. Before the Lawgivers of the Old Realm even thought of exploring it, the Morticians’ Order had already contacted the Underworld and knew how to house and appease the dead. Sijan, therefore, rather than Stygia, claims the honor of the first city of the Underworld. The East holds hundreds of tribes and nations, with at least a thousand different ways of celebrating, venerating or mourning a loved one’s passing, and almost as many for the death of an enemy. The professional funerists of Sijan serve them all. Sijan’s jet-black funeral galleys ply the rivers of the Scavenger Lands unmolested by brigand, pirate or robber baron. The silver bracers of the Morticians’ Order are a common sight in most cities. Members of the Morticians’ Order spend their entire lives serving the dead and training for their postmortem careers. But these days, it sometimes occurs that their best and brightest join the ranks of the Abyssal Exalted instead of their colleagues in the Underworld. As one of the foremost experts of the Morticians' Order, you have all the knowledge and skill you need for practically all the funereal rites in Creation, being a master of ceremony and ritual, or embalming and tomb-design, and many more things besides. Such mastery could even be used to create new burial rites, so as to appease the dead and ghosts that don't fall under the existing ceremonies. And of course, you are also a trained exorcist, with the skills to deal with more troublesome ghosts."

As agents in Creation, these Deceivers draw towns, tribes, nations and empires into chaos, allowing the other members of their circle to work unmolested. When the living can be convinced, coerced or tricked into serving the needs of the dead, the Winds of the Abyss make all the necessary arrangements. In the Underworld, the deathknights of the Moonshadow Caste serve many of the same purposes. They broker agreements between warring ghost factions or kingdoms, all in the name of unifying the dead beneath the Deathlords. With them also lies the responsibility of resolving conflicts between Deathlords, even if all they actually do is observe the formalities and carry out the rituals of tradition while the Deathlords negotiate their grievances in person. Having become an expert diplomat, you can now fulfill this role too. Whether speaking to the living or the dead, you know how to broker agreements, how to convince people, and how to trick them into going along with your wishes. You could spark wars with just only a seemingly innocent conversation at the court of the ghostly king, or broker peace between two warring nations by acting as a intermediary between them."

Some may call you a madman, but no one may deny the results you bring. You can forcibly mix two or more abilities that were not meant to work together, creating a new technique with devastating results. Some examples of these are the techniques developed by the Jet-Black Warrior, Magsarion: Using several blessings of defense, which increases your weight, and teleportation, which basically makes it,so you move through distance in no time, to turn yourself into a human-shaped cannonball that can destroy a mountain. Forcibly transmitting an excessive regeneration via combining several blessings of regeneration and offense, so your enemy’s regeneration gets overwhelmed, and they begin to collapse. And many other combinations that you will be able to come up with in no time using your own unique abilities. While these techniques may be seen as suicidal by most, you also have a knack for finding ways to ignore the more lethal or even debilitating damage from them, albeit you may not be able to always escape unscratched, and this is usually limited for yourself."

With a few moments to get a feel of things, you’re able to adapt with instinctual knowledge to use things relating to combat at a competent level. If these things happen to build on what you’ve already learned well, like a Bankai to your mastered Shikai or a new spell in the repertoire of a Kido Master, you’ll see this instinctual skill greatly increase.

Yet, among all of the talented ancient sorcerers, there was one outlier: Hagane Daido, a non-sorcerer unable to even see curses. Despite lacking the capacity to use jujutsu, however, Daido more than made up for this with his by being a true master of the blade. Choose any form of weapon you like: the sword is the most natural choice, but it could be spears, axes, bows, or even something stranger besides. Whatever your choice, you possess incredible prowess with it, enough to stand at the peak of what is possible. Even if you lacked the ability to manipulate cursed energy, you’d be able to fight on equal terms with a pretty powerful jujutsu sorcerer or a cursed spirit capable of moving at Mach speed, your sheer skill letting you overcome their superior physical abilities and esoteric techniques. It’s to the point that just holding your weapon of choice causes you to exude an aura of pure lethality, a testament to your mastery sure to strike terror into the hearts of your foes. Alternatively, you may forsake specialising in a single weapon type to gain a more general talent. No matter what it is or what form it takes, so long as it’s a weapon of some sort, as soon as you pick it up you’ll not only know how to use it, but use it well. You won’t be close to the same level as the option above, but you make up for this with the sheer versatility this talent gives you, allowing you to wield anything at the level of a well-trained combatant. There’s nothing saying you can’t improve your skills further, either."

You don’t yet have the comprehensive and intense training of the Spartans themselves but in their place, you find you have incredible potential for learning new combat or war related skills and improving those skills at a massive rate. Even if you started as a child, you’d quickly surpass men with decades of experience after a few months of learning. However, while your starting potential is great and will only grow, you only show your true power when at a disadvantage. The worse off you are in battle, the more you’ll find your powers, raw statistics and skills improve for both you and close allies you have nearby. Facing some notably stronger than yourself might see a decent boost to your own strength but taking just three hundred of your best friends to block the passage of one of the largest and most powerful nation’s greatest army, vastly outnumbering and overpowering yourselves?

Your treatments become applicable on all targets, even against what seems like common sense, as you can stitch up the wounds of spiritual beings with no more difficulty than a flesh and blood human. Even non-humans take only a small time to study before you can effectively understand and begin treatment.

The moves might be weird, the accompanying phrases might be silly and embarrassing, but these are immensely, undeniably effective techniques all the same. And if enough people participate, they could bring down beings that would normally be able to effortlessly mow them down like a scythe through a field of grass."

      "description": "Comprehension matters a lot when it comes to learning and mastering skills, and it would be hard to find powers of comprehension better than yours. Your mind works on levels entirely unimaginable to most people, now. Not only can you replicate just about any technique you come across just after seeing it once, you truly understand all the things you see, down to the purpose and meaning of every little component of it. So good is your understanding of such things that you can find ways to use techniques, both actual attacks and tiny, seemingly irrelevant things like the specific ways one shapes a fireball, to create effects that should really be quite beyond them. Simply by layering small incremental boosts, or by combining two trash techniques, you can come up with moves that wouldn’t be out of place in the hands of a true genius beyond geniuses. Nor is your talent limited to modifying or better using existing techniques. You have a penchant for inventing new ones, refining and combining your insights into new techniques and methods as good as, if not better than anything found in ancient jade slips. You don’t start out being able to redesign cultivation for everyone, but if there was ever anyone who could, it would be you, since your talent for comprehension and creation is just that great. Finally, you also have an immense capacity for enlightenment, wherever it’s needed of you. It comes both in the actual mystical and spiritual form, and in the form of a constantly working mind that allows you to better combine systems, magics and techniques to make them all better."

The comprehension abilities of your students rapidly grow to absurd heights, improving more the more you interact with them. One word of advice from you could clear away millennia old bottlenecks and grant insights into the Dao people half a dozen cultivation levels above you would cherish, while more personal attention sees results proportionately greater. Indeed, it seems as if under your tutelage there is no such thing as a lack of talent, as even the worst, least capable students of yours explode into beacons of talent to match the finest seedlings any storied sects or clans have. While they don’t gain any unique heritage or bloodline, constitutions change and foundations deepen, and by the time you’re done with them any of your students could be regarded as a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a diamond of the first water."

However, the glory days of the First Age are long gone and the former Lords of Creation are hunted as demonic Anathema, and thus no retinue may be easily available to them. But even this can be overcome. You may train effective armies from the ground up in a staggeringly short amount of time, turning a village into an elite fighting force within a week or two, tops. How effective this is depends on how far you spread your efforts...training a single individual will quickly see them become your equal (though obviously without Charms or any other advantages, unless they already have those or you grant them somehow) in combat and strategy, training a small village will create a disciplined squad that will put the veterans of Lookshy to shame, and training an entire country would create a crude but functional army. Obviously, this can be improved further if you have more time to raise these troops. This can also be applied in training or delegating any sort of organization or group of people - letting you raise ‘troops’ for art galleries or dancing as easily as you could battlefields. In addition to this increase in discipline and competence, they will develop or strengthen a sense of loyalty towards you - those newly blooded generals will lay their lives down for you, and that village will be all to ready to fight for you."

Most remarkable of all, this Solar had not activated a single Charm - they used their own wits, cunning, and tenacity to fool those he had spoken to, and vanish without a trace. This tale has been woven into your own abilities - your prowess in spying, espionage, theft, larceny, and trickery is second-to-none. You can trick the hearts of men, Exalts, and even beings vastly beyond yourself, and steal from under the noses of all but the most paranoid and powerful of foes.

Yet now and then, he produces startling innovations in necromancy and necrosurgery, usually following the lead of some other Deathlord and then leaping ahead to make discoveries of his own. He may, indeed, be the most intelligent of the Deathlords... when he puts his mind to something. Achievements such as his Cold House and the zombifying disease known as Embrace of Decay stand as testaments to how much this Deathlord could do if he truly wished. And in this, you shall take after him. Though you will hopefully maintain a less fickle mindset, you shall find yourself leaping ahead of your peers and coming up with innovations that may disquiet the Deathlords themselves.

No, this legacy is that of a line of disciples that will spread your name and techniques far and wide as they rise in power, immortalizing your name eternally in the history of the cosmos. Sadly, many can never pick the correct people. Either they pick someone who is secretly mind controlling their daughter into becoming their sex-slave, or they find someone with early explosive growth, but with that early talent fading later on. Not for you though, you can always tell the full potential of any person you meet, and if given enough time with them, could find opportunities to guide them to reaching it, or even surpassing it. If you felt like it, you could turn a mortal late into their life into a celestial immortal in five thousand years even if they never had a chance of reaching the Zifu stage. Those that you guide and teach would reach their full potential a tenth of the time they would normally reach on their own. The problem of people that are good on the outside turning out to be completely evil on the inside is moot as well, because any person you personally take on as a disciple will always feel a strong bond towards you, to the point where even if you just gave someone a few pointers, they’d be willing to shed tears for you on your deathbed."

Then, in 1989, Satoru Gojo was born, and the balance of power was forever shifted. Some of this was due to the sorcerer possessing both the Limitless technique and Six Eyes, but that was not all. He was also a natural innovator, someone who broke the limits of what was considered possible, to the point that even the King of Curses was surprised by the things he could pull off. While you may lack in raw power, proficiency with cursed energy is something you have in excess. You have a great understand of not just any cursed technique you might have, but all of your supernatural powers. You’re fully aware of their limits and capabilities, allowing you to push them to their limits and pull off feats with them few others would expect. Your skill is at the level that for you, the rules of any power system or ability you use seem to be that bit looser. For instance, while normally one’s cursed technique is ‘burned out’ after using a Domain Expansion, making it unusable for a good while, you’d be able to figure out a way to heal your brain and regain your technique in a fraction of the time, something considered impossible by anyone else. Similarly, while some might only be able to fire an ability in a straight line, you’d be able to figure out how to make it curve around corners or even home in on your foes, and a technique that cuts things at range could be made to cut through space itself. You won’t be able to completely change the technique or power into something else, but so long as it’s still recognisably the original and doesn’t provide a direct increase in power, it’ll probably be possible."

After all, while one may have a cursed technique from birth, this does not come with mastery of it, and a bit of intelligence can go a long way in this matter. You’ve got an incredible intellect, enough that those around you would quite rightly consider you a genius. Learning new things comes easily to you, able to figure out the basics in no time at all, and reaching mastery in far less time than most others. Even if you were completely unaware of cursed energy’s very existence, upon becoming a sorcerer it wouldn’t even take you two weeks to become equal in power to a grade 1 sorcerer, just by figuring out its rules and the best ways to use it. For context, most sorcerers sit at grade 3 and will never even reach grade 2, and those with great levels of talent would usually take many years to achieve the level of mastery of their cursed technique needed for grade 1. Your intelligence undeniably lets you push your abilities to greater heights than most, coming up with uses for your techniques that would never have occurred to others. Who knows how far you could get in a few years of practice?

There was one, though, who stood above all others as the undisputed strongest in history. Born with a disfigured body uniquely suited for jujutsu sorcery, unsurpassed reserves of cursed energy, and a cursed technique of incredible power, this innate talent alone put him on the path for greatness. You may not share these traits, but there is one area in which you’re his equal: your raw ability with jujutsu. Due to a combination of natural talent and training, your skill with cursed energy is at the very peak of this world. From fluidly switching between different techniques of yours to using even the most complex of abilities, all of this comes effortlessly to you. Though you don’t have the precision nor efficiency granted by the Six Eyes, it wouldn’t be wrong to say your understanding of cursed energy would be on par with someone who possessed them. This understanding extends further than just your own cursed energy, though: it also allows you great insight into how others use it, too. Just by witnessing a cursed technique in action you’re able to quickly determine how it functions after just a few moments, letting you figure out its potential strengths and weaknesses. Not only that, but so long as it’s not something innate to the individual, you’ll be able to copy any usage of cursed energy after witnessing it a few times. While you can’t copy cursed techniques with this, if you had the same cursed technique as someone else you’d certainly be able to copy any abilities they’ve developed for it, and if you witnessed someone using reverse cursed technique to heal a burned-out cursed technique, you’d soon be able to do the same even if you previously thought it impossible."

When a sorcerer applies their cursed energy to a physical attack within a millionth of a second of the impact occurring, their energy becomes dyed black as it explodes outwards (hence the name). The results are dramatic: not only is the strength of the attack increased to the power of 2.5, it also causes the user to temporarily enter a state similar to ‘the zone’, where manipulating cursed energy becomes as easy as breathing. Naturally, this lets them operate at levels beyond their usual limits, at around 120% of their potential, and makes scoring consecutive Black Flashes far more likely. While you’re not able to perform Black Flashes at-will, you have an incredible amount of skill and natural talent when it comes to manipulating your cursed energy. It would be incredibly simple to mislead your foes with your control, tricking them into thinking you’re doing something else with your energy until the very last moment, and your skill also makes any cursed techniques you possess a fair bit stronger, as you intuitively understand how to use your cursed energy in a more efficient manner. Of course, pulling off Black Flashes is much easier for you than most, to the point that they’re a pretty regular occurrence, and will only become more so with practice. And, in situations where you’re especially focused, such as a fight where your life is at significant risk, you’re practically guaranteed to pull off at least one. The concept of Black Flashes may also be applied to any other supernatural energies you may possess, too."

It might even be...how do you say, impractical? So how do you keep speeding through all of it while barely knowing what you’re doing? This perk’s benefits are twofold - any sort of power or item that requires a ‘certain person’ to use it, you automatically qualify. For example if you needed a strong spiritual will to become a certain type of being, then undergoing the process to become that being would welcome and accept the change to your body. Secondly, all abilities that grow based on age or practice now take a considerable fraction of the time and effort needed for you to perfect it, perhaps even letting you develop a Reality Marble as an Apostle in a year as opposed to decades or centuries. I wonder what sort of madness created a being like you...?"

Your physical form as undertaken a similar boost in might, with all your physical attributes raised to absurdly superhuman levels. You could survive being punched from Seoul to Beijing, run back in a few minutes and then punch your attacker two hundred kilometres away, embedding them halfway into a mountain. You are not yet on the level of the High Gods but you’re closer than all but a dozen or two people in all the universe. Boosted: So long has Humanity suffered under the yoke of the Gods. It is only recently that men and women capable of making a push for freedom have appeared. Men and women as mighty as yourself. That insatiable drive for freedom, or just revenge, against the Gods has granted you special powers against Divine beings. Your blows strike far harder against them, piercing through all but the greatest defenses that Divine beings can muster. And their counter attacks against you are dulled, reduced to a tenth of their full force. The Taboo still applies to you but the Gods will find it of little use.

If you choose robotics as your specialization, you could make war machines powerful as a Tailed Beast with the right materials and enough effort for example. With time and effort, you could make several discoveries and advancements even outside your specialization, like discovering how to give biological immortality to living beings, actually transferring minds through scientific means, artificially replicate existing dōjutsu or even create your own customized ones, a feat that even Amado would classify as belonging to the realms of the gods, but, after all, you’re basically a divine being yourself."

Be it sword, bow, spear, wrestling or any other weapon that can be found in this time, you hold divine levels of skill with them. Even warriors that are many times stronger and faster than you can find themselves hopeless against your arts of combat. It’s possible to find people that manage to surpass you, somewhat, but they are few and far between, such as comparing your archery to that of Atalanta’s. Still, while you may not be outright perfect in skill, you have a special benefit that no one else but Heracles seems to have. You can create martial techniques that act like spells, drawing on your stamina in order to use weapons to accomplish supernatural things. Using your knowledge of the bow to create a combat move that allows you to shoot a hundred arrows in a single motion, which will endlessly kill anything it strikes down even once to completely counteract most forms of regeneration and immortality, like what Heracles used against the Hydra. Once you’ve done these, you can effortlessly adapt the technique to other weapons or even the use of magic or your own body. It may lose in effectiveness, such as your hundred bow shots becoming nine slashes of the sword or nine beams of energy, but this adaptation is instant, compared to the several days of practice your techniques usually require, and the new forms of techniques can even be made suited to specific kinds of foes in minutes of focus."

Your strength and speed is enough to go into battle against Dragons, though it is not a fight you would be guaranteed to win. Still the punishment of such a Beast you could endure, even hails of Bullets from Beasts designed to kill. But of course what is a Hero without the skill to use their strength? Saving princesses and slaying Monsters just comes naturally to you. Some may think your claim of being able to do ‘Just About Anything’ isn’t entirely farfetched, as you are simply competent in whatever is needed, like say cheering up an ally, getting food, raising a spirit or even just fighting someone way out of your league. Now you can't DO anything, only do lots of things. You wouldn’t be able to destroy trees that simulate entire Worlds for example but you may just be able to put up a great fight against a single great Tyrant. Though at least you know what is truly impossible to you, just so you can bother trying for what you could somehow pull off. But where you truly shine is on top of a mount. Your skill at Riding is legendary, far beyond what any human should be capable of. What it is you ride, be it a monster or a vehicle, ill maters. As long as you can count it as a form of transportation you can do just that with the kind of skill only a Hero of an Epic could replicate. Of course combat on top of your steed is also all but instinctual, perhaps even greater than it would be on foot.

You have reached a level of swordsmanship that cannot be described as just supernatural or divine. To the eyes of the few others on your level, they describe it as having reached the Truth of the World with a single cut. The result is the ability to accomplish many impossible feats through your sword style. Cutting any physical material, repelling vastly superior opponents from a location your guard without injury to yourself, cutting through armies of threatening foes with grace and fluidity. Even with the body of an ordinary man, rather than some powerful heroic form, you remain one of the most lethal combatants in Japan. Your style currently culminates in a single perfect expression of your talent, which has been taken so far as to warp reality itself. A technique that incorporates the Second Magic to cut three times with one slash, creating an inescapable prison of steel, is the best known example. But this peak you have reached is just the base of another mountain, as you have the ability to rapidly bring new techniques to such a supreme level. Your repertoire, provided you continue your harsh practice, will likely see new abilities like this every few months. Additionally, bringing other sword-based fighting styles to the level you have reached with this one is a speedy process of around a year’s practice, your existing skills easily bridging the gap."

Choose any seven of the following - War, Melee, Martial Arts, Archery, Thrown, Riding, Sailing, Socializing, Athletics, Awareness, Dodge, Bureaucracy, Crafting, Integrity, Investigation, Larceny, Linguistics, Lore, Medicine, Occult, Performance, Presence, Stealth, Survival, or Resistance. You are now the undisputed master of those seven skills. This is in addition to any skills or abilities you would normally be good at on account of your Caste or 'favored' choices. You can do things with the seven skills you have chosen while half drunk and blind on your worst day that the greatest mortal practitioners would never be able to replicate, even on their best day, in their entire lives. Additionally you can train anyone that you personally tutor in these seven abilities and they will quickly reach a level of skill close to, but just short of, your own level of skill. They will learn at a rate equivalent to an Exalt so long as you personally teach them, even if they aren't an Exalt. If you chose Dodge you might one day be able to walk through a rainstorm without getting wet. If you choose Archery you might strike a man’s heart from over the horizon while he is standing in the middle of a forest. If you chose Bureaucracy the sheer efficiency and speed with which your organization operates will baffle even the most astute observers and leave competitors hopelessly scrambling to catch up. Choosing Medicine might allow you to perform brain surgery with a rusty knife using only one hand, and have the patient come out the other side perfectly healthy. Point blank the things you can manage with your chosen skills would be outright impossible for nearly anyone else to replicate, even other Essence users needing to ‘cheat’ and use Charms in order to match what you can do with nothing but your own innate talent. You may purchase this perk up to three times, each time it is purchased you must select different abilities."

      "description": "Your nature as a world (and dimension) crossing Jumper has changed the fundamental nature of your being and understanding. Your many experiences across many worlds has given you the necessary insight and mental fortitude to truly grasp the nature of Martial Arts. You can learn any supernatural martial arts style native to any world/Jump you happen to find yourself in, even if you don't actually have a mentor to teach you how to do it, so long as it is not an option that requires you to pay for it with CP (a restriction that is lifted Post-Spark). Through either dumb luck or keen insight you'll just stumble into the correct move set, frame of mind, and if necessary secret-hidden-potential needed in order to become a practitioner. In effect this means you'll always be able to learn any form of supernatural martial arts even if you lack the qualities, genetics, special destiny, knowledgeable teacher, strong soul, or whatever that you would normally require in order to learn them. For this Jump specifically this means you can learn Sidereal Martial Arts even if you aren't a Sidereal (or even if you're just a mortal) and, further, you're a lot better at it than you should be. You've got a natural talent and insight for martial arts that allows you to get a lot more mileage out of these styles than normal practitioners, able to fight harder, longer, faster, and just all around better than your peers. You require less Essence, ki, qi, magic, chakra, chi, or any other energy source in order to power any supernatural Martial Art that you know. You must have been to a Jump in order to learn/practice any special martial arts from that Jump, so no learning how to make your hand glow with an awesome power unless you've been there first."

You understand economics and politics with complete mastery of both, but you also know how to build a lasting nation or organization that can sustain itself without you having to constantly reinforce it with Charms or other abilities. In addition, changes you make in the world...whether building monuments, kingdoms, or slaying a great menace will have a permanent and lasting effect - your dynasty will last for thousands of years beyond your own era, your legend is told for many years to come, and your cities will be full of life even if the world around it should be torn apart. This effect can be mitigated or ‘turned off’ at your leisure if you prefer subtlety or impermanence."

Your Exaltation holds many of the lost knowledge of crafting and forging great Artifacts, as well as lost sciences of the First Age such as biogenesis. You begin with the basic knowledge and fluency in Old Realm, as well as mastery of the various sciences and ways of crafting from the First Age, able to forge weapons, warstriders, and other items of legend to add to your own panoply. As a bonus, you know how to substitute magical materials for such items with their mundane equivalents or metals in other worlds - useful in worlds without materials such as orichalum."

Very few savants in Creation even have any kind of idea of what the Yozis are, as a group, or how they work, much less in-depth psychological profiles of particular titans or a clear view of their history. To truly understand the Yozi, one needs a working model for how endless seas of consciousness and alien minds forged raw from chaos translate into observable behavior patterns, and for how a thing beyond mortal rationality can function in a superior yet irrational fashion. You've got a astonishing talent for understanding alien, bizarre minds and beings, able to easily pick up on their subtleties and obsessions. As such, you've even managed to gain an understanding on the behavior and thought processes of the Yozi, and how they influence their souls and are influenced in turn. This isn't just limited to the minds of the Architects of Creation, but you'll have to spend some time interacting with or observing other beings to grasp their particular psyche. Of course in the course of your research into the minds of the mad titans, you have learned a great deal more... The legends and accounts of the time before reality, the tales of lost Zen-Mu, the birth of Creation itself, and the long histories from before and after their imprisonment within Malfeas. Even the histories and lore of demonkind are open to you now, most of the knowledge contained within Orabilis' glass libraries already known to you. But your intimate understanding of the Primordial condition gives you one other benefit, as it allows you to translate the supernatural powers of one Yozi to another as the Yozi themselves do. Through this, you may adapt the charms you know of one Yozi into an equivalent that uses the themes of a second Yozi. But remember that this is by and large merely aesthetic, and some sufficiently different abilities may prove impossible to translate."

But it is in the Underworld itself that their true potential for leadership shines through, for it is there that they may act with the full authority of the murdered architects of the universe. Necromancers and Deathlords might rule the dead through fear and spells of binding, but you have no need to force obedience through such methods. The dead know their rightful ruler when they look upon you, and most shall be eager to follow your commands and swear themselves to your service. While the mindless, reanimated dead will not gain the faculties to swear themselves into service, you may still command them as you will and they shall never raise their rotted claws against you. Even those ghost and mindless undead bound through necromancy refuse to act against you or disobey your orders. Just, don’t expect such mighty rulers as the Deathlords to prostrate themselves. But a wise king need more than obedience, and you too have gained the virtues a good ruler needs. Being an old hand at matters of court and government, at the labors of bureaucracy and lawmaking, and at that most important of talents... delegation. Knowing whom to trust with which aspects of your realm, and whose counsel you can trust to be wise."

      "description": "Every single Shinigami who has been raised to the vaunted heights of Squad Zero has accomplished something incredible. Each one is a master of a skill to a level considered impossible to all others, taking something useful but mundane and making it akin to the work of a god. One is a swordsmith, whose works are the Zanpakuto that form the core of Shinigami power. One a seamstress whose ordinarily clothes withstand attacks with ease from all but the greatest Captains. The oldest among them is a monk who has given names to all things and controls the very names themselves, giving great power over the world. While you may not necessarily have been offered a place yet, though also possessing sufficient power may change this, you have mastered a certain skill or idea to a similar level as the current members. Skills are obvious and described both above and below but ideas are also possible. Ichibe’s title as the one who names others has allowed him to manipulate names as a concept, altering or controlling others through their names. In his sealed form, this is largely limited to an innate knowledge of all names, the ability to draw power from others speaking his name and to lay notably powerful curses or other effects on names that activate when spoken. Whatever you pick allows for incredible uses and techniques just on it’s own, such as the above techniques described. It’s almost certain that you have also created some great invention connected to your chosen skill, which may have already spread through Soul Society and brought fame to your name. A master of Kido who created stick-shaped implements that allow even a beginner to work powerful magics, a swordmaster whose written lessons have revolutionised Zanjutsu by introducing magical techniques not connected to release forms or kido, perhaps even something like an author whose stories have inspired and directed the afterlife again and again. However your skill and the accompanying great invention appear, there is a second aspect to this option. Whatever your skill or idea is, it is also linked directly to your Zanpakuto. Releasing your Zanpakuto will greatly expand what you are able to accomplish with your skill. This works in concert with it’s existing abilities, which may alter the form of the blade and the powers to complement each other better. Ichibe’s Shikai, a large brush which could manipulate ink, allowed him to suppress and erase others by covering them, and thus their names, in black ink. His Bankai grew this to the point that he could directly change or give new names to beings, with the properties of their new name becoming true. The most powerful warrior reduced to the strength of a helpless ant, as that is what his name had become. Your Zanpakuto releases will likely be supercharged by this process, greatly improving the existing powers as a result of them combining with such divine skill. It is also worth remembering that these powers are not without limit. The released state of this skill will require your spiritual energy to operate and some uses, though theoretically possible, may be of too great a magnitude to actually work. Those without a Zanpakuto can eventually unlock independent release states that give access to two increased levels of power with your chosen divine skill. These two release stages will drain your energy similar to a Shikai and Bankai but at least allow access to your full potential."

Your physical abilities are enough that you could fight powerful adult dragons and demons to a draw with your bare hands or even win if you added a good weapon to your side. You’ve got unbelievable levels of martial skill in both offense and defense, across two dozen kinds of weapons, such that even without your physical abilities being so great you could slay armies. You have strategic and tactical abilities that let you lead small forces to crush far larger ones and can even make a good substitute for a king if your liege needs to spend a few months away at war, though you are far below the sort of king that can create a golden age. You have a high level of natural talent at any skill or ability you try your hand at and find it very easy to learn and train to become better at new things, quickly surpassing even the most venerable of warriors in their specialties. Of course, you would not be peerless if you did not also look the part. Among all the men in the world, only the divine could outmatch your physical splendour and even then, only by a touch. Your king might frown on the hordes of maidens that lust after you but you really can’t help it, as you gather admirers and love interests even when fully armoured and masked.

Magical poisons and diseases can still mess you up, but you've got a fair resistance to those as well. Finally in places of extreme chaotic nature, such as The Wyld, you will find yourself oddly insulated from the normal consequences of being in such a place. This isn’t total resistance and it’s still advised you leave while you can, but if it’s just a relatively short visit you could conceivably survive just fine even in the very heart of The Wyld or other similarly chaotic areas."

Many of these feats are the result of enhancing techniques and other abilities by using even more power on them, with a case that perfectly exemplifies this is the usage of Rasengan by Momoshiki that amplifies its size from being hand-sized into a gigantic scale. However, merely adding more energy without any care into a technique is usually pretty inefficient and may make it more unstable. Fortunately, as a result of specializing yourself in this, acquired experience over the cycles or due to an innate affinity with enhancing techniques over their regular limit, you’re now able to fuel any technique and/or ability you have to with any amount of power without needing to worry about any loss of efficiency or instability caused by it, allowing you to both enhance them by fueling them with additional power or use weaker versions of them by limiting the energy you use."

You would only need to rest or sleep an hour per month to fully recover your stamina and mental fatigue and return to peak condition and a full day should push yourself like fighting or training for an entire year. This also removes muscle pains and cramps from not exercising for too long or stretching first before doing a strenuous activity."

Deathknights’ vitality makes them seem unpredictable and potentially dangerous to the staid, conservative, unchanging dead. Abyssals fit in most in shadowlands, since they are caught between life and death in a manner similar to their surroundings. Yet the denizens of the realms on either side of a shadowland tend to look askance at their in-between neighbors, fearful of what influence the opposite realm might exert through the shared territory. For most deathknights, this serves to instill in them a doubled sense of exiled desolation. Yet you have found ways to make use of your state as a being with merely one foot in the grave. For all intents and purposes, you may consider yourself to be living, dead or undead, whichever state is most favourable to you at the moment, for the truth is you are none and all of these at once. Though this understanding, you can choose to be considered \"alive\" while in Creation, respiring essence like living creatures. But being dead means certain things (like most poisons) won’t have any effect on you. And being undead means you can respire the necrotic essence of the Underworld. You can choose for spells and magic that affects the dead not to work on you, or only to work on you when beneficial.

This doesn’t help you once it is over, and you may very well die for good once you beat him, but unless he literally pulverizes you, you won’t go down first."

And when it comes to being killed, it’s a trial and a half to actually make you stay down. You do not truly require any of the organs that frail humans rely so much on. Instead, so long as your body is at half there, you will survive and fight onwards. Even being reduced to a smoking, blackened skeleton from the waist up would not slow you down for a second."

Even if you should have died from a wound, you will still cling to life, requiring extraneous time suffering the injury or truly over the top punishment than you should be able to endure to truly silence you."

Achieving harmony with your blade has pushed it beyond the boundaries of what the human mind can easily understand, leaving opponents unable to read your attacks or intent when fighting with a sword. Every attack is unforeseen, a surprise manoeuvre not encountered by you before no matter the experience they have with you. Enemies must rely on raw reactions, skill and instinct to fight you as understanding the combat techniques you use remains impossible. With normal attacks, it is possible for someone to actively keep in their mind what your style is and consciously counter it but this prevents them relying on instinct. To any special techniques you possess, they cannot even do this and each one will be completely unexpected. These effects can be used even with weapons other than the sword. This harmony you have reached has also given you a heart that could be described as a perfectly still pool of clear water. Your focus in battle is legendary, unwavering in the face of fear and able to patiently wait in a ready stance for days on end. Even magical interference on your mind slides off, unable to taint the clear water."

Through a personal journey or being part of such a legendary group, you’ve become worthy of standing at the peak of all hunters in this land. Your physical abilities may not match the most terrible of demons outright, though splitting a castle with an axe is well within your reach, but your combat abilities extend much further. You are broadly skilled with many weapons and martial arts, enough to reach an expert level in most, and are particularly talented at fighting those more powerful than yourself. Whereas a master swordsman may outmatch you with their wits, you are able to fight in a way to negate the advantages of demons tens of times your strength or speed. Knowledge of holy rituals and a lifetime of slaughtering mysterious beasts has made you highly resistant to magic and able to deal much more damage to beings of great mystery than normal. Your demon blood heritage is fully turned to your benefit, making it much easier for you to deceive and trick demons and Oni. Fooling them into treating you as an honoured guest, even when you are a famous hunter of their kind, isn’t an impossible task. Lastly, as with the many demon hunter clans to arise in later times, you are able to pass down your techniques and unique abilities to the rest of your family. Your descendants are able to much more easily learn what you have learned, as well as being able to unlock special powers that would normally have a very low rate of inheritance. Unlike some clans, they also share any self control you have over your Oni nature, preventing them from falling to madness."

Your body is through natural means able to contend with a Saint that relies on holy power and should you find yourself in a formal duel against one opponent, your skills and abilities greatly heighten in threat level. But no hero can win forever and thus your final defence is one of spite towards any that try and take from you. Any enemy of yours that is able to steal a personal ability or item from you directly will find that not only do they gain little to no use out of it, it will often backfire on them catastrophically.

You have the ability to just ‘let go’, to forget about the worries and the grind of the cultivation rat race, and while away your days partying and just having fun. You know your alcohol and your fashions, and your mind-altering drugs if you’re the kind to use them. And you find that doing so actually helps you. Stress and tension melts away, and your comprehension soars as your mind explores new horizons. More than just being able and good at the Silkpants lifestyle, perhaps your biggest talent is the ability you have to tempt others into it. No matter how fastidious or devoted they might normally be, all you need is the slightest chink in their armor, the slightest hint of a vice, and you know how to draw upon it and ensnare them into this same lifestyle. It wouldn’t be easy, but you could turn a millennium old, utterly devoted ascetic into a drunken whoremonger in a matter of weeks, if not days. You could use these skills, with a lot of time and effort to design a whole cultivation style around hedonism and teach it to others, or you could use them to just ruin promising geniuses so that you shine brighter. Either way, it should be a lot of fun, yeah?"

She is not permitted to enter the Labyrinth at all without the First and Forsaken Lion’s accompaniment, nor can she enter Stygia. She has not been seen in Creation for centuries and is practically forgotten there. Yet, this has not stopped her from pursuing her own objective of freedom. She has been the Lion’s prisoner for centuries, yet she still spits on any and every attempt of his to win her loyalty, and constantly schemes to undo her superior and seize his assets for herself. She has been forbidden from having Abyssal servants of her own, yet this did not stop her from acquiring a monstrance and choosing a hidden servant either.

And the actual Gods may still be able to bypass this effect, at least if you do not possess the same form of divinity as well.

And nothing shakes more its inhabitants than the uncertainty of this ever-shifting world that seems to be trapped in an ever-spinning charade of a war, where nothing is certain but the perpetuation of a conflict that will never seem to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Thus, people seek refuge in things that they consider certain, like how the Ashavan chase after the image of a true hero that will save them, or how many Daeva pursue their own strength as their only certainty. Even those with the potential to assault the heavens and take the Divine Throne for themselves yearn for something that gives them true security, an ‘immutable’ goal. You have rejected all these foolish notions. The Hero of the Ashavan? Nothing but an ever-shifting ideal on which people project their anxieties. The mighty warriors of the Daeva who devote their existence to chasing the throne of their strongest? If their strength was immutable, they wouldn’t need to prove anything. Greed? Beauty? or Love? All of them are nothing but trash that cannot stand even the simplest inspection, a house of cards waiting to fall. Only you, who has realized the truth of how pathetically feeble all these ideas are, can be worthy of being called truly immutable. And your body now reflects that. What was once subjected to being changed by others, it is now something that can only be affected by your own actions, as if your flesh had been replaced by something sturdier than matter: an idea. Attacks capable of shattering galaxies, even the powers of the emerging gods, cannot affect you. They cannot even make you budge a bit. The only thing that can change your own body is you, any other actions that come from anything that isn’t yourself or your own body will simply fail to have any effect. Be warned however that the actual gods and those who are on their level of existence may still find ways to affect you. As your immutable body is no longer bound by the changing laws of reality that move at the wills of Star Spirits and Gods, it also allows you to preform feats of unimpeded movement, such as walking and running through any medium, even air or the void, unrestrained, ignoring things such as gravity. his doesn’t give you any additional offensive strength by itself, but it’s not that you need to affect the changing universe to reaffirm your immutability."

      "description": "Humans, be they sorcerer or not, are all born with a certain level of cursed energy innate to their being – sorcerers just have a higher amount of the stuff, along with the ability to control it. There are rare cases, though, when would-be sorcerers are born with abnormally low levels of cursed energy, less even than an ordinary human, and in exchange are gifted with superhuman natural physical capabilities. Rarer yet is one born with no cursed energy at all, of which only two cases are known to have ever existed. The result of this is a monster capable of contending with even the strongest of sorcerers. Now, you are the third such case – a being born without any cursed energy, with all of the benefits this comes with. The first, and most notably, are your physical abilities, which have far transcended the limits of any normal human. You’re strong enough to smash down buildings, shatter thick concrete walls, and casually throw cars around. The ground forms sizeable craters when you strike it, and all but the toughest of curses could be killed with a single blow should you land a clean hit on them with a cursed tool. Your toughness is similarly impressive, able to take such hits without being injured too badly, and any injuries you do take short of missing limbs or organs can be healed relatively quickly. You could be crushed between two enormous hands of stone, large enough to fully envelop your body, and not only would you be able to overpower them, but break through them without much being harmed much at all. Even if you were slammed into the ground at speeds far faster than the speed of sound, rupturing your organs and leaving you unable to move, you’d be able to get up again after barely five minutes of recovery and keep fighting as if nothing happened. You can move so fast that others have difficulty even perceiving your movements, able to cut down multiple highly-skilled sorcerers before they even have a chance to react to your presence. Combined with your equally impressive agility and reactions, you could catch bullets fired at point blank range, run across water, and bound off of walls and trees with effortless ease. Your senses are likewise a lot sharper than they were before. You’re capable of spotting even the slightest of oddities in your foes’ movements, and can even perceive the air itself.Through this, you could determine the presence and actions of invisible creatures by how the air moves around them, and even pre-empt their movements to a degree. More than this, you can even see the scattered surfaces in the air created by subtle differences in temperature and density, and somehow use them to manoeuvre in mid-air, swinging and leaping through the skies in ways no other could predict. This, combined with your speed and agility, affords you such mobility that even a cursed spirit moving at Mach 3 would be completely unable to keep up with you. In addition to the above, having no cursed energy has benefits of its own – specifically, that any ability that targets cursed energy has no effect on you. Barriers, for instance, can only recognise and prevent the entrance or exit of beings with cursed energy – while any other sorcerer might be completely blocked by one, you could walk straight through it as if it wasn’t there. Similarly, effects that detect others based on their cursed energy wouldn’t even register you, and even the guaranteed-hit effects of Domains would be unable to target you. This also applies to any other supernatural energies you might possess. The main downside of having no cursed energy, of course, is just that: you don’t have any cursed energy. As such, not only are you completely unable to use any sort of cursed technique, but you’re also unable to harm cursed spirits – you’ll need a cursed tool or other object imbued with cursed energy to do that. However, given that those with this ability are capable of fighting an entire clan of sorcerers at once and emerging as the sole survivor, or taking on special grade cursed spirits and defeating them single-handedly so long as they’re armed with a decent cursed tool, the benefits are well worth such small drawbacks."

Unfortunately, every creature has its limits, restricting their growth and potential and our limits are the main obstacle to achieve our goal, but not for you. You don’t have any limit and your potential is infinite, letting you grow stronger and evolve without the worry of having a roof to your growth. You’re also very compatible with any form of power boost, being able to become more powerful by absorbing energy and training without needing to worry about being incompatible with some form of power. This lets you become stronger with this, but doesn’t nullify their side effects and downsides."

After being killed, this also happens to some lucky Ōtsutsuki, but you’re specially gifted with this kind of spiritual resilience. If you’re killed, your soul will be able to stay intact for a few minutes and you’ll be able to use any of your supernatural abilities, including the Kāma, giving you enough time to find a way to prevent your death. If even with this opportunity you still don’t manage to save yourself, this will count as a true death and, unless you have some 1-up perk or item, your chain will end. Obviously, during this time, your soul will still be vulnerable and can be destroyed, so take caution. Requires Karmic Vessel to purchase."

To truly pass this defense, the divinity must be equal to that of at least a demigod with one powerful parent or the equivalent, and lesser amounts of divinity will result in only a small percentage of the incoming attack being able to affect you. It is also possible for enemies to trick their way past this blessing, by attacking with an ‘act of friendship’, such as being bitten by a vampire who intends to turn you into a vampire like them. Finally, your one true weakness that all can strike at, is that one of your heels were unable to be covered in the fires and not only does that heel lack your invincibility, specifically striking it with enough power to damage the heel will result in your invincibility being deactivated for a full day."

That is, you have the ability of growing eternally, becoming stronger each passing second, a peerless warrior incapable of exhaustion. This doesn’t mean that you have any regenerative abilities other than you would have before, but you no longer have to fear having to end a battle due to running out of stamina. While this engine is always active, the gains it provides when you are doing nothing are basically unnoticeable, even during long periods. It can only shine when you direct yourself to proving yourself as the strongest. That is, when you engage in one-on-one battles to the death. The target doesn’t matter. From the smallest pieces of grass and tiniest insect, to the mightiest Arch-Demons, the only thing that matters is that mutual recognition is established. Surely, a sneak attack would prove nothing of your own strength. Once both parties have acknowledged each other, you must kill the other party using your entire might, regardless of the difference of strength. As long as you continue fighting this way, your internal engine will be fed and use this battle lust to propel you to greater heights. Your senses become sharper, your punches increase in potency, your skin and muscle become more durable and harder to penetrate, your will is hardened. Obviously, the greater the enemy you face, the more desperate the situation is, the more you will grow. Enemies of your same level or higher will provide better gains that tiny bugs that you can easily crush. However, be warned that while your growth is infinite, your growth rate is not, and even if your stamina is inexhaustible, this doesn’t make you completely immortal. And finally, while stronger enemies will make you stronger faster, this is only true when it comes to putting you in a more desperate situation. Should they restrain themselves, you won’t escalate as quickly as you would if they were going all out."

Even the Monkey King with his Yeoui, a man who could destroy whole planets with his magical staff, could barely open up more than a tiny gap in the skin of one with a body formed of this metal. Beware though, as the innards of your body, though still formed of Barbadium, and are slightly less durable than your outer shell. Boosted: Your original form, made from Barbadium, was in truth a crude thing. The Barbadium was just shaped into your body and then your soul was poured in. The metal was not prepared or enhanced beyond that. That was changed. Now your Barbadium body has gone through the full, proper forging processes. Heated, folded, concentrated, mixed with other supernaturally tough materials to make something truly special. While the material itself has become significantly tougher, a blow that might have pierced your skin entirely will only give you a bad bruise now, it's’ supernatural enhancements are what make it truly special. The Barbadium will become more concentrated as your supernatural energies grow, life energy and otherwise, retaining its immense durability no matter how far you grow. It will remain far tougher than you so long as your energies continue to increase. Given your newfound power, at least in your transformed state, it's likely that there are less than a dozen beings in this world that can hope to harm you even with repeated blows, most of which have not even reached that level of power yet.

This practice is mostly divided into two ranks: Ki refiners, who generally rely on magical techniques and treasures to fight, powered by the Elemental Essences they absorb, and Fiendgod Body Refiners, who strive to turn their bodies into those of the ancient Fiendgods and utilize divine abilities with vastly varying effects, such as increasing their size, adding extra arms, or even strengthening their bodies beyond their already impressive levels, making their physical abilities and general battle prowess much higher than those of a Ki refiner in exchange for lacking the ability to use treasures and weapons. Thus you get a technique from each of these two types of cultivation to study. Be warned though, that although Fiendgod Body Refiners are much more powerful, their ways of cultivation may be painful to the extreme, or extremely hard to advance in, resulting in decades of effort for just a bit of progress. There are many stages to cultivation, starting with the Houtian Stage, which signals the very start of a journey, as well as the increase of a cultivator’s lifespan to over a hundred years. Then comes the Xiantian Stage, where the body is completely reforged for perfection, and the cultivator’s lifespan increases to over two hundred years. The third stage is called Zifu, in which the practitioner forms their own “Violet Palace” which contains their liquified Ki energy, and enables them to live over four hundred years. The fourth stage, called Wanxiang, is the stage of manifestation, where the practitioner gains access to Divine Will, and increases their lifespan to eight hundred years. The fifth stage, called Primal, gives the practitioner the ability to live forever* (not actually forever)*, with no limits on their lifespan After that comes the Void or Earth Immortal Stage. When a practitioner reaches the Void Stage and attempts to progress to the next level. they shall be met with a final Tribulation. This is a test sent down by the heavens in the form of heavenly wind, fire, and lightning strikes that they must either bear or face total soul annihilation. Then they must pass a test of their Dao Heart in the form of the Demonheart Tribulation, where they shall be tested to see if they are truly dedicated in the matters of Cultivation, and whether they are willing to abandon everything for its sake, though it can be resisted with a powerful Heartforce. If they succeed in this Tribulation, they shall reach the Celestial Immortal Stage, or, in the case of Body Refiners, the Empyrean God Stage, where they shall break free of the mortal coil and the five elements. After that, there are two more stages for both paths of Cultivation: True Immortal for Ki Refiners, or True God for Body Refiners, and then Daofather for Ki Refiners, and Elder God for Body Refiners. Finally, there is the very pinnacle of power in the Three Realms, the World level. This is the level of cultivation Pangu was at when he created the Pangu Chaosworld, and Nuwa similarly reached. While there are even higher levels of power to be grasped, they need not be mentioned for now, and you won’t be able to reach them during this jump. On a final note, once every three hundred years after a practitioner steps into the Zifu Realm, they will be met with a minor tribulation, which will build up in power until finally, they shall face one major tribulation every nine hundred years. Three centuries a Tribulation, nine a Calamity, this shall continue until they either reach the Celestial Immortal stage, or have their souls shattered. For the purposes of this perk you’ll be given a technique in both Body Refining and Ki Refining that will last you until the Wanxiang Stage, at which point you’ll have to fend for yourself. For 50 CP you can get one that will allow you to advance to the Celestial Immortal and Empyrean God level, using both types of cultivation. Regardless of whether you buy the technique that allows you to train to the Celestial Immortal/Empyrean God level or not, the technique you get is of the highest quality, and you won’t need to worry about your future growth being crippled by using it. Your cultivation technique may be aligned towards whatever Dao you wish it to be."

      "description": "In this world, all but a few humans possess a form of spiritual energy known as cursed energy, which is produced when feeling negative emotions such as anger, fear, or grief. Most humans, however, they have no control over this energy. As such, it leaks freely from their body, causing it to congregate and coalesce into cursed spirits. There are an incredibly rare few who are born with the ability to control this cursed energy, though – people known as sorcerers. You are now one of these sorcerers, granting you the ability to manipulate your own cursed energy. While you aren’t capable of anything particularly special with this alone, there are a good number of benefits to this. For one, you are able to perceive cursed spirits and other spiritual entities with your senses, something usually impossible for non-sorcerers without specialised tools. Additionally, you’re able to channel this cursed energy into your body to enhance your physical abilities to superhuman levels, with greater results coming from greater investments. The above are but the most basic of uses of cursed energy – for more specialised and powerful ones, you’ll need cursed techniques. With this alone, you’re capable of some basic barrier techniques, which let you create (often spherical) walls of cursed energy to close off an area. The most common form of this is a curtain: a large, pitch black sphere that prevents those outside the barrier from seeing what’s happening within. Barriers can also be hardened to make entry or exit more difficult, though be aware that the more difficult it is to leave a barrier, the easier it is to enter and vice versa. In addition, you also have the capability to summon shikigami: creatures resembling cursed spirits created from your cursed energy. These require an intermediary such as a talisman to summon, tend to be rather straightforward in terms of abilities, and won’t be particularly strong, though this may be changed with some practice. Unfortunately, aside from barriers and simple shikigami most cursed techniques are innate, and as such cannot be learned. It’s also entirely possible for a sorcerer to be born without a cursed technique, and as such you will not receive one from this alone. The Cursed Technique section later on will allow you to purchase one for yourself, though certain other, riskier methods may also allow you to obtain one. Perhaps unexpectedly, the amount of cursed energy a sorcerer has is also something determined at birth. By default, you have a rather good talent for jujutsu, granting you a respectable reserve of cursed energy which will replenish by itself. This is more than enough to stand on the same level as the majority of sorcerers, though there are a fair few who still dwarf you in the size of their reserves."

By taking in this energy, you will slowly grow more powerful, and your lifespan will increase each time you advance a stage. Separate from both of those, is body cultivation.

This can be done when someone reaches a sufficient level of development in their body and skills while some unconsciously use it. In your case, you instinctively know how to use it and it passively coats your entire body and clothes from the get-go. This allows you to explosively boost strength, speed, durability, reaction times, spatial awareness and magic resistance along with the ability to strengthen your weapon and perform unbelievable techniques and even resisting harsh conditions like extreme heat and cold is also possible. By default you have the talent to reach Saint-Rank within three years on your own at bare minimum, but with a proper teacher and learning environment you may reach God-Rank in a decade along with having the instinctive ability to use and wield the Beginner-Rank techniques of the Three Sword-Styles. You also gained the ability to grant the ability to use the Battle Aura of this world to someone that doesn't have it. The people that you grant the Battle Aura/Magic System would gain a talent that allows them to reach Saint-Rank within three years on their own at bare minimum, but those with a proper teacher and learning environment may reach God-Rank in a decade granted they only focus on either becoming a Warrior or Magician and not both, if not it would take much longer reach God-Rank. By default those who you grant this ability gain an effect similar to Laplace Factor, which allows them to improve their Mana Reserves so long they train and continue to deplete their Mana Reserves and they also have the ability to pass Battle Aura to their children and their descendants. You can also grant the same ability/talent to people who lack it in this jump."

      "description": "When a young God comes of age, much like how humans go through puberty, they have what’s called a Divine Revelation (usually around half-a-century old). A time when their bodies awaken their power. If not watched over by an experienced elder, these Divine Revelations can turn deadly as the young God’s ability begins to go wild; firing off wildly and consuming any available energy to fuel itself. You may either pick which power you want or roll a D8 for a random Divine Power and receive +200CP. All aspects of the Divine Power scale with the user as they practice their abilities and get stronger innately. This innate power can be passed down to any of your descendants if you wish too though it cannot be taught. --1. Monochrome: One of the rarest Divine Powers, with only two known users. At its core, this Divine Power is all about control, allowing its users to utilize both their skills and powers at any intensity at will or just turning off/on any powers too. Only having an active ability, an AOE effect that does one of three abilities: suppresses the physical attributes of others, suppressing the supernatural abilities of others, or an absolute erosion effect (this caustic aura affects matter, energy, and the spiritual). You start off with enough proficiency for the suppression effect at 25% of others’ capabilities, with the erosion effect equally as potent. For an undiscounted 100CP cost, you can choose another medium to manifest your ability through (either by sight or imbuement into items) and another effect to be unleashed with Monochrome. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost you get both all activation methods (AOE, sight, imbuement) and all abilities of Monochrome available to for you to play with. --2. Indestructible: One of the more well rounded abilities granted to the Gods. At its core, this Divine Power passively grants the user bodily mastery, always aware of the state of their own body while able to exert/dial the strength or speed of their body however they please. When active this power doubles all of the user’s physical attributes, making it so practitioners rarely need to rely on weapons or armors; and even going a step further to boost a specific physical attribute up to 5 times as if they were sprinting (strength, speed, or constitution/endurance) both the active time of usage and the magnitude of the boosts provided will increase in time and training. Some users have found they can extend this powerup to their own items or to other people with the same type of boost; with even more esoteric users just channeling their Divine Power to enhance their will to suppress others (making it a very washdown version of Divine Power - Monochrome). You can choose one subsection’s aspect (either one superior physical boost or other enhancement) or you can pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access to both subsections with one aspect from each side. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost you will have access to all aspects of this power. --3. Seer's Vision: Those born with this power are not usually warriors but tacticians or manipulators. At its core, this Divine Power enhances the vision of the user for 20/20 vision. Its active ability is divided into two subsections: granting the user the ability to see into the past/retrocognition, present/clairvoyance, or future/precognition depending on their affinity; with its other focus of this ability is mental manipulation - projecting/creating illusions, telepathy, memory/perception manipulation, and even hypnosis. You can choose one subsection’s aspect of this ability or can pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access to one aspect of both subsections of this power. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost to have access to both subsections and all their aspects. --4. Eternal Life: Wielders of this power are often put into a supportive role, though master’s of this power is a fearsome sight to behold. At its core, this Divine Power grants a passive healing factor for its user (healing small cuts in second and broken bones in minutes). Its active ability can be divided into two subsections: a healing aspect, greatly stimulating your recovery/regeneration with life energy (which can be shared with others); enhancing targets though not to the same degree as “Divine Power-Indestructible”; and resurrect the recently fallen and long dead unless of course the target has been decapitated. The other subsection of this Divine Power does the exact opposite, siphoning life of living beings to add to their own; damage reflection; and even using life energy to form constructs like giant statues or petals for you to control. You can choose one subsection of this ability or can pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access to one aspect of both subsections of this power. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost to have access to both subsections and their aspects. --5. Asura: One of the more esoteric powers of the Gods. At its core, this Divine Power makes the user more appealing to wildlife; making it easier to handle and command animals for the user. Its active ability enables the user to summon a specific spirit-animal life format will for them to command. The animals summoned become an extension of the user’s senses and will follow their commands explicitly; but needing the user’s concentration to stay manifested. Luckily practitioners do not suffer any sensory overload or feedback from pain or death of their summons. Speaking of the animal summoned by the user can be any mundane creature (insects, mammals, fish, birds, etc...) with their size and numbers varying per user though diminishing returns applies to the summon; bigger animals costing more energy to summon, with smaller ones costing less. The majority of the users can be divided between four major aspects: swarm types, summoning ten animals for every one a normal user would conjure; amalgamation types, basically the summon is a chimeric organism mix-maxing traits to a base form such as a flying tiger with eagle wings or a bipedal shark with gorilla limbs; primeval, can have your summon be an ancient life form (opens up dinosaurs, mammoths, devonian terrors, and other ancient beasts); or power type, gaining one unique ability which can range from being a copy of the Divine Powers listed or a single power of something else entirely (though no reality warping powers or a copy of “Monochrome”). On purchase your summon gains one aspect ,or you can pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access to two aspects. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost to have access to all aspects. Fanwank responsibly! --6. Underworld: For those with a more toxic personality. At its core, this Divine Power grants a passive knowledge on how to concote/handle poisons and diseases while also gaining a resistance to poison and disease for their users (if you have purchased the “Ancients” perk the resistance is turned to an immunity). Its active ability allows users to have control over auras of death and decay; which takes on the forms of varying degrees of poison manipulation. These forms of poisons appear as either toxins or venom by growing natural weaponry (claws, talons, fangs, stinger, spikes); creating constructs (animals, plants, fungi under your control); or just creating straight up poison (adjusting its solubility, viscosity and acidity) to deliver your deadly payloads. Those born with this Divine Power can often be confused with those possessing the Divine Power - Asura, though the conjured forms of Divine Power - Underworld lacks the same autonomy that Asura users have over their summons. You can choose one subsection of this ability or can pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access to one aspect of each subsection of this power. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost to have access to all subsections and their aspects. --7. Heaven and Earth: A straightforward power, but no less destructive if not more than the other abilities known to the Gods. At its core, this Divine Power gives the user an immense resistance to a specific element, enough to make others believe they are immune to it. Its active ability allows the user to either generate or manipulate a natural element of their choice (sadly time-space or other esoteric elements are not viable for this option). For an undiscounted 100CP, you are able to take on traits of the element you conjure; like being being able to manipulate lightning to increases one's speed or even to change into lightning. For an undiscounted 200CP, your power extends to tangent elements for you to control now too; best example is with water for ice and steam (though blood would be a stretch, fanwank reasonably). --8. Primordial Strength: Instead of gaining a Divine Power, you become host to an ancient being that gives you access to their ability. At its core, their Divine Power has anti-healing properties for any wounds inflicted by the user; making those injuries only able to heal at the rate of a normal human being even if they have a healing factor. The active ability is determined by the particular being you are sheltering, as the host you may choose which one inhabits your body. Choosing the Phoenix (the crimson bird) makes you sprout fiery wings for flight and able to detach your feathers for explosions of fire, which regrow quickly. Choosing the Seiryu (the blue dragon) sees you generate scales for enhanced swimming speed, the ability to breathe underwater, and being able to detach your scales to create blasts of water. Choosing the Genbu (the black turtle) has you develop a shell upon you while doubling your strength and durability, and you are able to burrow/tunnel into the earth or earthen material at great speeds (with the latter option at a slower pace). Choosing the Qilin (the white kirin) has you growing platinum blonde fur across your body while enhancing your mobility for great bursts of speed, generating static electricity to discharge the more you move due to friction. All “enhanced movement” options start at half the speed of sound. For another undiscounted 100CP, you are able to host another ancient being. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost you host all the ancient beings, though for now you can only have one active ability at a time."

      "source": "Avesta of Black and White",
      "chapter": "Source",
      "description": "The basis of most supernatural abilities in the First Heaven, the Commandment appears as a self-imposed limitation taken before the Avesta. It is a declaration against the world that reflects the warrior’s personality and ideology. By swearing to God to live in a certain way, you receive a boon in exchange. The nature of this boon varies greatly, since in the end it is up to the Truth to determine such a thing. Normally, a very restrictive bond would result in a greater power. Things such as vowing to always achieve victory, refusing any kind of companionship and living in solitude, or always fighting any being that establishes mutual recognition with one’s full strength. But there are other factors that may influence this result, such as the person’s own disposition and ideals. For example, a gentle being who took a vow of solitude would see a greater boon than those who are loners by nature. But also, those with great wills will see their Commandments also bear great results if it matches their nature, such as someone with a massive thirst for battle limiting themselves to not take any action that isn’t related to killing after establishing mutual recognition when another. And lastly, there is the own opinion of the Truth herself, who may grant better boons if she simply sees fit to do so, whether as part of her own plans or simply due to her own amusement or personal opinions of the person in fact. The vow you take is very important, because breaking it will incur a divine punishment. When this break is unintentional, this may result in your death via divine punishment, enforced by the Law of the Truth. But when this breakthrough of your Commandment results from a willing act, an event known as Forced Falling Down occurs, in which the breaker is forced to switch sides, resulting in a change of personality and power, almost always for the worse. While this indeed a dire thing, it is not as if most Commandments don’t have loopholes around their limitations. For example, Quinn’s Commandment makes her follow the orders of others to be able to act, and she cannot stop following other people’s orders. But the orders she receives are ranked in importance, so she can disregard someone’s orders as long as it is to fulfill a higher duty. Samrukh was also able to replace her lost limbs with prosthetics without violating her ‘do not heal yourself’ commandment. There is also the possibility for those who have outgrown the Law of this universe itself to rebel against the punishment and outright ignore it, or even use brute force to warp reality in a way that allows for breakthrough of one’s commandment without incurring in divine punishment, such as the usage of the Power of Ego to maintain multiple contradictory commandments as some Daeva do. Albeit, this last effect is something that even the most powerful Daeva struggle with, resulting at best in just pushing the line of what’s acceptable before a willing breakthrough rather than outright denying the punishment. Only those who are stronger than God or have the capability to replace her can actively ignore the punishment. Albeit, doing so means rebelling against the Truth and may incur in her wrath, being stricken via other means than a forceful Fall when that it is not possible. It is possible to take Commandments of limited duration, or which are active just until a condition is fulfilled. But this topic is purely academic stuff for almost everyone in the cosmos, usually no one would do this, nor could, for that matter. Commandments are strong beliefs and iron-clad held convictions, pridefully sworn as a particular way to face the world. It is impossible to replace them on a whim, as one would their clothing, unless one’s mentality and personality was hollow enough that they may not even be called human to begin with. Since everyone is required to take a commandment as part of reading deep enough into the Avesta, you too have gained yours. The exact wording of the Commandment is up to you, as well as its restrictions. Here you have two options: You may take whatever you have gained via this jump, with the exceptions of the ‘Star Spirit’ and ‘Will of the King’ purchases, and have it be a result of your boon, at no cost at all. It is not such a strange occurrence, even if it is the result of a single Commandment. Individuals Nahid or Vararam have proven that a single Commandment can result in a large amount of powers and boons. But if you like to, you may have actually taken multiple Commandments in the way that some powerful Daeva, or the heretic Yazata Magsarion, have done. The other option is to pay 200 CP and receive a Commandment similar to that gained by Quinn, Spenta Mainyu or Zaurid’s original Commandment. Basically, you get a boost in power by following a certain limitation but gain no real special powers from that. Again, you may decide to purchase multiple Commandments here. Other abilities and items may interact with Commandments, further increasing their power if the compatibility is right. This is especially true with abilities related to your own will, like the Power of Ego that the Daeva wield. Once this jump ends, you may decide to stop being bound by your Commandment(s) in exchange for losing any potential boon that they may grant at will, no longer bound by the Avesta. You may decide to activate them again at the start of the next jump. This only applies to any abilities not derived from the perks that you purchase below. Breaking your Commandment won’t deprive you of your abilities, but will incur in divine punishment during your time here. May be Purchased Multiple Times"

A Shinigami might be equal to Captain Komamura or Captain Hitsugaya early in the story, powerful but hardly the cream of the crop as they are now. A Hollow would be one of the lower Espada, an Adjuchas made Arrancar through the Hogyoko, such as Grimmjow or Nnoitra. Of the Quincy, the lesser Stern Ritter such as Candice Catnipp or Bazz B are a good example.

Any supernatural ability you wield will become stronger whenever anger, hatred, and the like fill you, with the boost you gain being greater the more intense these feelings are. Your control over your abilities becomes refined, and your blows pack that much more of a punch. This won’t be an enormous boost – it won’t allow you to defeat a foe that truly outclasses you – but it might just let you wound them before going down, or give you the edge you need over an otherwise equal opponent.

You get much more mileage out of them than you should be able to, spending dramatically less Essence when using them and being able to either effect a larger range, more targets at once, use it for a longer period of time, or perhaps just affecting one target in particular in an especially potent way. The exact specifics on what this does changes depending on what type of Exalt and what type of Caste you are but it’s a very dramatic boost in general. Additionally when you use your anima powers you may choose whether or not they are visible and may additionally choose to exempt people, creatures, items, or other such things that you do not specifically desire to target."

The energy can even manifest with the forms and behaviors of living creatures, as in Jiro's Rising Wolf Guinness Punch technique. Appetite Energy can also be infused directly into particular body parts, increasing their strength and even generating beneficial mutations. Sunny, for example, can infuse his hair directly with Appetite Energy to temporarily morph his feelers into Devil Feelers for his Satan Hair ability. Be warned, like in Sunny case, body parts enhanced that way, may develop their own appetite and consume the user.

      "description": "A unique power limited to those with the “mind’s eye”, rare human being’s who can perceive the “invisible air” or Qi as master’s call it. This Qi becomes the building blocks for a practitioner's construct to take shape: such as weapons, organs, objects, living creatures, etc... Though the more complex the construct is, the more aura/construction time it will require from the user. Most Smelting Aura users concentrate on a single type of constructed concept, as higher proficiencies will see their construct be as real as any other object; remaining as an independent object as long as the Smelting Aura remains unbroken. All broken or destroyed constructs return to the practitioner and can be used again immediately, the only cost for these constructs being the user’s concentration and the required Smelting Aura for the construct in question. Masters of this discipline can add elements from Wu Xing to be reflected in their constructs for additional/supernatural powers. Please reference the NOTES SECTION for more clarification. You start off with moderate proficiency in this art, being able to permanently conjure a single designated construct or around a dozen of the same construct with temporary forms; being able to expand your own reserves by either continually practicing. You are also able to teach this ability to others. As a being composed of Smelting Aura you are able to perform minor Body Manipulation on your body; healing or reshaping your form from your aura reserves, and even using parts of your body as material for your constructs. As a denizen of Phantom Island you have also achieved the next stage of utilizing Smelting Aura only possible for your kind - Battle Armor. At this stage the practitioner becomes composed or encased in the same material as their construct. Similar to the “Dark Arts - Limit Break”, construct is no longer constrained to their conjured form and is able to have its composition manipulated at will. For example one could make silk bandages as dense as steel able to cut/pierce like any other bladed weapon; or stone boulders to become as light as a Feather while being as malleable as wet clay. Also the constructs formed from Battle Armor still follow the same rules as other Smelting Aura constructs and can be reformed the instant they are broken. Just take care to choose between reforming your own form or a construct with your aura reserves. --If you bought the “Crystal Mind” perk, you now have the potential for limitless parallel thoughts separate from your own normal train of thoughts. These parallel thoughts can be used to maintain your constructs indefinitely or to focus on any other problems/powers/tasks you wish. You start with 4 parallel thoughts. You are able to train for more trains of thought on your own, but the more trains of thought you acquire the more difficult it becomes to acquire a new one; diminishing returns starting to take place past double digits. You have the possibility to purchase the Crystal Mind perk for 200 cp if you roll this perk."

Soul Power really shines when you are able to Spiritize, injecting your own soul into a single object (usually a weapon) of the user’s choice to alter and enhance its power to make a Soul Gear. Once a person can Spiritze they can also access and learn the other techniques available to those with Soul Power. Beyond Spiritze, there is another level called Limit Break; when a user ignites their Soul Power beyond Spiritize to become one with their Soul Gear, shattering the physical limitations of the Soul Gear. You are able to teach this ability to anyone who has a soul and you yourself starts with proficient knowledge in this art to Spiritize a Soul Gear though not enough to achieve a Limit Break yet. You also gain the ability to detect other powers/energy types (divine power, smelting aura, psionics, etc…) as a sixth sense - their location, their strength, any maladies that seem to be affecting their physical or spiritual states. --If you also bought “Crystal Body”, you gain a regeneration ability for both your body and any items you wield (which would mend themselves). Any broken bones, large lacerations, or any other injuries of a similar potency will fix themselves within minutes; with any chips or or broken fragments of an item matching that regeneration. Lost limbs or organs can regrow in a few weeks, with you being able to functionally normally while on the mend while constantly using your Soul Force as a supplement.

This won’t enable you to shape your power as an omnipotent kind of energy that lets you warp reality, or anything like that, if you already didn’t have this kind of power, the ‘TLDR’ is that it just lets you use it efficiently with infinite precision.

As such, renouncing a Commandment or taking them lightly would be as renouncing one’s core ideals or just taking these strong beliefs lightly. It is a thought that normally only the hollow Man-Eating Demons would be able to practice. While you don’t require to be as devoid of regular emotions as they are, you are able to take their same approach to Commandments, and as such you are able to take Hollow Clothing Commandments. That is, you can take small-scale and temporary Commandments in exchange for lesser effects. These include vows such as renouncing your sight for a few moments in order to gain a short- scale future sight or vowing not to move for the next three minutes in order to gain teleportation for a minute. These Commandments will never be able to reach the potency of a punishing Commandment that completely directs the life of a person, but they grant a great variety to someone’s arsenal for just small inconveniences. In future worlds, whenever you can gain a power based on your convictions and ideals, you will also be able to take temporary and lesser powers by ‘dressing’ yourself under limited and hollow ideals."

      "source": "Avesta of Black and White",
      "chapter": "Source",
      "description": "The basis of most supernatural abilities in the First Heaven, the Commandment appears as a self-imposed limitation taken before the Avesta. It is a declaration against the world that reflects the warrior’s personality and ideology. By swearing to God to live in a certain way, you receive a boon in exchange. The nature of this boon varies greatly, since in the end it is up to the Truth to determine such a thing. Normally, a very restrictive bond would result in a greater power. Things such as vowing to always achieve victory, refusing any kind of companionship and living in solitude, or always fighting any being that establishes mutual recognition with one’s full strength. But there are other factors that may influence this result, such as the person’s own disposition and ideals. For example, a gentle being who took a vow of solitude would see a greater boon than those who are loners by nature. But also, those with great wills will see their Commandments also bear great results if it matches their nature, such as someone with a massive thirst for battle limiting themselves to not take any action that isn’t related to killing after establishing mutual recognition when another. And lastly, there is the own opinion of the Truth herself, who may grant better boons if she simply sees fit to do so, whether as part of her own plans or simply due to her own amusement or personal opinions of the person in fact. The vow you take is very important, because breaking it will incur a divine punishment. When this break is unintentional, this may result in your death via divine punishment, enforced by the Law of the Truth. But when this breakthrough of your Commandment results from a willing act, an event known as Forced Falling Down occurs, in which the breaker is forced to switch sides, resulting in a change of personality and power, almost always for the worse. While this indeed a dire thing, it is not as if most Commandments don’t have loopholes around their limitations. For example, Quinn’s Commandment makes her follow the orders of others to be able to act, and she cannot stop following other people’s orders. But the orders she receives are ranked in importance, so she can disregard someone’s orders as long as it is to fulfill a higher duty. Samrukh was also able to replace her lost limbs with prosthetics without violating her ‘do not heal yourself’ commandment. There is also the possibility for those who have outgrown the Law of this universe itself to rebel against the punishment and outright ignore it, or even use brute force to warp reality in a way that allows for breakthrough of one’s commandment without incurring in divine punishment, such as the usage of the Power of Ego to maintain multiple contradictory commandments as some Daeva do. Albeit, this last effect is something that even the most powerful Daeva struggle with, resulting at best in just pushing the line of what’s acceptable before a willing breakthrough rather than outright denying the punishment. Only those who are stronger than God or have the capability to replace her can actively ignore the punishment. Albeit, doing so means rebelling against the Truth and may incur in her wrath, being stricken via other means than a forceful Fall when that it is not possible. It is possible to take Commandments of limited duration, or which are active just until a condition is fulfilled. But this topic is purely academic stuff for almost everyone in the cosmos, usually no one would do this, nor could, for that matter. Commandments are strong beliefs and iron-clad held convictions, pridefully sworn as a particular way to face the world. It is impossible to replace them on a whim, as one would their clothing, unless one’s mentality and personality was hollow enough that they may not even be called human to begin with. Since everyone is required to take a commandment as part of reading deep enough into the Avesta, you too have gained yours. The exact wording of the Commandment is up to you, as well as its restrictions. Here you have two options: You may take whatever you have gained via this jump, with the exceptions of the ‘Star Spirit’ and ‘Will of the King’ purchases, and have it be a result of your boon, at no cost at all. It is not such a strange occurrence, even if it is the result of a single Commandment. Individuals Nahid or Vararam have proven that a single Commandment can result in a large amount of powers and boons. But if you like to, you may have actually taken multiple Commandments in the way that some powerful Daeva, or the heretic Yazata Magsarion, have done. The other option is to pay 200 CP and receive a Commandment similar to that gained by Quinn, Spenta Mainyu or Zaurid’s original Commandment. Basically, you get a boost in power by following a certain limitation but gain no real special powers from that. For 400 CP instead, you may decide to instead create Commandments with more exotic results, like those of Munsarrat’s second Commandment, Mashyana or Ferdows, but you may not take anything that it’s already a perk in this jump, as those are the result of very special circumstances, nor an effect that it’s stronger than the 600 CP perks. You can see examples of Commandments in the Notes section. Again, you may decide to purchase multiple Commandments here. Other abilities and items may interact with Commandments, further increasing their power if the compatibility is right. This is especially true with abilities related to your own will, like the Power of Ego that the Daeva wield. Once this jump ends, you may decide to stop being bound by your Commandment(s) in exchange for losing any potential boon that they may grant at will, no longer bound by the Avesta. You may decide to activate them again at the start of the next jump. This only applies to any abilities not derived from the perks that you purchase below. Breaking your Commandment won’t deprive you of your abilities, but will incur in divine punishment during your time here. May be Purchased Multiple Times"

In terms of Reiryoku, you’d have about twice as much as the average Captain and you’d be considered to have some level of mastery of your racial release state or unique power. Examples of this level are sparing but eye-catching. Byakuya Kuchiki of the Shinigami is an excellent showcase of the sort of overall level of skill and superb power available. A mighty warrior, skillful magician, intelligent leader and fine man. But clearly lesser than the true Shinigami veterans, such as Shunsui Kyoraku or Unohana Retsu. Among Hollows, the higher level Espada such as Starrk or Harribel are a clear example, likely making you a Vasto Lord yourself. To the Quincy, powerful Stern Ritter like Bambietta Basterbine or Mask de Masculine are your best choices. Make no mistake, you’re not the strongest with this or even on par with the second and third strongest tiers. The Royal Guard, the Quincy Schutzstaffel, thousand year old Shinigami Captains and more are all beyond you in power and skill, to say little of their leaders.

A very rare few, however, are born with energy that possesses unusual traits, unique to the individual. While not inherently more powerful, these properties are difficult for normal sorcerers to deal with, making it a potentially significant advantage in combat depending on how it is used. Now, your energy, too, has something rather unusual about it, a trait that sets it apart from the norm. This can be almost anything: perhaps your energy has an edge to it, allowing it to cut even when using bludgeoning attacks and being significantly more painful to get hit by than normal. Or maybe it has the properties of electricity, allowing you to shock your opponents with your blows, or perhaps even creating arcs of lightning with enough practice and control. While this doesn’t make your cursed energy directly stronger, it’s worth noting that reinforcing one’s body with cursed energy, the usual means of protecting against cursed energy-based attacks, is far less effective against defending against these traits than it is normal energy. Furthermore, you also gain a high level of resistance to whatever your trait may be: the aforementioned cursed energy with electrical properties would allow its user to shrug off lightning bolts without much issue, for example."

According to one demon, they are not just the manifestation of one's Gourmet Cells, but are in fact the embodiment of their hosts' \"appetites\" and are born from their hosts' desire for delicious food. Because of this, Appetite Demons have a strong gluttonous desire for delicious food, something they can crave so intensely that they may even go wild and posses their hosts when in the presence of something truly delicious.

This will create an opportunity, however small, for you to capitalize on and perhaps seize victory...but such chances, such miracles, will only happen once against said foe. I hope you use it wisely."

Other feats include things such as sending arrows imbued with your Heartforce that completely devour a person’s Truesoul and are blessed with such speed that they can't even be dodged by anyone in the same level as you . Heartforce also allows for higher control of the practitioner’s energy and increased power in all of their strikes, as long as they can afford the admittedly high energy requirements. This jade slip details the six known levels of Heartforce, and contains instructions on how to reach them, though actually getting there requires a certain level of skill and talent.

The understanding you develop with this piece of yourself, the bonds you forge and the loyalty between two comrades. There is where true power can be found. Forming such bonds with spirits or intelligent sources of power within your being allows you to increasingly improve the power of your bond. The closer you grow with your Zanpakuto, the more powerful their abilities will grow, the easier they are to use and the less costly their release is to maintain. Truly deep bonds can even reveal entirely new powers. The two of you coming together as one to discover new sides of yourselves and in doing so, uncovering similarly new abilities. Obtaining a deep level of intimacy, an intense bond and acceptance of each other, would make you far superior to an otherwise equal opponent that lacked this camaraderie with their blade. Once a true and full bond is created, you will have the opportunity to truly become one. Known as a Final Technique, undergoing this process will destroy the gap between the two of you and create a new being. Your dear ally does not die from this even if you can no longer perceive them as separate, instead rejoining you to become an integral part of who you are. The final release gained from this, for a Zanpakuto’s Final Technique, would be similar to a greatly enhanced version of their Bankai state. Unlike the few Zanpakuto who can perform similar techniques as a desperation measure, the complete affinity you and your sword forged will allow you to retain this state and your spiritual powers. The state itself is not permanent, acting similar to your previous releases, but it can be entered with a moments notice. It may even leave some changes on your body outside of it, a sign of the part of you that has rejoined the whole. This above process is not limited to pieces of your own soul. Any being that has a connection with you and exists within your being is open to it. It requires a genuine and sincere bond from each side, failing if either side knowingly falsifies it in some way. But even a Hollow or a Demon could become one with their host. The changes you experience from this combination are likely to be much more significant if used with a being that was not originally part of your own soul, as a fair warning."

Exposure to power will very slowly cause related powers to develop in you too. The constant presence of a uncontrolled source of spiritual power will quickly awaken your own spiritual awareness and very slowly unlock spirit powers of your own. This might mean gaining enhanced physical abilities and the power to create fire or even lucking into a more unique ability, if you had secret potential of your own. Achingly slow compared to naturally gained powers, you can still slowly develop in power and ability from exposure, then start training what you’ve gained intentionally. This isn’t limited to just supernatural power sources but long term exposure to intense sources of mundane power can be quite hazardous.

      "description": "Many centuries ago, some of the most powerful sorcerers in the world decided to cheat death. They became cursed objects, nigh-indestructible remnants of their former bodies imbued with their cursed energy, designed to last throughout the ages. Then, no matter how much time passes, if someone decides to ingest the cursed object, the cursed energy within will overwhelm the consumer, the host’s body being completely being taken over, and the sorcerer of old incarnating anew. Except, sometimes a host has a strong enough will to suppress their would-be possessor, gaining great power in the process. Now, like Yuji Itadori or Hana Kurusu, you are another such case, having consumed a cursed object and, against the odds, subjugated the cursed energy within. Strangely enough, though, the sorcerer the cursed object belonged to doesn’t seem too bothered by this turn of events. Unlike others, they have now have no desire to take control of your body for themselves, and are content to live in symbiosis with you. The personality, history, and other such details of this incarnated sorcerer are free for you to determine as you see fit. They’re little more than a passenger within your body, and as such are unable to use any of the abilities they had in life. At most, they can use their power to harmlessly manifest a mouth on your body, which they can use to verbally communicate with you and others. They can also draw your mind into their innate domain, an ‘inner world’ of their mind and soul of sorts, to talk with you face-to-face, though naturally this won’t be done without your consent. There are a number of benefits to having an ancient sorcerer sharing your body. The first is that their levels of cursed energy have now been added to yours – which, given that their amount of cursed energy exceeds the vast majority of modern sorcerers, is nothing to sneeze at. The second is that their presence offers a measure of protection to your mind and soul. Anyone trying to control, manipulate, or otherwise affect them against your will will face far greater resistance than usual as your symbiotic partner does their best to defend you, making it so even an exceptionally powerful special grade curse would struggle to do much of anything to you. Eventually, it may even be possible for you to learn how to use the innate cursed technique of the incarnated sorcerer within you. Such a thing will not be easy achieved, however, and will require not just a very strong rapport, but a great amount of training and experimentation before it even begins to be possible, and being able to use it proficiently will be further off still. You may purchase a technique from the Cursed Technique section at a discount, to represent their cursed technique. Otherwise, it will either be impossible for you to use their cursed technique, or they never possessed one to begin with."

While some individuals’ Heavenly Restrictions grant them great physical abilities in exchange for abnormally low levels of cursed energy, his was quite the opposite. Instead of a powerful body, he was born with several missing limbs, and lived in constant pain. In exchange, he gained something no other sorcerer could possess: the ability to use his cursed technique over incredible ranges. Somehow, though, you have achieved the same feat without having to sacrifice your physical condition in return. While they may not be any more powerful than before, the range of all of your techniques and supernatural abilities have been vastly increased. A technique that could only be used out to a maximum of a few hundred metres before, for instance, would now have a range that would allow you to use it anywhere in Japan with no loss in efficiency. Muta used this to great effect with his Puppet Manipulation technique, allowing him to puppeteer his cursed corpses as if he were right next to them while he remained in a bunker on the other side of the country. Of course, there is something of a restriction to this, that being the limits of your own perception. While your range may extend for hundreds of miles in theory, if you can’t see something that far away it’s not exactly going to be easy to use your techniques on them. With some creativity, or perhaps a technique that comes with the ability to perceive things at a distance beyond what your own eyes can see, though, this shouldn’t be too much of an issue."

It is well known that you are a saint or similar figure of your religion in this world, for all the good and ill that can do.

Eventually one of the Taotie was slain and the other was sealed away. The soul of the slain Taotie was sealed away within a child to hide it and to prevent anyone else from acquiring it. This was done since anyone who absorbed the soul would gain the powers of a Taotie and its sheer might. This perk allows you to gain a Taoties soul and to directly fuse with it. Alternatively you may choose another divine beast instead such as a Phoenix or Dragon. Doing so will give you different powers based on your choice. For example the Phoenix would give you powerful flames and regenerative abilities. Lastly this option will allow you to receive the power of true divine beast rather than the diluted bloodline."

While the Seventh Sense is a milestone, this one requires a miracle - enlightenment and understanding of one’s own death is the ‘easiest’ way to do so, and only after much meditation and training. It is possible to forcefully elevate yourself to this after mastering the Seventh Sense by tossing yourself headfirst into the Underworld or a similar hostile afterlife...but that is more likely to kill you for good. However, should this level be obtained, your feats in Cosmo are outmatched only by the much-stronger Gods and those who have unlocked this same sense, making you capable of sending entire galaxies into chaos with your strongest blows. In addition, it enables you to transcend life and death, letting you waltz out of the afterlife or exist within it as a living being, should you be sent there. It should be noted that while these Senses create very strong thresholds you must overcome through training and effort, it is possible to briefly push past your current limits through emotion and willpower, as well as extensively honing your Cosmo abilities through combat and knowledge."

Cosmo can enhance the physical body to incredible heights or manifest a vast variety of supernatural abilities, depending on the skill, knowledge, and race of the user in question. There are many degrees and levels of mastery and power with the use of Cosmo, but for the purposes of your time here, you will be quite incredible amongst Cosmo Users. As a Saint, you will have the average level of power and skill akin to that of a Gold Saint, meaning that you have long since unlocked the Seventh Sense. You have the power to destroy massive stellar objects and to move far faster than the speed of light. As a Titan, you will instead access the holy power of Dunamis, a divine equivalent to Cosmo. Darker and denser than Cosmo, it can be difficult to take hold of but you have largely mastered your use of it. You are equal to most of your Titan brethren in the use and power of it, putting you at a level that allows you to destroy entire galaxies and outmatch the Gold Saints with ease—right up until they do the impossible. While a Titan may have more power, a Saint has a natural tendency to do the impossible and perform miracles that allow them to reach far beyond the power they normally have access to. The battle between a Saint and Titan may at first look to be blatantly one-sided, but for a Gold Saint with the will to win, they can triumph even when they should be crushed without mercy."

However, personal power is still King, and if you continuously rely on this luck it might fail you at a crucial moment and lead to your death. As an added function for your convenience, you may dim the light you emit to nothing at all, if you do not feel like letting others bask in your glorious radiance.

There seems to be a limit to just how much of the mist you can have stored within your soul, however. Even though you’ll be able to fight a lot longer than a person who relies on their own energy, don’t think that you’ll be able to fight like that forever. Another thing to keep in mind is that fully comprehending these Seals in a short period of time was impossible even for Nuwa, who had mastered over eighty thousand Daos.

A desire to overthrow the God of the world (Truth) and impose a new Law into the cosmos, giving birth to a new universe. Not only is this a special disposition that is no longer tainted by the current Law, but also a special quality of your soul. That is, you have the qualifications for sitting on the Divine Throne, and spreading your Law by undergoing an apotheosis and becoming a God. As you are now, this untapped potential seems to be of little use. But with time, as long as you attune to your deepest craving, you may potentially begin to challenge this world in multiple ways, such as ignoring or limiting the effects of contradicting a Commandment, even negating the entire Law of the Avesta and Commandments all-together in a certain area. Eventually, you may ascend into godhood and challenge the current order. That is, you will start to emanate, repainting the world with your own color. And if your strength proves to be as great or greater than that of the current God, you may also dig into the Singularity, challenging them for the right to dye the entirety of creation with your color. However, this is not something that you can do immediately in most cases. Depending on your craving, the path to activate your Law and become a full-fledged God may require a costly undertaking, such as Sirius’ Paradise Lost requiring him to save ‘everyone’ personally before being able to fully emanate. And just like the Covetous Dragon, you can also decide to prevent yourself from emanating by not following your desire, but once you realize it you won't be able to stop yourself. At least not just with this potential. And that might be a wise decision if you aren’t strong enough yet to challenge the sitting Godhead. It may even be possible that your own actions, should they lead you to take a path that goes against your own Law, such as taking a Commandment that goes against your very own ideal existence, may make it impossible to fully emanate until you fully accept your own craving and discard the other limitations. By default, this craving is manifested as a Hegemony type. However, you may also decide to be self-centered beyond reason, and instead of seeking to change the world, seek to reach your own ideal self. Thus, you may decide to take the path of Transcendence and instead become a Transcendence God. You won’t be able to emanate, but you will also be able to use the power of the Big Bang, or as it will be known in other eras, Taikyoku or Atziluth. Be advised that Transcendence Gods may only manifest in multiverses, as they are a living universe, they cannot exist in those universes, like that of Ahura Mazda, where only a single universe exists, for those who follow this path cannot replace the Godhead."

Mantra is basically a generalist spell casting-system that you now are proficient in using. You start with 2 minor Mantra of your choice and are able to learn more by watching other practitioners, perform trial and error for discovering new Mantras, or by being taught directly (the latter option being the safest option)! Though using Mantra does come at the cost of a portion of the conjurer’s soul or transcendent vigor per cast, which can be recovered with long periods of rest. Overexhaustion will result in the conjurer turning into a “Spirit of Corrosion” - an amorphous black balloon with large jaws, hand tentacles, and red eyes; a fate worse than death according to some (and will count as a Jump Failure for you).

The first is the ability to create illusions, overlaying visual phantasms over an area. It’s maintained by your energy and the complexity you can manage will increase as your power does, similar to how you might learn to cover more of the five senses as you grow stronger. Unfortunately, it’s a lot easier to get out of these illusions, as they exist on the environment and not within people’s minds. All it takes is leaving the area to be free. The other option is teleportation. You’ll be able to teleport yourself and anyone you’re touching to any location within range, the range being dictated by your Reiryoku. Even at weak levels, it should be enough to zip about a town the size of Karakura. You can also create wormholes that can act as portals, for transporting many over time or to redirect attacks by quickly creating multiple portals. It’s even possible to create a portal to nowhere, effectively erasing things that enter the portal by locking them in some unknown dimension. Some foes might be able to break out if they have their own transportation abilities however. A second purchase of this, discounted if you use your second discount, can be made to gain the other option."

Known as Decay, floral patterns spread along where you hit them, and their bodies begin to decay from the inside out. It’s not a hugely fast process – even if you manage to get a fair deal inside someone it could still take ten or more minutes before killing them, and hours until their bodies become naught but bone – but it is highly painful, regardless. It's worth noting that while it doesn’t have a maximum range, the Decay technique needs to be actively maintained – if you release it at any time, the decay will instantly stop and you’ll need to get your blood into your target once again. You also don’t have much control over your own blood: you can spew it from your mouth in a spray, or shoot out many fast-moving lines of blood from yourself if you truly master the technique, but that’s about it. Regardless, it’ll never be capable of the same level of control and versatility of Blood Manipulation, nor reach the same raw power as Piercing Blood – and with this technique alone, you’ll still need to worry about running out of blood."

While any part of the body can be used by this, the larger it is, the more effective the technique will be: a hand or internal organ will make it much stronger than a hair or some blood, for example.

No, binding vows can also be made with others. This often takes the form of a contract between two parties, where both agree to a certain set of conditions, most often certain actions they must do for the other party. Unlike in a self-imposed vow, however, the penalty for breaking a binding vow with another is much more harsh. Though the exact details of what will transpire will vary from vow to vow, the punishment is severe enough that even the most powerful of sorcerers and cursed spirits do their utmost to honour such agreements. Usually, these require that both parties are capable of manipulating cursed energy. You, however, can apply the principles of a binding vow with anyone, regardless of whether they can use jujutsu or not. When you make an agreement with someone or a group of people, you can choose to make the terms nigh-inviolable as described above. All parties involved will understand that breaking the terms of the contract will result in them suffering severe penalties, far worse than any gain they might have received from not honouring the vow. Naturally, this isn’t a one-sided thing: you, too, will face consequences for breaking such a deal. However, it’s important to note that abusing loopholes in the vow’s wording doesn’t count as breaking it. If you agree to kill someone, for example, killing them and then immediately reviving them afterwards is completely acceptable unless explicitly agreed otherwise."

The first form is black rods, similar to the ones created by the Outer Path but have some different usages that enable you to manipulate the actions of others or even directly control their bodies through implanting these rods into them. The second form is a malleable and sentient construct, similar to the Black Zetsu created by Kaguya. This being will be absolutely loyal to you and has the same intelligence as you, as well as having the same innate abilities of Black Zetsu, being able to control the actions of others by coating itself over their bodies and essentially possessing them. There is no specific limit to how many beings like him you can create and maintain, but the amount of chakra required to do it is a limiting factor."

Masters of the bow, the spear, the blade and more besides, their skills were worthy of every bit of power that was ascribed to them. But it certainly didn’t stop certain tools being favoured and that very power meant that things would often be forced to fit the hero, rather than the hero adapting to his situation. You discover the ability to force your weapons, tools and even unique abilities or attacks to take on new shapes to suit your desires. A legendary bow might transfigure to become a sword in your hand, it’s effects altering to become suitable to a close ranged form while remaining as faithful as possible. An arrow might instead be subsumed into your form and become a powerful laser emitted from your eye, now requiring a supply of mana to replace the arrow’s physical form. It is a change of medium, not of the innate abilities of the targets, but even entire vehicles could be potentially affected. It is the hero who decides the way battle is fought, not the weapons he is given to wield."

The many restrictions and honourable rules that the noble warriors supposedly lived under were fabrications of a later age. Mostly. There were indeed good men who bound themselves in vows and promises to show their morality, as well as those who did so to restrain their own dark sides. But the sacrifices made through a warrior’s vow can have it’s own benefits, the loss becoming new power for battle. You are able to take vows that restrict your own life, receiving increases to your overall combat ability in exchange. The more restrictive the vow is to you personally, the more significant the increase. Sacrificing a few hours of your time in prayer each week would be a minor boost in power at best, whereas constant limitations such as never breaking your word or always fighting in an honorable manner could improve your power by half or even double the normal level. Breaking a restriction removes the benefit and applies a proportionate penalty to your power on top, as well as a damaged mental state. These penalties will disappear in time and slowly removing a vow over a few days will allow you to drop the restrictions without cost. A vow’s power is based on how it affects you personally at the current moment, something strong for others but weak for you will give weak benefits."

Using multi-coloured flames or by borrowing the energy of heaven and earth, one can enhance an object to increase its strength. Used on weapons they can become stronger, sharper. Souls become more hardy and powerful. Pills have their effects boosted. These enhancements can be stacked as well, each additional enhancement increasing the previous effect tenfold. A normal wooden sword will grow many times stronger from the get go, while a Celestial level treasure will have negligible gains until the twenty first enhancement. Each step takes more energy, or colours of flame, and has an increased chance of failure, with failure leading to the destruction of the spiritual energy of the object, the object itself consequently becoming useless too. Your will power and confidence will have a marked effect on the success rate of enhancing. In fact, the more a practitioner succeeds, the more confident they become, and therefore the more often they succeed. But the opposite is also true. You have something of an affinity for spirit enhancing, and as such your success rate, and progression in the art, is much better than most cultivators, putting you in the top percentile wherever you go."

As with the more typical hungry ghosts, this is the lower, animal elements of the soul turned restless spirit, and appears as a smoky, translucent image of yourself, the arms and armor it might be adorned with merely cosmetic. These trappings of armament and mortality fade when it attacks, revealing a leathery, vulpine body with enormous talons and slavering jaws. But while most hungry ghosts are turned vicious and feral by improper treatment of their mortal remains, yours yet remains connected to you and will follow whatever commands you give it. As the po soul of an Exalt, it is already much more powerful than a normal hungry ghost due to the Essence on which the soul can batten itself, and it shall further grow in power as you do. Aside from its wraithly savagery in battle, it can also serve as a relentless bloodhound and tracker, able to sense the presence of spilt blood and follow the scent of bloodshed from miles away. Strong, swift, and deadly, it naturally materializes upon sensing potential prey, turning back into an immaterial presence when no prey is present, yet may still pass through solid obstacles when material in order to flee overwhelming opposition or approaching sunrise. But while it possesses a predatory cunning with which to hunt down and tear apart your foes, it does not have much ability to improvise beyond murder and thirsts for living blood. It dematerializes at sunrise to flee back to your body, as other hungry ghosts would return to rest in their improperly-interred corpses, for the light of the sun would blast it to ash. And if it should it be slain, your lower soul will return to you ripped and torn, an event which will burn and stun your mind for a time. Should you learn the secrets of necromancy required to bind your lower soul to your shadow, through the Links Born of Tumult, the Essence-suffused shadow it is merged with further empowers your hungry ghost. Beyond the Essence-charged might and the benefits usually granted by the spell, your hungry ghost will be a monster cast in your shadowed and smoky image. It shall wield a mighty panoply of three great powers, each an unique expression of vast and terrifying might, reminiscent of the powers of Labyrinth and Void Circle spells. And when it moves to attack, its monstrous form will resemble a chthonic abomination straight from the nightmares of the Neverborn."

      "description": "A special art discovered by Koga Kuchiki, thought to be taught only to his own blade. Yet the method to use the technique was eventually found by another. With only a small expenditure of energy, you are able to create invisible threads of spiritual energy from your body, controlled with ease through only slight movements. While the threads can physically manipulate objects, their strength and durability decided by your own energy invested, their main purpose is to ‘invade’ other things with your Reiryoku. Once connected, you are able to manipulate the minds and bodies of other things, the former being much easier than the latter. The reiryoku that is within the enemy’s body allows for illusions to be crafted, affecting all five of their normal senses. The quality and complexity of the illusions is largely based on your skill and creativity with this technique, improving with practice from the simple images you can form now. On the physical side, the threads can immobilise those not more powerful than you without much difficulty and weaker beings might be able to be controlled like dolls. The threads can be cut or destroyed if hit from a sufficiently powerful source and the illusions have a special weakness. Anyone who closes off their hearts to you, feeling no empathy or strong emotions towards you, is able to negate the effect."

      "description": "A cursed technique that activates perhaps without you even being conscious of it, you’re able to store “miracles” you experience in your life for later use. Whenever you encounter a small, everyday miracle – which could be something as simple as seeing a digital clock when all the digits of the time are the same – it is erased from your memory and stored. Then, whenever you would take a fatal blow or are in genuine danger, these miracles are released, allowing you to survive through sheer luck. For example, if the ceiling were above you were destroyed and you were about to get crushed, a miracle might cause all of the falling rubble to land around you instead of on you. Or, if someone were to punch you in the face hard enough to kill you instantly, you might instead only lose a few teeth and go flying, your would-be killer assuming you’re dead. Though you’re not innately aware of how many miracles you have stored up, there is a visual indication available to you. A number of triangular markings are visible on your body – when you have a miracle stored they become filled in with colour, but become just an outline when this is expended. By default these are located under your eyes, but can be found elsewhere if you choose. You can have up to six miracles stored at a time."

      "description": "While quite a few different techniques for countering domains exist, none possess the same offensive capability as Domain Amplification. A rather complex ability, it involves coating oneself with a thin layer of their own Domain, as if surrounded by water. This has the effect of preventing the user from being targeted by the guaranteed hit effect of a Domain Expansion, but also comes with a useful secondary effect: neutralising the cursed technique of anyone it comes into contact with. Now, you too are more than capable of using this rare technique, one few even know exist. Its power is such that it can even overcome a cursed technique as powerful as Limitless, bypassing its incredible defence to hit the user directly. However, there are two drawbacks to Domain Amplification: one is that the user is unable to use their cursed technique at all while it’s in effect, and the other is that its technique- neutralising effect can be counteracted by pouring enough energy into a cursed technique. Generally, the more energy you put into Domain Amplification, the harder it will be for other techniques to overcome its neutralisation. Needless to say, you can use Domain Amplification to counter supernatural abilities than rely on sources other than cursed energy, too."

For example, using the extension technique known as Flowing Red Scale, a user is capable of adjusting their body temperature, pulse rate, red blood cell count, and the composition of their blood in order to vastly increase their physical abilities, enough to disappear from someone’s sight in the blink of an eye. The blood outside of your body can be controlled too, such as by coating an arrow in it to let you change its trajectory in mid-flight. As such, Blood Manipulation is more than capable of being used at all ranges. Of course, there are also more directly offensive uses of Blood Manipulation. Forming a net out of one’s blood to restrain an opponent, creating spinning disc-shaped projectiles to slice others apart from afar, producing shields of blood to protect yourself from blows, or shaping blood into a knife and rotating it at high speeds to enhance its cutting ability are all possible uses. The most potent, however, is likely Piercing Blood: by condensing one’s blood as much as possible until it becomes a tiny bead then clapping it between one’s hands, the user can fire their blood in a straight line at velocities exceeding the speed of sound. Despite its power and versatility, the greatest weakness of Blood Manipulation lies in its medium. To counteract the blood loss this technique incurs, users often carry around blood packs or prepare blood-coated weapons in advance. With great skill, users can recycle any blood they use and bring it back into their body, though this expends a lot of energy."

      "description": "Cursed energy is capable of great many things, but it does have its limitations. As an innately negative form of energy, it is impossible to use it to heal oneself or others in its base form, for instance. Yet there is a way around this: a method known as reverse cursed technique. By multiplying cursed energy against itself, it instead becomes a ‘positive’ form of energy, and thus can be used to heal. While this sounds simple, it’s a rather complex thing in practice, with many talented sorcerers being unable to grasp the process. You, however, don’t struggle with this at all, being a true master of reverse cursed technique. The most obvious benefit this gives you is the ability to heal yourself as well as others through physical contact. Though you may leave some scars behind for more serious wounds, with this you’re capable of healing anything from cuts and bruises to slit throats and missing limbs. The more severe the injury and the faster you wish to heal it, however, the more energy will be required, and there are certain things that are more difficult to cure. Poisons, for example, take a lot of concentrated effort to neutralise, and damage to the soul cannot be healed at all. This is only one use of reverse cursed technique, though: significantly, it can also be used in conjunction with one’s cursed technique. By powering one’s cursed technique using the positive energy generated through reverse cursed technique, its effect becomes reversed. A technique that pulled people closer would be made to repel them, while one that weakened gravity in an area would amplify it instead. While any user of reverse cursed technique would be able to use this, purchasing this perk allows you to apply this reversal of effects to any other supernatural powers you may possess."

Beyond that skill, it also enchants anything affected to be a fairly powerful magical tool. While they’re far from an Excalibur, the enchantments are still quite useful, allowing the weapons to possess unnatural durability or fire magical blasts of significant power. Even a gun might find each bullet now possessing enough power to meaningfully harm some supernatural foes. Knight of Owner has no size limitation on what it can affect, so long as you see it and everything within that might be affected as a weapon first. Even a jet fighter or battleship can be affected, with your weaponising aura allowing you to control affected vehicles by thought alone. Lastly, the power will also override control over things that would normally have special requirements for you to use, such as a Noble Phantasm that only the wielder can use via magical rules, a gun that is DNA-locked to specific people or just a car that you need a key for."

This enhancement isn’t much, no more than 1% at most, but there is no limit to this increase as well as it affects all your capabilities (physical, mental, abilities, perks). You are also able to summon any of these past victims (with no limit) as thrall soldiers for you to command. These thralls hold all of the victim's past abilities and memories but they will be scaled down by half of their usual attributes. It should also be noted that each soldier will be entirely composed of Nothingness, making them highly toxic to touch and under your complete control; giving you awareness of all thralls, able to communicate and see through them, and being able to summon or unsummon your thralls at will. Any thralls that are destroyed can be resummoned in a week unless they are used as a sacrifice for another one of your or another one’s abilities. Requires Agent Of Nothing(600cp). Possibility to purchase the perk for a discount of 300 cp alongside Cull."

Darkness covers the entire sky, causing the land to fall into shadow. Lightning strikes down from the dark clouds as the surroundings can no longer be seen. The land around breaks down and a giant hole appears in which a giant hand rises up and drags him down. Inside is a dark space like an underground cave but with a spacious area. Within this area lies the 13 most powerful demons within the Abyss. From here, you can choose a demon and borrow its strength for a limited amount of time, however to use such power one must make a contract with these demons and the price is always something the user holds dear, as these cunning demons never make a losing exchange. Should you get this skill, in future jumps it will entrap beings in the same level as the demons of the abyss are in your current setting allowing the user to channel their power, you will maintain the power you obtain from them and other beings through others jumps. If this ability is mastered and evolved, then it’s possible to trap beings you defeat within it, creating something akin to Hell, those who are sealed within it would be eternally bound to the user."

This also allows you to read the minds of others by touching them or their blood, even fully synchronizing with the five senses if the opposing party allows it. Be aware that some may resist this effect by their own power, or have a mentality so warped and alien that trying to understand them becomes impossible. Also, you can read memories. As you gather these prayers, you are able to perform miracles in the same way that the great heroes could. Not only that, but you can also concentrate these prayers into those who gather around you, granting them temporary boosts that may allow exceptional Yatazas, assuming the forces of good are relevant enough at time, to fight against even Special Rank Daeva. And for the last of your abilities, you are able to turn yourself into a sword, which would require a godly level of strength to be damaged, and thus could also be used to slay even the gods in the right hands.

With a single punch using this you could exorcise a special grade cursed spirit, or severely injure a special grade sorcerer and send them flying despite using their cursed energy to reinforce their body. As such, your striking power is completely unparalleled. There’s no limit to the amount of mass you can add to yourself, the amount that you gain only being restricted by the cursed energy you put in. However, although it is almost immeasurably high, there is a point at which you start to become affected by the virtual mass you add: the point at which you become so heavy that your body condenses into a black hole. Though by your will you can suppress it so that it only affects a certain radius around you and disappears after a certain amount of time, unrestrained this is a true black hole, able to destroy the entire world. Unless you have some way to survive this, it’s probably best to keep it in reserve as a last resort. Your cursed technique also inherently comes with a shikigami: a bony, serpentine creature known as Garuda, with eight small wings that allow it to fly. The main use of Garuda is to enhance the variety of your own attacks, as you can also apply Star Rage’s effects to it. You could grasp it by the tail and swing it like a whip, make it roll up into a ball and throw it as a projectile, or command it to ensnare someone and weigh them down. It’s also capable of attacking separately from you, and to great effect if you use your technique to bolster it. Though it can be killed, it will revive after 24 hours if this happens. The only real downside to this technique is that, because the mass it adds is virtual, your tensile strength doesn’t increase with it, making you only as durable as you would normally be."

      "description": "You’ve gained access to the hereditary cursed technique of the Zenin Clan, which focuses on summoning shikigami (familiars similar to cursed spirits, often with abilities of their own) using specific hand signs and one’s shadow as a medium. As its name implies, the Ten Shadows Technique has ten shikigami that can be summoned through it, with more powerful shikigami requiring more cursed energy to summon. By default a user begins with only the first available to them: the Divine Dogs, a pair of wolves, one black and one white, that can be used to defeat weaker curses and for tracking. To gain access to the other nine shikigami, the user must first summon them using a ritual. When brought out in this way they will initially be hostile, but will fall under the user’s command if they can defeat them without any outside help. Eight of the other shikigami are as follows, with the ninth currently being unknown: Nue, a masked bird large enough to lift someone into the air and carry them for a short distance. Aside from its ability to fly decently fast, the main draw of Nue is its ability to produce electricity from its wings that it fire off at-will, which can hit hard enough to exorcise weaker opponents and even stun relatively strong ones for a while. Toad is a man-sized version of exactly what its name implies. It doesn’t have any impressive abilities, its only notable feature beings its tongue, which extends relatively quickly and is strong enough to lift and throw human targets with ease. Great Serpent is an enormous white snake, large enough for a human to easily fit within its mouth and long enough to reach dozens of metres into the air. If it has any special abilities, they aren’t known. Max Elephant is a pink elephant with the ability to output large amounts of water from its trunk, enough to flood a wide corridor or a room in moments, and with enough force to barrel a man off his feet. It also happens to be rather heavy, more than enough to crush someone if you dropped it on them from above. Rabbit Escape is a swarm of hundreds of white rabbits. They’re each about as strong as a regular rabbit, so this shikigami is mainly used to distract or confuse an opponent. They can be directed to work together though, piling up on each other to create simple structures like walls or hollow balls. Round Deer is a four-eyed deer large enough to fill a corridor. Its main use lies not in direct combat, but in its ability to use reverse cursed technique, which can be used to both heal the user and counteract cursed energy used against them. Piercing Ox is rather simple, taking the form of a black ox. It doesn’t have any abilities other than charging straight towards things to ram them and it can only move in a straight line, but the longer it charges the more powerful it becomes, to the point that it can knock back one of the most powerful sorcerers of the Heian era with a brief windup. Mahoraga is the strongest shikigami by far, taking the form of a large, powerfully- built humanoid with two feathered wings in place of each eye, a blade attached to its right arm, a snake-like tail extending from the back of its head, and an eight-pronged wheel hovering above its back. Even with its physical abilities alone it’s a threat to even the strongest sorcerers, hitting hard enough to punch its foes through several buildings, and the blade on its arm, the Sword of Extermination, is a cursed tool coated in positive energy, which is anathema to cursed energy and especially cursed spirits. Its most powerful ability, though, is its power to adapt to the whatever it faces. If it or its user is hit by an attack, the wheel above its head will begin to rotate, and when it has made a full revolution it will have fully adapted. An attack that worked on it before will no longer affect it – similarly, if it encounters a defence it can’t pierce it will adapt in order to overcome it. It doesn’t just stop at once it has though, but instead continues to search for better, more effective adaptations. For example, when it initially came into contact with Gojo’s Limitless, it first changed the very nature of its cursed energy to overcome it, then switched to cutting space itself to bypass its defence entirely. As a result of this power, though, no sorcerer of the Zenin family has ever succeeded in subjugating it. In addition to the shikigami above, it’s possible to temporarily fuse several shikigami into a single summon, combining their forms and abilities at the cost of increased cursed energy usage. Users are also capable of using their own shadow to store objects, though they still experience the weight of anything kept inside, and even entering other shadows in order to hide inside of them. Aside from the aforementioned limitation on which shikigami can be summoned, there is another major flaw: any shikigami that is destroyed will be unable to be summoned again. Fortunately, it’s possible to dismiss any shikigami with a thought, whereupon they will be fully healed when resummoned, and the energy of any dead shikigami will be inherited by the others who survive, empowering them proportional to the defeated one’s strength. Merged shikigami are also not subject to this, their constituent shikigami not being permanently destroyed upon the fusion’s death. Any dead shikigami will optionally be restored after ten years or at the start of the next Jump, whichever comes first."

It has no combat ability on its own, but is instead a vital part of Deadly Sentencing, the Domain Expansion that is inherent to your technique. Upon activating your Domain, you and your target are brought into a courtroom where all violence is forbidden, with all parties being completely unable to harm the other. Instead of physical combat, however, those within are forced to engage in a trial, with you as a prosecutor, the target the defendant, and Judgeman as the impartial judge. Judgeman inherently knows everything about everyone in the Domain (though you do not share this knowledge), and will use this knowledge to accuse the defendant of a crime they committed. Furthermore, as the prosecutor you will also be given an envelope containing evidence related to the trial, though it is not necessarily conclusive, and only you will know that is inside. This evidence could, for example, be a photograph of the defendant at the scene of the crime they were accused of committing. Without knowing the evidence, the defendant is tasked with making a statement to prove their innocence, though they may choose to remain silent or confess if they see fit. You may then use the evidence given to you to present a rebuttal. Once both statements have been made, Judgeman will render a verdict based solely on them. If the defendant is deemed innocent, the Domain will end. If they are found guilty, however, Judgeman will sentence the defendant, resulting in a punishment. Though more severe crimes tend to result in worse punishments, even you can’t be sure which one it will be. One sentence given by Judgeman is confiscation, which will cause the defendant to lose access to their cursed technique – or, if they lack one, their cursed energy. The harshest is the death penalty with confiscation, which will not only apply the above effect but also give you the Executioner’s Sword – a blade of light that will instantly kill anyone cut by it without exception, though it can only be used upon the defendant given the death sentence. In addition to the above, you’re also able to summon a special cursed tool with your technique in the form of a gavel. This cursed tool can change its shape according to your will, such as by extending its handle for greater range, turning it into an enormous mallet to crush your foes, or even giving it a level of fluidity, allowing it to weave past their defences and catch them with a hooked head. So long as it’s still vaguely hammer-like, it’s possible. You can also summon and dispel it with a thought. There are only a few limitations to this technique. One is that in order to use Deadly Sentencing, you must explain the rules of the Domain to the defendant. The other is that so long as the target denies their guilt they may request a retrial, which will forcibly open the Domain once again, though they will be tried on a different charge the second time around."

      "description": "You’re can use Limitless, the cursed technique of the Gojo family. This, in short, is the ability to bring infinity into reality, which in practice functions as a form of space manipulation. In its most basic form, referred to as Infinity, this takes a layer of space surrounding the user’s body and extends it into infinity. Functioning similarly to Zeno’s paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, anything that approaches you gets caught in this space, slowing down as it gets closer until stopping entirely, never actually reaching you. This acts like an impenetrable forcefield surrounding you in practice, with any attacks sent your way being unable to actually hit you. There are some ways, however, to breach this defence: techniques or cursed tools that nullify cursed techniques, effects that bypass space entirely, and attacks that cannot miss, such as from a Domain Expansion, are all known examples. Limitless isn’t restrained to being used defensively, however: it also has several potent offensive uses. Blue is the amplified form of Limitless, which acts as the ability to attract by manifesting negative distance into reality. The effects of this are broad: it can be used to pull things towards you, tear apart buildings brick by brick, or something as precise as crushing someone’s limbs by affecting several different parts of them with Blue. It doesn’t just have to pull things towards you, either – it can also be used to pull things towards a specific point in space, often manifesting as a blue orb of energy that functions like a black hole that can be moved at-will, or even to pull you towards a specific point in order to act as a form of high-speed movement. There also exists an inverse form of Blue, known as Red, which requires mastery of reverse cursed technique in order to use. As Blue’s opposite, Red acts instead as the ability to repel. While used in a similar manner to Blue, Red is at least twice as powerful, and often takes the form of a small ball of blood red energy – a direct hit is more than enough to blow a large hole through most things it hits, or at the very least send a target flying for hundreds of metres with enough force to tear apart the entirety of their surroundings. The most powerful form of Limitless is Hollow Technique: Purple, the fusion of Blue and Red. By combining attraction and repulsion, an imaginary mass is created in the form of a large ball of purple energy, then shot forth. The power of this cannot be understated: while it doesn’t literally erase anything it touches, it might as well do for most matter it comes into contact with, leaving only empty space in its wake. Only those standing at the absolute peak of this world in terms of power and skill, would be able to resist it, and even then not without serious injuries. There are more uses of Limitless besides these. It can, for instance, be used to teleport the user and anything they’re touching long distances. It has been stated certain conditions are required for this to function, though unfortunately these are currently unknown. The main flaw of Limitless is its complexity: without also possessing the Six Eyes, it’s almost impossible to use effectively due to the immense precision and high energy costs required."

Jogo’s pyrokinetic abilities, for example, allowed him to create enormous blasts of flame from his hands capable of burning down vast areas and seriously wounding or killing grade 1 sorcerers. Aside from this, he was also capable of generating small volcanos to emerge from surfaces at a distance and violently erupt; producing fist-sized ‘Ember Insects’ while flew towards a target, attempted to sting them (to unknown effect), then exploded; and even creating an enormous flaming meteor capable of destroying much of Shibuya. Hanami’s ability, on the other hand, allows for the creation and manipulation of plants with various special abilities. On the simpler end, this can be used to produce various wooden constructs: roots to entangle and throw enemies about; spikes of wood that emerge out of the ground; vast masses of roots the size of a large building; and balls of wood from which branches can emerge mid-flight to skewer those around it. On the more complex end, this can also be used to produce such things as a field of flowers that distracts and disorients those caught in it or buds that drain the cursed energy of whoever they latch onto."

While some of them emerged naturally thanks to mutations, many of them have some kind of connection with the Ōtsutsuki clan, being wielded by Kaguya’s descendants, but these inherited gifts became diluted and much weaker than their original versions, the kekkei mōra used by our clan. In a few words, the kekkei genkai usually are just pale imitations of the kekkei mōra. For example, the kekkei genkai version of Shikotsumyaku allows the user to manipulate and control their own skeletal structure while the kekkei mōra not only allows it on a greater degree, but also make their bones completely lethal to living beings, making them to deteriorate and disintegrate at a molecular level after piercing them. You can choose a kekkei genkai to receive its kekkei mōra version, gaining an incredibly high power boost, new abilities and/or removing its limitations, on par with the power of the All-Killing Ash Bones technique. It’s up to you to choose the specifics and attributes of this kekkei mōra. For example, if you choose the Ketsuryūgan, your Ketsuryūgan, as a kekkei mōra, would be able to easily enter into your targets’ minds without any difficulty and its iron manipulation would become powerful enough to control even solid iron at a molecular scale and not only liquid with a high iron concentration, like blood, as well as being able to cause much more alterations and mutations by manipulating blood within their bodies than just making them larger or exploding them. You can’t choose kekkei mōra granted by other perks in this Jump (like the Rinnegan, Sharingan, Rinne Sharingan, Byakugan and the Tenseigan) and techniques that are classified as kekkei mōra. You can also choose to upgrade elemental kekkei genkai. This can be purchased multiple times."

But perhaps you took this quite too literally, as you have started to become one with your weapon of choice. It will take time for this process to start taking place. At least a couple of years of using a weapon constantly will be needed for it to begin, and a few more to finalize. But once you are done, your abilities will fuse together with that of your weapon, allowing you to channel magnified versions of whatever powers your weapon had, infusing other items or weapons with the same powers and even create copies out of thin air of the weapon you fused with, all of an extremely high quality. Finally, you are able to temporarily bring your body to an existence closer to the weapon you are fused with at will, allowing you to gain increased defensive capabilities, as a sword is harder to break than a human. This however has the drawback of making your articulations stiffer the closer you bring yourself to your absorbed weapon, to the point that you may lose any movement capability until you undo the transformation if you go too close into your ‘weapon mode’. You can only fuse with a single weapon at a time, but unlike Ragna, you can undo the fusion process and choose another weapon to begin fusing with."

If you could find some way to maintain the presence of the sun in a condition similar to the hours of power you have, you might even gain this boost for longer than normal.

But the world needs those ridiculous, absurd, wonderful heroes just as much as it needs the realistic, practical kings. The charisma of a hero is not the sort that leads nations but the kind that binds people to you personally, making those you fight alongside or save into close friends in short order and lifelong comrades without much more effort. You might not give people faith in your governance but you inspire people with the hope that they can follow you out of any darkness they find themselves in. But a hero is much more than just their charisma. The brilliant holy light shines forth from you, a sign of the great power you hold. You are able to use this light, a powerful form of magic, to enhance your physical body to move beyond sound itself or smash through castles like a house of cards, even letting off mana bursts, flashes and blasts of light in different forms. As part of your heroic experiences until now, you are also highly capable with most traditional forms of weaponry for knights and heroes, like the sword and lance and bow. The light greatly empowers your offensive and defensive abilities against the foes of your religion and those beings that call the darkness their home, letting you cut through heretics and devils like you were thrice as strong as normal and making you similarly tougher to their returning strikes. Lastly, for whatever whim of the heavens causes it, the light continuously acts to put you in the most dramatic of scenes and visions, ensuring that everyone that looks on you can’t help but think- that hero is simply the coolest thing. Charlemagne would be proud."

However, this is not the most valuable part of the technique. When fully mastered, the Eight-Nine Arcane Art allows the user’s body to become harder than weapons made to kill Pure Yang True Immortals, beings capable of easily standing on the surface of a star. There is, however, a cost to this technique, which is the absolutely mind boggling amount of spirit pills required to forge the user’s body into something greater, more than even most Daofathers can afford. However, as amazing as that version of the technique is, this one details how to move past even that level, and is capable of turning your body into something comparable to a Chaos Weapon, allowing you to survive attacks that would end entire Major worlds without even flinching. Before practicing that part, however, you need to break through to the level that Nuwa had been born into, The Elder God level, and find an even more ridiculous amount of treasures and essence in order to train to it."

When that light peers through your most common actions, such as a simple smile, it becomes capable of charming almost all sentient beings with little effort. You become an idol, an object of worship, respect and protection for almost anyone who witnesses you. Only those with the strongest wills may be able to resist the natural charm of your existence. This is not a coincidence or an exceptional occurrence. Originally, you were meant to be the Hero of this generation. The greatest good that would face off against the Kings of Evil, and bring change to the current cycle. At least, that was the plan. Instead, your rights were lost due to an unaccounted for anomaly. However, God, who originally bestowed you with such a role, saw fit to compensate you. Instead of taking the role of the Hero, your new status made you become the most prominent person under the Heavens. That is, you had the ability to charm and command anyone but those who stand equal or above the Heavens, those with the wills to defy God or the Gods themselves. This is especially potent when it comes to commanding nature itself. As extensions of the Avesta, Star Spirits, some of the mightiest existences of this universe, are completely under control. You are able to communicate with them even from across galactic or intergalactic distances, drawing them to you under your command. This is a control that transcends the Avesta, and only those with a latent universal divinity of their own may resist you. Once you have put enough of these spirits under your control, your may condense all of existences into a singular point, allowing you to craft a weapon that contains the accumulated powers and abilities of all who were put under your command. This weapon is naturally just as subservient to your will as the spirits were, and can be freely summoned or diminished at will. In future jumps, your existence will be recognized as equally predominant, and those spirits and manifestations of the natural forces that are below the cosmic scale will be forced under you in the same way."

Similarly, you could also trade injuries in a fight for receiving special powers, or subtracting those from your enemies. Perhaps something like losing an arm would see you stealing your foe’s arm and gaining some of their abilities. Of course, there is a limit to this.

The fusion of a human and a silver sword due to continuous use, and maybe some other freakish modifications and coincidences. The Silver Arts are not properly a magical ability, but rather an ability that exists to combat magic. They confer the user a physical power and speed nigh unrivaled, on the same realm of those that even only a handful Seija can hope to reach. Destroying large castle wards with a punch and sending someone flying kilometers away with a kick, just to get near them again in less than a tenth of a second is just some of one starting to grasp the potential of the Silver Arts could accomplish. Your touch is deadly to any dragons, being instantly frozen the moment you extend your hand towards them. You can even do this with several dragons in a large area, freezing dozens of them by releasing your silver aura. The same goes for their magical power, which either gets completely frozen and broken by your touch, or at least makes you highly resistant to them. In future worlds, this would extend to all sorts of magic-based creatures, although the strongest of them may be able to resist this power, needing to combine it with your strength and speed to break through their defenses before being able to use your silver aura on their cores. The fusion within your Silver Sword has granted you the ability of summoning silver swords from thin air, all an extreme quality, as well as infusing other silver swords or weapons with your potent silver aura power. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with this power, as even more uses could be mastered with enough battle experience and training. Normally this power would possess a deathly toll onto the body, with continuous use probably killing you in over a year, but you find that it is merely physically draining instead of life threatening. Unless you really wish to go beyond that this would grant you and extract even more power from the sword fused to yourself, in which case it can still potentially harm you. Finally, this grants you a form of quick regeneration, letting you recover quite fast from heavy wounds, and it may even let you reattach something as a cut head if you do it quickly enough with your incredible speed."

Be warned however, Dynasts by default will be embroiled into the political schemes of the Realm and the various Great Houses, and will likely have many duties and responsibilities that their outcast (non-Dynast) dragon-blood cousins do not. If you desire instead of being a Dynast you may instead be a member of one of the five ruling gentiles of Looks"

One of the best examples of this is what happens when two spiritual species come together as one. The result is not an infertile mutant or weakened cripple but something quite incredible. There are many kinds of racial hybrids in this world, and many different ways to make them. Every purchase of this option will let you pick another of the above race options for free. As to the actual races, how you combine is up to you, balancing various benefits and flaws. The most basic is to simply become a natural member of each race at once, having access to all natural abilities and potential from the start, but with no added power from this hybridisation. Other options can range wildly. Something like the Vizard, turning one or more of your additional races into a temporary power up, giving a large increase in power and temporary access to some racial abilities, but at the cost of no access to such powers outside of your brief transformation. These might be unlocked in time, the tradeoff for an initial benefit. It’s even possible that your hybridisation might result in a new race taking aspects of both, with new abilities made from the fusion of both. While the potential and originality can be tempting, you’d also be left to discover your abilities from the beginning with no one to help, being the first of your kind. Feel free to get creative but try to keep your choices balanced against these examples. If a choice has a particular benefit, try to make for a change off elsewhere. There are no limits to how many races you can hybridise into your mix, beyond the maximum present in the jump. May be purchased multiple times."

Likely the result of a distant ancestor if you’re not a clan member, it has several effects on your body and spirit. The first is an enhanced life-force, making it possible for you to survive wounds and illnesses that would kill normal humans quite quickly. Despite taking the same wounds, your body is unnaturally enduring. The second is an enormous natural talent for magecraft relating to the channeling and controlling of spirits, not enough to match a Risen Legend but enough to become quite well known should you be trained. More importantly, that talent is the basis of the core power of the Fujo. ESP, or the projection of their spirit from their bodies. Leaving your physical form resting behind you, you can move as a spirit in the world, your power dictated by your magical energy. Possessing and controlling humans directly becomes far easier and you already know how to bind the spirits of the recently dead to your service while in this form. More spiritual powers may appear with practice and power, though even now you’re able to rapidly cross all of the city while flying along as a ghost."

As your power and skill grows, you will be able to greatly increase your physical abilities, grow immensely in size, turn yourself wholly into animals, mundane or fantastic, or even shift yourself into forms that exist nowhere but in your own imagination."

Quite the opposite, the low and mid-tier dragons are born from the blood of the Seija. Now you are one of these beings, ranked around the 10ths in your bloodline, at least without any other perks or powers. Powerful beyond human belief, the Seija are former humans who were turned into dragons by one of the six Kings of the brethren families, gaining through them the blood of ‘god’. Capable of a regeneration that will let them survive even if only a part of their head remains and allowing them to walk during the sunlight without any problem, resistant to all but the most powerful silver auras, these beings are the peak of power in this world. They can kill even the strongest humans with their bare hands without too much effort, at least without accounting for other special powers and magics, and their blood is so rich in mana that they can cast their magics just by imagining the effects without the use of any incantations or hand-gestures. A single Seija would be capable of destroying an entire city on their own and take on hordes of dragon hunters without a problem. And that’s only while they are in their ‘humanoid’ form, as they can transform into large dragons at will just as well, gaining at least a five times increase from their previous humanoid physical and magical power. Be warned that silver disrupts the magical power that flows through the Seijas’s blood. Should some silver weaponry disrupt the blood flow, such as managing to penetrate your impossibly hard skin through enough force or quality of the weapon and destroying your heart with the same weapon, it would cut your regeneration factor and prevent you from casting magic unless you manage to remove it and the frozen parts. The transformation from human to Seija also adds a curious side-effect: all previous hatred towards dragons is eliminated, and at least a small amount of loyalty towards their King is gained. It is possible to regain or gain a new hatred for dragons, however, and you may even defect your king if you are displeased with their way of acting."

Your muscles will bulge and your stature grow far beyond any mans. Your bones will twist and warp, yet not hinder you at all. Even your hair will become a deadly weapon, turned into sharp spikes that stand on end. In every way, you will become an ungodly beast. Yet this hideous form comes with immense power, greatly magnifying your physical abilities. Few warriors could resist your blows in this form or keep up with the speed of your mad charges, even should you be a mediocre warrior in your own right. The transformation may grant you tens as times as much power as before but it drives you into a near mindless frenzy, robbing you of the use of much of your skill in combat and other intelligence, though you can still distinguish friend from foe in a vague sense. You are also able to reform from this transformation at will."

You have at your disposal a formless stuff, comprised of a nebulous mix of your blood and soul. It has 60% of your cultivation, soul and mental strength, in addition to what you already have. The profound handle resides in your left hand, and can be released at any time you want. It can use any and all abilities you can that rely on the above attributes, though no other. It can take any shape of your choice, but the colour remains fixed. You can also use it as a decoy by generating your aura from it and suppressing it at your own body, if you want. In addition, the Profound Handle is capable of other things like directly interacting with souls, your or other people’s. You can manifest aspects of your soul through this handle, allowing it to operate semi-autonomously and support you while you focus your attention on other things. It can also interact with other’s souls, allowing you to do things like performing surgery on them, searching their memories, and potentially much more. In essence the soul is as clay, to be moulded by the Profound Handle as you will. Finally, while it’s almost impossible to manifest more than one handle below the Divine Realm, there is no telling just what all you could achieve with it later on. As mentioned above, the handle you get is Cyan in colour, the same as the greatest geniuses of the Yun Family. However, if you want you can pay an additional 300 CP and receive the Gold coloured handle instead, which has 100% of your power, in addition to all the other abilities being proportionately strengthened."

Any powers you possess will continue getting stronger as you grow older, with no upper limits except your lifespan, which is extended to several hundred years. Finally, once per jump including this jump you can produce a ‘Dragon Seed’, which you may impart to someone else of your choice through sex. This heals them of any and all injuries or illnesses they may have, and nearly doubles their powers and energies. With time, you can learn to impart it without the sex too, but one person can only benefit from it once. This changes to once every ten years after your chain ends."

It has Twelve Stages, each more difficult to achieve than the last. This art does not depend in any way on one’s profound veins or profound strength, working instead from your soul, and nature itself. Your progress on this path depends on your comprehension of it, with each level unfolding as your comprehension improves. This art provides you two things to begin with, those being increasing strength, and increased healing ability. Both stem from the power of Heaven and Earth around you flowing into you through the mysteries of this art, enhancing your body dramatically. At the first level, this art passively gives you strength of almost two tons, and the ability to heal from all wounds in a couple of days. At the second level, this art gives you strength of four tons, and provides significant improvements to your healing speed. At the third level, this art gives you strength of ten tons, and increases your durability to the level of pure steel. Your healing abilities enter the realm of active regeneration here, although it will still take hours to deal with grievous injuries. The silver pagoda you manifested so far also turns into a faint gold color. At the fourth level, this art gives you a strength of fifty tons and you enter the intermediate level of the art. The pagoda becomes a dull gold in color and your blood is slightly tinted gold. Your body now cultivates at all times, providing a slow but steady benefit to you continuously, but fast enough that you could gain a level of Emperor rank in a couple of months even if you do nothing else. At the seventh level, this art gives you the ability to restore important bodily necessities such as vision but it is impossible to reach this level even at the Sovereign realm while remaining in the Mortal World. Trying will cause your body to explode. Benefits provided by further levels are unspecified, except that the twelfth level is the peak, and it grants you the original physique of the Rage God."

Of the two Lunars are by far the more direct, and significantly more capable in direct matters (especially of violence), they're also insanely difficult to actually pin down and kill, surviving situations where virtually anyone else would die. Sidereals however are much more subtle by design. Sidereals powers often require either significant preparation or specific, and sometimes difficult to arrange, triggers in order to work. Additionally they are cursed by Arcane Fate, meaning that they will fade supernaturally quickly from the memories of anyone they do not take excessive effort to maintain close ties with, including their friends, family, and loved ones.

The Exaltation bonded to your soul allows you to wield essence. As an energy, Essence is life, breath, power, the essential, all-pervading animating energy of Creation. Though as an Abyssal, you shall instead draw upon the cold and sterile Essence of the Underworld, necrotic instead of living. Still, for you it is the size of your spirit and the magical power of your soul. Should you draw upon too much of it, you will first manifest the bleeding mark of your Caste upon your brow and then your aura shall bloom into a terrible, dark majesty. When an Abyssal’s aura turns fully totemic, any mortal who sees it feels both the terror and the lure of the Void. Merely mortal minds can break when subjected to such horror. With essence, you fuel your Charms. Each is a technique for channeling Essence through the body or mind to enhance yourself to superhuman levels. As one of the Abyssal Exalted, you wield dark mirrors of Solar might and charms to invoke oblivion and the Deathlords, with which you elevate your skills to new and terrifying heights.

And this bloodline represents a gateway to great powers that can shake the world and overturn the heavens and the earth. The first of these powers lies in the Nirvana Brand, a heaven defying innate magic that is symbolized by a green mark on the hand of its bearer. The Nirvana Brand allows one to undergo Nirvanic Rebirth up to four times, which allows them to immediately reincarnate with their identity intact without needing to go through the cycle of reincarnation and birth in between. Each time a bearer of the Nirvana Brand goes through a Nirvanic Rebirth they produce a Nirvana Fruit, up to a total of four. Nirvana Fruits are a great source of power, valuable even to Transcendent cultivators, but their true worth can only be displayed by their owner. While it still counts as a form of reincarnation, undergoing Nirvanic Rebirth through your Nirvana Brand will not end your chain. The second power granted by the Allheaven Bloodline is that it makes it possible to achieve the three special stages of True Immortality; the Immortal Emperor, Allheaven Emperor Immortal and Allheaven Dao Immortal realms. These stages are possessed of such power that they could allow one to overthrow cultivators entire cultivation realms above them with brute force, and completing all three would establish a near unprecedentedly powerful and stable foundation for future progress. Because of this perk you will only require a fraction of the effort and resources that it would normally take to reach these realms, which could have been ruinous otherwise. Finally, this perk grants the power to awaken the potential to achieve the three special stages of True Immortality in anyone connected to you by blood by creating an Allheaven Dao seed within them. This can be done individually, in groups, or to everyone linked to you through blood all at once. You can remove the Dao seed from anyone you have granted it to and, once you step into the Allheaven Dao Immortal realm, control the life and death of anyone with an Allheaven Bloodline awakened by you with a thought. As a precaution, your bloodline connection to Allheaven cannot be used against you in any way. After this jump your Nirvana Brand will renew its ability to perform four Nirvanic Rebirths at the beginning of each new jump or every ten years, whichever comes sooner."

You can enter any of your four transformation levels at will, the first form being several times as powerful as your base form and each further transformation being significantly stronger than the one before it. Each form will look progressively more monstrous, as well as seriously strain your stability and calmness. Even the first form will make it very hard to not go into a berserker rage, and the fourth form would require a miracle of some sort to prevent you from descending into a mindless fury. The forms are tiring to maintain and will eventually deactivate, even if you are lost in a rage."

This power manifests as a glowing white dot on your forehead. While it can be covered, it otherwise can’t be hidden or gotten rid of. At will, you may also manifest a halo above your head, and beyond having to look kinda like a halo, you get to choose how it looks. This power, access to the Key of Kings, grants you many abilities. First, you are able to do stuff like summon phantasms of gods to fight for you, have clones made up of white energy split from your body and attack your enemies, teleport, and more. Additionally, you know one of the words of the Seven Part Name, YISUN’s true name. By saying this word, you damage reality itself, and even kill those of weak will. Finally, you can also loan some of your power to your followers. How strong these powers you give them depends on how much power of your own you sacrifice, but these blessings can be pulled back to you at no cost, and making your power whole again. You can also make your Emissaries, the people who have been granted power by you, have their mind twisted to your goals, though those with strong will can fight against this, even defeat your corruption. The Key you get is equal to Allison’s/Zoss’s, though you have to learn how to use it. The downside to this power is that anyone that sees your Key and knows what it is, they probably want to steal it for themselves. And if it is taken out of your head, you fall unconscious and take a ton of damage and pain, regardless of any power you have. Post-jump, you may choose to hide the Key, revealing no outward signs of it. This perk is also a capstone booster, look in the Notes section to see how it affects the capstones."

An orbital laser fired on you would only be good to piss you of and may God have mercy on whoever invoked your Wrath.

Otherwise you may feel free to design it from Feathery wings to leathery or even fiery ones. On top of boosting your physical capabilities you gain numerous other abilities such as Flight thanks to your wings, the ability to fire Lasers from your Third eye and telekinesis so you may choke out the poor fool that challenged you (or blow up their motorcycle). Additionally, in this form you become a master of Mishima style Karate. Dark powers can be absorbed by you as well. Usually, without extensive training and self-control, you would find yourself corrupted by this Power and run the risk of being overwhelmed and overtaken by it. However, thanks to you paying with CP you will be in full control and without risk of being overtaken by the Devil inside you. You could still find yourself a lot easier to anger however and find sadistic glee in beating down whoever opposes you."

Bram Stoker wrote but a mere story on an ancient count who fed on the blood of living beings but it grew so far beyond that, bringing fame to the legend of the vampire and defiling the legacy of one Vlad Tepes. Despite the true form of vampires being that of Dead Apostles and not this fictional breed, you still find yourself waking this evening with the powers of that dread count. The many traits of this classic fiction are present in you now. Unaging immortality and pale beauty when not enraged enough to use your bestial abilities. Your body takes on a composition less of flesh and blood, more shadows with mass, the change allowing you to survive even the most terrible wounds with little penalty. A destroyed heart or damaged spirit core hardly slows you and your potent regeneration can heal most wounds before the attack that caused them has even finished. This can be focused on certain areas to make it almost instantaneous but one should be aware that sustained levels of severe damage over time will cause your regeneration to slow and eventually falter. Despite the fictitous nature compared to them, your regeneration abides by the same mechanics of the Curse of Restoration that Dead Apostles have. It works via regressing time, rather than simple healing, and grows stronger as the moon waxes. The same shadowy powers that grant this healing also improve your power, giving you the strength to effortlessly bat around powerful Heroic Spirits or cause the ground to tremble for miles. Your speed matches this physical strength, bursts of movement that can cross miles in moments or let you throw out attacks well beyond the speed of sound. All of the many incidental abilities shown by Count Dracula are yours to possess as well. Control over the weather or shadows, hypnotism and manipulating the memories of humans, crawling on walls or commanding the animals of the night and more. Your shapeshifter abilities let you turn into such animals, as well as mist or a swarm of bats, an instant transformation that can make melee combat against you near impossible. As is natural for any vampire, you have the claws and fangs to suck blood from others. Not only does this sate your own deep hunger for blood, it also turns those whose blood has been sucked into undead slaves, barring great mental or magical resistance. Acting as ghouls loyal to you, you can embrace and expand your undead army quite rapidly, and your bite has an unnatural ability to bypass all defences against ‘attacks’. It is, after all, a show of affection to take them into your undead family in such a way. But the legends of Dracula are not all positive and the presence of sunlight will significantly weaken your powers, while holy powers can deal catastrophic damage to you. A devoted priest of great power could very well kill you when a whole team of history’s great heroes failed. As your power comes from the legend of Dracula, it is possible that new or altered abilities will reveal themselves in time. Sometimes temporarily, sometimes not, as the legend and story may alter or have certain aspects become more popular in time. While the above abilities will always remain with you, you may find that different worlds offer new variations to enjoy for a time."

He infused your body with the blood of a dragon, granting those same abilities in your frail human form. Or not so frail anymore. Your core has become akin to that of a Dragon, immensely enhancing your magical abilities. Your mana will grow immensely as you age, becoming close to equaling that of an adult Dragon by the time you are an adult, and continuing to grow at a slower rate as long as you continue to live. It will replenish at a terrifying rate, refilling from empty in but an hour of time as your inner dragon generates nearly endless amounts within you. This draconic power also grants you a extremely high level of resistance to magic, rendering you immune to spells save from the highest class of magus, such as Merlin himself. However, it does also make you slightly more vulnerable to attacks that have an advantage against dragons, due to your nature."

This regeneration has a handy side effect of granting immunity to disease and poison. You have control over your regeneration; so if you want to permanently edit your genetics or stop something from regenerating you can. You stop aging once the prime of your life is reached, or revert back to your prime. Your appearance never deteriorates regardless of lack of exercise or food. Since you no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe for living anymore, but may still do so for enjoyment. Your hair and teeth will always be perfect no matter the situation you are in and regrow if lost. Your mind is equally made immortal granting you a perfect memory, with instant recall, unlimited storage, perfect indexing, perfect comprehension, and you can not lose your memories if your head is destroyed or time altered. Your immortality includes being immune to corruption, changing or copying your memories, mental attacks, hacking, mind control, brain damage, & possession. You may share this immortality with those you are married to and/or are soulmates of, but they may not do the same."

Solars are aspected towards the Sun, Infernals towards the Yozi (demons/Titans), and Abyssals towards the Neverborn (Titans that got killed and then stuck between life and death).

Infernals take on traits of their patron Yozi, and Abyssals are aspected towards the essence of death (pretty much no matter what you do as an Abyssal, someone is going to die because of it). Regardless of which type you choose they're all on a relatively even playing field with each other, largely because Infernals and Abyssals are corrupted Solar exaltations, and they can all eventually reach dizzying heights, capable of routine feats of skill that mortal grand masters could not imagine replicating with a lifetime of effort and eventually the ability to use conceptual effects both for defense and offense."

And yet... no such being exist now, in flesh or in memory, but for an echo from Beyond. You now carry this echo, your Exaltation matching that of this lost Tiger.

However it came to be, you are an entirely artificial attempt at creating a replacement for the Spirit King, going beyond even a natural potential like Kurosaki to become something more. The basic part of this nature is that you are equally and innately part each of the Shinigami, Quincy, Hollow and Fullbringer races. This works via a free purchase of Hybridisation for each perk, set to make you a otherwise normal member of each race rather than any other variation. This otherwise works as normal for the Hybridisation perk in regards to discounts and such. More importantly are the countless tiny fragments you’ve been inserted with that originate from the Soul King. The raw power of these parts have given a royal tinge to your Reiryoku, giving you spiritual power equal to an experienced Shinigami Captain. Combined with meeting all requirements for the throne, you’ll start to see much more valuable developments as you age. Unlike a mere substitute for the King, you are a true successor, and will very slowly begin to develop the same powers on your own. Though the process will take several millennia at least to come close to finishing, you will slowly develop the same great and varied abilities as the King as your soul ages. Your spiritual power will naturally grow stronger from age, while new and incredible powers awaken in your various body parts. Provided you continue to develop yourself and experience life, the road to royalty will continue progressing regardless of how much you train in the combat arts."

Even the attacks of beings far more powerful than you simply fail to have any effect. Starvation, suffocation, aging, and even magic that seeks to transform you—nothing will be able to change you for the worse, even without active hostile intent behind it. However, there is no protection from someone throwing you into deep space or burying you in the core of the Earth, nor from the madness that could arise from the years of isolation and sensory deprivation that would follow. The sacred power within you has more uses than just protecting yourself. Even now, you’re aware of how to charge it into your body and attacks to give them potent holy attributes or cleanse your and others’ bodies of impurities with holy light.

As one of these Nobles, you possess all the abilities of an Artificial Vampire, but with enormously increased levels of power. The few weaknesses they have, such as limitations on their regeneration, do not affect you, and even immortal hunters find it difficult to hinder your immortality or regeneration. Additionally, you likely have a wide variety of vampiric abilities that normal Artificial Vampires cannot access. Your raw power alone is absurd. While not unbeatable—especially against coordinated teams—you are more than strong enough to match the magic or physical prowess of anyone, short of another Vampire Noble or legendary figures like Negi Springfield in his adulthood and Ialdabaoth. Even if you lack magical skill depending on later choices, your raw power is enough to destroy cities or mountains with minimal effort. Simple magic projectiles in your hands are better compared to nuclear weapons. You are also a particular kind of Noble, similar to Baal. Your True Form is not the humanoid body you currently possess but rather an amalgamation of magical beasts and demons, a dimensional slaughterhouse filled with writhing black monsters that surge from your shadow at will. These shadow beasts are your true form, with thousands of creatures acting independently or under your control. They can separate to operate at a distance or attack in unison. The creatures range from weak enough for a novice wizard to kill to mighty monsters capable of threatening the best that the UQ Holder organization has to offer. They are all parts of your body, allowing you to cast magic through them and ensuring your survival as long as even one creature remains. You can even absorb any creature you slay into your shadow, incorporating it into your True Form. As all Vampire Nobles hail from ancient times, this option also grants you the title of Elder Immortal. While it doesn’t cost anything to take, it depends on you purchasing additional options below to gain full benefits. You will have 12,000 years of experience like your peers, but only the specific benefits that come with Elder Immortal, and no greater ones. Even Vampire Nobles can be sealed away or lose track of time as the eons pass."

      "description": "An Apoptosis is the phenomena from which those with divinity produce a being that is both their antithesis and the one with the absolute potential to end them, born from the self-destructive desires that they held. For whatever reason, you too seem to have a similar origin to those existences, perhaps related to one of the divine beings of this era. However, you seem to be a special case even among these exceptional beings. An impossible being born out of the contradictory World of Dualism. Instead of being a self-destructive factor that brings the end of just its parent entity, the target for your destruction is mutable. If an Apoptosis is basically a divine cancerous cell that corrupts and kills the host from the inside, you are closer to a metaphysical virus that expands until it has consumed everything. You have become a vortex of destruction. An engine fueled by killing intent, capable of growing in strength as long your violent impulses remain, as well as empowering yourself with any killing intent directed towards yourself. By turning your weapon towards someone, you begin to understand them, regardless of how alien they are supposed to be. The more you fight with them, the more you begin to peer into their psyche and the more attuned you become with them, and thus, the deadlier your blows are to them and the less effective their attacks towards you. You develop a resistance to their powers as you keep relentlessly moving forward to their destruction, your weapon never even once leaving your hand, and thus becoming able to see gaps in their techniques and use them to evade even attacks that bend causality to hit you. And when it comes to offense, these gaps also seem to forcibly manifest as your understanding deepens, appearing on even supposedly perfect armors, and then allowing you to strike with surgical precision to utterly annihilate the enemy. Even if those gaps didn’t exist before, your sixth sense will forcibly create and notice them, allowing you to strike the line that brings death. It doesn’t even need to be physical offense, your understanding of your target makes it so you can even crack and destroy their egos with verbal abuse, by exposing their deepest cravings and fears before crushing them. And finally, once you have been fully ‘synchronized’ with your victim, you can bring down the full potential of an Apoptosis: the complete annihilation of the host by a power that equals and then eventually surpasses them. You may find that they may even welcome it, being poisoned by the impulse towards self-annihilation that you have attached to them. But unlike a regular Apoptosis, your strange nature has made it that you don’t die with your host. You have long surpassed the destiny of a mere cancerous cell. You instead take a part of them with you after slaying them, adding it to your strength, and become able to target a new victim. The more you walk this path, the more efficient this process becomes. Those who stand before you become easier to dissect with each new victim, regardless of how alien their minds were or how unfathomable they are supposed to be. Difference is power matter less and less, as your sword cleaves through them quicker each time, moving from one target to another quicker and quicker. Should you not decide to stop at any point, you could go on until every life in the universe has perished under your sword, before turning it to God itself. Until the only thing that remains in this universe is the immutable fact that is your endless desire for blood."

These powers do not come without attention however. Taking the 1000CP option will lock you into the plot of this setting in a sense. Whatever actions you choose, you will end up fighting against several opponents at the level of the High Gods. If this means you join Mo-Ri Jin in his battle against the Gods and take several on yourself or if it means you face down the humans and find several empowered warriors on the level of High Gods in your way, so be it.

      "description": "A long time ago, there was a race of vampiric creatures known as the True Ancestors. Born as part of a pact between Gaia and Crimson Moon Brunestud, this race would exist as an extension of nature and the will of the planet itself, designed to return the planet to its ‘default’ state before the growth and advancement of humanity began to fester on its surface like a malignant tumor, obliviously killing the spirit of the world they lived on. However, not only were they detached from their original mission, but as they were based upon Crimson Moon itself, they suffered from a vampiric desire for blood despite their lack of need for such a thing. They would eventually become feral beasts, little more than living disasters akin to a living force of extinction. It was this flaw that would result in the creation of the Dead Apostles and the strongest of the True Ancestors - a weapon by the name of Arcueid Brunestud, the ‘Princess’ of the True Ancestors. And she would be the one who would slay almost every single one of them, leaving her and a very small handful remaining. And you. Somehow, you are an anomaly - a True Ancestor who sealed themselves away before Arcueid’s purge of her own kind, or perhaps one brought to life in the modern era against all odds. You and her are some of the only ones of your race left on the entire planet, and likely the only ones there will ever be. As such, you are both one of the most dangerous and most interesting beings left in this world of dying Mysteries. I hope you don’t mind - The Dead Apostles are likely to either fear you, covet you, or outright try to slay you themselves. And that’s before factoring in the many humans interested in your existence... You are a creature, or rather a flesh-given spirit, that exists above what others would call ‘Divine’. Being born of the will of the planet, you have a natural connection to both nature and the ‘rules’ set by Gaia. Your body possesses superhuman speed, endurance, and strength - even if you were absolutely exhausted, you could tear open a three-story building with a swipe of your hand, move far faster than the speed of sound, and withstand most mundane physical attacks like leaves gently brushing against you. You possess an incredible resistance to what this world calls Conceptual Weapons and modern magecraft, most being unable to even scratch you unless they were truly powerful or designed to be used against you specifically (or your regeneration, such as the Church’s Black Keys). Similar to a Dead Apostle but well beyond their norm, you are able to regenerate from even physical annihilation by your injuries ‘reversing’ back to your healthy state. In addition, you suffer no physical weakness from sunlight, nor do you require blood to sustain yourself - simply a few days of rest will suffice should you overextend your abilities. In the daytime, you are physically tough. In the dead of night, exposed to the light of the Moon that your progenitor dwelled within, your already-considerable might increases greatly, making you able to swat aside most Dead Apostles like flies. This further increases with the phases of the moon, waxing and waning as it does. The concept of death itself flees from your body at night, and only in a state of extreme physical weakness or if your connection to the Earth is somehow severed are you vulnerable. In addition, your connection to the world enables you to use a phenomena called the Marble Phantasm - tapping into the will of Gaia and re-shaping it according to your will, using your imagination to create changes in reality. An example of this is turning the atmosphere within a hallway into vacuums that would slice apart a target like a knife, but the hallway itself remaining untouched because your imagination didn’t factor it in. Empowered by Crimson Moon, Arcueid Brunestud could pull out a version of the moon itself from the distant future, though this is an extreme example and beyond what you begin with. It is also more difficult to use this ability within areas affected by the progress of human development and civilization, though the difference is slight - and while you cannot directly affect humans or things made by humans, you can easily do so indirectly, such as with the aforementioned vacuum blades. What you create with the Marble Phantasm must be something possible under the rules of the world - it could not make a creature or item made of dreams or magic, but it could create mundane animals and other results that were possible within the world - such as fire, villages, natural disasters, or even elementals and spirits born of the planet itself. The Marble Phantasm allows you to create results that were possible according to the laws of the world, akin to reaching into a bag of marbles and pulling out a white one every time with only a 1% of drawing it normally in a bag of black marbles. So long as it is a naturally occuring phenomena, you can create it - so you could create unpurified ore from nothing, but not a car or an anvil. Finally, you do not age, untouched by the ravages of time. All being said, you are not invincible. Your abilities are not tied to a pool of blood or magical energy like Dead Apostles or Magi, but instead directly to your personal stamina. The more you exert yourself, the weaker your abilities become - while you remain formidable, you become increasingly vulnerable if you recently had to do something like recreate your body from slabs of meat in the daytime, requiring you to rest for several days. While fighting Dead Apostles constantly or making uses of Marble Phantasm will not be enough to drain you, coming back from certain death or battling nonstop for hours at your full power will likely be a heavy toll. You are also not the same level as Arcueid Brunestud is at her full power - the strongest of your might is a third of her full power, and while this makes you equals in the modern era, should she ever succumb to her bloodlust or become the vessel for Crimson Moon, she would slay you as easily as she did the rest of your kin. Finally, while you have no need for blood, you do suffer from the vampiric impulses of your kin...though it is more of a peckish craving and an annoyance in your current state, indulging in it will turn you into one of the ‘Demon Lords’, a rampaging beast that is a threat to humans and vampires alike - and likely target number one for the Princess herself. However, whether from your youth or the unusual circumstances of your condition, you will find that your vampiric impulses can be suppressed by an act of will alone, needing none of your power to do so...and while your impulses will grow as you age, so will your power. And maybe even that vice tied to your body can be overcome. Perhaps with years or even centuries, you may yet obtain and surpass the full might of the Princess herself...but that night is not tonight. Such a curious creature, one that has no place in this era, a living relic of what was...what will you do, I wonder?"

      "description": "At the first impression, this glowing gourd made of red chakra looks like any other chakra construct, but there are some important differences. Unlike the other constructs, this gourd is permanent and doesn’t require any extra energy to stay existing. Its main function is to store energy and techniques to use later and even replicate them using your own power after absorbing them for the first time. The gourd doesn’t have unlimited storage, capable of storing up to energy equivalent to the power of the One-Tail, and will break if its energy limit is surpassed, making all of the stored energy and techniques to be released in a very dangerous way. If lost or destroyed, the gourd will reappear in your Warehouse in the next year, but, if you have the Chakra Construct perk, you’ll be able to repair it using your own chakra if it’s destroyed. Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."

A massive chakram, bigger than a grown man and made of impossible heavy metal that allows it to crash through even enchanted steel with ease. Despite this mass, it feels light as a feather to your touch and as easy to manipulate as your own limbs. The chakram spins at incredible speeds with a twitch of your wrist, allowing the blades that sprout from it’s rim to cut through most material. When spinning like this it can even be unleashed to roll towards enemies at high speeds, homing in and returning to you via magic. The final aspect to this divine weapon is the holy fire that can be summoned from it. Never harming you but growing in size and intensity the faster the blade spins, it creates a combination tool that crushes, cuts and burns through all enemies that stand before it."

There is deadly venom harvested from plasmic arrow frogs, soporific toxins to be placed on needles or in cups of ghostly wine, and steel ant venom that burns both the living and the dead. Most terrifying to ghosts is Lethe serpent venom, at once the most feared toxin in the Underworld, and perhaps the kindliest way to \"kill\" a ghost. Lethe serpent venom does not damage its victims corpus or body. Instead, if they fail to resist the venom, a ghost instantly enters Lethe to be reincarnated, though on rare occasions the unluckiest of wraiths find their soul send to Oblivion instead. The living affected by it instead suffer a month of amnesia, losing none of their skill but forgetting their identity. These and many more toxins and drugs are at your disposal now, an eclectic collection of hundreds of different substances at your disposal. Replenishing once used, and carefully catalogued for your use, each of these drugs comes in a separate container. With this, you will never again lack an appropriate venom... nor a dose of wraithly cocaine."

While the wand allows for speedy flight but takes up one’s hand while in use, the mantle allows for sustained floating and causes no real impairment. Neither are very hard to use at all, with even beginners being able to use them with ease."

When administered, it will cause rapid regeneration of the recipients body parts, able to quickly mend large wounds or even entire missing limbs. Not quite so effective with vital organs, but then most wouldn’t survive long enough for it to be administered anyway. There is the unfortunate side effect of intense pain while the drug is in effect, but I’m sure you can grit through that in return for a lost arm, right?

      "description": "Not all Zanpakuto are personal tools, made from the soul of one Shinigami. Some are the result of an entire family line, each holding and passing down a mighty weapon. Rather than an ordinary weapon, you possess one of these ancestral tools instead. For some reason, possessing this Zanpakuto doesn't prevent you from wielding your own Asauchi. The ancestral Zanpakuto is set in it’s ways, with already established powers independent of your own. While this means they will not grow with you further through power or maturation, it also means that every ancestral weapon is already mighty. They possess incredible and often numerous abilities as a result. A mirror blade that perfectly scatters, reflects and even destroys those said to be ‘gods’ is one example. Another is a sword with the ability to copy and manifest the abilities of any Zanpakuto the wielder has seen, scaling these individual powers to the user’s own level of Reiryoku. These are only examples of their Shikai, as well. The downsides are that they usually entail a cost or significant threat to the wielder as a result of this power. The mirror blade, Shinken Hakkyoken, can result in the wielder’s destruction if they don’t have the strength to hold it against the reflected attacks. The copy sword, Enrakyoten, drains from the life force of the user to mimic other Zanpakuto. Perhaps some of these downsides can be countered with skill or enough power but for now, they remain in tact. Other than their inability to grow with you, they work as normal for Zanpakuto. You may apply the below options to them, they possess a Spirit, a Shikai and Bankai, as well as the other limitations of a soul sword. If desired, you can also pass the sword on to a descendant.

The first is that the wounds created by the spear cannot be healed without very powerful magic, so long as the spear exists. Similar to the red spear of the later Irish hero Diarmuid, the wounds this weapon makes become part of the normal state of any victim. The second ability is to create a bounded field for dueling. A battleground is created where it becomes impossible for gods, outside help or luck of any kind to interfere in the battle between the two combatants. This created battleground is a separate dimension, divided in space and time from the outside world, ensuring any duel lasts just a brief moment to outside view. The rules of the duel are decided on by both combatants together, but enforced fully on agreement, and the battleground can only be summoned provided both agree with full knowledge of the details of this ability. Only once one of the two are defeated can the field be escaped."

The arrows appear to the wielders hand when needed, allowing for quick loading for the bow that can optionally fire at quite the rapid speed. With a brief surge of energy and calling the crossbow’s name out, a variety of magical effects can be utilised. The first and most lethal is that anything the next bolt fired touches, will see any impurities, diseases or poison in their bodies instantaneously amplified. Only a touch is required as well, making defence difficult as the bolts do not need to pierce the enemy. The effect of this can range from merely intensifying the existing effects and duration to creating an explosion like lightning up gunpowder within their body. Alternatively, the same calling of the name can cause the next arrow to create an area around where it lands that automatically transfers a weaker dose of the Yew poison, strengthening as long as they remain within. Finally, through expending magical energy, the Yew Bow can create trees under the user’s command that originate from Sherwood Forest. These can appear as roots that swarm and bind targets, originating from bolts shot by the bow, or as trees that appear and shape themselves to the wielder’s wish from around their body."

They bestow upon their wearers an enlightened, cold fury, ensuring that when they go into a berserker state gained from infernal monster they will actually become more powerful as a result. The anger and fury of the style will merge seamlessly with the cunning and rational thought the wearer possesses without the charm, to form something closer to the Yozis particular sense of spiteful hatred. The wearer will still rampage and slaughter, but now it will a calculated and precise effort instead of the random destruction the Infernal Monster embodies naturally."

One so trapped can only be released through the will of the chains’ master, or the actions of another, who must tear them off the chains with agonizing violence.

The mainstay of this world are the many divine armors that the Gods grant to their loyal warriors - The Cloths of Athena, the Scales of Poseidon, and the Surplices of Hades. They act as amplifiers to the combat ability and Cosmo of the wearer, along them to attack with greater power and take more damage. However, these items do not inherently make the user superhuman - you must burn Cosmo equal to the necessary level of the armor. It does not add to your power, it merely complements it. Thus, someone who wears an armor expecting it to win the battle for them will merely be weighed down by several cumbersome pounds (or tons). The armor usually takes the form of a statue based off of a single creature or item, which then breaks apart into smaller pieces that cover the user and fit to them like a glove. This armor is stored within a metal box marking what ‘type’ of armor is contained within when it is not in use. While you will need to either carry it or need someone to do so for you during your stay here, post-jump you may summon this box and your armor at any time you wish from the Warehouse. You will receive an armor equivalent to those of the Bronze Cloth. It will be either of your own design, or an existing Cloths, Scales and Surplices. . You can upgrade it to the equivalent of Silver or Gold Cloths by spending extra points below or simply by growing stronger. Do note that you are not necessarily crippled by choosing a ‘weaker’ armor - as said, it mainly amplifies the Cosmo you burn, and stronger armors have a stronger starting requirement. And the Bronze Saints may yet overcome even the Gold Saints through awakening greater Cosmo and smarter fighting abilities. Should you have a piece of armor you’re particularly attached to, you may import that as your armor for 100 points. Depending on your chosen background, your armor will have some innate properties..."

Anyone awakened to cosmo could use one, making such a user able to shatter stone, move and fight at mach1, and take equally powerful hits. Some have thematic items to supplement them, such as Andromeda’s chains or Dragon’s shield. A Cloth is almost always made after something. A creature, a constellation, a star… First consequence is that the pieces will be designed so that when the Cloth is not worn, they assemble themselves into “object mode”, a statue-like form at the effigy of its theme. Second is that if the source of inspiration had notable associations or properties, it can be translated into minor features. Perhaps it has an affinity or association with fire techniques, a weapon or shield tied to itself, or a favored type of enemies. A Cloth can only have up to 2 of those however, and they may not be overly advantageous given the grade of your Cloth, merely thematic. Cancer’s affinity to Yomotsu (Gold), Libra’s 12 golden weapons (Gold), Andromeda’s chains (Bronze), Centaurus’ fire (Silver) are all examples of what you could reasonably do. Two paths are possible : Choose a cannon constellation/evil star/creature appropriate to your tier. You either create a new original Cloth with the same attunement, gain a copy of the original, or gain the original itself and replace its previous owner, with their respective implied consequences.

Should these eggs make contact with flesh they’ll burrow beneath the skin, and in a matter of seconds they’ll hatch, fist-sized insect cursed spirits bursting out of the poor victim’s body.

Through normal use, especially when used to strike something, it accumulates force and cursed energy within the blade. Then, at any time the user wishes, these can be ejected from the vents like jets, granting the blade an explosive boost in speed and cutting power. Such power is enough for it to slice clean through metal reinforced by cursed energy, to say nothing of the violence it could do to a person’s body.

Its real draw, however, is that the rope has the ability to cancel out any cursed technique it comes into contact with. Even a defence on the level of Limitless’ infinity could be easily bypassed by it. That said, it does have a weakness: each time it’s used to interfere with a cursed technique, a part of it burns away. Each individual use only destroys a small amount, but over the course of a fast-paced yet protracted battle, it might not be long until it’s significantly shorter than it was before.

The majority of these experiments failed and resulted in deaths, but a few ones managed to achieve good results, with different degrees of success. Madara, for example, created a mindless clone of Hashirama, capable of producing a substance made of his cells that could heal injuries and replace lost limbs, as well as usually increasing the user’s chakra reserves and granting access to some Wood Release abilities, while Victor used his cells to induce a splinter of the Earth’s God Tree to make it grow an artificial (and incomplete) tree. All of these features granted by Hashirama’s Senju physiology is thanks to him being a descendant of an Ōtsutsuki, in this case, Kaguya herself. It’s logical that the cells from an Ōtsutsuki will have slightly different features, but more powerful. You get a few samples of Ōtsutsuki’s cells, enough to reproduce it infinitely with proper equipment. These cells grant the same benefits as the Hashirama’s cells, but without the risk of rejection due to the Ōtsutsuki physiology being much more malleable. They also won’t grant Wood Release abilities, but they grant all the basic nature transformations (including Yin Release and Yang Release) to those that are implanted with it and may cause their kekkei genkai, if they have any, to evolve into new forms or even achieve power compared to their kekkei mōra versions.

      "description": "Weaved from the light of the gods, the armour that is bound to your form could rightly be called a near-invincible protection. A tight suit of armor integrated into your body, it provides unmatched protection against any threat, whether physical or conceptual. All harm that comes to you from outside of your body is reduced by ninety percent of it’s damage, turning major wounds into small scratches and cuts. Many magical spells and powers will be reduced to useless sparks or negated outright, such as the armor preventing you from being erased from reality by those that can warp such things. But this protection does not apply inwardly, allowing any harm that originates from inside your body to proceed unaffected, such as summoned spears piercing you from within. You can take off the armor and even give it to others, the integration into your body able to be undone with a thought. As well, when in the way physically, the armor can recede inside of your body to allow you full access. Optionally, you may have a flamboyant cape of flowers appear behind you when the armor is present on your skin."

This sheath is an incredibly valuable artefact, as it bestows powerful regenerative abilities on you while at your side, allowing you to heal from almost any wound in minutes at most. Even if most of your body was vaporised, as long as your brain and a fair amount of the flesh and bone connected to it remained, you could restore yourself to normal in five minutes of healing. Avalon cannot heal brain wounds and you will die if it is destroyed, though the item also struggles to handle cursed wounds. Though it drains your energy, you can also activate the special power of the sheath, which will place you in the world of Avalon while you maintain it. While here, it is almost impossible to reach you and even dimension crossing effects will only work from insanely powerful users. Effectively, it lets you dodge away out of almost any effect in an instant. Notably, Avalon as a sheath will resize to fit any sword you wish to put into it."

Only an immortal being could avoid death, should the poison enter their blood, but it will still deliver unending agony unless they could use powerful magic to remove the poison."

The bow is also able to call down a rain of light attacks, by expending some magical energy and firing two shots at once towards the sky. This results in a rain of arrows of light, each able to easily pierce thick enchanted metal armour, over a controlled range of attack.

At the top of the axe handle is a reverse pistol grip, a trigger linked to what makes the axe special. A powerful magical weapon already, the axe has fifteen cartridges built into it that store powerful blasts of lightning. Even one cartridge being triggered unleashes a powerful blast of lightning that can leave a small city block in ruins. All fifteen at once might split a small mountain into two with the valley carved by the thunderbolt. These cartridges slowly replenish over time, drawing on the electricity in the air, but can automatically absorb any lightning attack when empty to protect you and charge faster. It’ll take some practice to get used to the trigger, though you can optionally change it’s place on the axe if desired. Golden Axe is also able to take on a second form, that of a modern Japanese motorcycle, albeit a massive one done up in the style of a young gangster. According to one golden man, the bike has two million horsepower and can travel at over Mach 2. True or not, the wheels are able to rapidly build up a thunder charge like the cartridges, becoming stronger and more charged with each revolution. Racing towards a foe turns your bike into a mighty spear of lightning that can tear through even powerful youkai, if they fail to dodge the extremely visible attack. At least the thunder from the Axe doesn’t harm you."

While a near unbreakable weapon and light in your hands despite the stone crushing weight it swings with, these are all minor physical traits. The true value is the core held within the hammer head, which has the ability to use the Galvanism trait, in a very similar way to the Living Lightning perk. The hammer can absorb any wasted magical energy or electric energy from you as well as anything within a short range around the hammer in your surroundings, acting as a potent defence against magic. The hammer can unleash massive blasts of lightning, taking the form of tree branch extensions, both in close range and at a longer distance when targeted. Just picking up ordinary mana and electricty from the air, the hammer is able to unleash bolts that tear humans, cars or houses apart. A large amount of energy could wipe out a small force of magical golems in an instant. If used in tandem with the Living Lightning perk, or similar abilities, the two sides work together to create a much more powerful Galvanism expression. The limits on absorption are largely removed, excess energy in the body immediately discharged through the hammer with great force, allowing the user to easily defend against even vast amounts of magic. Bridal Chest also grants easier regulation of energy, greatly improving how much can be used to heal or reinforce your body before you endanger it. Bridal Chest is also able to transform into a secondary mode, taking the form of a equally large sword. In this state, not only can the electricity be used to hone the swords’ edge or cause it to vibrate at high speeds, the sword can be reversed so that the energy is channeled into a massive projection of electricity. This energy blade takes a vast amount of fuel but is easily the most destructive attack the weapon possesses."

The blade of light that brings out the fondest feelings of all warriors that see it, even as it obliterates them, and can force madmen back to sanity with a glimpse of this glory. Excalibur is the embodiment of victory and a mighty weapon in it's own right. A holy blade of truly peerless strength, endurance and cutting power in this world, it is also able to instantly convert any amount of magical energy residing in the wielder's body into destructive beams of holy light. Fired as an energy beam or blast from the tip of the blade in less than a second from activation, the blast of Excalibur can cleanse almost any foe from the face of the world. While costly to activate even for King Arthur, it is more than capable of vaporising fortresses, mountains or even Divine Beasts. The ranks of those that can survive a full power beam, as it can be adjusted for less cost and power, are limited to powerful Divine Spirits, the mightiest Dragons and beings above them. The weapon is constantly covered in a powerful enchantment of wind, placed by Merlin himself. This conceals the sword to all eyes but your own, rendering it invisible, and cloaks it in an aura of wind. This wind can be controlled, made to cut and grind away or even unleashed in a powerful blast that on it's own, would be a match for many powerful magical tools. While this Invisible Air is active, it significantly reduces the attack power of the blade and prevents you from activating the holy light. The sword must be revealed to the foe to show it's true self, in the manner of a chivalrous knight. Much like the Lance of the End- Rhongomyniad, Excalibur has potentially not normally seen. There are Thirteen Seals on the blade, one made by each member of the Round Table. Each seal that has it's condition met, raises the power of the sword even beyond what you might do by charging it with more energy. Unlocking all Thirteen Seals would return Excalibur to it's original form, a shining light made to protect the very planet. A weapon that can decisively drive away even the Umbral Star itself from this world in a single, glorious ray of light."

The cost is higher for weapons that possess inherent magical abilities or world-shaking powers, while mundane weapons cost you nothing to make a replica of. These copies possess all the functions and abilities of their original, with bottomless ammunition for bows or firewand-like weapons, and last up until the battle has passed.

Its sleek black hull is propelled forward as much by sorcerous means, as by imperishable sails of cloth-of-jade and almost a thousand skeletal oarsmen laboring below decks. The black teak of its construction is a dense hardwood originating from the Font of Mourning, valued all over the Underworld, especially for shipbuilders, for its wood is nearly flame proof, as well as resistant to rot and the Essence drain of the Sea of Shadows. Reinforced with soulsteel and magic, both in vast quantities, the hull and masts are indestructible and impenetrable to Essence besides, such that not even immaterial spirits may pass through. Armed not with the mundane catapults or ballistae common to sea-going vessels now, it instead carries the powerful First Age weapons known as lightning ballistae. When fired, each ballista releases a powerful blast of lightning that sears and scorches whatever it hits, turning flesh and wood to ash and melting steel or stone. But its greatest power is perhaps the one least expected of such a juggernaut of a ship, for at the command of its captain, the prow with its reinforced ram can pitch upwards to allow the ship to take to skies. So do oars find purchase in midair, sails catching the winds far above the surface, to allow the Psychopomp to race amongst the clouds. At night, it could even slip quietly from Creation into the bleak skies of the Underworld, and vice versa. Unlike the no-frills triremes of the realm, this ship does have proper accommodations for a crew and passengers, though not enough to house the hundreds of reanimated dead set to man the oars. Raised platforms in front and back can hold weapons and lookouts, as well as cabin for crew, passenger cabins, or even troop barracks."

Those who try are sapped of their strength for some time, rendered as helpless as a small child. Anyone struck with its blade is also stricken with a rotting pox that slowly putrefies their bodies. One week after infection, no weapons can be wielded. If a victim finds no cure after one month, they die and become a walking corpse completely under the control of Walker in Darkness, or under your control if you purchase the grimcleaver here. The disease carried by the blade cannot be treated without magic, and even then it is a difficult thing to cure before the black destiny of the Deathlords will have completely poisoned the victim, tainting even their very name."

The cloth can shrink or expand to fit you at any size and stretch several times further than its current size too. When commanded to attack, the cloth can whip out with enough strength to slice through miles of rock at a time or pierce through all but the strongest of magical shields, helped along by its powerful anti-magic properties. When an attack is sent at you and is blocked by the shield, which automatically acts to protect you as best it can, few blows will manage to make you shift at all. The cloth can protect against anyone with less power than the Thousand Master, so long as it actually blocks them."

Beside the Gods and their Kamuis, few surpass a Gold warrior except another one. A Cloth is almost always made after something. A creature, a constellation, a star… First consequence is that the pieces will be designed so that when the Cloth is not worn, they assemble themselves into “object mode”, a statue-like form at the effigy of its theme. Second is that if the source of inspiration had notable associations or properties, it can be translated into minor features. Perhaps it has an affinity or association with fire techniques, a weapon or shield tied to itself, or a favored type of enemies. A Cloth can only have up to 2 of those however, and they may not be overly advantageous given the grade of your Cloth, merely thematic. Cancer’s affinity to Yomotsu (Gold), Libra’s 12 golden weapons (Gold), Andromeda’s chains (Bronze), Centaurus’ fire (Silver) are all examples of what you could reasonably do. Two paths are possible : Choose a cannon constellation/evil star/creature appropriate to your tier. You either create a new original Cloth with the same attunement, gain a copy of the original, or gain the original itself and replace its previous owner, with their respective implied consequences. You nonetheless gain the cannon emblematic techniques as starting moveset, as per the Basic Training perk. Alternatively, you can create your own unique theme for your Cloth, based on an asterix, other star or even an otherworldly inspiration from another jump setting you visited. Its affinities, if any, are left up to you. You gain an original moveset whose strength is adapted to its tier and whose nature is adapted to its source."

Sword of the God of Military Arts This yellow longsword demonstrates remarkable cutting prowess, effortlessly slicing through gold armor and even the formidable Cape Sunion. Additionally, it has the ability to cut from a distance. Moreover, it can emit beams of light capable of absorbing enemy attacks, with these beams having the capacity to not only cut through but also disintegrate anything in their path. These attacks boast attack speeds surpassing natural light and match the cosmos level of the goddess Athena. 3. Sword of Destruction This massive red Greatsword possesses the power to annihilate golden armor at the proton level within atoms, making it capable of dismantling structures at their most fundamental level. Additionally, it grants the Pallasite wielding it the \"Enhanced Time Destruction\" technique, an enhanced iteration of \"Time Destruction.\" This advanced technique enables the user to siphon time even from adversaries at the level of Golden Saints. However, those possessing the seventh sense can only maintain their consciousness in the face of this formidable ability. 4. Sword of Theogenesis This verdant sword demonstrates the ability to immobilize individuals with regular cosmos, including those who have unlocked the Seventh Sense. It possesses unparalleled cutting capabilities, able to slice through any earthly material with ease, including gold armor. Additionally, the sword repels enemy attacks by emitting a potent cosmos, akin to the defensive maneuvers employed by deities like Poseidon and Abel."

The most obvious result is an increase in spiritual power, reinforcing your soul with the energy of hell, similar to maintaining a Shikai or Resurreccion state while the armor is summoned. More interesting are the hellish abilities you have access to. You can travel freely to and from Hell, summoning the Gates to enter the place and then exit again anywhere the realm might have reach. You can both create and command the chains of hell as well as summon the Kushanada. The chains are near unbreakable even to a Captain level opponent and can bind the spiritual energy of others or drag them down into hell, if the Gate is active. The Kushanada are gigantic gorilla-like demons who guard Hell and torment it’s prisoners, each one more than a match for any Vice Captain Shinigami.

Unless your soul is completely destroyed, you will reappear in a few days in your realm. You’ll retain access to the Hell of this world in future, though the sinners of the past worlds will be left behind, and can attempt to claim similar influence over other Hells. If you can convince it’s guards to invest their power or conquer them yourself, at least."

While its said to be strongest in the hands of those who can see the souls of inorganic matter, such as those with zero cursed energy, its power is incredible regardless. The bodies of even the toughest cursed spirits would be like paper before it, and the damage to the soul will make it much more difficult to recover from their injuries than normal."

      "description": "A red, fleshy cube, each face covered in ever-staring eyes, Prison Realm is an unusual thing made from the body of the monk Genshin. A special grade cursed object, it has a power worthy of that ranking: the ability to seal anyone, imprisoning them within a pocket dimension within itself, from which escape from the inside is impossible. That said, there are quite a few steps needed to get Prison Realm to activate. First, the user must chant a short incantation to open Prison Realm, causing it to expand into a mass of meat as tall as a man, stretched out between four cubic corners with a bleeding, unblinking eye in the very centre. Once opened, whoever you wish to seal must be kept within a four-metre radius of it for one minute – though, notably, this doesn’t have to be a minute in real time: just a minute from the perception of the target. As such, someone reminiscing about a series of events in the past can cause it to trigger, even if mere moments passed in the real world. As soon as this condition is met, Prison Realm morphs into a set of cubes surrounding the target, from which sinewy protrusions instantaneously shoot forth to bind to their body. This not only completely restrains the target, preventing them from moving or breaking free, but also renders them unable to use cursed energy, or any other supernatural abilities for that matter. The only step that remains is a final short incantation, causing the Prison Realm to snap shut and return to its original form, sealing the target within. The pocket dimension inside of the cursed object is little more than an impossibly deep pit lined with endless amounts of skeletal remains. Though the sealed target always remains conscious, time does not pass in that place – they do not age at all, and the only way they can die is if they take their own life. There are only two ways to release someone from the Prison Realm: one, if the owner of it wills the person sealed within to be released. Two, if it is targeted by an effect that nullifies cursed techniques. Otherwise, it is wholly inviolable and indestructible. While it being targeted by a cursed technique nullifying effect will destroy it, if such a thing happens you will receive a new copy after ten years or at the start of the next Jump, whichever comes first."

Each of it’s points confers a unique power relating to the trinity of existence, used as you desire. The first point represents Destruction and releases divine lightning on command. This lightning unmakes whatever it comes into contact with, short of a fully enlightened Buddha or God of solar scale. What is destroyed by this lightning is done so completely, impossible to bring back short of a reality changing miracle, such as a wish from a Holy Grail or the act of a Bodhisattva of great power. Physical material, magical spells, even the fabric of the world that creates a texture can all be undone. The lightning moves to your will, like gentle waves or a raging storm, guided to every target by thought. The second point is lesser, not so deeply represented by Shiva’s aspects, but still potent. Maintenance of reality that allows the spear to reinforce reality as it is, greatly hindering attempts to change it. From magic to authority to mundane methods, the trident can be planted on the ground and extreme resistance to change in the world you are currently in, preventing reality from being altered or commanded by others without immense power. Finally, creation as the third point. When holding the spear, you may cast your own magic through the trident and out of this final point. The process immensely improves the power of such things, increasing them to hundreds of times their normal strength. It becomes a tool to aid the shaping of the world around you, creating and manipulating using your own knowledge with the trident as a tool."

It works almost identically to the holy sword, able to convert magical energy into greatly magnified heat and light, resulting in an annihilating laser blast or slash. The quality of Excalibur will depend on the base tool you used to manifest it and many tools will crumble from the strain. A stick’s maximum power could still split thick trees in two before turning to ash but a sturdy sword might leave a large theatre ruined from a half hearted slash of light. The limitation is that, as mighty as your power can be, it can never truly match the original Excalibur’s scale, even with the greatest of base tools."

However, the lance is restricted by the same 13 Rules that bind Excalibur, limiting it’s power unless used in the right conditions. If the lance were to be broken, the two sides of the world would combine into one, filling the world back up with all kinds of fantasy. In fact, Rhon retains this quality even in future worlds, allowing you to break the lance to fill the world with magic, myths and mystery appropriate to it.

It paid off with a mastery that verges on the realm of godliness, such pure skill with the spear that it has changed your very being. If it weren’t for their lesser reputation, you’d be remembered alongside the likes of Musashi and Munetori for your military talents. The divine nature of your skill greatly increases your physical power, smashing down whole dojo buildings in a single swing of your staff is a great way to teach these sword using brats a thing or two. The focus you’ve achieved when wielding a spear allows you to ignore most attempts at interfering with your mind, the bloodthirst of your foes being so evident to your purified mind that it allows you to move before most of them can finish the thought of attacking you. Nothing else demonstrates your mastery more than your ability to respond to any enemy or technique however. Even on your first encounter, you can adapt your style to whatever you encounter with a few moments consideration, letting you counter even truly bizarre things that should not be matched with a simple spear. Cutting apart magical spells, piercing a spirit’s core, turning aside the three thousand bullets of your foe. While your ability to create martial arts to respond to any challenge is impressive, and possible to expand beyond the realm of a spear with some work, it can require enough power to keep up with your foe to some degree. Too far beyond you and even all your skill will falter. Additionally, these techniques are often partially effective at first, requiring time to hone to full mastery before you can fully negate or counter their intended target. You may optionally exchange the parts of this perk that focus on spears with another fairly specific weapon type. You can’t have it for all swords or anything you do while unarmed but longswords, halberds, nunchuks or a specific martial art style can all work."

At minimum, its power and durability are equivalent to that of three golden armors, enabling the user to move faster than the speed of light and easily destroy any divine-protected areas with ease. However, they will require a Cosmo level equal to that of the Four Heavenly Kings of Mars to make this armor work."

      "description": "The Crumbling Orb at the centre of so much conflict. The magnum opus of both Sosuke Aizen and Kisuke Urahara. Each man wished to find a way to break the boundaries of the spiritual world in some way and, somehow, each found their way to the same creation. A device capable of realising the deepest desires and dreams of those around it. Yet, this tool has a will of it’s own, an intelligent to read the desires of others and serve the one considered it’s master. Whatever the truth of it’s intelligence, the completed Hōgyoku rests in your palm now, a fusion of two component orbs and incredible power to bind them. It’s power is to manifest dreams as reality, not in a temporary sense or only maintained by focus but as truth. It could break down the barriers between two races to create a new species, awaken powers in those that desperately desire or evolve a man to ever greater levels of power. Indeed, these dreams manifest through evolution, change and growth in those affected. The orb requires a large amount of Reiryoku to activate, either injected in to activate in regards to a single desire or constantly infused by being near a powerful source, allowing the orb to manifest wishes as it sees fit. However, the orb manifests desires that people are capable of achieving. If one does not have the raw potential or power to achieve something, the Hōgyoku will instead attempt to lead it’s user towards being able to do so. They might be forcibly evolved in stages first to prepare them for the true goal or be guided without realisation towards what is needed to gain the potential for what they desire. The more powerful the user, in raw power and capability overall, the more the Hōgyoku can achieve on it’s own."

Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

This mighty blade possesses no innate power, save its limitless cutting edge. A single, lazy slash was able to slice all of South Korea in half and the blade was also able to destroy the cloned Ruyi Jingu Bang. It can summon gigantic waves of incredibly hot flame at the user’s command and even the sheath of the blade is powerful enough to split in half the super massive swords wielded by Nephilim without any action on the user’s behalf. Even if somehow broken, a feat only accomplished once by the Monkey King using over a hundred National Treasures and multiple Charyeok at once, the blade will be replenished to pristine condition within minutes."

After flying through the void of space for untold years, it has come crashing down in front of you as you enter the jump with nary a whisper of its appearance. Like the Sovereign fan that will soon pass the Eternal Realm, its functionality will slowly by unlocked as you complete challenges of appropriate difficulties. Its exact function is something you should decide now, whether it be a weapon, a transport, a shield, or other. Whatever the case, it is extremely strong, and likely large. As a sovereign level treasure, its function can dip slightly into the domain of a Dao, like the hour glasses that affected the flow of time around them. Its full power will only by fully unlocked when you reach the peak of Archaean realm, or are of similar power."

      "description": "You have gained a forbidden knowledge. A dusty tome has come into your possession and within it dwell the secrets of producing Alchemical Exalted, one of the greatest creations ever made by a Titan devoted to Craft. It could take a hundred mortal lifetimes to glean even the barest secrets of this knowledge, though one who is Exalted above others might manage it in as little as one. It contains instructions on how to make all the various types of Alchemical Exalted and, unlike the Alchemicals that were first created, these instructions show how to create improved versions. Ones that are immune to the dread sickness that so afflicted the Maker and far less susceptible to the vagaries of Clarity. This is only the knowledge to create these beings, and someone that desires to make use of this knowledge will need to secure the materials, infrastructure, and other reagents needed on their own. The Jumper, and only the Jumper, is guaranteed to one day be able to make Alchemical Exalts if they study this, even if they wouldn't normally be capable of such, though it may take a very long time indeed. While you may discover the method of the creation of Alchemicals, how their Exaltation itself is formed will elude you, no matter what method you attempt, until such time as you have gained your Spark. Further you will discover that no method you are capable of will be able to utilize the Alchemical Exaltation for anything other than powering the Alchemical that it has attached itself to. This, too, will be something that will be beyond your comprehension until such a time as you have gained your Spark. As a reminder Alchemicals were once people and while the process may have changed them both in looks and abilities they are people still. So unless you take them as companions, or have some other method of bringing them with you into future worlds, you will not be able to take them with you. Finally the process of making an Alchemical does not infuse into them any sort of loyalty to you, so beware if you have used this knowledge to force this condition upon the unwilling."

      "chapter": "Treasure",
      "description": "The great Monkey King had four mythical artefacts that accompanied him on his war against the Gods of Heaven and each of these are now made available to you for purchase, granting you perfect copies of the weapons that are loyal to only you. Each artefact is a separate purchase, though every purchase after the second is discounted to 500, for Demon origin takers and for non-demon origin takers. The first and most famous. Ruyi Jingu Bang, also known as Yeoui. A silver Bo staff, it is imbued with many great abilities. It can change its length at the owners command, from being small enough to use as a toothpick or fit behind one’s ear to extending from the surface of the Earth to several times beyond the Moon, this change of distance happening almost instantaneously. The width and thickness of the staff may also increase at the user’s will, enlargening to stay proportional to its greater lengths. This lengthening power can be used in combat to blow through enemies, even piercing through and destroying whole planets. Its weight can also alter as the owner commands, becoming as light as air or so heavy that even Uriel, a Goddess who held up a planet with little issue, had her arms torn off by trying to hold it in the air. Yeoui returns to its masters hand when called, either teleporting back or flying towards them, destroying everything in its path as it travels at terrific speeds. The staff itself is almost completely indestructible, the only two beings who have managed to damage it being the First Prince of Natak, leader of the war gods, and the Jade Emperor using the Blade of Tathagata. One being, 666:Satan, was able to destroy the staff, but fear not as the implement will regenerate to its full health in a few hours of being broken. Then there is the Kinto-Un. A cloud that the owner may call to their service, no matter where they are. It will even appear in the depths of space. This cloud can be used for transportation, travelling at absurd speeds even considered against the speeds achieved by Gods and Demons but its main purpose is the raw offensive power. It allows the user to manipulate storm related events, such as creating and controlling winds strong enough to hold up an entire continent, calling down an almost limitless number of lightning bolts with each able to damage even the powerful Gods of this world and being able to create fog so thick it cannot be seen or passed through except by the strongest of beings. However, the Kinto-Un is powered by the user’s life energy and abilities such as its lightning calling power will create a great drain on the power of the user. Next is the Crimson Gourd. Taking the form of a small gourd, tiny enough to be fully held in one hand, it is able to absorb attacks and seal away monsters on a vast scale. The Gourd is nearly indestructible, with not even the First Prince of Natak scratching it, and is able to absorb any sort of energy attack fired at the user, with no discovered limit on how much it can store. The second use allows it to suck up and seal away monsters of every sort. In a single command of the wielder, it was able to suck up every single monkey in the Monkey Country of the Sage Realm at once and has no difficulty sealing monsters of almost any kind, though those of sufficient power can resist the call. Gods may also resist, whether through raw power or through being in their true forms. Finally, the armour and garments of the Monkey King, Yongpyo. When not actively worn it takes the form of a shifting mass of black energy and when worn, it may take the appearance of any clothing the user desires. When worn as clothing, it is an armour unsurpassed by any form of defence save a Barbadium body, and is still capable of working as a powerful shield even when all combatants are flinging about attacks that can destroy whole worlds. The armour massively enhances all of the user’s physical abilities, propelling even a mortal to Godlike levels. It is partially sentient and acts to protect its master even when they are not aware of attacks, changing form to block attacks. The armour is also capable of at least two transformations, with possibly more to be discovered. The first is the Boost Mode, which creates wings and jets on the armour, multiplying the speed of the user several times over. The second is Power Mode, bulking the armour up greatly and in return granting a significant multiplier to the user’s strength. Yongpyo may also be loaned to other people or recalled in an instant. Boosted: While purchasing these options will grant you the chosen implements as normal, it will now act as an immense boost in power to one of your own personal implements, one of the 2-4 things that you gained by taking the capstone booster. This boosted thing will vastly outmatch even the Monkey King's tools, which will be used for examples. The Ruyi Jingu Bang would become tough enough that even 666 Satan, the God who would eventually shatter it, could not even scratch it at his best and be capable of stretching from Earth to Pluto in an instant. The Kinto-Un would make its’ original speed seem like molasses while being able of summoning lightning that can shatter large parts of a planet with each individual bolt whilst the winds it brings could scour a planet to dust in a minute at tops. The Crimson Gourd could store any matter at all, sucking away even entire planets to store within its’ depths until recalled. The user would also gain great power over the space within, becoming able of warping it almost as desired, though not entirely limitless. Yongpyo would become many hundreds or even thousands of times more durable and gain not only vastly increased transformations but several addition ones, boosting various other traits of the user. Whatever your implement may be, it receives a similarly massive boost. You can optionally choose to simply boost the Monkey King Implement you received instead of boosting one of your own. Boost Requires Reincarnation(High God) to Activate May be Purchased Multiple Times"
