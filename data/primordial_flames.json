In future Jumps, objects with strong supernatural powers or links to the combined human subconscious can be treated as Objects of Power and bound for abilities as well.

This power naturally strengthens the body and its functions in its base state. A person is limited to the Light they have on reaching full maturity, around the human equivalent of 25, with the powerconstantly growing at a slow rate up to that point, with it slowing further after puberty. However, this alone would not make Light particularly useful. There are two ways to manipulate Light. The first focuses the pinpoints into a smaller area to add more power to that area or be able to shift how it manifests. While this shifting takes a bit of concentration and time, it is fairly easy to train to the point where it's near instinctive to shift the pinpoints of Light around. The second method is the most potent, but also the most time consuming. By looping the strands connecting pinpoints together around a series of pinpoints, it's possible to create a Seed. A Seed will continuously grow brighter over time, creating a small well of power. This is the basis of Seed Sorcery (see below). However, even those that do not use Seed Sorcery will find this useful, as cracking open one of these Seeds gives a boost to the effects of the user's Light based on how strong the Seed is. Post Jump, you may awaken Light in others, complete a capacity to form Mistlight Manifestations.",

      "description": "When any creature with Light dies, they leave behind a small echo, a wisp of glittering Mist, colored similarly to the Lenses the individual possessed in life. These wisps are also touched by the memories and emotions of the being's life, altering its properties somewhat. The collection and manipulation of these wisps of Mist are the basis on which Mistlight Manifestations come into existence. Collecting a wisp of Mist is easy, simply touching it will stabilize it and allow it to be stored indefinitely. But utilizing a single wisp of Mist to create a Mistlight Manifestation will result in a lackluster Manifestation, weak enough that even humans, who lack the reserves of light necessary to become proper hunters, prefer to make at least a few modifications before doing so. To that end, there are three methods of strengthening a wisp. First is smelting or fusing. Taking two or more wisps of Mist and combining them into a single, new one with the traits of both. This is by far the easiest and fastest method of empowering a wisp of Mist. However, unless you know exactly what your wisps of Mist are and how they'll react, combining them in this way may lead to complications, such as opposing traits canceling out or mutating into a new trait that has a negative impact on the whole. Second is cultivation. By 'feeding' a wisp of Mist, it is allowed to grow organically and produce new qualities and traits over time. Allowing a wisp of Mist to grow in this way is fairly simple, and with its organic growth it's unlikely to have any complications, but this process is time consuming, potentially taking weeks or months to yield the results on par with smelting or refinement. Lastly is refinement. This is a rather difficult process that removes unwanted traits from a wisp of Mist, much like cutting and polishing a gem. This process has you excise traits and qualities from a wisp of Mist, allowing the other aspects to grow in strength as a result. This is a quick process and is unlikely to cause any real trouble, but you must be very precise and careful during the process or you may leave behind bits of what you wanted removed. Additionally, wisps of Mist are useful for another purpose. By binding a wisp to a Seed, it can act as an artificial Lens in the use of Seed Sorcery. Seeds formed with a wisp are, however, slower to grow than those that use your own Lenses. Cracking a Seed with a wisp will often cause the wisp to dissipate, though some Seed Sorcerer's have learned how to reclaim the wisp used for this prior to cracking the Seed.",

      "description": "Sparks are spiritual seeds of the World Tree, planted within the minds of the people of Betwixt and enhancing the mind of those who benefit from it. The Spark on its own is a form of mental magic that grants you, and anyone else with a Spark, an enhanced ability to learn new things through improving memory, comprehension, and thought speed, equalling roughly three times the norm of someone without a Spark. Thissteadily improves over time as the Spark is nourished and allowed to grow, which is sped up further by actively learning new things and meditating on what you already know. Additionally, the Spark acts as a buffer against mental influences, protecting the mind and will against any form of mental attack. While not a perfect defense, this buffer is like armor for the mind and takes a concentrated effort to bypass. Combined with other mental defense techniques, it becomes significantly harder for mental influences to take hold on the mind. Like the World Tree they come from, Sparks produce an energy that can be harnessed. The energy produced by the spark cannot truly affect the world in its raw state, but it can be used as a fuel source for the various technologies of Betwixt and can act as a catalyst to initiate or speed chemical reactions that would otherwise never occur or take a long time to run their course. The stronger the Spark is, the more of this energy is produced. Post-Jump, you’ll be able to grant a basic form of Spark to others. This also results in them.obtaining a functional biotemplate.",

The presence of the biotemplate and the development of methods to observe and interact with it after its initial discovery drove the advent of bioenhancement in Betwixt. Additionally, it was found that the biotemplate could be ‘extended’ into grafted structures, such as cybernetics or artificial organs, to make them a part of the body, to the point that cybernetics will repair themselves if damaged after being incorporated into the biotemplate. This does, however, take upwards of a decade to fully integrate. While technically the result of possessing a Spark, this structure can be created within someone simply by exposing them to the energy of a Spark without needing to possess their own Spark, thus, you can use this perk to grant someone a biotemplate.",

As strange as that request was, when you watched him enchant the various jackets it suddenly made sense. Instead of trying to enchant a single jacket multiple times, he would wear multiple jackets enchanted once. But you can improve on that idea. Instead of attempting to craft multiple thinner jackets, you've opened up inner linings in existing pieces of work. As you predicted, while the ease of stacking enchantments has gone up, the overall durability of the item has dropped by a bit. Perhaps with time and better materials, you could rectify the second point. Having so many inner linings also helps quite a bit when it comes to deeper pockets, which is a nice side effect.",

This makes the material used in the shaping far easier to work towards that purpose and enables it to ‘fill in the blanks’ to a degree as it works towards that purpose as well. This can make normally tough materials, such as mithril, as easy to work as iron, or even easier if you are skilled enough, with there even being a case of a man shaping iron like clay with his bare hands using this method. However, even once done, the object will serve better towards the intended purpose, such as an axe made with the intent to fell trees will cut better on a tree than it would on a shrub or in service as a weapon. This is a fairly permanent affair, even breaking the weapon won’t see this quality fade unless broken down to the point it becomes a new base material, at which point the effect is considerably weakened. Chaos affected in this way tends to keep the purpose it’s given when used in this way, and if repeatedly given the same purpose can find itself locked into a more permanent form, only a chaos distiller able to break it back down into its base state without the integrated purpose. This can, however, be felt by the binder and is usually only done either in emergencies or when the permanent form is the desired end result.",

It allows a wizard to create huge gems formed from pure crystalized mana that can then produce magical effects that do not draw power from the wizard. The gem’s color indicates its abilities, but the effects of the spells are determined by how the gems are mounted. Mountings can alter a gem to provide passive boosts to surrounding gems, area of effect bursts, strong bolts of pure force that can deal incredible damage, and many more effects. One thing to note about gemcraft is that it scales to extreme heights, since the wizard doesn’t have to chanel the power directly, a sufficient buildup of power allows spells that can only describe their damage in scientific notation. This power is fueled by the self-improving nature of the Orb of Presence as a mana battery and generator. It is certainly possible to cast gemcraft without an orb, but the true heights of power require one in order to avoid burning the wizard to a cinder from over-channeling magic. The other main consideration is that gemcraft is predominantly a defensive art (in the ‘the best defense is overlapping fields of fire’ sense). Since the easiest size of gem to work with is the size of a large living room and weighs hundreds of tons, moving them conventionally is impractical. While you can reposition them around the battlefield within range of an Orb of Presence, don’t expect to be able to take the fight to the enemy with any degree of ease. Gemcraft can be taught to anyone that already has a massive pool of mana to work with, although it is quite complex, and requires quite a bit of magic theory background to progress to even the simplest of spells.",

Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at it’s core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear. The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into it’s mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon.",

You have been extensively-trained in hextech engineering, and are capable both of building all common hextech devices in Piltover-Zaun, and of innovating upon them based on your knowledge of hextech and its principles. True, radical innovations like the Hexcore are somewhat beyond you, but you could approach such creations with a long-enough development scale and enough staff to help you - and ‘conventional’ hextech is nothing to sneeze at. Moreover, you know how to use existing hex-crystals to produce new ones, albeit not as potent as the original, natural hex-crystals. Thus, you need not worry about your creations running out of power in new worlds.",

Without the same access to the expensive hexcrystals which make the innovations of Jayce Talis possible, the undercity has had to continue relying on older chemtech, with all its associated volatility and, often, toxicity. Still, chemtech is hardly a worthless line of research, capable of everything from creating powerful fuels for engines and industry, to brewing all kinds of near-magical drugs, potions and concoctions. You are well-trained as a practitioner of chemtech, able to produce all the common chemicals used in the economy of Zaun, as well as to modify them or innovate new ones given time and space to work in. You know the recipe for Shimmer, and are quite a proficient doctor, able to keep your patients alive (though not necessarily unchanged) far past the point at which mundane medicine would have given up. As well as being able to perform the chemical side of things, you’re also capable of building machines that take advantage of the weird brews and concoctions you can make, like engines which run on artificial fuels, prosthetic arms powered by Shimmer, or suits designed to supplement Shimmer’s body-enhancing properties.",

This process is known as Leying. This natural energy must be nurtured, cultivated, and allowed to mature before its effects manifest, taking days, weeks, months, or even years of being fed or collecting more natural energy to manifest their full power, depending on the strength and complexity of the natural energy structure used. Left to its own, this will result in a somewhat random enchantment or small array of enchantments, however, this process can be directed to instead manifest a specific ability. Enchantments made in this fashion make the enchanted object better at what it’s meant to do, and while this can be pushed, it cannot run directly counter to its purpose.

But maybe if you could use a different material, things might be different? The principle of this weave is the same as when you made inner linings.

The method by which Altered Items can be created, and how they can be transformed into Objects of Power. You can construct a ritual, a blending of technology and mysticism that will take an object, and focus belief and thought about the object onto it, bathing it in raw paranatural resonance. Eventually, the item will transform into a true Altered Item, with a strange power somehow linked to its nature and the ideas that people have about it. A postage stamp could gain the capacity to ‘send’ ideas into the heads of those nearby. A traffic cone would give those who approach it a looming sense of danger. A clothes hanger might gain the capacity to cause items to vanish into a ‘storage space’. Once an item has been ‘Altered’, you will then need to take steps to link it to the Astral Plane, forming a channel between the object and the collective unconscious. This is a delicate process that can destroy the object if you are not careful, but once complete, a parautilitarian or similarly psychically empowered individual can connect to the object and borrow its power, gaining some skill such as Telepathy, Danger Sense, or Storage. To start with, it would likely take several weeks of effort to make a single item, but as you explore the process, you can discover shortcuts and improved methods to speed up the process. Altered Items and Objects of Power you create are immune to corruption by the Hiss or similar powers, and while anyone with psychic power can bond with them, you are able to purge bonds you disapprove of, as well as storing them in a space like your Warehouse and still accessing their power.",

Traits like a specific hair color, eye color, or body type is child’s play to you - and while complicated or powerful abilities may not always descend down the family tree, you could preserve the appearance and base talents of your bloodline for millennia to come. An affinity for a particular element, a talent for a set of skills, or even a unique magical ability tied specifically to the DNA of the user are valid examples for this. Whether you merely wish to experiment with magical DNA or begin a great dynasty, you will find that with the right motivation, your legacy could last forever.",

A genius can imagine them as knots of cohesion floating in a vast illuminated sea of Idea, little islands where things almost make sense, though the shoreline shifts fractally with every passing second. Mastering each of the Axioms in turn allows a Genius to gain control of aspects of his own Wondrous works. A master of Axioms can do things beyond the scope of his fellows and has a true grasp of the deeper weirdness that comes with Mania. You have become a master of these powerful foundations. Most look at you in awe but you still feel there is further to go yet. (See Notes for a full explanation of Axiom and this Capstone, along with it’s boosted effects) In addition to this mastery of the Axioms allows you to utilize any other engineering or technological knowledge that you have, allowing you to make those types of devices as Wonders as well, enhancing their traits by doing so. Aside from the ability to create wonders from technology your Inspiration also allows you to see how the various technologies could be used together. Though this insight is small and it will take work to realize. Capstone Boost: You have truly reached the apex of each of the Axioms. This total mastery has effects ranging from atomic bombs the size of decoder rings to time machines able to travel into the future and back again to scanners that can detect something anywhere at any time within the local heat death of the universe to massive scale of cloning. Kill sats able to instantly burning a city to ash and shields strong enough to stop said Kill sat are also things you can build. Incorporation of other engineering and technological perks will no longer true Wonders as the seamless integration gives birth Wonders that need no Mania to survive reality proper. A master of Apokalypse, the Axiom that best represents discovery, could build a sensory platform capable of probing the truths and contrapositives that underlie material reality to reveal the truth of the world, anywhere within the local solar system. Boosted Mastery includes scanning all of reality for a singular object or scanning alternate dimensions. An Epikrato, the Axionm of control, master can completely build a wonder to produce one of several results: to make crowds denser or sparser, to bring people or things to the genius through a series of improbably complex coincidences, to produce specific results within a complex unfolding event (that is, to rig elections, trigger riots, and produce other popular mass-events), and to manipulate wealth and the market. Each example is a distinct wonder. Boosted Mastery is a thing of fear, control over the mind can grow to the point where a Genius can completely control the unaware and even create life like hallucinations and sleeper agents tailored to keywords. A master of Exelixi, Axiom of Healing, can resurrect the dead, at the cost of the Mania having a chance at changing the resurrected, heal even the most grievous wounds and preserve life in an inhospitable environment. Boosted Mastery can create immortality pills able to halt ageing for decades and cure any natural disease with ease, even things like biological faults are able to be healed at this point. A master of Katastrof, Axiom of destruction, is capable of crafting weapons able to burn out hundreds of yards of area in an instant or vibrating swords able to loosen the molecular structure of object and people, both of which would have a tendency to ‘melt’ before such blade. Bombs that work like short lived low range black holes and rents in space-time in the shape of a sword held in place by a hilt of technology could represent Boosted Master of the Axiom of destruction, weapons at this level easily slay cities. A master of Prostasia, Axiom of Protection, can shield a football stadium from the strikes of a weapon able to reduce it to a crater. An orbital defense grid able to take the enitry of the planets nuclear arsenal and stand tall is the only example of Boosted Master of Prostasia that comes to mind. Skafoi’s masters could create vehicles able to travel the eddies of space at speeds around the Speed of Light, masters of this Axiom of travel speak of the ability to travel even the eddies of time but you have yet to reach such theories.

Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own. By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source. From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers. Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully. There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly. Unfortunately, this can have dangerous side effects, as giving them too much to handle at once can lead to mental instability or even insanity, the severity rapidly scaling upwards the more initial energy put in.",

The accumulation of \"Materia\" leads to equipment slowly becoming sentient, but that would require the Materia to be \"slotted\" onto a target piece of equipment and slowly absorbed over time.

This allows you to make great leaps in using magitech, and eventually learn the inner workings of Asgardian 'technology' to create works like the Bifrost or enchanted weapons that can focus abilities through them.",

It's a stressful line of thinking, but that stress will see you through. Looming threats will spark your ingenuity and manufacturing speed tremendously, allowing you to quickly take stock of the situation and use information surrounding said threats to create countermeasures and machines custom-tailored for the situation in a fraction of the time it would normally take. Knowledge of the monster tearing down cities could see you adapting and fielding a custom armor for taking it down, or learning very rapidly from your mistakes in one fight to adapt your technology for the next fight. Capstone Boost: has shown you how matter can be shaped and wielded with proper application, and so the magic you have found can likewise be shaped. Enchantments are stronger and come much easier, in time allowing you to create great Relics while learning how to mimic the enchantments of others just by studying the bonds of magic.",

Where an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, Kinetic Theory can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy so too with the behaviour of intelligent beings. Psychohistory allows the long-range prediction and manipulation of the future, provided the population is of sufficient size, without directly infringing on the free will of the individual. Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil. Nano Karmatron Theory Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness. It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs. These Imaginos Bodies are a perfect fusion of the will of the mind and the power of the physical form. However, at least with the current state of Karmatron Dynamics, very few are capable of making the transition successfully their wills disintegrating their body into a screaming crumble. At the moment, only karmic singularities individuals of exceptional and unpredictable influence on the destiny of mankind can be reasonably expected to make the leap into the new flesh. Their base appearance reflects the self-image of the mind. As the mind reflects upon itself it may learn to change colour and gradually shape. Assimilation of cherished weapons, generation of new systems and limbs, intuitive hacking the full capacity of the Imaginos is limited only by the imagination and will.",

Your aura grows in proportion to your soul, and your soul grows as you become more powerful. Aura passively increases the physical ability of those who have it, placing them at low superhuman levels. You can channel your aura into weapons and armor to increase their durability and offensive capabilities. With some experimentation, you might even learn to directly enhance your strikes with your aura. Aura is also used to activate Dust, the main energy propellant of Remnant. Lastly, those with aura can also unlock the auras of others with a bit of self-reflection on the nature of their own soul.",

You have the ability to design and create just about any kind of hardware imaginable, with such marvels as game controllers that shape themselves to their user’s hands or real life holodecks being well within your grasp should you have enough time. This works beyond the scope of video game technology, as well, allowing you to make things like computerized fans that turn on above a set temperature, or things like self-driving cars. Capstone Boost: Quality over quantity is your motto now. Or at least, it should be, considering your devices are a couple steps above the rest. And by couple, I mean more like a few hundred. For whatever reason, any devices or products that you create are made better than the competition, even when extreme measures are taken to save money and resources. Even when using half the material that a device should normally have, at worst it will work just as well as if someone else made it correctly, and when using all the materials required it works so efficiently it seems like the future itself has been imbedded in your devices. Simply put, the stuff you make is a lot better quality than it should be.",

Taking them into account and ensuring you can use your parahuman abilities in sync with them. Assume any potential incompatibilities are handled appropriately to allow a power to still perform its intended function. All powers may be toggled on or off, and you understand their nature and how to use them instinctively, if not necessarily all the different ways they could be applied creatively. Tinker: Whereas other parahumans get the power to do incredible things, Tinkers get the ability to build incredible things. Tinkers essentially have a database of extremely advanced scientific data and technology in their heads, letting them build and create things far ahead of their time. This data follows a certain theme, whether that be bombs, efficiency, vehicles, or otherwise which defines what their power lets them build and work with. Tinkers need resources, time, and effort to do what other parahumans can do casually, but they are incredibly adaptable, able to show up to the next fight able to completely shut down opponents that were untouchable in their last encounter, all because they can build the right tool. Within their specialty a Tinker can build nearly anything they can imagine. Tinker abilities seamlessly integrate any such knowledge of technology and science you possess, meaning you don't have to make any extra effort to use your powers along with any other tech based perks you might have. The knowledge you gain is basically the collected science of hundreds of advanced civilizations within your area of expertise. You don't necessary have the capability to process and sort through it all at once, but your power will continue to feed you data and knowledge relevant to your endeavors and what you're building.",

Should you be born later in this world’s life, after the Age of Gods has ended, you will be quite the anomaly. A human with a body from the Age of Gods yet born in the latter ages. You have the physical and mental capabilities that any modern human would believe you are superhuman. You can tear through the stone or metal of the modern day without much exertion, perhaps even lift a tonne of weight over your head, and certainly outrun any horse. You have magical power unlike what appears to those who use magecraft, as you do not have magic circuits. Instead, through your body runs pure magical energy, allowing you to much more easily manipulate your own energy and that of the world around you. Of course, such a thing requires training to utilise to any real effect but once you have that training, there is no modern mage not considered a freakish prodigy that could level with you. As befits a time of myths and heroes, you will be assured to be at least somewhat attractive and it is possible for your body to grow to somewhat inhuman degrees, though whether that manifests as being eight feet tall and bulging with muscles or the sort of beauty normally seen only in the depictions of fertility goddesses in the temples of Babylon...that’s still to be decided. to deal with them, and makes it easy to see through dishonesty or even martial techniques.",

You could make yourself as strong and fast as an Olympic athlete or enhance your senses to the best of human ability and so on, or you could increase the sharpness of a sword to cut through steel or the durability of a shield to endure small calibre firearms with ease. Things can only be reinforced so much at a particular skill level before they simply explode from overstuffing. Gradation Air is shaping magical energy into the form of an item, which temporarily becomes real. You could make a sturdy but mundane sword or shield with this, though they would not last more than a few minutes at a time. Hypnosis is the basic form of mind control all Magi learn to use. It can be easily shrugged off by any supernatural being or magic user at this level but manipulating ordinary humans is quite easy and only those with exceptional willpower be able to resist the use of this without magic to back them up. Formalcraft, generally considered magecraft for dummies, is a way for Magi to use the mana in the air, along with sacrifices or ritual preparation, to make casting spells easier or possible at all for those with little personal magical energy. All of these can be improved with time, sometimes to terrifying levels, but it will take effort and time.",

Magically, you possess a number of high quality circuits, equal to the much later coming Tohsaka heir. A prodigy in those times but still notable even a thousand years prior. You lack training for now but magic is not so hidden as it becomes in the modern day, with the presence of spiritual temples and Onmyouji practitioners.

One might claim you’re in some sort of samurai movie, with how many dramatic effects tend to occur around you. As part of this national style, you also have the unique trait of never struggling to draw or sheathe your weapons, no matter how impractically sized they are.

In short, every thinking mind is at least potentially capable of sensing others, and both inserting its thoughts into other minds, and reading the thoughts of others. However, there are many limitations on this process, which prevent every Tom, Dick and Barliman from making use of - or knowing about - this ability (see Notes). With this you, like every person in this world, gain the latent ability to develop this skill to at least some extent, to contact and read the minds of others and project your thoughts into theirs, whether to communicate or compel. This can be very useful for interpreting thoughts others wish to reveal, and thus in interpreting unfamiliar languages. Perhaps more importantly, though, you gain the likewise-universal ability to close your own mind, whether to particular individuals or to all. This barrier of ‘unwill’ makes it impossible for even the greatest and most powerful mind in Arda to perceive or alter your thoughts – but you can still be persuaded, intimidated, tortured or tricked into lowering it. By default, the unwill still provides a strong barrier against other means of intrusion from outside this jump (e.g. psychic powers), but is not entirely invulnerable. In future jumps, characters will be able to close their minds against your thought-reading and thought-sending in a similar way, regardless of the local metaphysics, and with time you may be able to teach them to close their minds against similar intrusions by other means.",

Befitting this world shaped by music, you have a talent for song and poetry; you can carry a tune or recite a poem easily, injecting appropriate emotion. Furthermore, you can easily memorise such artworks. For 400 CP, free to Elves and Maiar and discounted to Men of the West, the power of your music and chanting goes beyond ‘mere’ poetry and song. Through such music, you can perform goetia, the magics of the mind. With a calming song you could quiet wild beasts and befriend furious horses, with an upbeat and merry melody imbue a party with an air of enchantment, wonder and joy, with a quiet rhyme help conceal yourself and others in foliage and shadows, or with a bellicose chant ignite courage in the hearts of your allies and intimidate your foes. Alternatively, you may sing such songs to counter similar enchantments of others; for instance a song of courage and resilience to help another resist the terror-spells of a Nazgul. On your own, the effects you can invoke with this are relatively subtle and will be tiring, but many such chanters together can magnify the effects and reduce the burden upon you, as can magical tools such as Rings of Power. For 600 CP, free to Maiar and discounted to Elves, your mastery of the music goes still further. No longer limited to affecting minds, emotions and perceptions, your songs and chanting can alter the physical world. A low, whispering tune might call up mists from the ground to cover your passage, while a wild, high chant might conjure storms or send a river raging down from its source. Your music can encourage plants to grow, fires to rise high, or even stone to shiver itself apart. However, such magics are draining to body and spirit, the more so the more overt and grand the effect; a little chant for call light from a staff-tip or conjuring a shroud of mist on a cool night would be quite simple, while shattering stone or calling storms would be extremely exhausting even for even the most powerful of the elves unaided. As with lesser songs, additional singers of similar power, and magical tools can make this easier. Furthermore, these musics alter and command what is already present, rather than calling new things into being. At a significant cost in exhaustion - even to one bearing a magical tool such as a Great Ring - you can condense such a song or chant into a single note; a Word of Command which takes effect in a moment, such as when Gandalf shattered the bridge of Khazad-Dum, or attempted to hold back the Balrog of Moria behind a sealed door.",

Not creative or innovative like your normal thoughts, but absolutely patient, and never stopping, slowing, or growing bored. If you need a material with a certain set of properties, they can go over everything you know about material science and systematically work through it until they find such a material. If you need to make a process more efficient, they can systematically go over all possible iterations, checking them one by one, simplifying one way, then another, and another, seeing what works and what doesn't. You always know how many steps you went up or down on a stairway, how long your stride was, how many windows you passed, and other such points of data. This doesn't give you bottomless memory, but the machine minds in the back of your head miss nothing, and can ponder anything and everything. They can even outperform a more brilliant mind, because they never dismiss anything and leave no stone unturned, even ones a more intuitive thinker would overlook. They excel at keeping the facts in mind, and only the facts. What they lack in creativity or innovation they make up for in being utterly systematic. You also find it easier to work methodically through things with your normal thoughts, and when you do you can work with the machine thoughts, using your intuition and creativity to help them overcome problems and find solutions faster. These extra thought trains always equal your normal ones in raw processing, but are otherwise crippled as described above. However, they will take on weakened shadows of any mental or social enhancing perks you possess. For example, if you have the Social Intelligence perk, they will pick up on social data, and can work with it despite not being creative or intuitive, processing through such data in bulk to help you solve larger social questions. They won't be as capable as if you focused on those things with your normal thoughts, but their methodical approach means they can handle bigger datasets then you can, and nothing stops you from considering the ideas and thoughts they come up with your normal less restricted thought processes.",

Buildings hundreds if not thousands of feet high can be built without any apparent load-bearing walls or struts. Windows and doors can be placed anywhere without disrupting the integrity of a building. Of course these techniques work best with the brass and black stone common to Malfeas, even if they work to a lesser extent with other materials. So it is just one more reason most buildings in Malfeas are made of brass and basalt, along with their abundant presence. Yet many more techniques are used by the artisans and architects of Malfeas, even aside from the omnipresent murals, wall carvings, and other ornamentations. Techniques to create such marvels as buildings that sprout from the ground at unnatural angles and made of polished brass turned a rainbow of colors by a process known only to the most skilled of architects. In many of these techniques you have gained the pinnacle of skill and knowledge, that you might might replicate the Demon City's constructions even in other realms. While you might not have reliable access to the materials common to those in hell, you will be able to substitute many other materials for these in your structures.

This represents only the potential to wield magic, not the knowledge to actually do so. Still, it is a rare gift, and holds the potential for great power, and great harm. When conversing in the Old Speech, you cannot lie, or even twist the truth. This is the fundamental mechanism of magic: If something is said which is not true, it becomes so. This requires spiritual energy from you; the greater the change the more energy is required. Commanding something which can move on its own – for instance, calling the true name of an animal to cause it to come to you – is some of the easiest magic, while changing something’s form and substance is much harder. Hardest of all – and perhaps the most terrible – is grasping part of the nature of the world itself; to open doors into death and other such feats. The more a piece of magic goes against the order of the world, the more it demands. By default, you have a fair pool of this energy, which replenishes with time and rest. Perks which increase your store of spiritual energy likewise increase this pool. It is not directly related to the energy of your body, but if your body or spirit is weakened (e.g. by starvation or disease, or by despair and loss of purpose) so too will be your spiritual energy. Likewise, if you exhaust your energy, your body and spirit may ail and become weaker. This perk gives you enough power to be a strong mage or weatherworker, though not the equal of Ged at first.

Forging soulsteel is difficult for even the best smiths. Soulforging is the process by which the souls of the dead are melted down and then shaped into useful items or are used to produce soulsteel. First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking. Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith’s hammer. Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords.

Not merely a learned ability; Savants in Autochthonia are a unique breed, of which Sodalities and some Alchemicals are part of. This breed of individual possesses an exclusive talent for instinctively understanding magical and scientific theory. This gifts them a particular aptitude to the repair, operation and maintenance of magitech adding on top of whatever skills the user has for determining their ability to attempt this feat. This does not actually aid in the execution of such functions, effectively acting as understanding without skill in creation. At the 50 CP Tier this is a mere glimpse into the wonders of the Great Maker. Gunzosha Armor, Light Implosion Bows and other such artifacts of power are understandable with a professional education. At the 100 CP Tier this manifests a moderate understanding of magitech. At this level extremely potent machines like Warstriders or Lightning Ballista can be operated and repaired with even greater ease than the artifacts mentioned in the tier prior. At the 200 CP Tier one is capable of understanding extremely advanced magitech theory as easily as your average socialite understands basic mathematics. As it stands right now, only such magitech as the Realm Defense Grid is beyond your understanding and even that could be understood with light study.",

In the past, you had the enviable privilege of being given a masterclass by him in both the combination of modern science with spiritual energy that has allowed the Infernals to make human civilisation the dominant power of Creation, and ancient feats of artifice lost to the modern era. With this, you know how to design the geomantic structures for secret prayer mills that feed power to the Yozis-or perhaps, yourself with minor adjustments. Constructing engines that can seal off death-tainted realms of existence or growing a demonic bioweapon are old hat to you. You know how to create many methods of travelling swiftly around the universe similar to the typical means of the Infernal Exalted, encompassing both artifice and sorcery as well as many wondrous marriages of both. But so is the forgotten art of forging demon souls into more archaic weapons and armour, or the schema to recreate monsters of myth long lost to Creation’s memory like Oliphem: A giant of stone and iron who can walk on the sea or sink to its bottom freely and without harm, and has a great light-casting lens in his face that can guide ships or sear enemies. The doomsday devices you could build with this beggar imagination. Your skill with genetic engineering and human enhancement with divine components is particularly outstanding, and you can singlehandedly perform the process that infuses human embryos with blood cells extracted from imprisoned Elemental Dragons to create new Dragonblooded from birth. Perhaps in time, you’ll discover ways to modify or improve the Terrestrial Exaltation shall be discovered by you with time and effort. Or apply such modifications to other Exaltations provided you have the correct reagents, rituals and technology. With some innovation, in time it might even be possible to live up to the Infernal lie of human potential by creating a serum that can turn an adult into a Dragonblood. After all, you already know the foundational theories and proven techniques that can alter Exaltations: To cut away the machine-flesh and divine ichor of Autochthon away and infuse it into a Lunar Exaltation, melding it’s evolutionary potential with the modular mechanism of god-machinery to transform it into an Alchemical Exaltation. Similar procedures and the theoretical framework to tamper with these divine superweapons with are known to you, and you have an excellent grounding for altering other Exaltations. Your understanding of the Exaltation’s underlying structure, composition and the crafts with which it can be tampered with is exemplary even for an Infernal. Last but not least all three circles of sorcery have been drilled into you, including many spells unique to the Yozis themselves. Some of these great powers can create magically reinforced silence that even prevent spoken spells from being cast in their area of influence, and the corruption of lands to favour the Yozis as well as their servants and Total Annihilation: A mere fleck of Ligier’s flame that deals great destruction with green hellfire.",

Overall, your skills are well-suited to outfitting large groups quickly - but with enough time and workers, you could raise a fortress to equal Angband, equip your armies in. Finally, you have skill in the alchemies of orc-kind. You can produce a wide variety of medicines, brews and poisons with potent effects. From salves which cause wounds to quickly heal, though with scarring, to deadly poisons to liquors which banish pain and give bursts of energy and vitality to the drinker, you are capable of making all manner of useful potions and poultices.",

A disembodied hand grasps and claws. Neglected corpses rise from their graves, craving the flesh of the living. Such reanimated creations are not restricted to the narrow medical patterns of life. A living being with no heart in her chest falls limp and useless, but the same creature reanimated can move and fight and kill. So made independent from the biological weaknesses of life, undead are not restricted to living or even organic parts. An iron ribcage is stronger than a bone one. In these violent times, swords are often more useful than hands to wield them. From this understanding comes the field of building and maintaining creatures, built of dead and inorganic parts, the art and science called necrotech. Craftsmen who study and perfect necrotech are known as necrosurgeons. Knowledge lies at the heart of necrotech. Necrosurgeons must learn through observation and experimentation. They make progress through scientific investigation and deduction. Yet necrotech is also the highest of arts. When mortals run in panic from the spiked monstrosity with a hundred screaming faces, they know the glory of the Void. For this reason, most necrosurgeons take great pride in the hideous beauty of their creations. As an expert necrosurgeon, you have a firm grasp of the science of necrotech, and the mundane skills in medicine and crafting that underlie it. You may create meat puppets and bonestriders, yoroi ogres and exoskeletons of bone and metal, and you could just as easily practise more standard medicine or forge weaponry. But you have a possibly even greater mastery of necrotech as an art, allowing you to create things of macabre beauty and exquisite hideousness. Delicate constructs of bone-clockwork, beautiful youths perfectly preserved and turned into bladed weapon-champions, or the horrific mother of suffering. Whether you wish to evoke beauty or horror, you have the skills to do both. And the aptitude to apply this slant of the gothic and the horrific to all your other creations besides.",

You are a master of all manner of crafts and trades which deal with the natural world and the products thereof; you are a master farmer and cultivator, a herbalist, husbandman and carpenter. You can build wondrous things of wood and weave magnificent tapestries or clothes from plant or animal fibres. Furthermore, you have the skill to ensure that what you build exists in harmony with the natural world, enhancing and beautifying it, rather than destroying it. You can cultivate groves of fruiting trees and sunny glades of grain without having to clear the forests to make way for ‘productive’ land, build cities into the crowns of great trees to fill the canopy with light and song without disrupting the paths of animals across the forest floor, or build sanitation systems that make use of the roots of plants and beds of marsh-plants to purify and make use of waste. Part of this includes making it so that your creations can visibly blend into the natural world, often making it difficult to tell where nature ends and craft begins - or to find you or your people, if they don’t want to be found. Furthermore, your understanding of the natural world enhances any use of magic with regards to animals, plants or the wilderness. Your Sanwe-Latya allows you to communicate with, understand and tame animals, while your Songs of Power can easily lay enchantments on your lands, such as causing animals to avoid your grain-glades, the stars to glimmer like jewels in the branches, or causing trees to grow as you would wish them to.",

Additionally by working your magic in concert with other mages, you are similarly able to store the spells they may cast as well, though this requires a good deal more time and effort on the part of both parties.",

You are a master shipwright, able to build seagoing vessels whose beauty and grace alone would see them labelled ‘magic’ by most men. They will fly before the wind like birds of the storm, dance over roiling wave-tops and pass without fear through all but the most terrible storms while carrying heavy loads. Above and beyond this ‘mere’ excellence of craft, you know how to weave spells and enchantments into such vessels so that no wind may break their mast, that no rock may shatter the hull, that even the slightest breeze will send them flying fast over the waves, that they may pass unseen by enemy eyes, concealed by fog and rain, while to friends they come like shining stars upon the sea. With enough time and effort, you could build a ship the equal of Vingilot - though the hallowing of it would be beyond you with only this perk. As well as the arts of ship-building, you are also a master of architecture, particularly buildings of grace and beauty, and structures designed to be built along the sea-shore and to work with water. You could build sea-walls that no wave could ever topple, and hidden havens that an enemy would have to search for years to find, let alone to conquer (so long as there are those willing to defend them, of course). You know spells you can lay into these foundations to hide from evil, and to help give freedom and escape to those within. In a well-ruled city you constructed in this way, none could ever feel constrained or bound against their will, and trade would flow like the very winds of the sea, enriching all.",

No matter how great, they do not remember the makers of armor or shields like they do artisans of the blade. On the level of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split magical steel and blades that don't shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much greater distance than just the physical blade. Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps. With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword.",

The making of such artifacts requires the pure form of the dark and acrid liquid known as vitriol, and the binding of demons into these relics, dissolving their forms and integrating their still-living Essences into their creation. Under an infernal artisan’s ministrations, pure vitriol serves as a catalyst. Objects bathed in it are seared free of weakness, making them as strong as any of Creation’s magical materials; component parts flow together and intermingle, amalgamating into a unified whole. Where an artificer in Creation would spend months carving and shaping an artifact’s components, his Malfean counterpart immerses them in vitriol and guides their slow, inextricable melding.Then, one slowly integrates the dissolved form of a living demon, known as Chalcanth or Azoth depending on their power, into the device’s nascent structure. A demon must be of sufficient stature to match the power of a relic in order to bond with it, and likewise must its nature also accord with the relic’s function if the procedure is to succeed. Now you too will join the ranks of hell's greatest artisans, with knowledge and skill that encompasses vitriol itself, the acids and catalysts derived from it and its use in the crafting of infernal relics. Your knowledge encompasses much understanding of demonic Essence, as well as the instinctive ability to use the appropriate mundane crafts to use together with vitriol as the catalyst. Bonding the Chalcanth to a Brass blade of your own design shall be a labor almost considered easy to an craftsman of your skill. Likewise the arts of demonic magitechnology and the creation and modification of life through vitalizing essence are known and practised by you, though their applications are somewhat more complex. As one of Hell’s master artisans you may even surpass the limitations of the dull and feeble demonic essence contained within your creations, to instill them with a demonic will as a true Hellforged wonder with its own intellect and awakened essence.",

At will, you may also manifest a halo above your head, and beyond having to look kinda like a halo, you get to choose how it looks. This power, access to the Key of Kings, grants you many abilities. First, you are able to do stuff like summon phantasms of gods to fight for you, have clones made up of white energy split from your body and attack your enemies, teleport, and more. Additionally, you know one of the words of the Seven Part Name, YISUN’s true name. By saying this word, you damage reality itself, and even killing those of weak will. Finally, you can also loan some of your power to your followers. How strong these powers you give them depends on how much power of your own you sacrifice, but these blessings can be pulled back to you at no cost, and making your power whole again. You can also make your Emissaries, the people who have been granted power by you, have their mind twisted to your goals, though those with strong will can fight against this, even defeat your corruption. The Key you get is equal to Allison’s/Zoss’s, though you have to learn how to use it. The downside to this power, is that anyone that sees your Key and knows what it is, they probably want to steal it for themselves. And if it is taken out of your head, you fall unconscious and take a ton of damage and pain, regardless of any power you have.

This will require a bit of practice at-first, and somewhat wasteful; but with time and effort will become second-nature and relatively efficient in its use. Third: You’ll find that you can almost always convert your skills with one system of supernatural abilities to work with another. Adapting Potterverse-style spells into in the framework of Tamriel’s magicka or Exalted’s supernatural martial-arts into Street Fighter should prove relatively easy; Trying to convert the sophisticated magi-tech system of Lyrical Nanoha into the significantly-softer magic of the Dresden-verse might prove a bit more difficult, but you should be able to make something similar with a bit of effort (maybe using runes or something). Lastly: Whenever you learn a new type of magic, your understanding of other magics will become... greater somehow; like the more you learn about magic in-general, the greater you become at all magics.

As a boon for purchasing this perk instead of learning this magic yourself, you will always be treated as having ‘admin’ privileges — at a minimum — within the user hierarchy of any ontological infrastructure or reality implementation system you interact with.",

What reason would there be when they could simply pay for another Magi to make something if they absolutely needed it? You're one of these skilled experts that others come to. Obviously in your chosen field, you're one of the great masters in creating magical items, such that something like Volumen Hydrargyrum wouldn't be hard at all, but even when it comes to fields of magic you have no knowledge in at all you can get surprising results. So long as someone with the requisite knowledge is nearby and willing, you can draw on their knowledge of the subject as you work, effectively combining your skills with their knowledge to become a master craftsman in fields that you have no knowledge of. Capstone Boost: The sorts of things you can draw from those assisting you or willing to offer help has grown beyond just skills, now including abilities and powers that you yourself do not possess or possess at a much lesser level. Whilst you may only use them when you are crafting something and with their permission, you can use any skill, ability, spell or power that they have alongside what you yourself possess to bring your crafting even further beyond what you are normally capable of.",

You are an expert in all the skills essential to raising an advanced agricultural and maritime civilization, from farming to water management to city planning to metalworking to carpentry to navigation - and moreover you can teach these skills to those who lack them at twice the normal speed. However, there is a particular craft which you have especial expertise in. Choose two of the following for free. Additional crafts may be chosen for 100 CP each, or 50 CP with a discount. Shipbuilding: Though your expertise lies more in carpentry than building ironclad ships, by treatments of the wood, metal banding and other methods you can design and, with help from skilled workers, build vessels that can fly across the most treacherous seas like birds skimming clouds, or great ships of war truly worthy of being named Alcarondas - ‘castle of the sea’. You can lay spells upon such ships to ensure good winds save by divine intervention, spells for safe travels and returns and all manner of other enchantments that enhance the voyaging of your vessels, and through a combination of knowledge and spellcraft, perhaps you could even build a vessel capable of sailing the air, rather than only the sea. Architecture: You are a master architect, capable of planning and building such grand edifices as the gates of Argonath or the ring of Orthanc - provided a large enough workforce, of course. More than this, however, you know spells and magics which can be worked into the stone of such edifices to make them as imperishable as the tower of Orthanc or the walls of Minas Tirith. Weaponsmithing: You are a master smith of arms and armour, capable of forging artefacts to equal the craft of the dwarves. Moreover, you can weave into your creations subtle spells of bane and striking, so that their attacks hit harder and more precisely, or pierce protective magics on their targets. An example of such spells are those on the blades of Westernesse which Merry used to render the Witch-King of Angmar vulnerable. On the other hand, you also know spells of protection and warding which can be woven into armour and shields, so that they turn aside blows that ought to crush them, protect their wearers from harmful magics or bolster their wearers’ courage and spirit. Herblore: You are a master of healing, knowing the use of countless medicinal and poisonous plants, and no small amount of surgery either. Though not every wound is within your power to mend, most that other healers would give up for dead can be saved by your expertise, provided you have the appropriate medicines and tools. You could concoct no small number of terrible poisons, either, if you so chose. Furthermore, you know spells of healing which, in combination with your medical expertise, would allow you to counter many curses and magical afflictions, such as that of the Morgul blade with which Frodo would one day be stabbed.",

To understand the vast potential of reality is not to feel insignificant, for everyone is part of the whole. With wisdom, a Wizard of the Cosmos will learn that just as magic ties the world together, so too can your magic be bound to the world instead - vastly expanding their reach. With the correct magical reinforcement, this principle can be used to transform enchantments into variants that are much more costly to maintain, but that operate continually over untold hundreds of square miles: the so-called ‘Domain’ spells. Only a small number of these terrifyingly potent spells are known to Wizards, but you have awakened a potential within you that allows you to develop more of these spells with great ease. You can create a Domain variant of almost any magical effect you know, with only a moderate amount of study and experimentation. Known examples include spells that slowly alter affected terrain to a type more pleasing to the Wizard, spells that burn, poison or curse all enemies under their effect, as well as the creation of Domains that strengthen summoned servants or that allow all allied forces to move with great speed as if under the effects of a ‘Haste’ spell. However, do keep in mind that for all the power of Domain enchantments, they are still tied to the Wizard: these effects will only reach as far as your own magical influence reaches. In most cases this means relying on Wizard Towers, with a potential reach of up to a hundred miles or so, but this also means that losing a tower can deprive a large area of the effects until you re-establish your control.",

Such spell matrices last much longer than common spells, able to persist for weeks on a single casting. Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes. This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years. You and your companions will automatically recover at the start of each new jump. Capstone Boost: The unliving are a rarity among the denizens of the demiplane, often artificially made instead of granted that state by the demiplane itself. This state means you are receptive to other forms of enhancement, this is especially true for those formed from rituals, but will make spells or potions that affect you positively have a noticeable increase in effect. Your life force also has the effect of stabilizing such effects, making them less likely to harm you and allowing you to sustain up to eight such effects indefinitely with absolutely no downsides, though if you want to maintain an 9th effect, you’d have to give up one of the previous ones. This also allows you to maintain ritual spells and allows them to recharge over time. The stabilization effect means that rituals that would normally destabilize your form will no longer do so for longer than a week.",

The shadow is also just better then the original untransended object was. It costs roughly five parts gold for every one part of the object to be transcended.

      "description": "In Valinor, Aulë was a close companion of the Noldor, and taught them many useful crafts. Perhaps you were a student then, or a student of a student, but whatever the case you have great skill in all manner of crafts which deal with metals and the substances of the earth. You are a masterful architect and city-planner, an expert blacksmith, armourer and weaponsmith, a cunning worker with intricate devices, and learn other such crafts with ease. Furthermore, you have a knack for integrating your work with that of others, synthesising different styles of creation to achieve something greater than the sum of their parts. Finally, you have particular skill in one of the following areas, allowing you to imbue your creations not only with mundane excellence, but true magical power. Additional areas of enchantment may be chosen for 100 CP each, or 50 CP with a discount. Architecture: Your architectural skills go beyond the mundane. You can plan cities which uplift the hearts and minds of their inhabitants, build walls proof against dragonfire and the whips of balrogs, and create hidden houses or underground halls so well-hidden that no enemy could find them - provided you don’t build an obvious bridge outside your door, of course. You can carve stone so that it seems to grow like living trees, and meld wooden constructions so seamlessly into a forest that they seem as though they grew there naturally. Weaponsmithing: You can forge steel, silver and mithril into weapons and armour wound about with spells for the protection of their wearers and the destruction of their enemies. You can forge blades the equal of any from the forges of Gondolin, imbuing them with spells to warn of approaching foes. With metal like the star-iron Eol used to forge Anglachel, you could create weapons that would cleave any earthly steel. On the defensive side, your armour and shields would turn aside terrible blows, sit as light on a wearer as silken cloth, and stave off both fear and exhaustion. Jewelcraft: Although jewellery might seem frivolous in comparison to the other crafts of the Noldor, it is here that they achieved perhaps the greatest degree of magical might. You have the knowledge to create items of wondrous power; rings that conceal their wearers, crowns that increase the wearer’s insight and capacity for thought-sending, and other such marvels. With enough time and practice – and perhaps a few secrets from a willing Maia - you might be able to learn how to forge a true Ring of Power.",

With this perk, you gain the power to both bless and hallow, or corrupt and twist things and creatures within the world. If you bless something, you effectively give a part of your spirit and strength to it, helping it grow into more of itself. Blessed things become haler, more healthy, more ideal, more beautiful, less easy for uncorrupted beings to harm and broadly ‘better’, as well as resistant to corruption, rejecting corrupted things in general. A blessed stream will flow swift and clear, full of life but not choked by weeds as it dances over rocks with a musical sound. A blessed land will grow strong and vital, its soil giving forth more crops than before while those crops in turn become more hale and hearty, and the farms will not harm the wilderness, or be harmed by it. A blessed animal might become more intelligent, a blessed sword sharper and more resistant to breaking. Perhaps most of all, blessed things are protected from evil; their thoughts are uplifted with hope and courage, black magic will fail before them, and blessed blades might drive spirits of the dark undead flying in fear. If you corrupt something, you use your power to force it into a shape other than what it should have been, bending it to your will. This is not merely guiding growth, but transforming it into something else. By corrupting a land, you might make it barren, a dreadful, desolate desert, but one that serves your purposes and is less harmful to you and your forces than your opponents. By corrupting a human, you might transform them into a twisted creature, increasing their strength and power in battle at the expense of their new physiology causing them pain or similar. With decades or centuries of work, you could use a combination of corruption, inhabitation of dark spirits and other means to create even new species entirely divorced from what they were before - dragons, vampires and so on. Generally speaking, corrupted beings can either be stronger than they were to begin with, but not necessarily obedient to you, or weaker but easier to dominate. The amount of spiritual power required to hallow or corrupt a thing roughly corresponds to the spiritual power of the thing in the beginning, and its scale. This power is unavailable to you so long as it is ‘in action’ - that is, as long as the power is taken up creating the change . Eventually, a blessed thing will become blessed as part of its very nature, or a corrupted thing become corrupt, and you will regain the power you expended to make it so. The more powerful the target, the more powerful the result - either corruption or hallowing can enhance the target’s powers, whether those be physical, mental or spiritual as appropriate to the blessing or corruption. The more powerful the blessed thing to begin with, the stronger it will be once blessed - the Silmarils burned even the hands of Melkor, the greatest of the Ainur partly because of the hallowing of Varda, but also because that hallowing was backed by the light of the Two Trees. By default, a Maia could bless or corrupt a small valley, or a collection of people. With Arisen in Might, this ability is amplified greatly, allowing you to bless or corrupt entire regions, as Melian enchanted the forests of Doriath, or Sauron desolated the land of Mordor. Additionally, blessing and corrupting are two sides of a spectrum; the more you focus your energies towards blessing, the harder it will be for you to corrupt and vice versa. This ‘slider’ can move both ways over the course of your existence; the most hallowed can descend into the pits of corruption, and perhaps find redemption after even that if they are willing to make recompense and face judgement. You cannot bless or corrupt yourself, though others may do this to you.",

There is nothing that matches the metaphysical value of the human soul, so attempts to revive others, and transmutate human life will almost always cost something that the bearer truly cannot go without such as their eyesight, organs, limbs, or even their entire bodies. This limit, and the one that states that only something of similar material makeup may be transmuted is waved for you. Now, you can apply the scientific reality to the mystical parts of Alchemy. As long as you have the mass necessary, you can transmute one thing to the other without issue. Sealing wounds and fixing bodies as long as you have the matter necessary to remake the parts? Sure.

When someone thinks about your chosen profession your name is often found to be synonymous to it. Not surprisingly the rich and powerful will easily agree to outrageous prices to own what you make. This is what it is to be the Master, but there is more, for you are gifted with talent for organization. Your subordinates always perform to the best of their abilities and always remain very loyal to you. Your businesses don't suffer from misfortune, working like well-oiled mechanisms as long as their focus is on your craft. They need so little oversight that you can spend your time on other pursuits almost without worry for your business. Eventually every master will take an apprentice, or several, and you can fully teach them what you know about your chosen art, almost regardless of how inept they are.

It astonishing that you can do all of this even with most basic instruments and materials, at fraction of time, perhaps the materials bend to your will while you work?

With this might comes greater power; the forms you can wear can be up to ten times the size of a human, with proportionate strength and physical abilities. Your spiritual power is immense, able to face a Maia such as Sauron or a similar spirit on an even playing field, and to hold out reasonably well even against a Vala. This strength can be put into other forms of magic as well, enhancing them proportional to the power you pour into them, such that spells which for others produce a localised fireball instead create a great conflagration - specially when used in combination with your Memories of the Music. Finally, your skill in the magic of song is greatly increased. Not only can you manipulate the physical world as might a lesser Maia (see Songs of Power), but the strength of your spirit is such that you can do so with relative ease, without particular danger of tiring or becoming exhausted. Only enormous workings, such as the raising of a mountain, would exhaust you. Additionally, with lengthy preparation, you can even bring new things into being this way. You cannot create sapient life unless you have some out-of-jump means of providing a soul, but you could cause new species of trees to sprout from the earth without seeds, or create a new source for a mighty river.

This process is not very fast, and can only modify and alter what already exists, but with time you can produce novel species to serve your aims. It is possible to make these alterations in a kind and considerate manner, or for a good purpose, but the process of transformation is rarely pleasant for those who undergo it, and the faster you want to make it happen, the more twisting and painful alterations it will require.",

      "description": "It is said that in the spring of Arda, when the world was lit as it were a changeless day by the lamps Illuin and Ormal, Yavanna first brought forth the fruits of her thought. There were trees in those days which grew like living mountains, cloud-crowned with their feet deep in a green twilight of their own making. Those days are vanished and gone - but in you there lives a memory which can be brought forth once more. At your will, lands you cultivate grow strong and swiftly, plants bursting forth eagerly from the soil at twice the rate elsewhere, with no greater need for nutrients or water. This is but the least of your gifts, however. Under your care, plants of all kinds evoke a memorial of those early days in the spring of Arda, growing five or more times their normal size. This growth is more than physical, though. Lands you cause to flourish in this manner grow strong in spirit as well; they are greatly more resilient to corruption and desecration of all kinds, while animal denizens grow larger, stronger and wiser as well. Herbs and plants are more potent, fruits and crops more fulfilling, and any magical crafts which take advantage of them find their results increased as well. Finally, though, there is the change in you yourself. These bountiful lands nourish you as much as you nourish them. While within these lands, your resilience to injury, disease, poisons and other harms is greatly increased, your stamina and endurance becomes to all intents and purposes infinite, and your strength is magnified twice over. These benefits linger to an extent while outside of these lands, but fade over time; within a week or so the benefits will be lost until you return, whereupon they return at approximately twice the rate.",

      "name": "Vitki",
      "source": "Ars Magica",
      "description": "The Vitkir are mages who originated in northern Germany before spreading into Scandinavia, Iceland and the British Isles. Vitkar magic is based on Futhark runes, and thus their spells are only cast by carving or writing runes onto an object. Each spell, known as a rune script, takes time to learn or invent, but, once learned, can be cast in the time it takes to carve or write a short sentence. A rune script’s duration depends on the material used to write it. Runes written in paint or ink last only days, those carved into wood can last years, and spells engraved in stone or strong metals are effectively permanent unless the runes themselves are destroyed. Unlike other magical traditions, vis is not needed for creating permanent effects this way, though vis does make them more potent. Each rune is associated with certain effects, and each spell is defined by a specific rune or combination of runes. Each must be practiced independently of the others, representing its own skill; a Vitki skilled in Hagalaz-based scripts is not necessarily good at Tiwaz. You gain a journeyman level of skill in each, with the potential to improve with time and effort. ᚫ, Ansuz, the letter “A,” is associated with the mouth, speech, and communication. Rune scripts based on Ansuz might improve the target’s persuasiveness, distinguish audible illusions from “real” sounds, grant the ability to speak, translate spoken language, or read a target’s surface thoughts. ᛒ, known as Berkanan, is “B” in the Futhark alphabet. Berkanan governs youth, healing and fertility, and is specifically associated with the birch tree. It can be used to accelerate or prevent healing, to target young people or animals, or as a contraceptive. ᛞ is the letter “D,” and is called Dagaz. Dagaz means “day,” and growth, light, and the passage of time all fall under its purview. A rune script based on Dagaz might cause its target to grow or shrink in size based on the position of the sun or change the target’s rate of aging. ᛖ, Ehwaz, meaning “horse,” is analogous to the letter “E.” The horse is noted for its strength, stamina and mobility and is considered a noble, loyal animal. The Ehwaz rune can impart these qualities to its target or promote harmony between man and beast. ᚠ is the rune Fehu, equivalent to “F.” It represents prosperity and wealth, specifically in the form of currency, commodities, and livestock. Fehu rune scripts can grant luck or misfortune in acquiring wealth, direct a person to precious metals, or even summon livestock animals. ᚷ, Gebo, the letter “G,” means “gift.” In Norse society, accepting a gift places one under certain obligations, usually giving a gift of equal value in return. Therefore, Gebo rune scripts can improve one’s ability to influence others, and particularly powerful Vitkir can even achieve complete mind control this way. ᚺ is the rune Hagalaz, and corresponds to the letter “H.” Meaning “hail,” it represents the cruelty of nature, storms especially. Hagalaz rune scripts can increase or decrease the damage dealt by their target or summon storms and other severe weather phenomena. ᛁ, analogous to the letter “I” in Futhark, is Isa, and means “ice.” It represents coldness and stillness in a literal and metaphorical sense. Isa can be used to create extreme cold, manipulate ice and water, inflict depression or apathy, or hold a target motionless. ᛃ, called Jera, corresponds to the letter ‘“J.” It means “year,” but is associated with the autumn harvest specifically, and the bounty of nature more generally. Rune scripts based on Jera can improve tasks undertaken for an entire year, such as studying, training, teaching, etc., preserve or improve health, or summon food and drink. ᚲ, Kauno, is the letter “K.” Kauno means “pain,” and is associated with heat and fire. With it, a Vitki can inflict, worsen, or heal disease, improve one’s sight, or set things aflame. ᛚ is the rune Laguz, meaning “water,” specifically seawater. It is the Futhark version of the letter “L,” and rune scripts that use it can summon water, manipulate water, sense water, sense things in water, grant water breathing, or speed travel over water. ᛗ is the letter “M,” called Mannaz. Its meaning is “mankind,” and Mannaz runes inspire skill and cooperation in their targets. ᚾ, Naudiz, “N” in the rune alphabet, means “need.” It can grant fortune or misfortune in times of great need, grant luck in things that the target has attempted and failed before, delay a supernatural effect, extend the duration of another spell, or inflict despair or strife. ᛜ is Ingwaz, which represents the velar nasal sound, “Ng.” Meaning “Lord,” Ingwaz is associated with safety, peace, home, and family. Rune scripts based on Ingwaz can grant fortune to a family or household, provide information on one’s home and family, safeguard the health of a pregnant woman and her child, or summon a person that the Vitki has an arcane connection to. ᛟ is the Futhark analogue to the letter “O.” It is called Othila, meaning “inheritance.” While Fehu represents general forms of wealth, Othila is about specific objects such as heirlooms or lands. A Vitki can use it to improve the qualities of an item, making it more effective in its intended use. Othila can also be used to summon specific nonliving items smaller than a person. ᛈ, Perth, corresponds to the letter “P.” Its literal meaning is “cup,” but it is associated with the concepts of fate, luck, gambling, pleasure, relaxation, secrets, and magic itself. In rune scripts, it can affect luck in matters of pure chance, sense, identify or dispel magic, or locate vis. ᚱ is the letter “R” in the Futhark alphabet, pronounced Raido. It means “riding,” and thus holds dominion over speed and travel. Raido-based magic can help guide a traveler, improve a target’s stamina, repair a vehicle, heal a beast of burden, increase a target’s speed, or summon an object larger than a human, such as a vehicle. ᛊ is Sowilo, “Sun.” It is the runic letter “S,” and is related to light, perception, the divine, and good triumphing over evil. Vitkar magic that uses Sowilo might grant improved perception, sight in darkness, the ability to see through illusions, or invisibility. It can also create or extinguish light or detect divine or infernal power. ᛏ is the letter “T,” called Tiwaz. Tiwaz means Tyr, the Norse god of truth and battle. Tiwaz runes can grant bravery, confidence or skill in battle. They can also locate other people, tell truth from lies, grant mind reading, or predict the actions of others. ᚦ, Thurisaz, represents the “Th” sound in the runic alphabet. Its meaning is “Giant,” “Ogre,” or “Thorn,” depending on dialect. Therefore, Vitkir using Thurisaz can weaken and harm supernatural creatures, create plants, destroy plants, or transform a target into a living thing. ᚢ is the rune for “Aurochs,” corresponding to the letter “U,” and is called Uruz. The Aurochs is a symbol of strength and masculinity in Norse culture, and therefore rune scripts based on Uruz can increase a target’s strength, grant resistance to mind-altering effects, or summon animals. ᚹ is the letter “W” in the Futhark alphabet. It is known as “Wunjo,” meaning “Joy.” It is also associated with intoxication, the absence of suffering, and glory in war. Wunjo-based magic can improve charisma, reduce or eliminate pain and feelings of fatigue, or inspire joy in others. ᛇ, Ihwaz, means “Yew,” and is analogous to the letter “Y.” The Yew tree is associated with death due the Norse practice of planting them in graveyards, and therefore Ihwaz-based spells can create necromantic effects such as sensing, summoning or animating corpses. It can also be used to sense or summon supernatural creatures, summon trees, or increase or decrease a target’s intelligence. ᛉ is Algiz, the letter “Z” in the Futhark alphabet. It means “Elk,” and the rune itself is sometimes interpreted as a hand outstretched in a blocking gesture. It is used for protection and to ward away specific targets. It can also be used to target elk or hands.",

      "description": "The practice of using magic in known and precise ways usually through the expenditure of energy within the self and the use of external catalysts to shape and control it to a given end. As the ability is an innate part of the user, it is very easy to detect at young age and such mages usually start training very early. Academic mages must work hard to build up their internal reserves of magic and be diligent in ensuring that all of this energy is used in as an efficient and precise way as possible. Academic mages are generally more versatile in their magic than ambient mages but tend to be less powerful since they cannot draw upon ambient sources of power. Academic mages may choose to specialize their learning to improve efficiency and increase their skill but this is a personal choice as they do not possess the natural affinities to one form of magic or another as ambient mages do. Some may not choose to specialize at all. The first specialization is free, and each additional one costs 200 CP. Specializations include but are not limited to; Curse-weaving: The act of causing harm through magic, whether it be by causing a persistent ailment, a confounding of the senses or any one of a number of unpleasant things with varying lethality and duration. Curse weavers are popular with people who hold a grudge. Protective: Using magic to protect from harm is a common and well chosen choice. Whether it be charms to ward off diseases, gird against misfortune, turn away curses or even create barriers of raw mystical force, protective mages are always in high demand. Raw Elements: Academic mages who choose to practice elemental magic usually focus on one of the classical aristotelian elements; air, earth, fire or water. From there they focus on manipulating the element to various degrees but usually do so in subtle ways. In particular wards which prevent fire damage, sustain homes during earthquakes or prevent flooding are highly sought after and incorporated into most homes that can afford them. Some may choose to take this raw power in a more offensive route, turning it against others as a weapon of war, or using it to augment existing weapons such as Boom Stones or the dispersal of poisons. Stone: Of the academic elemental mages, stone mages in particular focus on the variety of natural types of stones and may apply a number of wards and protections to appropriate types of stone increasing the spell's effectiveness.",

      "description": "Ambient magic takes different forms depending on the mage and the craft he or she performs. Each Ambient Magic is considered linked to a specific one of the four elements. There are a multitude of different forms of ambient magic, each linked to ages old traditions such as (but not limited to) cooking, dancing, smithing, weaving, animal tending, sailing, building, gardening, farming, and scribing; or to powerful natural forces, such as fire, wind, weather, and so on. Thread: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the manipulation and enhancement of thread, cloth, and other tools of the weaver or sewer’s trade. It is practiced by Sandry and Dedicate Lark. Stitch Witches can enchant bandages to heal wounds, broider veils to hide identities, make clothes that protect like armor or ward away fire, and sew good luck or love charms. Green: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the manipulation of plants and products made from them, medicine making and magical improvement of existing (plant-based) medicines. It is practiced by Briar, Dedicate Rosethorn, and First Dedicate Crane (an Air Initiate). Garden Mages can enchant crops, brew medicines and poisons of supernatural potency, shape entire orchards into living charms, kill entire forests... or restore life to dead woods. Smith: A form of Fire Magic, it allows the sensing and manipulation of metals, ores, and other materials used in smithing (like coal), resistance to fire and burning metal, resistance to smoke damage to lungs, and varying levels of fire manipulation. It is practiced by Daja and Dedicate Frostpine. Not only are Smithmages immune to normal fire and being pierced by non-magical metal, they can craft supernaturally sharp blades, future scrying mirrors, and any number of charms from engraved metal or twisted wire. Glass: A form of Fire Magic, in which the user creates unique glass objects with magical abilities (eg. scrying orbs or tracker / warning pellets), as well as identification of glass works without sight through the piece's own knowledge of its form. It is practiced by Kethlun Warder. Glassmages can make lenses and mirrors that grant extra-sensory abilities, such as the ability to see magic or track footprints. They can also make warded or incredibly strong windows. Carpentry: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the magical shaping of wood, the identification of wood, the strengthening of processed wood, the softening of processed wood, and the sensing of weaknesses within wooden objects. It is practiced by Niamara Bancanor, Camoc Oakborn, and Arnen. Cooking: A form of Fire Magic, Chef Magic draws power from all aspects of cooking and the manipulation of fire. A Chef Mage’s senses of taste and smell are incredibly precise, able to accurately judge both contents and quantities of ingredients. A Chef mage can, in defiance of that age old adage, pull some or all of an ingredient out of a dish with enough concentration. They can enhance flavors, healthiness, or even how much sustenance someone gains. They are also extremely skilled with knives. It is practiced by Jorality Bancanor, Olennika Potcracker, and Gorse.",
