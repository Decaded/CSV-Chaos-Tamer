Using your powers takes less stamina and should you rely on an internal pool of energy, your use of that energy will be more efficient. Furthermore, the effects of power suppression will be very hit or miss on individual powers: No schizo-tech collar suppressing a metagene will affect muscles that you have already grown, but a psi baffle will still work effectively on most forms of telepathy.",

If you are a Warrior you could potentially cut down an army of a thousand regular men all by yourself, and would be capable of feats of skill and martial prowess that would leave regular folk in stunned awe of your capabilities, and have them whispering that maybe you aren’t a mortal at all. If you are a Magic Caster you are capable of spells up to the sixth tier, believed to be the highest tier of magic that a mortal could possibly ever achieve. Spells of the sixth tier can perform things that would be miraculous to the common folk, such as resurrecting the dead, teleporting over unbelievable distances without error, summoning forth powerful creatures as servitors, or potentially casting spells that would let you defeat upwards of a hundred men with no more than a few words and gestures. If you are a Generalist your luck, wit, cunning, and skill are so profound that you have an answer for virtually every situation, and while your combat prowess won’t be as great as a warrior of the same level, and your magic won’t be as good as a magic caster of the same level, you’ll far outstrip anyone that isn’t in the realm of heroes in those abilities.",

This increase is permanent and the rate is quite fast, though it does not scale up as your opponents get stronger. The stronger your opponent is in comparison to you, the faster you will grow but this increase gets less and less the stronger your foe is.",

If so, as long as the person is strong enough and has done many acts of good, out of the good of their heart for the sake of humanity, the Voice of the World will grant them the Hero's Egg. The Hero's Egg is a skill which is also not a skill. It has no other purpose but to awaken its bearer into a Hero once the conditions have been met. It gives no additional abilities nor skills but it does protect its wielder from attack prediction abilities. Afterward, the only step remaining would be to 'hatch' the egg. Although it sounds simple, it is actually more difficult a task than the Demon Lord's 'collection of 10,000 souls', since the Hero's Egg seems to only hatch by the strong willpower and conviction of the bearer. The person needs to truly know right from wrong and believe that what they are doing is a righteous act, and also be willing to face death for that conviction. Your egg has already hatched and your body has been reconstructed and your lifespan was increased, you are immensely stronger than before and a skill of your choosing has evolved to its next level.

      "description": "The true power of a Zanpakuto comes not from immense Reiryoku or total mastery of technique. It comes from the heart. The understanding you develop with this piece of yourself, the bonds you forge and the loyalty between two comrades. There is where true power can be found. Forming such bonds with spirits or intelligent sources of power within your being allows you to increasingly improve the power of your bond. The closer you grow with your Zanpakuto, the more powerful their abilities will grow, the easier they are to use and the less costly their release is to maintain. Truly deep bonds can even reveal entirely new powers. The two of you coming together as one to discover new sides of yourselves and in doing so, uncovering similarly new abilities. Obtaining a deep level of intimacy, an intense bond and acceptance of each other, would make you far superior to an otherwise equal opponent that lacked this camaraderie with their blade. Once a true and full bond is created, you will have the opportunity to truly become one. Known as a Final Technique, undergoing this process will destroy the gap between the two of you and create a new being. Your dear ally does not die from this even if you can no longer perceive them as separate, instead rejoining you to become an integral part of who you are. The final release gained from this, for a Zanpakuto’s Final Technique, would be similar to a greatly enhanced version of their Bankai state. Unlike the few Zanpakuto who can perform similar techniques as a desperation measure, the complete affinity you and your sword forged will allow you to retain this state and your spiritual powers. The state itself is not permanent, acting similar to your previous releases, but it can be entered with a moments notice. It may even leave some changes on your body outside of it, a sign of the part of you that has rejoined the whole. This above process is not limited to pieces of your own soul. Any being that has a connection with you and exists within your being is open to it. It requires a genuine and sincere bond from each side, failing if either side knowingly falsifies it in some way. But even a Hollow or a Demon could become one with their host. The changes you experience from this combination are likely to be much more significant if used with a being that was not originally part of your own soul, as a fair warning.",

While this may take a lot of energy to do, you will never need to practice swinging a sword or cooking food in order to know how to do it, but every time you perform an action, you increase your experience over time until your skill level reaches level 99.

Your own powers will not scratch your skin if reflected back at you, abilities stolen from you will not work against you and energy drained from you will fail to empower foes when they use it to strike against you, leaving them with nothing but their own power. Those thieves will be unable to even use the weapons you wield if they take them from you. So long as it is yours, it will serve them not. If they want to fight you, they’ll do so honourably and with their own power.",

They’re things that can’t give strength, strength to defeat your enemies and protect these fragile emotions. But you know that they make you strong in the REAL way, strong in ways they can’t even imagine. When you’re fighting to protect or for the sake of someone(or multiple someones!) you truly love, you could go from a normal man to someone who could shape and shake the earth with your strikes. Not only strength, but your clarity of thought allows you to bring out an inner focus and competence you may not have even known was there. If the people important to you needed you to move mountains...by god, one way or another you’d get them moving. In addition, the more ‘stage presence’ you have...the louder, more flamboyant, or hot-blooded...your combat abilities rise with your gallant performance, letting you truly become a larger-than-life fighter even if you seem little more than a hooligan or a dandy at a glance. This won’t always suffice against foes far stronger than you, but it may give them a harder battle than they anticipated. And if you do both of these together? You will truly earn the name ‘hero’.",

If you do this favor for him or not is up to you. He can’t exactly take away your powers now if you just disobey him. You have a powerful form you may call upon by shouting “SHAZAM”, manifesting in a great and powerful display of nature. Such as whirling sands or a great burst of fire, or the classic lightning bolt. You may still use this manifestation of nature to heal or harm as you wish, and it is magical in nature. You may also share this power with others who are worthy, however expect yours to decrease in strength when you share it until you get your powers back. Your power is derived from the very gods themselves. With great strength and speed that threatens Superman, you are a power to be feared. Possessing the Wisdom of Solomon, you have eidetic memory and a vast intellect. Excelling at war tactics and mathematics among other subjects. You may also comprehend and speak in any language you encounter, including magical ones as Solomon was a powerful wizard himself. The Wisdom of Solomon also enables you to gaze upon all possible angles of a situation and figure out how to turn disadvantages into advantages. You can fly at fast speeds. You also have a vast well of willpower inside you. You also lack the need for food, water, or sleep. You possess infinite endurance and stamina. You also resist powerful magic, such as Zeus’s lightning bolts, but you also possess great magical talent. (You start out with no skill in it, however. You’ll need to refine your powers.) Only the most potent of magic found here could harm you. Finally, you have been given access to the Rock of Eternity, an interdimensional prison where you may lock up any magical being you desire. Created from two rock formations from Heaven and Hell, it may hold up to great magical beings such as the Three Faces Of Evil. You can also teleport to this place at any time. This will be dragged with you from place to place, and you must be able to defeat them before you can lock them up with you.",

      "description": "There were 41 players that came together to form the guild known as Ainz Ooal Gown (the name Momonga, the guild leader, eventually took as his own) and then later took over and remodeled the Great Tomb of Nazarick. Well, there were 41 of them. Now, however, there are 42. You are the final member of Ainz Ooal Gown and alongside Momonga you are the only one of the ‘Supreme Beings’ that remained behind. You are considered to be a god by the NPC’s of Nazarick and they all swear their undying loyalty to you, and to Momonga. You will have full access to the resources, facilities, and services of Nazarick and may freely command any of the NPC’s within it to do basically anything you tell them to do, the only one who can challenge your authority is Momonga himself. You additionally have your own luxurious quarters on the 9th floor of Nazarick itself. Since Ainz Ooal Gown was originally founded upon the idea of group decisions you will always have a say in the general direction that Nazarick takes in regards to politics and the distribution of resources, but your own vote is no greater or lesser than that of Momonga himself so you will likely need to compromise on particularly divisive issues. Taking this option automatically overrides your location roll. You automatically start in the throne room of Nazarick alongside Momonga, with events prior to your appearance having played out as they normally would have (such as Momonga editing Albedo, and taking into his possession the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown). Additionally you will gain memories appropriate to being a member of Ainz Ooal Gown (you can not be a Drop-in with this option), and you will find yourself having an extremely strong attachment to the NPC’s, such that you’ll find yourself forgiving of just about anything they do that isn’t blatantly and obviously a screw up on their part, as well as possessing a strong desire to protect them (and Nazarick by extension) and a towering anger at anyone that would dare to lay a hand on them. Capstone-Boosted (Requires Level One Hundred): You’ve hit the pinnacle. There is no higher level, not within YGGDRASIL at least. As a Player you have hit level 100, not exactly a surprise since most Players had done that, and represent the absolute peak of personal power and ability. If you’re a Local then you’re quite frankly a freak of nature and are probably seen as a god by any other locals that actually know what you’re really capable of. Literally, by the way, the Slane Theocracy actually worships as gods a group of six level one hundred Players that appeared to them in the past, though virtually no one still alive outside the highest echelons of the Theocracy itself actually knows that. All level one hundred individuals possess high-tier nullification defensive abilities. This means that individuals won’t be able to even hurt you that aren’t, at the very least, within the fabled ‘Realm of Heroes’ and even then they’d have to be a hero among heroes to manage it, and they’d still have to get past your normal defenses even if they manage that much. The only hope they’d normally have is if they possessed access to some magical artifact of sufficient power to get past your defenses. That said the high-tier nullification is an all or nothing ability, either it works or it doesn’t. Your physical and magical statistics are absolutely mind boggling as far as the locals are concerned. Even magic casters, if they’re level one hundred, will possess physical strength and defenses on par with a warrior that is ‘only’ in the ‘Realm of Heroes’, and warriors can expect to be far far beyond even that. Magic casters actual magic power is enough that it could literally bring even the greatest human archmage to his knees in awe and shame at his own weakness, were he to actually witness your true strength. Even warriors that only dabbled in magic would still be on par with magic casters in the ‘Realm of Heroes’ at the very least. The abilities of a Generalist, both physical and magical, will outstrip everyone other than their level 100 peers by a tremendous degree. As a warrior you are capable of annihilating armies of tens of thousands of regular men on your own, and likely wouldn’t even notice them. It would take legendary heroes or beasts to actually make you break your stride. You’ll possess skills that will let you nullify certain damage types outright, perform swings of your weapon that can hit dozens of individuals at once with air pressure alone, and provide you with a myriad of defenses against magic casters that would seek to stymie you and prevent you from closing the distance. You are literally a one-man army killing machine. As a Warrior you additionally possess ‘super moves’ that can do things like grant temporary invulnerability to virtually anything, allow you to strike everything in your line of sight with a single powerful blow at the same time, or hit one opponent dozens of times with a single strike. As a magic caster you are capable of casting spells of every tier up to the 10th Tier. This is a tier of magic that only a bare handful of people in the entire world even know exists, with most believing that 7th tier is as high as it goes. 10th Tier magic is the stuff of legends, capable of healing armies or slaying them, resurrecting the dead en mass, permanent teleportation circles, ‘buffing’ or ‘debuffing’ entire armies, summoning forth creatures of legend as servitors, and so forth. As a Magic Caster you’ll also be capable of ‘Over-rank Magic’, also known as Super-tier magic, that exceeds even that. Singular spells that could slay 70,000 men in one go and then also summon massively powerful eldritch nightmares under your command at the same time, destroying entire cities with rain that infects those it falls upon with an undead plague, conjuring forth miles upon miles of enchanted forest that responds to your will and will empower you while you are within, or spells of similar such scale and effect. Unlike normal spells ‘over-rank’ spells don’t actually cost mana and are more akin to skills, they always have a long casting time, usually a minute or so, and you must stand still and can not do anything else while casting them. Additionally you can only use them a few times per day. If you are a Generalist there really isn’t a question of ‘can you do something’ so much as ‘how do you do it today, and will you do it differently tomorrow’. You’re not quite on the same tier of skill as the warrior at combat, or the magic caster at magic, but you’re just below both of them. Magic of the 9th tier is yours to command, and while you’re not the combat beast a warrior could be you find that your command of both the physical and magical aspects give you a range of utility and versatility no one else could boast. As a Generalist you don’t benefit from super moves or over-rank magic but in compensation your statistics are significantly better overall in the areas where the other origins would be weak. You do have one area however where you particularly shine. You are blisteringly fast. You could run circles around the warrior even if you couldn’t beat him at swordplay, and you can certainly close the distance (or run away) from a magic caster in the blink of an eye. You’ve also picked up a penchant for sneak attacks, and opponents that don’t see you coming rarely get the opportunity to learn from that mistake.",

      "description": "You were born as a being with the power and destiny to both save the world and to destroy it. Your physical form is far beyond any humans. You have the power to destroy the moon in a single blow, to travel faster than light with just your own two feet and several more unique powers on top. The first, imbuing your power into other objects. With this you can use your full power through anything you pick up. A flicked rubber band would hit with the greatest amount of power you could put out with a punch. You could poke someone with a pencil and blow a hole clean through them. Even the air around you can be used, a puff of air turning into a wave of destruction when it originates from you. The second, a great defence against all powers. No supernatural or superhuman ability, no matter how strong or strange, can affect you unless you allow it too. From simple super strength or attacking with the elements to the esoteric, such as warping reality or attempting to delete the concept of your existence, you are utterly unaffected. The sole exception are powers based in the power of language, spoken or written or signed abilities that work solely by being spoken or written or signed. The Styles of this world are one such example. In addition to this, once you have seen an attack against your person once, excepting one that is based in language as a Style is, it becomes useless and ineffectual against you, as you cease to recognise it as an attack. Obviously, if it failed to kill you the first time, it is nothing more than a bug sting. The final, the irreversible action. Any action you take or change you make or damage you deal can be made permanent and irreversible by your will. Wounds you make will never be repaired or healed or changed at all, no matter what is attempted to change them, though language based powers will bypass this too. If you were to break someone’s will, it would remain broken for all eternity. You may reverse this at any time as you will, though it will automatically do so upon your death. This also has a secondary use, in that any attack that hits you will be broken permanently. Swords will be shattered, arms left twisted, techniques rendered powerless and so on. The greater the attack, the worse it will be broken. An ordinary sword might only be left bent and rusted but an indestructible sword of arcane might would be reduced to a pile of dust.",

But it is exactly this problem that the simulation room you have in your possession has solved. As long as you have experienced something personally, you simply need to link your mind with the simulation device, and it will quickly and accurately extrapolate from that information and manage to create a simulation of it that is at least 99.9% accurate, even if you only looked at an enemy fleet and never actually saw its combat capabilities, only growing more accurate as you gain more information. Any amount of people can use this room, its dimensions expanding and contracting as needed and new spots popping up in the same way, and this extrapolation can be used on anyone connecting their mind to it.

It’s the ultimate workshop, perfect for just about anything you may care to work at. It has a huge supply of papers and inks for your fuuinjutsu needs, herbs and plants for preparing poisons or medicines, a forge and metal supplies for smithing, timber for woodwork, and so on, for anything else you may care to work on. The quantities of the materials generated depend on their rarity and value. Something like ordinary paper and ink, or plain steel and wood, would never run out no matter how much you use, while things like paper from special, chakra-enriched trees would be in far shorter supply. But no matter how rare something might be, so long as it’s not absolutely unique, you can expect to find it here, and in sufficient quantities to work with. At the absolute slowest, for materials of priceless rarity like high quality chakra-storing gemstones or metals, you could expect a supply to regenerate bi-yearly, and proportionately lesser times for less rare substances. In future worlds this workshop updates with materials and ingredients of the respective settings, with the same replenishment rules remaining in effect.",

That is, you can control each and every aspect of the inside of this area. You can have any opponent, whether a real person in this world or a custom one, with specific skills you want at specific levels, and any number of them. In addition, you can control the size of the arena as well as the terrain, the gravity, atmosphere, the circumstances for the fight and indeed, everything else short of the passage of time. You can have battles on the scale that carved out the Valley of the End, or however much greater you want, with as many opponents, of however high or low power levels and/or skills, as you want. In addition, you impose whatever restrictions you want on some or all combatants involved, including yourself. This includes, but is not limited to editing yours and your companions’ memories to forget that this is an arena in the first place, letting you undergo the experience of proper battle while inside. Of course, if you just want to train in peace, you can do that too, as this area generates endless supplies of everything required, from natural chakra to practice shurikens to ink and paper. Related to this, all injuries, up to and including mental and spiritual ones, and even death, are undone perfectly upon leaving this arena. All mental and physical trauma involved is erased along with any residual memory modifications placed at the start, all ammunition and consumables expended are replenished, etc., leaving behind only the benefits, all of which are preserved perfectly. Death inside does not count as death, not for you and not for your companions. Finally, while you can’t change them while inside, the conditions you can set include being automatically kicked out upon a certain time period passing, or a certain event occurring, anything. The arena will also automatically eject you if you “die” or get into a state you cannot possibly recover from. Now there are certain limitations in place. First of all, while getting ideas from your opponent’s skill and techniques to improve your own is one thing, no abilities or power that let you copy or steal skills or abilities work here, and second, nothing generated in this world can leave this arena. All your improvements must come from within you, to put it simply.

Sure, you could pay to have some houses built, but with this option you, and each Companion and every child of yours or of a Companion gains their own bedroom. Every three bedrooms gain a full bathroom and your bedroom has a master bath. It’s not luxurious by any means, but this house (or houses) have 1 kitchen & dining room, 2 half baths, two general purpose rooms (offices, living rooms, game rooms), a few small closets, and a pantry for every 6 people. Individual rooms tailor themselves to the general likes of the individual and come with basic but not quality furniture. Companions who decide to share a room can cause their rooms to merge to create a larger room, but each basic room defaults to 4 meters by 5 meters by 3 meters. Non-bedrooms are on the small side but large enough to function. Floors are basic linoleum and walls are basic low grade paint. Appliances and fixtures are pretty bare bones and the walls are little more than plywood and wood frame. The bedrooms don’t have closets. Any other Personal Reality Extensions can be made part of the Housing Complex or kept separated. Each house must have a kitchen. That’s the rule. No more houses than total number of kitchens. A house may, of course, have more than one kitchen.",

      "description": "You’re trained and skilled in one particular area, taking damage. Whether it's because you’re naturally tough, particularly skilled at wearing armor, or have masterful use of a shield the simple fact is you can take damage like a champ and get up from hits that would leave lesser men dazed, if not dead outright. Additionally you are particularly skilled at grabbing, and maintaining, the attention of your enemies, ensuring they waste their time targeting you when they could be better spending their time focusing on your less defensively skilled comrades. Just starting out you’ll have a level of skill at rolling with the hits that would leave you easily capable of taking on small groups of armed men, with nary a scratch to show for it, and oftentimes not a scratch at all. You’ll possess abilities geared for gaining the attention of the enemy, even if they would normally ignore you, as well as abilities geared towards intercepting the attacks of others so that they strike at you instead of their intended target. You’ll also have access to several abilities that will allow you to easily repair any damage done to your equipment. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you’ll be taking on entire small armies of trained warriors (say a hundred or so) and will be unlikely to be injured by them to any significant degree, potentially walking away with no injuries so long as you aren’t careless. Your abilities in maintaining the attention of foes are greater, allowing you to grab the attention of many enemies at once and keep it on you with ease, as well as allowing you to easily intercept the attacks even of enemies that aren’t actually nearby. Your equipment can now be fixed in the middle of battle even as its being damaged, leaving the canny defensive fighter well suited for prolonged conflict. Additionally at this point you will be able to set a small group of allies as being ‘body-guarded’ by you. Half of any damage they would take is transferred to you, though your defensive abilities still apply to the damage in full, meaning it is likely you won’t be hurt very much if at all. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you can easily walk through entire swarms and throngs of ravenous monsters and berserker warriors and not even notice their attacks upon you. You’ll be able to get and then keep, until you allow them to focus elsewhere, the attention of any foe you engage with regardless of whether or not attacking you would be a wise course of action for them, and your equipment is now impossible to break or be damaged by any method so long as you are holding or wearing it. Your bodyguard abilities can now be applied to a massive number of people, and will intercept up to 90% of the damage that would normally have gone to them. Your defensive abilities apply in full against the damage sent your way, as normal, meaning you could potentially tank for entire raid groups all on your own. Finally you gain the Super-Move known as Invulnerable Aegis special ability. You can activate this at any time, several times per day, to render any attack made against you completely and utterly negated no matter how powerful it is. It is one of the few defenses known to be capable of fending off the Dimension Slash ability of the damage focused warrior. Naturally no matter what level you are as a defense focused warrior you’re decent at actual fighting as well, though not quite to the same extent as the magic warrior or monk, and nowhere close to the damage focused warrior. This class synergizes tremendously well with Tireless and World Champion, allowing the defense focused warrior to drag out battles near indefinitely, allowing them to benefit from regeneration, tirelessness, and slowly-increasing strength as the battle grows longer until eventually they’ll be able to batter down just about any opposition. To defeat such a warrior would require quick and overwhelming force, for in the long battle (which they would be uniquely suited to engaging in) they are a nearly insurmountable force. ---",

Just starting out you’ll be faster, tougher, stronger, heartier, and with a greater level of finesse (with your body at least) than warriors that chose to focus on swords and armor, though such individuals may outperform you if their equipment is of exceptional quality. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): Within the Realm of Heroes however your skin is akin to heavy steel plate at the weakest, and your strikes land with such quickness and ferocity that many bystanders will not even realize you’ve struck until after the fact. Additionally your heartiness will have grown to the point that you could casually resist even strong poisons, and disease and infirmity of the body are a thing of the past. You’ll also possess a number of abilities of a more spiritual sort, such as eventually being able to see the invisible, strike the intangible, ignore the damage reduction of enemies, and reinforce your body, mind, and spirit to significantly superhuman levels of resilience. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your blows could crack castle walls, your fists and feet moving so fast that you do not even appear to have swung them, and your movement is so quick that even with just a casual walking pace it may seem to passersby that you are practically teleporting. Your spiritual abilities will have also struck their peak, able to ignore poisons no matter how potent, understand the hearts and minds of living beings (even if you can’t speak their language, or they yours), and your physical aging will have stopped entirely. This class synergies tremendously well with that of a ‘damage focused’ warrior that chooses their body as their weapon, granting the skill, speed, and grace of the monk alongside the overwhelming brute power of the ‘damage focused’ class. ---",

      "description": "You’re skilled in magic as well as swordplay. It’s not really on the same level as your physical abilities but you’re not exactly a slouch either. You’re particularly decent at spells meant to debuff or otherwise hinder large groups of low-level foes, as well as spells designed to force singular opponents into unfavorable positions that you can then take advantage of. Additionally you’re skilled enough with both your magic and physical abilities such that you can easily make use of both even in chaotic melee. That said your magic is best put to use putting your foes into unfavorable positions or forcing them to face you where you are strong and they are weak, don’t expect to be blasting armies out of existence with this. Starting out you can easily best small groups of trained warriors via a combination of both might and magic, easily channeling your foes into unfavorable situations and footing in order to take solid advantage of them. You possess magic capable of weaving illusory effects, as well as more physical magics such as changing the consistency of the ground (such as from hard earth to soft mud) or causing negative effects such a grease or sleet to form where you desire. Your magics and abilities that directly target your enemies focus mostly on slowing them down and sowing confusion, often via dazzling them with bright lights, flashes, sounds, and so forth. You naturally have the ability to channel these sorts of powers through your weapon, allowing you to inflict these effects as you hit your foes. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you could trivially defeat large groups of trained warriors. You could easily sow confusion amongst their ranks via the crafting of illusions, such that they see everyone as an enemy, or everyone as an ally, or for single targets literal confusion as they are stuck by spells that leave them incapable of telling real from unreal or up from down. Induction of vertigo, poisoning, curses, literally slowing people, and even petrification are all possible at this level, and you can even haste yourself. Naturally your melee skills are top notch at this point as well, capable of easily taking advantage of the openings your magic makes in order to make easy kills. Even without the benefit of your magic though your skill is nothing to complain about, easily the equal or superior of anyone that isn’t a damage focused warrior or monk of a peer level to you. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you’ll be able to make literal topographical changes to the nearby terrain, creating gullies, small lakes, pitfalls, cliffs, and more. Your illusions are so powerful that it is virtually impossible to see through them without specific prepared counters, and the debuffs you can layer onto your enemies run the entire gamut of negative status effects, even including potential instant death, and can even hit large swathes of enemies all at once. Additionally your lower-leveled debuffs and effects become passive abilities, allowing you to layer such debilitations onto anyone you strike with your weapon without the need to actually expend mana in the casting. At this level your sword skills are near peerless, easily the equal of your magics, and outside of other peer level warriors it is unlikely you’ll ever meet someone that can give you true challenge in melee. A Magic Warrior benefits tremendously from the knowledge of strategy and tactics that comes with The Long Game, allowing them to effortlessly direct their spells, attentions, and technique in such a fashion as to hinder their enemies into near-inability to act, leaving the Magic Warrior free to take action at their own direction and at their own pace. ---",

      "description": "You’re trained and skilled in one particular area, dealing damage. You have focused on a singular weapon type to the exclusion of all else (your body can be your weapon), and are at the level of a grand master with it. You could easily best any seven of your peers in sheer skill alone, though skill may not help you if the differences in equipment or physical ability are too far out of your favor. Regardless of that however is your sheer ability to deal raw, unrelenting, damage with your chosen weapon. You’ll be able to pierce through armor with it, deal devastating blows, and cause massive amounts of critical damage to your enemies. Just starting out you’ll be able to slay small groups of trained soldiers with relative ease, and so long as you’re careful you’re unlikely to take any damage of note. You’ll possess a number of special abilities designed for striking with more power, increasing your accuracy, dealing considerably greater critical damage, as well for determining potential weaknesses in a foe. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you could easily enough defeat the garrison of an entire castle single handedly, and your special abilities have increased even further. Aside from more powerful versions of your previous skills you will also possess the ability to deal wounds that resist natural healing efforts, may ignore the damage resistance of enemies, and in addition you will have learned several methods to allow you to blow through the prepared defenses of a magic caster. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your skills are virtually unmatched when it comes to the slaying of others. You could casually defeat entire armies of men and beasts without even batting an eyelash, and even beings of legendary martial prowess will find themselves merely your peers, at best. Your special abilities are even more powerful, and additionally you may now deal wounds that prevent both natural and magical methods of healing, as well as forcing weaknesses in creatures and enemies that do not normally have them. You’ll also possess the ability to strike at range, well outside of melee, through either air pressure or the simple force of your martial prowess (your choice). Finally you will have unlocked the most devastating of all direct damage abilities. The Super-Move, Dimensional Slash (or pierce/smash). With this technique you will be able to, several times per day, deliver strikes so devastating that they travel across dimensions, bypassing virtually every single defensive measure known. Armor fails, toughness fails, magic fails. Only pure skill and dodging will save your foes from this technique and with this ability before you virtually anything can be killed. Pointedly it does not prevent foes from being resurrected. A damage focused warrior benefits tremendously from also training in defense focus, as their increased knowledge and skill in defensive ability serves only to heighten their knowledge at exploiting the defenses of others. ---",

As a bonus, this can let you look casual and collected in battle, which is impressive to those who watch it.",

      "description": "This probably doesn’t do what you’re thinking. In this world ‘martial arts’ are known as “a warrior’s magic” and are special skills and abilities that warriors (in general, not just people with the Warrior origin) can learn in order to empower themselves and perform supernatural feats. This talent enables you to learn ‘martial arts’ in half the time it would normally require and additionally allows you to activate twice as many martial arts at a time than would otherwise be normal (a legendary warrior might normally be able to activate as many as seven at once, for example, whereas at the same level you would be able to activate fourteen at once). This also reduces the stamina cost of ‘martial arts’ to half of what thewould otherwise be. If people learned you had this talent, and you actually practiced to take advantage of it, you would be hailed as a mighty hero. Example ‘martial arts’ include increased magic resistance, resistance to mind influencing spells, increased physical prowess, amplified speed, the ability to analyze and identify weaknesses in others, the ability to have perfect knowledge of everything within a three meter radius of yourself, the ability to completely nullify the physical force behind a single strike, the ability to hit multiple targets with a single strike, extremely short term (a few seconds at most) combat precognition, and so on. The more powerful the martial art the longer it takes to learn and the more stamina it takes to use.",

You can see the weaknesses of a foe just by looking at them, you know how many hits they can take, and every time you slay one you get an item based on how tough they were, and this stacks with other items drops. Whenever you are using combat techniques you only need a tenth of the normal energy required to use any moves, andyou quickly learn how to improve from each fight, from the lowest of monsters to world ending foes. Everything you know how to use is a weapon in your hands, from taking out tanks with a watering can, to taking out Gelwein with a fishing pole if you ever get that strong. Every form of combat you have can be used with other combat forms, Non-combat skills can be used this way as well, and you can even use combat skills for mundane tasks quite easily. You constantly improve your abilities in combat, from strength and speed, to things like improving your more unique abilities from other jumps. (Protagonist Boosted) Well now... I guess the previous description is beneath you. In battle your body and every ability you have constantly increases, and even in fights with weak monsters like woolies all of your abilities can increase by up to 1 percent in a one on one fight. With every battle you engage in you’ll learn new applications for your abilities, and you will gain new abilities derived from the old ones you had, either individually or as combinations. If you choose to spar with others, while they won’t nearly gain the same benefits as you at first, they will gain a somewhat reduced version of this non-boosted perk. Anyone you beat in a fight, regardless of if it’s fair or not, will at minimum gain a great respect for your abilities and will grant you one request, provided they live. Have fun mowing down armies or bosses rapidly. The effects of this perk can also be used to upgrade equipment or anything else you own by dividing your boost between yourself and your possessions, but this is guaranteed to be less effective and less efficient than using the blacksmith perks to upgrade them.",

The countless styles of swordsmanship that Unohana Yachiru mastered in pursuit of the perfection of dealing death were passed down to you, maybe from the woman herself, rendering you her equal in Zanjutsu at least.

Styles to allow the effortless counter-attacks to almost any blow, turning the enemy’s strength against them, or to cut away at the spiritual components of the enemy. Your skill is hardly limited to just what a mortal human would see as physically possible and the techniques you’re aware of make you capable of easily laying low those more powerful than yourself. Unohana, even centuries after she put down her blade, still easily killed the mighty Zaraki many times over despite his physical advantages. If desired, you can exchange this talent in swordsmanship for similar skill for another armed weapon form. Spears or hammers or axes or some of the wilder tools the Shinigami employ.

You know how to attack bypassing defenses, and defend in turn from attacks of this nature, by manipulating the opponent’s and your own Ki in turn. Its main technique is Musou Kassei - sucking Ki from the air and using it to further boost your abilities, though it places a burden on the body. It artificially creates something similar to the SP of the heroes, that can also be used to supercharge your magical abilities. It is best used in high-intensity bursts, though if you were particularly talented you may find more benefit in a more constant, low-powered state. You may adapt this style to work on other energy sources, rather than Ki. Chakra, magic, Aura, all may be used in a similar manner with enough practice.

This allows one to temporarily push past their current limits in terms of strength, speed, durability, and power for a very short amount of time, letting them multiply it up to one hundred of their original strength. Normally, this technique is extremely dangerous and draining, the body losing many times the energy gained and spent from the boost, enough to knock out or even kill the user if they overtax themselves. However, this version seems to be an improvement of the original - the duration of the technique starts off being able to last for a full minute instead of a ‘heartbeat’ of an instant, and the backlash will never do anything more severe than a stamina drain to your body. As you practice using this technique in both battle and training, you will learn how to multiply your strength beyond one hundred, and while the drain and backlash grows more severe the more you reach for power, this can be overcome or at least mastered with enough time, training, and mastery. The duration may also be extended over time as you master these greater heights, little by little, perhaps even letting you surpass the art of Transformation entirely...it will not be easy, but such lofty heights are within your reach, now.",

Even having only an hour a night might let you cram in two or three hours of study, helped along by a fairly sharp memory. Your teachers might even start giving you quite a lot of slack when it comes to the sudden disappearances, if you successfully show your smarts now and then.",

Not only do you have vast potential in just about every Ninja Art out there, but your ability to master new skills, arts, techniques, or anything else is utterly absurd. You pick up the basics of new things almost immediately and improve from there at dazzling speed; a month of hard training would give you the sort of gains that an average ninja would spend a lifetime trying to achieve. This works for everything learnable or trainable, in this world or any other. Physical development, chakra capacity, you name it. And you never need to waste time laboriously practicing or reconditioning what you have already learned; your skills and abilities will remain razor-sharp no matter how long they are left unused. Better still, what real genius ever needs to rely on others? You could teach yourself how to become a seal master just from reading the textbook, learn advanced jutsu from half-legible scrolls fished out of the garbage, and master new taijutsu styles by secretly watching other ninjas perform their daily kata. Nor do you suffer any bottlenecks or ‘down’ periods in your training. Every step on the path to power is as simple and obvious as the very first one, when it comes to you. The only limitation on your ability to learn new skills, techniques, or abilities is that you cannot create new information from nothing or train in powers or special abilities that you don’t have the capacity to use. Lastly, the very first lesson you learned was that genius is wasted without the proper application. Your work ethic is excellent and you not only have the dedication to keep grinding away for prolonged periods of time but actually enjoy doing so. --- Jinchūriki Boosted (Requires Jinchūriki): Normally there would be a solid limit to what you can achieve even with the many boons this perk grants you.

The beast within you has a nigh-infinite base of knowledge, and that includes the ability to impart potential for things you just didn’t have before. As long as something is not completely, utterly impossible to use outside of one specific bloodline or some-such, you find that you develop a deep, vast potential for it as soon as you encounter it, and are able, from that point on, to train it just as effectively as you can everything else. In addition to this, you find that the limits to what you can learn, at least, are simply gone. Even though you may not be able to use them, you can now learn any and all techniques, styles and similar, regardless of whether or not it’s supposed to be possible for you or not. And regarding those skills and abilities that are specific to bloodlines or similar, you find that you need to collect a sample of the relevant type, such as DNA from the specific bloodline, or just some blood from that specific race, or a sample of the energy required, before your beast can integrate them into you too, and grant you the same potential, up to and including making you a Hybrid of the race in question, one with all its strengths and none of its weaknesses. ---",

While you learned many magical secrets from Shazam (And possess considerable magical talent yourself, standing heads and shoulders above the typical magic user.), Shazam never granted you the powers he gave Billy. However, he did teach you how to gain them. You start out with two boons from two DC gods or godlike entities like one of The Endless in your new form. (Permission from said being already granted, somehow.) You may not start out with contracts to omniscient beings or metaphysical forces like The Presence or The Red. However you may fill the slots you start out with similar beings Shazam has made a contract with, such as Zeus or Solomon. You may not start out with a contract with any superhero. Now you can, in future realms, call upon the powers of a local god or spirit or any other skilled person to copy their best aspects when you forge a contract with them. If the god or godlike being dies, you lose this power. You do not lose this power when you leave the world. When you forge a contract with them, you add their power to a pool you may draw on. This functions as a form of power copying, but you still need to maintain the connection until you leave the jump, and then you no longer need a connection. You may only have up to six bound aspects to yourself at a time, and the first letters of the beings’ names will make up a magic word you can call upon. When you gain access to other beings, you may swap in and out the powers of other beings from this pool of contracts. You will have no more access to their power until you swap them back in from the pool. You may also draw upon this power by shouting this magic word, like Shazam, and transform in a powerful form that uses these powers. It can manifest in the classic lightning bolt (which can be weaponized if you shout down the name) or some other elemental display, like spikes of crystal or obsidian to represent earth or a blast of fire to represent fire. Or flower petals or some other plant display to represent nature. These will count as magical. You can grant your contracts to others you have deemed worthy, although they will not be able to pick and choose powers like you can. You will be the one deciding which gods or entities they derive power from. Granting parts of or entire contracts to people will make you lose the portion of the contract you have granted, and granting the entire contract will make you lose them. You may forge a contract with all-powerful, omniscient beings like The Presence with this power, and forging a contract with metaphysical forces like The Red is also allowed. However, you may not gain reality warping abilities with this skill, but gaining any other power is allowed. You will not be any stronger than an avatar of the metaphysical forces you make a contract with. You may forge a contract with literally anyone as well.",

You know how to cast spells like fireball, lightning bolt, haste, fly, invisibility, teleport, charm person, slow, a generous assortment of buffing and debuffing spells, and so on and so forth. You’re also a dab hand at ritual work. In terms of Ranked Magic you start out knowing a fair amount of spells of the third tier, and many more of the second and first. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): If you are in the Realm of Heroes you know and are capable of casting spells of up to the 6th tier. Spells of this level are dramatically more powerful than those of the lower tiers and you could honestly claim to be capable of beating hundreds of men on your own with just your direct offensive spells, and could probably manage far more than that with a bit of planning. At this level you’re considered a potential strategic asset worth whole armies as far as the people of the New World are concerned. Such spells include controlling the weather, conjuring forth skeletal dragons, dominating the minds of others (though in an obvious way), fabricating finished products out of raw materials instantly, making some lower tier spells permanent via the Permanency spell, and many more. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): If you are ‘Level One Hundred’ you are capable of 10th tier magic. Most people in the New World don’t even know that this tier of magic exists, or the 9th or 8th tiers either for that matter. You effectively have no match whatsoever in terms of arcane magic power outside of Ainz Ooal Gown himself. Spells at these heights could smite entire armies casually, summon forth creatures that could do the same for you, or ‘buff’ you to heights similar in physical ability to a warrior of your same level, though not with the weapon skills to make good use of it. Spells at this level include ‘reality slash’, which is a watered down version of the Damage Focused Warriors ‘dimensional slash’ (very watered down), conjuring forth major magical servitors such as primal elementals or high ranking angels (or demons), casting Gate, creating potentially permanent teleportation circles, wide area instant-death magic, teleporting over vast distances without any chance of error, shifting into other planes/dimensions of existence, making much higher tier spells permanent via the Permanency spell, and more. ---",

Additionally at this level your nature magics start to really come into their own with you being able to make minor, but useful, changes to the nearby landscape as well as controlling the weather, calling down lightning bolts, and conjuring forth much more dangerous and powerful monsters or creatures to serve you such as elementals or strong magical beasts. You’ll additionally be able to ‘wild shape’ into the forms of animals and such that you’ve encountered though you can’t transform into anything stronger than yourself, and you don’t get any supernatural abilities from doing so, however you do gain the size, strength, and toughness of said creatures. You’ll additionally be able to lift curses upon others, destroy lower level and even some ‘medium’ leveled undead instantly, casting healing spells that affect large groups all at once, and layer several ‘buffing’ types of magics to improve the performance of yourself or allies. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At ‘Level One Hundred’ you can cast spells of such potency that you could heal entire armies in one go, mass resurrect the dead with no penalty to the person that died, cast spells of protection that can potentially be used to nullify just about any kind of damage you can prepare for, cause earthquakes, turn small forests into armies of treants to turn against your enemies, and your skills in combating the undead are virtually peerless. Your ‘wildshape’ abilities now let you transform into fantastic creatures such as dragons or elementals, and you can even summon forth such creatures as temporary servitors to work your will.

Your spells tend towards beckoning or influencing the ‘spirits’ within your surroundings in order to accomplish tasks for you, and potentially even manifesting such spirits directly either as summons or to empower yourself or others as a form of ‘buff’. Different from druidism which deals directly with the manipulation of nature your approach tends to work through proxy in order to manage such changes for you. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): Just starting out you’ll approximate many of the abilities of lower level druids or arcane casters, but in the Realm of Heroes you’ll start to branch off more solidly, focusing on changing the ‘spirits’ of a given area to impede enemies or aid yourself and allies, calling forth spirit servitors in order to directly work for you, or calling forth spirits within yourself or others in order to increase their abilities. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you’ll be able to call forth spirits of tremendous and terrifying power and scope such as genus loci, giving orders to spirits to maintain or change large areas of land (or water) to support your aims (which they will then continue to maintain until such time as you direct them otherwise), permanently blessing (or cursing) the ‘spirits’ of specific bloodlines, or calling forth spirits into yourself or allies capable of empowering them to truly spectacular might. Taking this class ensures that such spirits will always be available in future worlds for you to call upon. Finally these are spells, so you don’t need to worry about your magic shutting down because the local spirits don’t like you.

You can easily create and control lesser undead, which will be permanent if you use fresh bodies as catalysts, and have a particular affinity for instant-death spells. Even if a target should resist one of your instant death spells they usually have an automatic ‘debuff’ effect anyway, such as guaranteed stunning, exhaustion, blindness, or other sorts of curses and abnormalities. If you couldn’t already you can now turn, command, and destroy the undead like a divine caster of your level and if you could already do that then you’re even better at it.",

You are not joining or fusing magic systems, merely converting spells from one into another. This takes effort and study however, and whether or not it will be worthwhile depends on how interested you are in devoting the time to it. Additionally so long as you’ve seen a spell cast at least once you will, with time and effort, be able to puzzle out its workings. You may need to see it cast multiple times however to glean everything there is to know, so that you might add it to your own list of spells. This ability, likewise, will take time and effort. monster, you can just wait till it’s dead to swoop in and take what you need from it. Or, wait till someone is alone and distracted to kidnap them. This is obviously more effective the more up-to-date information you have, but even if you are completely isolated from the rest of the universe, you’ll still have a feeling when the best time is to leave your isolation and find your fortune.

This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast a dozen God-Rank Spells before being exhausted. Due to your proficiency and mastery of your spells, your Truncated Spell-Casting is further improved which now allows you to shorten the incantation for any magic-spells that you can do a single word incantations. Through completely mastering the Three Main Categories of Magic has given you the ability to meld two or more Magic-Spells into one to reproduce various unique effects and natural phenomena, and this also gives you the ability to combine two or more Magic-Systems into one creating a new magic system with all of the advantages and discarding their disadvantages. This also elevates your innate talent at learning and mastering any Powers though this is more prominent when you’re learning different types of magic and would allow you to reach God-Rank starting scratch within a year’s time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it. This also allows you to invent, innovate and re-create any kind of magic or spells that you see and face with a few times of experiencing it or observing it and it also bleeds to any Powers to a lesser degree.",

Order magic is also capable of undoing the damage that Chaos magic and other corruptions have done, and can ward against it with near perfect ability if used preemptively. Chaos magic on the other hand is about corrupting and perverting nature and the elements to suit the user’s will, and can be used to cause plants and animals to grow in size and hostility, as well as to create powerful magical constructs to harass and attack your enemies. Chaos Magic is also capable of transmuting objects, though not into or from materials with supernatural qualities. Both types of magic allow their users to create force fields, shoot magical bolts, as well as fly. Users of Order Magic may be stronger than Dr. Fate or on par with him depending on his host, but users of Chaos Magic are much weaker than Klarion.",

Besides that, you are a genius at learning magic too, mastering years’ worth of material in days and weeks without even stressing yourself.

Finally, to fuel all this, your ‘Magical Core’, per se, is proportionately vast.

After that? It's up to you. Maybe you might like to look for the past users, if they're still around? I hear the 5th Magic has some red haired chick as its owner. And that kindly old man we mentioned earlier? Well, he's always up for giving kids a few lessons o the 2nd Magic. Good luck, you're going to need it. Of course, any Magic you do eventually master could be taught to a student. Emphasis on A. Once you reach a high level of skill in your chosen True Magic you’ll be able to awaken the potential for it in one other being and teach them too. Once they reach the same level of skill that you unlocked this potential at, you may choose another student. Or if they drop out or die. True Magic is quite dangerous after all. You may buy multiples of this perk but only the first purchase is discounted to Magus Heirs.",

      "description": "A Reality Marble. An incredibly rare and powerful technique. It is the forcible projection of your inner world, the core part of you, into the real world around you. It creates a dimensional pocket of sorts that draws in all those around you for a period of time, creating an arena of your design in which to fight. In this arena, you also gain a powerful new ability, such as summoning copies of legendary weapons you have encountered, calling past allies to your side, negating any use of magic and so on. Whatever this ability is, it can also manifest to you outside of your Reality Marble in smaller, weaker forms such as only summoning a small handful of the monsters within your inner self, rather than the thousands you might be able to call upon if you fully manifested it. These realms cannot last forever, the World around you exerting immense pressure because of the changes you have made to reality by the use of this. Thus, no Reality Marble can last longer than a few minutes, though experience and skill improves this over time. Your Reality Marble is based around a concept of your choosing though no matter what it's base is, it cannot be any stronger then the Reality Marble that one Emiya Shirou eventually becomes able to create as the Heroic Spirit- Archer. Unlike normal users of this ability, your mind will not be twisted or changed in any way through the purchase or use of this. You will also begin with a great deal more skill in the use of the power, the equivalent of twenty years of training in the ability, enough to make it last for a full 30 minutes before you are too tired to maintain the field for any longer and must rest the ability.",

      "description": "This class bears a lot of similarities to classic oriental magical traditions in that you cast spells via the use of special talismans that you can create. Only you can use the talismans you create (unless the other person has ‘Use Any Magic Item’). You’re not quite as focused in the arcane side of things as an Arcane Caster, and not as good at divine magics as a Divine Caster, but you make up for it in dabbling in both at the same time and having a fair amount of exotic or otherwise unconventional magics you can call up. Where you really shine though is that you can prepare talismans with specific spells ahead of time, allowing you to effectively ‘cast’ those spells when you’re not in combat and then keep them in reserve until they’re actually needed. In this fashion you can dramatically increase your combat endurance via intelligent preparation. Crafting these talismans takes you a bit of time, effort, and some resources and they’re only one use, but it’s dramatically easier and cheaper for you to do than anyone else could ever possibly hope to claim. Just starting out you know a fair amount of spells to inflict negative maladies upon your foes, and defeating a large group of armed warriors is as simple for you as cast a few of your magics and then letting time do the rest. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you have a fairly even mix of both arcane and divine spells, however your spells in those disciplines are not as powerful, broad in scope, or quite as versatile as an individual that specialized in those classes. Your single and area target debuffs and curses however are substantially better than either by a considerable margin. You will be able to inflict a large variety of negative status effects, such as confusion, insanity, vertigo, torpor, poisons, the more powerful ‘toxins’, polymorphing, petrification, instant death effects, and more. You bread and butter, such as it is, is that you are capable of debilitating foes, whether they come individually or in large groups, to such devastating effect that often times the battle is won without you having to deal any ‘direct’ damage at all. You are equally skilled at defending against such maladies. In addition your Talismans can now hold two spells at a time, however they must be the same spell. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your abilities have hit their peak. Your spells and debuffs can now affect entire armies of individuals all at once, wreaking utter havoc amongst your foes with singular castings. You could easily poison small cities all at once, or leave an army of statues standing in a field with only the slightest bit of effort. Your debuff and debilitation spells are still your main workhorse, however you know an even mix of both arcane and divine spells of up to the 9th tier, with your 10th tier spells being filled out with your class specific spells. Your talismans can now hold three of the same spell at once. ---",

This means you’re an excellent shot with a bow, decent in melee with a sword or mace, and have a particular affinity for moving through the wilds and taming animals. You’ve also got talent in druidic magic but not to the same extent as an actual Druid. You’ve also got the ability to ‘lure’ monsters to you over a wide area. The more powerful you are the larger the area that you can lure monsters in, and the more powerful monsters will respond. This does not actually create monsters out of thin air, it is entirely possible to ‘over hunt’ as it were. Great for wiping out pesky monster populations. Just starting out you’re well suited for surviving in the wilderness and off the land, easily capable of matching any regular warrior in battle, and know a handful of druidic magics to help ease your way. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you could track a man weeks after he’d moved through an area, assuming he used no supernatural methods to hide his tracks, and your skill with a bow and blade (or other weapon of choice) are sufficient that the mere rumor of your presence in an area is enough for tribes of (intelligent) monsters to steer well clear. Your druidic magics at this level are substantially stronger, able to conjure forth magical animals to serve you, control clouds (though not the climate), heal yourself and others of grievous wounds, and more. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you can track so well that unless strong supernatural protections are taken to prevent it you could track anyone, no matter where they are in relation to you, regardless of whether or not you’ve actually ever seen any of their tracks. Effectively just by thinking about the person you can find them given a bit of time and effort. Your skills with weapons are enough that you could clear out entire provinces of powerful monsters and beasts entirely on your own, leaving small hills of such dead creatures in your wake, or alternatively you could tame such beasts and have them serve you. Your druidic magics are at their peak, you can easily control the weather, conjure forth legendary magical beasts as servitors, and influence and control nature to a considerable degree around you, though not to the same degree as an actual druid. At this level your ability to ‘lure’ monsters is so profound that you can now specify specific types of monsters, or even specific individual monsters if you know of them, to call forth into your prepared traps. ---",

You’re also adept at stabbing foes right in the weak points for ‘massive damage’, a form of ‘sneak attack’ you might say. You’re also particularly skilled with illusionary magics to divert the attention of your foes as well as to seek out information for yourself, or protect your information from others. Just starting out you’re well suited to theft, burglary, infiltration, and the casting of magics to help facilitate such endeavors. Namely invisibility, silence, altering your appearance, and speed of movement. Such skill and abilities make it unlikely in the extreme for regular individuals to detect your actions. --- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes however your skill has increased to prodigious levels, you could tightrope walk across a thin wire dozens of feet in the air during a windy night, slip through even the tightest security, and place yourself easily in just the right way in order to take advantage of the openings of any enemies or foes you may encounter. Additionally at this level your magic has branched out to the point that you can effortlessly weave complex illusions, cast flight and teleportation (though not perfectly accurate), superior forms of invisibility and silence, as well as scrying and anti-scrying efforts to better collect, and protect, information. Your services as a ‘security consultant’ for the discretionary noble or businessman would be in considerable demand. --- --- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your skills are at their peak, you could backstab an undead for massive damage even though they don’t have weak points, slip through even supernaturally empowered security efforts, hide in a man’s shadow in broad daylight at high-noon, and your magical abilities allow you to pilfer information as easily as they allow you to pilfer more physical things.

Your arcane abilities are both subtle and profound, and tend best to work to strengthen and empower yours or others efforts. You now know a lot about just about everything, potentially including even lost or hidden knowledge, and your songs can now potentially affect whole armies, and their effects might linger for hours after you’ve finished playing. ---",

It's a lesson you and everyone must learn, and this has come to pass by how well you can teach others. Combat skills, espionage, diplomacy... these skills and more, you are able to teach your followers with near unnatural efficiency. They will learn in a fraction of the normal time, allowing you to turn weaklings with an ideal into disciplined subordinates that could take on elite forces with a speed that others might think is witchcraft.

That would be you Jumper, for your world is that of the shadows and your trade is in blood and murder. When it comes to the art of assassination there are very few in the Dark Brotherhood’s history who were quite as good as you were. Sneaking into a heavily guarded fortress, silently slaughtering your way through so you can plant your dagger in a King’s chest is just as easy as it would be for you to cut your way through a camp of drunken bandits. More than that, skills such as impersonating officials and guards is child’s play and dancing around alerted foes and slipping a dagger through their armor is much the same, all without even being close to touched. An Archmage or a Warrior King may be titans on the field of battle, but what can they do about the knife they can’t even see?",

Like Mora himself the book will gather information from each setting you go to as if Mora himself was gathering it, this isn’t instantaneous and don’t expect it to pull information that’s under incredible concealment or protected by entities of immense power with ease.

Kryptonian, Martian, and other alien tech development logs are not available through this purchase, and it comes with no working examples of tech, only notes that could, with intelligence and time, lead to recreation of their work. You can't take the Danner Formula as-is to grant yourself super strength. If you have access to a sufficiently advanced computer system, such as a Motherbox, Fatherbox, or Power Ring, you will have zero problems adapting it. If you are a skilled alchemist (or a mediocre alchemist with these research notes), you can modify the formula to work on yourself. If you are a smart enough scientist, you can observe the biological effects in rats or some other short-lived mammal, then replicate the changes in yourself. The research notes are enough to allow someone with no magic training and access to low level super-science to recreate the Danner formula and apply them to adults, given they have about six months to run animal trials. As in, “an ordinary scientist working for LexCorp” level super-science, not “Lex does research personally” super-science. The Danner formula is somewhat unique, in that it seems to work on any Terrestrial mammal, which means animal trials can be used to speed up the research cycle. With magical training, research notes, and household reagents, it would take a month to have a mass-producible super-strength serum that lets humans match Superman without being vulnerable to Kryptonite or red sunlight. If you choose the Garrick Formula, you would not get Flash knockoffs; barring mistakes in the production process, you'd get Flash-equivalent speedsters, lacking only the experience necessary to match the (arguably) strongest member of the Justice League. Complete with Speed Force connection. Other useful pieces of technology to research include, but are not limited to: the X-ionization process, which produces bladed weapons capable of harming Kryptonians. The Thinkers Cap, which provides powerful psychic abilities. Crumbler technology, capable of neutralizing Lantern Constructs and almost all physical matter. Cold guns, a lightspeed weapon which reduces the target to absolute zero in violation of all physics. Red Rocket power armor, currently being mass produced for the Russian Army. OMAC combat robots.

You are one of the people who realizes the great potential for Alchemy to be used on a mass scale to cause destruction, and find yourself able to quickly adapt your alchemy to such pursuits. Even the most basic transmutation of water is enough for you to create bombs assuming you have a spark, and something like simple transmutation of Walls could be used to crush hundreds by simply turning around and deconstructing it, creating a false forward momentum, and essentially making a giant paste maker. Under combat situations you’re great at identifying what’s best for what, All this and more are at your disposal, and while you do need to do some research to modify and maximize the destructive potential of more complex alchemical processes, it’s still far less than it should take.",

Apart from your specialty of replicating the effects of the Three Main Categories of Magic, you can create Magic Armor that would rival the Fighting Gods Golden Armor, Automatons with human-like intellect, Magical Prosthetic for those who lose their limbs, creating artificial labyrinths and even create Magic Tools to suppress and mitigate the Curse by other people. This also includes crafting complex constructs; this can include but is not limited to, teleportation circles, monster creation, magical traps and flying castles. Should you encounter a problem, with enough time and research you can invent and innovate magical items that would solve it and even a half-hearted attempt would make the item that you made likely able to suppress or mitigate the problem. This also grants you the ability to convert scientific-technology to their magical-technology counterparts and with enough time and research you can continually improve the magical-technology or magic-tools that you have. You also have the ability to reverse-engineer any scientific-technology and magical-technology that got your hands on with enough time and even seeing a scientific-technology and magical-technology in actions would give you an idea how it works. Unless your tools are directly sabotaged or damaged by an outside force or suffers a major natural disaster dropped right on top of them, they’ll last basically operate forever as their self- repair functions and systems flawlessly recover them.",

You can translate flawlessly between technology and magic, meaning that you can make technological equivalents to all magic you know and magical equivalents to all technology you can make without losing so much as an iota of the effectiveness. --- Merlin Returned Boosted (Requires Merlin Returned): ​While being good at merging magic and technology is pretty good, being able to merge wildly futuristic technology with highly advanced magic is better. Not only are you highly skilled at magic, but you’re now just as good at the technology side of it, being a certifiable genius among geniuses. Your merged devices now run far superior to either the magic or the tech would run alone, providing dramatically higher effectiveness and utility. In addition, your skills with the more ‘technical’ branches of magic, such as Arithmancy and such cross all imagined levels. Finally, you can achieve even things normally believed impossible through combining spells and technology. You can dispense with the more symbolic and ritualistic components of any and all magic you do, making it entirely as reproducible as technology.

The Reiatsu flows out strongly and indeed, there are some ways in which this age only makes you more deadly. The passing of years will slowly, independent of your actual training or learning, reveal to you secrets and developments to your skillset. The idle consideration given to one’s powers or skills happens to uncover new ways to use old tricks, a method to slightly improve your control over a fire-based release or give a flash of inspiration to solve a long mulled over problem.

You see, when one undertakes human transmutation, they find themselves taken through this gate and given knowledge of alchemy greater than most experts, alongside the price of something taken from them. Somehow your In-Jump origin managed to figure this out, and instead of trying a human transmutation they worked solely for the sake of entering this Gate and obtaining this knowledge. Somehow, this worked. Whether there was an item of great strength involved (hint hint), a gift from The Benefactor, or just Truth deciding to be a magnanimous fellow for once, they got that knowledge. You see, like a certain Dwarf in the Flask, you too have great knowledge of Alchemy. Instead of just being an expert, you’re more like a master, having knowledge of almost every branch of Alchemy in one way or another. Included in this is also the method for creating Philosopher’s Stones, Father’s eclipse ritual, Homunculi (the original kind), Alkahestry, and all the lost arts of Xerxes. Somehow, like the other sacrificial candidates and those stupid enough to try Human Transmutation, you too are now able to use Alchemy without a Transmutation Circle. You could spend centuries truly making this knowledge yours, but for now you’ll have to settle for the good amount of expertise you have. (Requires Alchemy): The art of Alchemy involves many different components, and is part science and part mystical. It involves the law of equivalent exchange, and with that limit in mind, one can comprehend, deconstruct, and reconstruct physical matter into different forms. Amestrian Alchemy involves using the power generated by the Earth’s tectonic shifts to power this transformation, and an alchemical circle to make the change. If this was already obtained, gain a capability boost allowing transmutation with fewer materials. (Requires Alkahestry): Alkahestry is a more medical and spiritual form of Alchemy that involves the “Dragon’s Pulse” which is a concept that details the constant pulse of Chi or life energy within the Earth. Unlike Alchemy, it is far better for healing wounds, and can project transmutation across distances. With this perk, you gain a decent understanding of either Alchemy or Alkahestry, enough to be a State Alchemist for the former, with a minor focus on one form of Alchemy. And similar skill for the latter with a minor focus towards either healing or combat, as well as the ability to read the Dragonpulse, and people’s presences and status.

You could create a piping hot cheeseburger from a brick, but you could not generate a living being or alter one. Hell you could generate a mansion and plenty of fine dining level food just from detritus around you. You cannot control living things, however, as the government that created you also implanted mental blocks that prevent you from altering them. These blocks do not naturally degrade except temporarily during times of extreme emotional stress (like if you were dying after having a Viltrumite punch a fist sized hole through your abdomen and spine) where you will be able to use this power on anything for a few seconds at most. When activated they automatically heal you to the prime of your health as well as anyone else nearby whom you care deeply about. These powers do activate as you die of old age: congrats, you are now physically immortal. A secondary aspect of this power that is both positive and negative is that as you use it results in rapid caloric depletion and the shunting of unused atoms into your digestive tract. While this will never be damaging to you, so long as you use your powers regularly you will always stay thin and remain unable to put on weight past your desired body type no matter what you eat. The secondary and less pleasant aspect of this is that if you use your powers very heavily you will need to go to the bathroom several times a day. With practice and mastery you may be able to learn to prevent this from occurring. Normally you would be unable to use your powers while pregnant as their use would put a strain on and potentially kill any foetus that you carry, meaning that if you got pregnant you would have to go 9 months without using this power. However thanks to the power of jumpchain this issue is no longer there allowing you to use this ability anytime without fear of damaging a foetus. Energy constructs default to bright pink, but as you are buying your power here you can decide what colour they are when you buy this perk. A person with this perk would be capable of creating constructs or manipulating matter that could block a young Viltrumite, and given years to train might even be able to survive against a veteran Viltrumite in combat. While the mental blocks do not naturally degrade, you could break them given the appropriate powers or tech. If the powers are ever unblocked, then even a Regent level Viltrumite would need to fear them as you could easily turn them into literal swiss cheese.

Faster than the naked eye or ordinary reflexes could keep up with, or even faster than a speeding bullet. Lucky you, you know how to keep up. While your own movement speed and reflexes may or may not be up to par, your mind and eyes can follow the motions of things and people moving at supersonic speed with ease. With this, you will never be lost upon spectating a fight or following the speed of an opponent heading towards you at full force. You will still need to train yourself or gain the ability to keep up with such velocity...but it’s far from impossible, now. Take care - somethings may still be too fast for you to follow if the gap is too wide.",

      "description": "Requires: Sharingan For an additional 500 PP, your Sharingan has evolved into an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan (EMS). In addition to possessing all of the normal Sharingan abilities, the EMS gains two unique abilities, along with the power of Susanoo. The pattern of your eye is up to you. Tsukuyomi- By making eye contact with another person you can trap them in an illusion of your design. This ability can alter the target's perception of time, allowing you to make time flow slower in the illusion than outside, allowing you to fit weeks of torture into the span of mere moments. Within the illusion, you are God: whatever you desire, it happens. Amaterasu- This ability allows for the production of black flames that will not stop burning until the target is destroyed or seven days and nights pass. Unlike normal fire, this cannot be put out by water and will not die out on its own until the aforementioned time has passed. The only other ways for Amaterasu’s flames to be dealt with are for the user to choose to disperse the black fire, or for the flames to be sealed away with Fuinjutsu. Amaterasu can burn any material, including other flames, until nothing remains. Kagutsuchi- This is the ability to manipulate the black flames of Amaterasu, changing the shape of the flames or controlling whether it burns something or not. With this power, the user could cause Amaterasu’s flames to cover their sword without destroying it, instead letting it destroy their enemies. Shin’s Object Control- With this ability you can brand any object you desire with a single touch. Doing so lets you use your Mangekyō Sharingan to telekinetically manipulate that object. There is no limit to the number of objects you can affect with this power. Shin’s Portals- You gain the ability to create a sort of warp portal. Normally this is limited to places where other instances of the eye are located (and if you have methods like clones or otherwise you are free to use it as such) but since you're paying CP you may warp to personally branded objects and places (This could be the same mark as Object Control if you have both powers). Although fast enough to catch someone off guard, this is nowhere near as fast nor as versatile as the Hiraishin technique barring extraneous perks or training. Kotoamatsukami- A powerful genjutsu that can manipulate a target’s thoughts perfectly and absolutely without anyone being the wiser. Even being aware that they are being affected isn’t enough to free them. Unlike Kamui, both eyes share the exact same ability. This counts as 2 powers Kamui- This ability allows the user to transfer objects to and from another dimension. Transferring from the dimension can be done with varying degrees of force either simply appearing or flying from the exit point which is categorised as a spiralling void that targets swirl into or out of. Kamui can also be used to travel to and from that dimension meaning that anyone trapped there and trapped forever unless the user allows them to leave unless the target possesses their own version of kamui or another way to travel dimensions. There are two types of Kamui- a long range version and a short range version- each of which must be purchased individually. With the short range version, the user can apply it to themselves, sucking themselves into the dimension and then exiting in any location they want. This is a nearly instantaneous process, allowing the user to avoid attacks, escape threats, or travel long distances in a short period of time. To suck others into the Kamui dimension, the user must physically touch the target. Another application of the short-range version of Kamui is intangibility. This is done by transferring body parts that would have been in contact with the overlapping matter into the Kamui dimension. This can be done to anything the user is touching and wearing. The user can utilise this to travel through barriers, travel underground, and escape attacks. The long range version creates an invisible barrier space around the target, and anything within that barrier is pulled toward the centre, transferring the target to the Kamui dimension. This can be used offensively by creating a barrier space around parts of a target and dragging them into the dimension without taking the entire target, ripping them apart. The greater the user’s chakra, the faster and more powerful the Kamui becomes. For both versions, anything that has been pulled into Kamui can also be launched out as a projectile at a speed greater than or equal to the speed upon entering Kamui, allowing jutsu or attacks to be stored and released similar to a sealing scroll. Susanoo: A power common to all Mangekyou Sharingan users with both eyes, this is a gigantic humanoid avatar made of the user’s chakra and serves as powerful defensive armor and an extremely dangerous weapon. However, it will take time and practice in order to completely manifest a perfect Susanoo, and by default, you will start only able to manifest your Susanoo’s ribcage form. You can decide your Susanoo’s looks and colour but remember all Susnoo’s appearances derive from Japanese mythology. By default, most Susanoo’s final forms resemble Tengu. Upon purchase, you gain 600 PP to spend in the Susanoo Customization Section only.",

The Sharingan grants 2 broad abilities: the Eye of Insight and the Eye of Hypnotism. For the former, the user can see chakra, though not as well as the Byakugan; it can see chakra through some obstructions and detect irregularities in chakra flow. In future Jumps, you will be able to see energy but when it comes to irregularities this will translate into lifeforce, chi, or whatever each Jump’s lifeforce is called. The Sharingan also grants increased abilities of perception, enabling a user to, for example, copy pencil movements, read lips, imitate taijutsu, etc. If a Sharingan is properly developed, it can allow a user to see even on a cellular level. In combat, a user can quite clearly track high-speed projectiles and enemies, and they can easily see muscle tension, allowing the user to more easily predict the enemy’s moves. The last ability of the Eye of Insight is the ability to copy almost any jutsu they see, regardless of whether it is genjutsu, ninjutsu, or taijutsu. They can then either use what they copied as the original user did or modify it to their liking. However, bloodline abilities cannot be copied, and the user requires any prerequisite abilities in order to copy a jutsu. Now for the Eye of Hypnotism. The user can perform genjutsu simply through eye contact, with it they can suggest thoughts and actions to the target, influence their perceptions, and in some cases even completely control them. However, while a target is being controlled, their eyes will take on the appearance of a Sharingan. Users with sufficient skill and practice will be able to control others without this visual tell. The baseline Sharingan’s final two abilities are Izanagi and Izanami. Izanagi is a genjutsu applied to reality itself, giving the user control over what is and isn’t for as long as it’s active. This is only used when the user (or another) is in danger, allowing them to negate injuries or even their death. However, performing this comes with the price of permanently blinding the Sharingan they perform the technique with. Izanami is a technique that enthralls the target into a loop of events that will continually replay within their minds, and each time a loop is repeated, any physical damage that is incurred is healed. Unless the target can acknowledge the results of their actions that led to them being placed within Izanami, they cannot leave even if they know it. Like Izanagi, performing Izanami will blind the Sharingan that the technique is cast with. Blinded eyes will return to their unblinded state at the start of every new Jump or decade whichever is sooner, and Izanagi or Izanami can be used twice total per Jump. If you purchase either level of the Sharingan, you receive the Specialist: Genjutsu for free due to the Sharingan’s ability to cast genjutsu with a glance.",

      "description": "A dojutsu normally limited to the Ōtsutsuki bloodline, one who wields these eyes can utilise six different Paths with each containing six unique abilities, as well as employ all five basic nature transformations, and yin, yang, and yin-yang release. The Deva Path grants control of both attractive and repulsive force. The Asura Path allows for the altering of the user’s body, creating mechanical weapons from their body. The Human Path grants the user the ability to read the mind of any target they touch by pulling out their soul. The Animal Path grants the ability to summon various creatures to aid the user in battle. These creatures are virtually immortal and can be resummoned if destroyed. Doing so requires no hand seals or sacrifices, and this Path can be used to summon people as well. The creatures summoned are up to the user's imagination. The Preta Path allows the user to absorb chakra in any form through physical contact or by projecting a barrier around their body. By directly touching others, you can drain their chakra directly, while the barrier can be used to absorb ninjutsu and genjutsu, absorbing the chakra from the techniques as soon as they make contact with it.. Post-Jump, this is changed to include any energy. However, care should be taken when absorbing energy with potentially dangerous effects, like natural energy for users not properly trained in senjutsu. The sixth Path is the Naraka Path that allows the user to summon the King of Hell to either interrogate or heal. To interrogate the target, the user first has to catch hold of a person. The King of Hell will then unzip its mouth and release a tendril-like hand, which in turn draws out the target’s lifeforce in the form of an elongated tongue. If the target lies to any question asked, the King will remove the tongue and consume it, killing the person. If the target tells the truth, they will be left alive, though significantly exhausted. The second ability is one that repairs all damage. To use it, the King of Hell will ingest the injured body using the tendril arms, and after a while, the injured will emerge completely healed. Bodies and souls can also be transported through the King of Hell. What many don’t know is that there is a seventh Path: the Outer Path, which controls power over life and death. Using this Path, the user can revive the dead, transmit their chakra into black receivers, and manifest demonic statue chains. As you are paying CP, summoning Gedou Mazou won’t cause you to be stabbed by receivers like it did to Nagato. Also reviving dead doesn’t end up with you dying, it still however uses a ridiculous amount of chakra if you revive something akin to a whole village population. The black receivers are rods that are formed out of the user’s chakra. Not only are they incredibly durable and sharp enough to pierce human bodies with ease, the user can also transmit chakra over large distances by stabbing someone with them and transmitting chakra to them. The user can disrupt the target’s chakra and throw off their movements, immobilising them, and even controlling them if they are close enough. The chains this Path generates are powerful enough that they can suppress a Tailed Beast with ease and bind anything they touch. Finally, the resurrection of the dead this Path grants is limited only by your own chakra, meaning you will require large amounts if you wish to resurrect an entire village the size of Konoha at once with no issues. Exceeding your limits while doing so could easily lead to your demise. You can also use the Six Paths of Pain technique by embedding black receivers into a corpse, allowing you to channel your chakra through the receivers into the body, completely controlling its function. You can speak and see through the body, as well as perform jutsu through it. However, due to this, the appearance of the body's eyes are changed to look like a Rinnegan. This can be used to control one body or multiple. The most famous users are able to control even six different bodies, though there is nothing that says that is the max. When using multiple bodies, the user can see through all their eyes at the same time, and can use any of their jutsus through them. The only limitation is that techniques that the controlled bodies do not possess the prerequisites to perform, such as Kekkei Genkai. However, each corpse can be imbued with the powers of a single Path. Be warned, if the transmission of the chakra from the user to the bodies is interrupted, the bodies will stop moving. Also, the appearance of the Rinnegan is up to you; it can look like Sasuke’s, Momoshiki’s, Madara’s, or Urashiki’s. Again you can merge all the dojutsu together. Limbo- This ability allows the user to project a shadow of themselves into limbo, a plane which coexists alongside the physical that is invisible to others, barring those in possession of a Rinnegan or Six Paths Chakra. The user can form four of these shadows, with each one possessing the same abilities as the user, including out-of-Jumppowers. The shadows are invulnerable to nearly any kind of damage, with only Senjutsu chakra being able to damage them. Amenotejikara- A space-time ninjutsu that allows the user to displace themselves between spaces, causing them to instantly swap themselves with anything they desire, even if they are not looking. The user can also target objects and individuals with this technique, allowing them to shift them to another location. Even ninjutsu can be shifted to ensure it hits its intended target. You can even displace yourself by switching places with the air. However, the longer the range of your substitutions, the greater the chakra costs will be. Sasuke’s Space-Time- This technique allows the user to create portals to other dimensions. This requires large amounts of chakra to use. Pattern Recognition- This allows the user to analyse patterns inside codes and by comparing them to similar patterns. Chakra Edible Creation- This ability allows the user to fully absorb the bodies of their targets and turn them into chakra-filled fruits. When someone eats these fruits, they will permanently gain access to all the abilities possessed by the individual that became the fruit. As you are paying CP, your edibles will not cause the eater to gain a demonic appearance unless you want them to do so. The user can also absorb chakra and transform it into chakra pills that grant an immense but temporary boost in power and temporary immortality, though the amount of chakra required is immense. Post-Jump, you can do this with all kinds of energy. Absorption- ThIs ability allows the user to absorb chakra-based techniques and then reproduce those techniques as many times as they desire. So long as you have absorbed a technique once, you can unleash it an unlimited number of times, and can choose to augment it beyond the original level if you have the raw power required to do so. Post-Jump, you can do the same for other energy-based attacks. Temporal Rewind- This allows the user to warp several seconds into the past. This ability requires an enormous amount of chakra, so much that even someone like Madara would be unable to use it consecutively.",

To begin with, while you don’t benefit from something like the Zenkai of Saiyans, your body is durable and even your vital organs become vestigial - you can easily survive and clot wounds as severe as being bisected, though being reduced to tiny chunks can still kill you. You also enjoy a faster growth rate in ki and combat power, even moreso if you train yourself - you can’t lazily breeze through the terrors in this jump by doing nothing, but by applying yourself, you may become a terror all on your own. Finally, as you grow in power, you may create increasingly-weaker ‘forms’ for yourself to both contain and conceal your might, and when the gloves come off and you return to your ‘true form’, your might is terrible indeed. However, this race also suffers from intense stamina troubles when unleashing your true power - unless you properly train, you may find yourself sputtering out into weakness from exerting yourself too much. A surviving adult of your race, you may begin on any planet in the galaxy save for Namek, or at your kinsman Freiza’s headquarters.

As humanity is very close in nature to the Viltrumites and that Viltrumite DNA overwrites lesser species, you can grow to be just as strong as any other Viltrumite out there. You will have super strength, super speed, super durability, and the power of flight. While you do not have super senses ‘per se’, your sight is comparable to a hawk, and somehow manages to operate perfectly no matter how fast you move (even if that is beyond the speed of light). Viltrumites have hyper-evolved and efficient bodily functions such that, holding a single breath of air is enough to last you for two weeks of vigorous physical activity, and you are immune to any and all diseases and ailments bar those that have been enhanced by something comparable to super or hyper science and tailor made to affect Viltrumites. Something like this would take the best scientists of an advanced alien civilization years if not decades to achieve. Viltrumites grow through stress and conflict, so you are able to train your physical abilities or improve through being damaged and healing from it at a comparable rate to if you had trained vigorously during that time. Viltrumites can heal from almost any trauma imaginable, able to get their guts ripped out or being ripped in half, with all it takes to put everything back together is for your bits to be in approximately the right place to heal perfectly, given the time. Due to this healing factor Viltrumites live for millennia, with their aging being comparable to human until they reach physical maturity at which point it slows dramatically. The only issue with this healing factor is that if the heart has about 50% of it destroyed the healing factor does not work, and while it can heal brain trauma (including memories), it caps out at about 1⁄3 of the brain destroyed. Also, as good as this healing factor is, it won’t replace lost limbs. Either reattach them or get a prosthetic. With age Viltrumites remain semi-comparable to humans as their hair changes slowly to white, though they never get wrinkles, and are able to grow glorious facial hair. Although culturally Viltrumites limit themselves to a beautiful mustache. Finally Viltrumites have a single inherent weakness, the complexity of the ear canals that evolved to allow them to balance while flying in space, this complexity means that the right type of sonic pulse could cause immense pain to a Viltrumite and potentially even death given a long enough exposure. No two Viltrumites are created equal. Their powers come from their extremely potent and dense tissue, and can be improved through their lineage or simply training. When you buy this perk you start off at the level of a young Viltrumite, able to hold your breath for hours at a time, and move or fly at hypersonic speeds. You are strong and durable enough to give and receive attacks powerful enough to shatter skyscrapers and break mountains. Given around a decade of natural growth (or less provided you train) you grow to the level of a veteran Viltrumite. Meaning you, with the help of a couple others of similar strength, could shatter somewhat weakened planets and receive similar attacks all while being able to move at well beyond the speed of light, although they tend to limit themselves to hypersonic speeds while in an atmosphere. They are capable of flying between habitable planets within a couple of weeks at their top speed, with the stamina to remain awake and aware through the flight. Given enough time and training you may even eventually be able to make it to the level of a Regent Viltrumite, though something like this would take about a couple decades (or equivalent) of dedicated hard work, and many life or death battles. Being healed to be better than before by someone with powers like Atom Eve may shorten this time further. A Regent Viltrumite is so strong and durable that a veteran Viltrumite could literally cause their own arms to explode into a bloody pulp from striking a Regent and have the Regent be completely unaffected. A Regent is so quick they could move without a veteran Viltrumite even seeing them, and so strong they could literally cut a veteran Viltrumite in half with a casual swing of their arms, like a hot knife through butter. Regent level Viltrumites are powerful enough that they could fight inside a sun, albeit while taking massive amounts of damage to the point of death or near-death if they stay there for about a half an hour or more.",

You could have your guts ripped out of your torso and all it would take would be to shove them back in, and make sure you have nutrients to survive (if you still need those sorts of things, I don’t know you), and you would be able to heal in a few months at worst without a scar to show for it. You are never at risk of infection, never get sick and left to your own devices you could live for millennia without succumbing to old age. Luckily for you this healing works on seemingly everything, from brains to hearts, though you must remain alive (at least barely) for the healing to kick in. The sole issue with brain damage is that when you heal, while you retain all of your previous memories, you may not make any new ones during the healing process if your brain damage remains too severe. Which means you might get injured and then suddenly come-to months later without any memory of the intervening time period while your brain was healing. This is just by default of course, if you have other powers or abilities for continuity of memory then this won’t override or stop those from working. While this does not really increase the speed of your healing it does ensure that you will heal completely and that the healing will not result in scars. --- Capstone Boosted (Requires You Have Been Reborn): Those atoms from the future seem like a vigorous bunch. Now whenever you heal from an injury your body takes the chance to rebuild from it stronger. Get nearly killed and once you heal watch your strength catapult from the level of young Viltrumite to the level of a veteran Viltrumite (assuming you were a Viltrumite, of course). Regardless, every time you heal you become stronger than before. A bone that was broken causes your skeleton to strengthen, a ligament pulled would increase durability and elasticity of tendons and ligaments around the body. If one day you were burned, the next you would be flame resistant.

Either way, you are one of the surviving members of the race of Krypton. At first glance, you are identical to a human - outwardly, anyways. Your internal organs and biochemistry are obviously alien on closer examination. Your true power comes from exposure to radiation from yellow sunlight, which your body absorbs and gives you a host of vast superpowers. First, your base intelligence increases greatly - you are capable of learning new academic subjects within minutes of study, including highly advances sciences and trade skills alike. Secondly, your body strength and durability likewise increase dramatically, allowing you to lift cars, buildings, and more as easily as a normal human could lift a toothpick, potentially pushing several quintillion tons or even an entire planet in time. Your durability is strong enough that bullets and artillery are casually deflected off of your body, and you could withstand planet-cracking explosions and come out with only some burns and bruises. Your senses sharpen greatly, able to view the world on a microscopic scale as well as vast distances away, even witnessing events on distant planets with your eyes or ears, as well as giving you x-ray vision that can perceive as lightly as past clothes or armor, or as deeply as a skeleton, though unable to perceive past lead. Your eyes can also radiate heat vision, able to act as precise as a scalpel or send a city or more aflame. Your breath also has the ability freeze objects and people into ice almost instantly, quickly reducing them to sub-zero temperature in seconds. You are also gifted with flight and super speed, able to move faster than the speed of light, as well as sustain yourself within the depths of space. Finally, the sunlight provided by this radiation is enough to keep your body whole and healthy, giving you a long lifespan potentially measured in millennia so long as your powers are sustained, and acting as a substitute for food, water, and nutrients. All these powers will steadily grow with age and experience, making you a true example of an alien superman. While Superman in his overcharged state is much stronger than what you start with, maybe you can reach that point naturally over a long period of time...? That said, there are downsides. While this won’t be a problem in most day-to-day circumstances, constant use of your powers will exhaust you of the energy your body has absorbed, with the physical invulnerability always being the last to go - and you won’t regain them until you once again expose yourself to the light of a yellow sun once again. Exposure to red sun radiation will quickly drain your powers away in similar circumstances, making you a ‘mere’ human in terms of physical abilities. The force that fuels your physical durability is no help against magical attacks, sometimes even able to bypass it entirely. Finally, the dreaded green mineral Kryptonite will near-instantly depower you upon exposure while causing you great pain, and continued exposure could eventually kill you. That’s not even going into the effects of colored Kryptonite, which can play havoc on your brain. This weakness to Kryptonite only applies for this jump.",

      "description": "You used to be someone special. Someone very special. In a past life you were one of the High Gods of this world, a being of quite literally Earth shattering power. But for some reason you died or lost your powers and were reincarnated into the form of a child of whatever race you are now. It is only recently that you have become able to awaken your powers, as will be described below. All the following powers, including any supernatural abilities of the items included, will be activated via a transformation into your Godly state. At first this transformation will be tiring but over time you will be able to maintain it for longer and longer until it becomes maintainable for good. Your reincarnation grants you a great deal of powers based on who you used to be. You should pick one God, Monster or other Mythological being from legend to be your original self. Your powers and items will be styled after that figure. The exact power of your Reincarnation will depend on whether you buy the 1000 High God option or the 2000 Supreme God option. The first thing that you gain is the physical abilities and life force of a greater being. You have the strength to destroy entire worlds in a single blow or lift them above your head with both arms and some strain. You outpace the speed of light a hundred thousand times over at least and can take hits that crush planets like humans can take hits from each other. Your life energy is such that you could almost drown an entire world just by releasing your power and that your life energy based abilities will be just as world ending as your physical force. The Supreme God option blows these out of the water. They can destroy a High God in a single punch, move at millions of times the speed of light with ease and laugh off the blows of these same Gods. Their life energy is so great as to terrify even High Gods when fully released and potentially threaten the stars themselves. You will gain 2 unique Divine Powers when you transform, based on the legend of the being you chose as your original self. These may be taken from the Divine Power section, if they fit, or made originally so long as they do not exceed the power level of the 600CP Divine Power options or the 600CP Charyeok options at most. Supreme Gods gain an extra 2 unique powers, which may include things up to the level of the 800CP options in the Charyeok section of the jump. Lastly, you will gain 2 unique items based on your original self's legend. These will be on the same level as the tools of the Monkey King, such as Yeoui/Ryu Jingu Bang or Yongpyo. A Supreme God will gain an additional 2 items that are also on the level of these Divine Tools, both also drawn from their own legend. If there are no items to draw from, it is possible to instead turn powers or feats that they have done into original items, though this must still be based on their actual legend. These powers do not come without attention however. Taking the 1000CP option will lock you into the plot of this setting in a sense. Whatever actions you choose, you will end up fighting against several opponents at the level of the High Gods. If this means you join Mo-Ri Jin in his battle against the Gods and take several on yourself or if it means you face down the humans and find several empowered warriors on the level of High Gods in your way, so be it. The 2000CP option will instead guarantee that you face at least two opponents on the same level that Satan and Mo-Ri Jin reached during their climactic battle, whether they be those two at their greatest power or other, original characters. These battles willb be serious, life threatening ones and cannot be avoided, no matter how you much try. Any allies you have will be drawn away in this time, leaving you to prove yourself worthy of your own power. You may find yourself also remembering your original selves' memories from time to time. They will not harm you or influence you but you may learn something from them, about your powers or about who you used to be.",

Your body, mind and spirit are all incredibly far beyond even the peak of human capability. You possess superhuman ability in adaptability, agility, analysis, awareness, attractiveness, balance, calculation, charisma, cognition, combat, competence, coordination, deduction, dexterity, durability, eloquence, endurance, flexibility, instinct, intelligence, intuition, invincibility, leadership, memory, meta-luck, mimicry, perception, persuasion, reasoning, reflexes, regeneration, senses, speed, strength, tactics, vitality, and willpower. To illustrate the sheer level of each of these traits, some examples follow. Your speed allows you to travel at Mach 20 with no training at all, strength enough to pull thousands of tons just by walking forward, charisma enough to get 98% of a student vote to become student president, regeneration to heal every single bone in your body from shattered to full health in ninety seconds and so on. These attributes will also scale up in the case of non-human species that have greater baselines for their average. Your learning rate is perhaps your most shocking ability. You are able to perfectly learn, memorize, recall, understand, master, and utilize anything and any skill by experiencing or observing it once, within seconds. Even things that take years or even decades for prodigies to learn, you can master, truly master, in just a few seconds. You also have no limitations on how far you can grow or learn, able to improve all skills and attributes and abilities without limit and with no loss in speed. You have total control over all parts of your body, including muscles, bones, flesh, blood, organs, nerves, hair, and veins. All of these can be consciously or subconsciously controlled, moved or adjusted, including improving them through thought to inhuman levels. This control is precise to an atomic level. This also allows you to be immune to any forced control of your physical body. Finally, you have a series of super modes that you can unlock over time. Each one greatly boosts the power of your physical abilities and all of your powers, though at first your initial mode will drive you to a mad fury whilst in it. As you grow and learn to use these, you will be able to retain control of your temper and even all other aspects of yourself, rendering you immune to any attempt to control your mind or body or spirit. Eventually you may even be able to keep yourself permanently within this form or to unlock new, unheard of forms based on the powers you have or that you encounter.",

Using this power, the user can shake apart and break brittle things quite easily, change the shape of the battlefield, rattle an enemy and other things you would use vibrations for. The user of this Quirk is limited by the aftershocks of their own ability, becoming stunned or even immobilized for an extended period of time if they shake something with too much strength or speed.",

      "description": "Requires: Super Speed Need to do more than just speed. Now you’ve gained a connection to the Speed Force; a mysterious semi sentient parallel dimension which gives Speedsters their powers. The Speed Force has given you more than just Super Speed for it has charged your cells with massive amounts of electricity. When accessing the Speed Force, you generate electricity from your body, most noticeably trailing your body as you run. Also you can share your immunity to the rigors of going fast by enveloping those that are touching you with the Speed Force. You can also vibrate can vibrate different body parts for various effects. This can mask you from being clearly perceived or distort your vocal cords to disguise your voice. You can vibrate to forcibly expel any toxins that affects you. By vibrating you can also generate great amounts of heat to recover & even be kept thermally insulated from extreme cold. By vibrating your molecules at the frequency of air, you can physically pass through solid objects. With training you can do this with multiple targets, such as an entire moving train and hundreds of passengers. You can also harmlessly pass through living individuals. He can also pass through the highly complex objects in universe that's vibrational frequencies differed from your own. Alternatively, you can use this as a weapon by passing your punch through a person's body, incapacitating them. Or by vibrating your hand and passing it through a person’s heart or brain killing them. By vibrating at varying frequencies and with different levels of force, you can create small tremors and can induce extreme amounts of jolt on any target you touch, even disrupt the inter-molecular bonds and cause it to shatter. Your vibrations can even shatter objects into fragments. Greater your speed the stronger the tremors are, to the point where you can create a small earthquake by moving at top speeds. When you gain enough speed you’re able to pierce through the time barrier, space barrier & dimensional barrier. When you bypass the time barrier you may enter different points in time and arrive at a destination with pinpoint accuracy. You can do this in one of two ways; either enter timelines independent from yourself and unaffected by his travels or perform a time do-over, wherein you \"merges\" with your temporal counterpart to be fully immerse in the timeline. Regardless of the changes you makes, this leaves you unchanged allowing you retain all memories of the previous timeline in addition to the new timeline and differentiate between the two. Through training you’ll be able to \"create\" a time remnant by traveling back to moments before your current self-time travels, hailing from a future that no longer exists. This allows you to be two places at once, enabling you to interact with the world for two separate actions simultaneously. If desired, you can create dozens of time remnants at once. Be warned if you abuse this too much, or change the time too much, then the Speedforce will send Time Wraiths or if the changes are too grievous the Black Flash. These beings are the enforcers of the timeline, if they catch you they will kill you or erase your existence rapidly. So be careful not to abuse your powers too much. When you pierce through the dimensional barrier, you can break open portals between dimensions, allowing you to travel to any other universe within the local multiverse, including the main Earth called Earth One. If desired, you can also bring others with you. At first you cannot consciously control this, but through training you break open portals of your own accord and consciously chose your destination, even into the Speed Force itself. Lastly when you pierce through the space barrier you can open space breaches, enabling you to shift and warp about and appear out of nowhere to new locations. When combined with super speed, your actions can appear as if you’re in multiple places at once by rapidly moving through these breaches to new terrain. Post-Jump you’ve become a conduit for the Speed Force itself, allowing the Speed Force to follow you throughout your travels. Lastly the Time Wraiths and Black Flash will no longer bother you. Everything you see Barry Allen do you’ll eventually be able to do as well if you train & push yourself to improve. What’s not known to a few is the fact the Speed Force is an intelligence that’s existed since beginning of time. It’s taken a shine to you and should you spend six months within the speedforce voluntarily, all soft caps will be removed. You’ll also subconsciously learn the speedforce language, a language that conveys lots of information with just a few symbols, which when studied will unlock the ability to share speed with non-speedsters for a short period and/or take away speed from speedsters for a short period of time.",

This is a very potent ability and even before active training has the potential to turn someone back minutes or hours in mere moments. With intense training, it has the potential to reverse only parts of someone or something. Intense training would be required either way however, as Rewind is difficult to control by default. It works on activation, being easy to turn on but difficult to stop at first, leaving control a serious issue.",

Their Right Arm is the Arm of Thievery, able to selectively ignore any outside influences to steal things, allowing the user to phase their arm through objects and steal things within those objects before phasing back out. Taking all of someone’s blood without leaving an entry wound is as easy as stealing a section of a rock to hide within the resulting hole. This arm can also be used to steal powers from other beings, which are then utilised with the left arm, the Arm of Usage. This arm is the one through which all stolen powers are channelled, though the powers are only degraded versions of the originals.",

Instead, they refine what they know, make it better, and dedicate themselves to it. When you focus on something, be it the use of a specific weapon, the skill necessary to mine ores, or even the study of magical theory, you can slowly internalize this focus and make it a part of you, allowing it to shape your development and skills in a way that aids you more than it otherwise would. This will naturally make you more suited towards the skills related to what you’ve internalized and ease any restrictions on you for learning such skills. Over time, you may be able to enhance an existing focus to be stronger and offer greater benefits to you, especially as you Rank Up or gain associated Jobs, even unlocking new ones based on your foci. Alternatively, you may gain the ability to instead internalize a new focus, on top of the existing one, which will shift your affinities to overlap with it. This is easier to accomplish if the foci internalized are related. An example of this is E, a goblin that grew fascinated with spirit stones and started to mine them regularly, developing into an affinity for earth that allowed her to eventually evolve into an Earth Lord, giving her great strength, durability, and the ability to control the earth itself.",

Techniques and training methods that are potent, you shall show great talent for. Fate smiles upon you, for your enemies tend to have a more difficult time dealing with you. You will never be permanently killed by anything so mundane and pathetic as a mere fall down the stairs or choking on your food. Your plot armour is ridiculous, letting you walk away with stuff that would maim or ruin normal people. Lastly, you gain some insight into the nature of your enemies; it will help you when confronting them. --- Secret Technique Scroll (Requires Xianxia Protagonist): There are many hidden combat arts throughout the long and storied history of the realm, and this scroll is but one of them. With successful study of the scroll, training in line with its instructions, and meditation on its deeper meaning, you will obtain a unique skill, one that will likely aid you in future training and provide you with unique options in combat. What the effect is is ultimately up to you but below are certain examples; Increasing the weight of an object the more spiritual energy you put into it. Being able to separate your spirit from your body. Concentrating all of your spiritual energy into a single point. Granting you control of all parts of your body, even your sweat and hair. Or maybe even making your skin become as hard as metal when you flow your spiritual energy through it. Or maybe cutting your enemy with your blade the instant before it actually connects. Ultimately, what this technique is and how it manifests is up to the buyer, but two things will almost always be true of it. The first is that it will always be limited to what a highly advanced practitioner of martial arts could do (or at least what they claimed they would be able to do in the distant past). And secondly, that it will improve and become more effective the longer and harder that you train with it. ---",

You find that people around you tend to practically fall over themselves to grant you artefacts, powers and abilities, be they superpowers or letting you summon their servants as your servants, or something in between. This happens most often with beings of great power and age, demons and demon gods, spirits and plain gods, but affects just about everyone. They never seem to care what other powers you have, even if they come from their enemies. Nor do they have much restraint in handing out the good stuff, making you among the most powerful ever empowered by them at a minimum. They do this most often through letting you share their bloodlines, or souls, or something in that vein, granting you power that won’t fade with time but instead only likely improves, though the latter is far from automatically assured. The bloodlines and powers you recieve in this way never harm you in any way, shape or form, and they always play well with each other, even if it makes no sense. --- Jinchūriki Boosted (Requires Jinchūriki): While the benefits granted by other gods can be great, nothing quite matches the beast sealed in you. Nonetheless, your beast has much to say and do about these blessings, including some really neat stuff. First, your jinchūriki regeneration has also been boosted, to the point where it can restore lost limbs and return you to full health from anything short of being ground into hamburger. This also affects more subtle things like diseases, poison or even aging, granting you eternal youth and health. Second, not only do your many blessings and boons play well with others but they now play off of each other, synergising and interacting positively wherever possible. The demon’s power also strengthens these bloodlines, meaning that they tend to start growing stronger and richer with time. This can take a long, long time indeed, dependant on the nature of the power and the being who granted it, but it can be sped up massively through certain methods and techniques your beast can guide you through. So thorough is this increase that it’s just a matter of time before your powers match the being who granted them to you, and slightly longer before you cross them and stand at the very epitome of their whole race or species, unless they were already there, of course.

This also protects you from becoming collateral( e.g. when the town you’re in gets nuked), as long as it wasn’t created/used specifically to kill you. This won’t protect you from anyone or anything wanting/created to kill you(mindless minions and the like included), even if you were to use mind control or something similar to attempt to change their disposition. Like the reverse, controlling them will not change the disposition - only actually changing their minds without force will make them incapable of killing you again. Yes, this protects you against Tsunderes.",

For example, the Jinchūriki of Shukaku possess the ability to manipulate sand, while the Jinchūriki of Son Goku possess Lava Release. Through practice and time, a Jinchūriki can wrest away the chakra of their Tailed Beast, forcefully taking their power for themselves. This allows a Jinchūriki to take on the form of the Beast, increasing their physical abilities and granting them greater access to the Tailed Beast’s capabilities. However, there is an alternative method of drawing upon the Tailed Beast’s power: befriending it and forming a symbiosis with it. This partnership can allow your Beast to access your chakra reserves, enabling them to funnel their chakra through you and even absorb and balance nature chakra for you.",

There are two uses for the wish of the god with the first being that should you die by any means it shall use its power to resurrect you. You’ll come back in prime condition, stronger than you were before, and highly resistant to whatever it was that killed you provided it was some sort of exotic or hax effect. The second usage allows a person that is long dead or someone who died in a special manner such as being retconned out of existence, to be resurrected with the same benefits as yours. As you have three special wishes this lets you have three resurrections for yourself or someone else. The sacrifice is unique for The Phoenix as it doesn’t want you to sacrifice anything of your own. If you die or need to resurrect someone and have used up your special wishes the Phoenix will use the last remnants of power to fulfill your wish. The sacrifice is that you forfeit the power of the Phoenix itself. No more wishes until ten years pass or the next jump. However, there is a way to get more of the special wishes without forfeiting the Phoenix's power. The Phoenix absolutely loves to see bloodshed and wants the lives of others in return for the continued use of its resurrection. By killing any sentient being i.e humans, gods, orcs, aliens, fantasy monsters, intelligent animals, etc it will add one more wish for the continued use of its resurrection powers. The Phoenix is known for being supportive and its skill reflects this. With a mere touch, you can restore a person and heal them to their prime condition with the process taking only a single moment. The person can range from slightly sick to even the recently deceased. So long as there is a single body part or piece of skin remaining everyone can be brought back. This healing touch cures them of any and all ailments, diseases, mental illnesses, curses, and anything that negatively affects their mind, body, and soul. You can turn a person's age back into their prime years by reversing the aging process. Yes, you can instantly heal yourself back to full power with a touch",

      "description": "Many view Sages as just another type of ninja, another kind of killer, but we both know that’s not true. A Sage is something more, a being who doesn’t just use the chakra of the world but becomes one with the world. Sages utilize a specialized form of jutsu called senjutsu that involves drawing natural energy from the world itself into their bodies and merging it with their own chakra to create senjutsu chakra. Now, this seems easy but in order to do so the nature chakra must be gathered and then balanced with the body's physical and spiritual energies. Upon doing so, the Sage’s strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception, and durability are enhanced. By utilizing senjutsu chakra, the Sage can cause their ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu to become even more powerful. The Sage can sense chakra around them and can sense attacks without the need to view them and if you can already do that before, then the talent is enhanced. While in Sage Mode, this increases the amount of chakra the user has available and by imbuing senjutsu chakra into ninjutsu, the user can augment the techniques and gain access to special senjutsu techniques. As you are paying CP, you can choose to gain the powers of either the Toad Sages or the Snake Sages. The Toad Sages possess the Frog Kata ability, allowing the user to harness natural energy to extend the reach of their attacks. The Snake Sages possess the Inorganic Reincarnation technique, allowing the user to animate and control the environment around them, as well as using the White Rage technique, a powerful explosion of light and sound. However, this comes with a downside. If too much natural energy is taken in, it can lead to the Sage being turned into stone. Another downside is that the natural energy can only be taken in and mixed only when standing completely and utterly still. If in a fight, you cannot stay utterly still, then your reserve of Senjutsu chakra will diminish as the battle goes on. By paying for it here, you'll find that the first drawback of turning to stone will never occur and you will never make any mistake in the blending of the chakra. Even in a life and death battle, the process will always go correctly. Normally you would require large chakra reserves, but you have found a way around that. Another thing to remember is if you continually practice the use of senjutsu, the time needed to refill your senjutsu reserves will decrease.",

Secondly, you are immune to all but senjutsu enhanced attacks. Thirdly, Six Paths Senjutsu enhances any dōjutsu you possess.

You can opt to stay in the past permanently and continue on or spend up to a week in the past before returning to the present. The present will be changed according to whatever changes you made while in the past. After you travel three times you can time travel again although any subsequent times will require a sacrifice. The sacrifice is heavy as the White Tiger is a bit of a dick. This god wants your existence which translates to your death. If there ever could be a silver lining in this shitty situation it would be that your death is not immediate. You’ll be sent back with the time limit as usual, to do whatever and when your time is up you'll be erased from existence. This process takes a few moments so if you happen to be touching anyone during this act they’ll be erased from existence as well. If you have any resurrection items this will negate the death and you can return to the present or stay in the past but you probably only have so many of those. The White Tiger’s skill allows one to use its power to stop time. In the beginning, you’ll be able to stop time for one second. A second might seem short but in the midst of battle, it can mean the difference between life and death. With the continued usage of the skill, the duration of the time stop will be increased. Eventually, you’ll be able to spam time stop after time stop however sadly a road roller is not included in the deal.

For example, Avarice enlightenment would make you aware of exactly what you want, why, and to what degree. Not only does this prevent self-deception, it also allows you to easily identify any external influence on your thoughts, regardless of how subtle they may be. If you wield a Power Ring or similar weapon aligned with your enlightened emotion, you are now more attuned to its power source, allowing greater power and more efficient use of that power. Emotion based powers will never overwhelm you, and extreme emotions will never override your reason. You can also now perceive the emotions that define and guide another person’s actions both consciously and subconsciously. --- Enhanced (Requires Jolly Cooperation): Lastly, if taken with Jolly Cooperation​ this will allow you to fuse with relevant entities and separate at will, giving you a trump card for when fights escalate to the level of Old Gods. In future jumps, if no equivalent distinct entity of an emotion (an analogue of the Butcher, Ophidian, Parallax, Ion, Adara, Proselyte, or Predator) exists for you to fuse with, you may fusswith all of an emotion that exists in the universe instead for a similar increase in power. ---",

Additionally, you have greater understanding and control of your own soul, granting a slight boost of strength and control of your magic, and a much greater boost in control of any domains or divine magic/abilities you possess. With practice, you can learn to push your soul into mundane or magical artifacts either to siphon strength from them, imbue them with power, make them into a part of your expanded metaphysique for purposes of arcane sympathy or control, or directly struggle against their own power or owner’s power to steal control of the item (though losing such a conquest can have terrible consequences). Most importantly, you can induce a divine awakening in mortal souls (including your own, if you are not already a New God). While this does nothing on its own, an awakened mortal will, over time, grow into a New God, increasing the strength of their soul and connecting to a Domain relevant to their skills and personality. Awakening a skilled mage would lead to a New God of Magic. Awakening Green Arrow would lead to a New God of Archery. Awakening a veteran Green Lantern would result in a New God of Will. A New God of Archery could fire one arrow and hit seven targets around a corner. A New God of Will could match the Guardians of Oa. In addition to granting a domain and increased arcane power, an Awakening will heal most injuries or arcane maladies, and elevate the subject to the ideal status of their species. It will turn white Martians into red Martians and have similar effects on other species with inherent biological or arcane castes. The rate at which a new New God grows into his or her powers can be increased with exposure to raw arcane power.

You see, that question above isn’t just some guideline used to scare away alchemists, or limit their abilities, it’s a legitimate rule of the universe. There is nothing that matches the metaphysical value of the human soul, so attempts to revive others, and transmutate human life will almost always cost something that the bearer truly cannot go without such as their eyesight, organs, limbs, or even their entire bodies. This limit, and the one that states that only something of similar material makeup may be transmuted is waved for you. Now, you can apply scientific reality to the mystical parts of Alchemy. As long as you have the mass necessary, you can transmute one thing to the other without issue. Sealing wounds and fixing bodies as long as you have the matter necessary to remake the parts? Sure. Bringing someone back to life using the materials necessary to form the human body, and their DNA as a blueprint? Truth won’t even flinch. In a way, you’re like a walking Philosopher’s Stone, though even you may not make something from nothing, only reconstitute what is already there. In addition, you still need to follow the rules of alchemy, so you must comprehend what you wish to reform or break down. You best get studying. In future worlds the same applies, allowing you to break the rules of your mystical systems and apply scientific logic to them regardless of their spiritual aspects restricting your ability to act.

The Charyeok is even able to summon an armour that increases the user’s physical abilities even more, with a second stage to go even further. The greatest abilities of Pandora however, are what it gains from its status as the Second Key. Unlike the First Key, Pandora cannot work on more than one target, only being able to unseal one being from the Taboo that the user can see at a time. However, it is also able to seal away powers, leaving the user with only their physical abilities, albeit they may be supernaturally great still, instead of any divine abilities or Charyeok. This sealing may also be used to reflect any attack away from the user and back at the attackers, though both this and the power sealing effect may fail if the foe is too far above the user’s power level. The Final ability of this Charyeok is The Hope- Sovereignty. Within a small area and for a very limited time, the user gains a great deal of control over the laws of physics and causality. With this, one could prevent attacks from being fired or nullify the abilities of others to manipulate physics in a similar way. This ability seems unable to be used to attack others, only change or nullify things. When active, it creates 3 angelic wings on the user’s right side and one on their left.",

It has ten charges of the spell True Resurrection imbued into it just as the name would imply. This spell can bring back anyone from death with no loss in strength or levels, doesn’t require a body, and doesn’t really have a time limit on how long they’ve been dead. Only extremely high-tier effects, such as Over-Rank Magic, World Items, or similar could prevent this wand from bringing someone back from the dead... or, alternatively, if the person doesn’t want to come back they don’t have to, though given how little cognitive thought souls are capable of it’s unlikely they’ll turn it down unless they’re truly terrified of returning to life (for example, if you’ve been killing them over and over and bringing them back to kill them some more). Expended charges refresh a week after use. You do not get extra copies of this item.",

      "description": "Be it the legendary or vassal weapon they are powerful spirits in the form of weapons meant to save the world. Each of these weapons take a variety of forms, some are meant for fighting while others are meant for support. Pick the form of your weapon, it can be a carriage, scythe, sewing set or something that belongs in a category like hunting tool. You can import existing equipment like weapons, armor, accessories, everyday items or even a set of equipment. Depending on its form most of its abilities and function will be geared towards its form but it would always have ways to attack. The weapon possesses a gem that acts as the functional matrix to activate abilities, this gem persists in every weapon form. The legendary/holy heroes cannot gain experience if they are not 1km apart but it doesn’t affect the experience gained by their companions. They cannot equip weapons with intent of using it for battle other than the legendary/vassal weapons. The weapons cannot be removed and if thrown it would appear back to the heroes’ hands. It prevents the legendary/holy heroes from traveling between worlds unless they get express permission from powers such as a guardian beast or the spirit of the legendary/vassal weapons but vassal heroes can freely move between worlds. As this is Jumpchain to be fair it doesn’t matter if you choose a legendary or vassal weapon all of it gains 4 strengthening methods. Pick a strengthening method in the Notes Below, 1 passive-method labeled as Core and 3 active-methods. Its main power is to absorb the parts of monsters, materials like rope, ore, herbs or items to unlock new forms with abilities based of the absorbed parts or materials. As the wielder of the weapon it removes your level cap that everyone in this setting has aside from the legendary/vassal heroes allowing you to level-up without limit. It has the function to automatically craft items with the limitation that the recipe must be known by the hero and only dropped items or created items by the hero can be used but the result is fixed to normal quality. Upon defeating an enemy, there is a chance that it may drop special items that include weapons, armor, crafting materials, and monster parts. This also makes the heroes immune to slave seals and other control-type curses, and inventory that can be used to store items. Grants a hero-exclusive energy called SP that is used to activate the weapon skills. It provides strengthening methods that drastically improves the weapon forms or the hero. The spoken language is translated to the user's mother language but doesn’t translate the written language. When the waves occur the weapons automatically summon the heroes and their respective parties are transported to close proximity to the waves of calamity. Then copy identical forms of the weapon and store them for later access. Even transforming into different variations forms of the weapon that grants you equip bonuses, such as stats, skills, and abilities. The variations can become mastered with enough experience, allowing the user to permanently retain the equipment bonuses even if they switch transformations, some bonuses remain exclusive. It multiplies the experience that yourself and your party members gain that everyone will reach levels that would normally take years of intense training and hunting monsters in months. Unlike the original, these weapons purchased here are soul- bound to the user, cannot be stolen, dismissed by the legendary/holy wielders, corrupted, severed, sealed, disabled or hacked by any authority, abilities or items. This gives you access to all of the strengthening methods in the Notes Below. As the legendary/holy heroes you can gain experience even fighting near other legendary/holy heroes and it doesn’t affect them too. Even equipping other weapons with intent of using it for battle is possible and the legendary/vassal weapons won’t prevent it. You don’t need permission from a guardian beast or the spirit of the legendary/vassal weapons to travel between worlds as you can travel freely. The automatic crafting only needs the recipe and the raw materials of existing monster parts, ores, herbs etc... can be used for crafting now but the result is fixed from normal to excellent. Even the inventory is now directly connected to the warehouse allowing you to take items via your legendary/vassal weapons or auto-crafting can directly access the warehouse for ingredients. When crafting manually the completed items are recorded to the legendary/vassal weapon with their recipes allowing you to auto-craft them later. The crafting speed of the auto-crafting is based on your level and actual skill making it craft faster and in larger quantities the stronger and skilled you are. The translation even translates the written language to the user's mother language. You are not limited to copying weapons in the form of your legendary/vassal weapon, as you can now copy a scythe even if the legendary/vassal weapons form is a sword. Then unlock a sword form with the stars, abilities and skills of the copied scythe. The experience that yourself and the your party members gain that everyone will reach levels that would normally take decades intense training and hunting monsters in months. Certain locations, items, skills and abilities cannot prevent you from changing your weapons forms or preventing you from teleporting. You can bestow energy to vassal weapons that lost their world to restore it into perfect form and keep it functioning, No matter which version you have both had this function. When unlocked multiple but similar forms it merges into one form that has the stats, abilities and skills of its fragments. Any monsters that you train/raise always turn into a queen/king of their race and count as followers. There's no duplicate bonus abilities from new forms, it can be either an upgrade, new ability or stat bonus. You have three forms of teleportation, 1 allows you to teleport on set locations you've been, 2 allows you to teleport on registered or nearest dragon hourglasses, 3 allows you to teleport on where you left your pins. Then transporting entire armies into waves of calamity provided you register the commander officer of the army into your party as Back-up Battle Formations. After this jump you would unlock all Strengthening Methods that you don’t have but its enhancements are only half the potency of the original.",

      "description": "​Now where did you get this beauty? This is a wand, of the very highest quality and power. In fact, it might just be safe to say this is one of the most powerful, best-crafted wands in the world. And it’s made specifically for you. Firstly, it is compatible with any and all systems of magic you can use, regardless of whether or not they normally use foci. And it’s not just compatible, but actually amplifies the effect of any spell you cast with it by an order of magnitude, if not slightly more. Even spells that don’t exactly depend on power have their effects boosted in whatever way would best make sense. You may choose the boost to be less than the maximum if you want people to be unaware of how potent your spells can be. Finally, magic cast with this wand is utterly undetectable to any means other than someone seeing or hearing you doing it, whether directly or through having been looking at you remotely somehow at that exact time. This does not mean that anything you enchant with this will register as mundane, but rather no one would notice you actually enchanting it. It does, however, make it so that nothing can be traced back to you, scrambling any ‘magical signature’ you might have. As an extension of this effect anyone attempting to “check” your wand to see what spells have been cast through or with it will be unable to detect any spell use you would not want them to know about. It expands into a cane or a staff at your will.",

This battlesuit is made from an unknown metal, dubbed “Strange Metal”, this allows the user to enjoy the immunity to static buildup and extreme heat that’s associated with going at extreme speeds. To get into or out of the suit the user has to bend over opening the backside up, this allows for exiting & reentering the suit very rapid. When out of the armor, there is a rudimentary AI on board that allows you for a limited time to remote control of the suit. The armor is linked to an unhackable special program which monitors your vitals, speed, has an ultra-high definition live camera feed, and allows for two way sub vocal audio communication with anyone linked to the armor electronically. While wearing the armor helps corrects your gait for more efficiency and less time on the ground therefore increasing your speed. For non-speedsters this increases your movement to that of a novice Speedster, which is 200mph. For Speedsters it can only do so much but it does increase your maximum speed by 1 Mach. Aesthetically the default look for the armor is to inspire fear and intimidation, with an otherworldly glow given off by neon colored circuitry in the eyes and underneath the armored plates, the color is up to you. You can customize it to however you wish for it to look. For offense the suit possesses a thick, retractable spike mounted on each wrist. The armor is at least a foot bigger than you and with its mechanized parts and material the armor gives the user great strength, allowing you to effortless lift, drag, and send a full-grown man flying through the air with just one hand. Defensively the “Strange Metal” is extremely resilient and durable, both small arms & high caliber rounds as well as a direct energy weapon seem to just richochet off without any damage to the suit. However it can be vibrated through and isn’t to similar or harder materials. If any part of the armor is broken or removed can be telekinetically summoned back to the rest of the suit if it is close enough. Lastly the armor is very cold resistant, with the user being able to instantly burst out of being frozen solid unfazed. You may import any existing armor you own, and it’ll gain all the above properties.",

      "description": "Though many use the crystalline magic known as materia, SOLDIERS are best known for augmenting their arsenal with the stuff. You receive a sturdy briefcase containing a wide array of these small spheres of mako. You can use blue materia to imbue your attacks with elemental effects and increase the range of your magic. Or perhaps you’d prefer to use purple and green materia to enhance your attributes or grant you new spells to use in combat? Yellow Materia can be used to augment your own powers and grant new combat abilities. Most powerful of all, you could use rare red materia to summon powerful creatures to fight at your side. Your equipment can only hold a few materia at a time, and not every materia is suited to everysituation, but you have a wide enough assortment that you could equip an entire fighting party and still have versatility to spare. --- Rare Stock (Requires Limit Break): With this upgrade comes both power and variety. Not only do you have triple the materia at your disposal, but the individual quality of each crystal has increased dramatically. Purple materia that once doubled your health will now triple it. Red materia that once called on Ifrit and Shiva for help now summon the mighty Leviathan and Bahamut. Alone, this effect would be impressive. However, you also receive a second benefit. Now included in your carrying case is a device SOLDIERs used to fuse materia together. By melding two kinds of materia together, you can create synergistic combos, power boosts, and even brand new effects. Combine two Cure materia to double the healing effect. Fuse a Poison and Power Attack materia to create a unique Poison Slice ability. Post-jump, you may use this device to fuse other kinds of magical artifacts together. So long as a magical effect is contained in a physical vessel, such as a scroll or potion, you can mix it with other magics to create complementary combinations. ---",

In a battle between opponents of similar skill level the one wearing Divine tier equipment will virtually always defeat the one that isn’t. The boosts that this set of equipment provides are unrivaled, and the various potent enchantments that adorn them are some of the best you’ll ever find, barring deliberate and painstaking effort on your part. Examples include potent regeneration, permanent high-tier haste effects, dramatically lowered casting/energy costs for spells and skills, extremely high tier spells/skills that can be used a few times per day for free, and various other things.Your equipment is a step further. Your equipment has not only been created with Divine tier materials, but they were also infused with the power of the Caloric Stone during their creation. While you sadly no longer possess the stone itself you do still retain the full benefit of having your equipment halfway between Divine and World Item. The boosts, abilities, bonuses, and effects from equipment of this tier are staggering and in the opinions of many “completely unfair”, leaving even Divine Tier items in the dust.

Both are marked with many precious stones and intricate runes; The left has a pictograph of a man seemingly circumnavigating the whole globe, and the right a pictograph of a man with a spear attacking a beast as his arm seems to blur. They were originally worn by the heroic Hunter Durlast, famed for his ability to run down and dispatch even mythic beasts with his blinding speed and masterful evasions.When worn as a set they triple all the personal movement methods of the wearer, such as flight, foot speed, or any more exotic methods. They also triple the attack speed of the user and increase their reaction times so they can make use of their new speed. Additionally five times per day the wearer may flawlessly evade any single attack or effect that the wearer is both aware of and has time to react to. In the event of an attack or effect that would kill or incapacitate the user the anklets will automatically activate, retroactively if need be.They also provide a resistance to mind-control, negative status, instant death attacks, protection from detection and scrying magics, and freedom from attempts at restricting movement which trumps even the effect of other World Items. Their final abilities however are perhaps their strongest. Whenever the wearer is trying to genuinely run from an opponent they will always be fast enough to escape. Similarly if they are pursuing an escaping enemy they will always be fast enough to catch that enemy no matter what methods are attempted to evade. However, these effects only come into play if either the wearer or their opponent is genuinely trying to escape or disengage from the conflict.It was often joked in the world of YGGDRASIL that while the anklets made whoever wore them into a deadly and fearsome combatant that could run down anyone that they were actually more suited to cowards, who wanted nothing more than to run away.

No doubt, however, it must have been the product of a civilization of unparalleled magical might and knowledge. The wand itself is made of an unidentifiable, and seemingly indestructible, polished wood that seems to drink in the light around it. With runes etched up and down its length and filled in with the seven prismatic ores, it seems to thrum in the hands of those that hold it, the power within clear to the senses, alongside a nebulous feeling that the wand itself is... waiting. For what, precisely, no one can say. However in the meanwhile its powers will serve well anyone that is blessed enough to carry it. The first effect of the wand is the standard protections granted by a World Item, protection against instant death attacks, negative status, all forms of mind control or compulsion, and all attempts at scrying or information gathering magic. Its true power however, and the one that it was named for, is as straightforward as it is powerful. The user of the wand may freely activate it to cast any spell from any style or system of Ranked magic no matter the tier, with the singular exceptions of Over-Rank Magic and spells that are uniquely restricted to special classes (such as the Catastrophe spell of the World Disaster class). The wand can only channel a single spell at a time however, and it takes a few seconds for it to “switch” to a different spell. Additionally, it cannot be used to cast a tier of magic that the person wielding it is not themselves capable of using (so someone that could only use 6th tier spells would be restricted to 6th tier spells, until and unless they become capable of spells of a higher tier). Further, it gives no innate or inherent knowledge of magic or what spells are possible, so truthfully speaking it will only shine in the hands of someone that is already a powerful and knowledgeable magic caster. In future worlds it will adjust to include any and all new spells and magics possible, short of anything comparable to Over-Rank spells or similarly “unique-class restricted magics” however like before it will not inform the user of what is possible, so it will require experimentation and knowledge in order to bring out its full potential. The Wand of Endless Spells is utterly unique and cannot be copied or duplicated by any method using in jump methods, nor can it be destroyed. If lost or stolen it will reappear on your person (or in your warehouse) precisely one day later.",
