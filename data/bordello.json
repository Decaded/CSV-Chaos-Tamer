When you take on multiple lovers (or are in a relationship with someone with multiple lovers), everyone involved just sort of gets along better than they otherwise would. Instead of being jealous of one another as they fight over someone’s attention, they will feel stronger feelings of compersion—that is, being happy over the happiness of others. Although they’ll still want to be with you (or your lover), they’ll still enjoy someone else having that special time instead of them. You may include yourself in this effect as well, if you so desire."

This manifests as something like the hairs on the back of your neck springing up or the taste of blood filling your mouth, not unlike how some mages can taste or smell high concentrations of magical power. This sixth sense is both sharp and accurate, and you could pick out a single villainous Engineer in a crowd of unremarkable innocents if you needed to do so."

You’re a stalwart guardian of your friends and loved ones with a finely-honed sixth sense tuned to their safety, a mix of empathy and intuition which will help you guard them more effectively. As long as you’re in line of sight of a person you want to protect you can immediately interpose yourself between them and anything that threatens them, all but teleporting across the distance between you to do so. If you’re further away a sense of impending doom will alert you to their peril and guide you to their side in time to help them. This heightened empathy also helps you determine how to help them even when they’re not in danger, whether they’re in need of a shoulder to cry on, a gentle slap upside the head, or just some time to themselves."

Maybe the seeds have a selection bias or maybe it’s just something about the power of love and friendship but you’re what some would call yuri bait, a magnet for affection from the female gender. You conquer personality conflicts and easily forge lasting friendships with girls of all types, and it wouldn’t take much for you to become the center of a very affectionate harem. These bonds also work to your advantage in battle, and having a close relationship with your teammates allows you to multiply your powers when you work together. With you leading them a team of new friends can easily pull off combo attacks requiring extremely precise timing and perfect coordination, but a team of lovers can do all that and more, even fusing their spells together into awesomely powerful combination attacks many times stronger than the sum of their parts."

With that in mind, in addition to said monster attacks, something to help keep your loved ones safe seems like a good idea. This perk will give your friends and lovers a form of plot armor. It won’t be as powerful as Bystander Effect, but it should still be more than enough. Someone, or something, that’s out looking for victims will overlook those that you care about, in favor of others. If they’re still targeted, for some reason --if the one targeting them was specifically after them, or there was nobody else around for them to target, for example--, they will have supernatural luck in escaping relatively unharmed; their attacker will trip, people who can help will stumble across them, they’ll instinctually choose the best escape routes, and so on. On top of all of this, you will also be able to feel when those that you care about are in danger, and how badly they need your help. Of course, you can turn this sense off, if you want, but why would you?"

This perk helps your haremettes cooperate with each other more effectively: given two girls whose only relationship is with you, they’ll find it much easier to make their individual efforts click together and support each other instead of tripping their partner up. Take the same two girls and make their relationship as strong with each other as it is with you, whether as friends or lovers or romantic rivals, and they'll laugh off mind-control or even the most insidious attempts to turn them against each other. This works for all group activities, from singing a duet to cooking a meal to group sex."

Duration for a boost from a peck on the cheek lasts for a few hours, while spending eight hours in bed can give a boost that lasts for weeks."

Your cultists will eagerly serve you any way you desire, sexually or otherwise, but if you wish them to be soldiers or assassins like those of the Grimleal then you’ll have to train them for those roles. Without such training the cult’s best use is as a network of spies and informants: they'll have an uncanny knack for infiltrating every corner of society and recruiting in places where their reach is lacking. In future worlds, the cult will reestablish itself as tales of you spread."

You draw great strength from the presence of friends, family, or loved ones while in battle, growing stronger, faster, and tougher when you fight together with them. Faced with two such allies your enemies will find that each of you fights with the strength of both of you, though there are limits given a vast enough difference in personal power. This bond also grants insight into your partner’s fighting style, allowing you to effortlessly supplement them with combo attacks or defenses. While there are diminishing returns, if you can find a way to unite many such allies you will reach even greater heights together. This is the power that conquered a god: use it well."

You’ve reached the “marry them all” stage in your journey where your entire harem is in love with you (and possibly each other) and everyone is happy to share, or if you haven’t yet then you will eventually. Once you’ve reached this ideal state nothing short of deliberate abuse or neglect on your part can make the members of your harem break up or fall out of love with you or with each other. New girls will be welcomed into the fold by their elder sisters rather than shunned or rejected, though this doesn’t guarantee a lack of personality conflicts. Even if you vanish for a hundred years or do a stint as an evil overlord they’ll all continue to love and support you, if perhaps from a distance, until you return to them."

Unlike other similar settings there doesn’t seem to be any suave masters of the art of flirting with dozens of potential suitors in the wing with the most anyone seems to be capable of are cheesy pickup lines. But who's to say that the cheesiness doesn’t have its own amount of charm and by taking this perk you’ll be on your way to filling that empty niche. Now not only do you gain practical base level skills in the various intricacies of flirting and romance, like how to hold a conversation, how find out someone’s likes and wants with choice questions, and other such things, you also have a strong gut instinct on how to go about it with the various different people you meet. Whether that be how to butter up a shy introvert and pull them out of their shell, how to keep up with a bubbly and outgoing hobbyist, or how to stealthily pepper flirting and compliments into the “arguments” you have with someone who seemingly hates your guts. But the thing that gets improved the most is your ability to come up with cheesy, but highly effective pickup lines which also comes with a well of confidence and courage to silence any embarrassment. And when you make use of these lines people never seem to react too negatively to them even if they get graphic. Though the people you use them on will get into it, and thus be more affected by your pick up lines and flirting, if you target/compliment parts of them they are proud of or that you truly find sexy about them."

Saying that you have the sexual stamina of ten men is great, until you meet someone with the stamina of one hundred and they all but fuck you to death trying to get off to their satisfaction. Luckily, that’s not something you often have to worry about. Your partners are exceptionally mindful of your limits - both social ones, like simply not desiring to perform a specific act, and physical ones, like being incapable of fully taking them inside of yourself. It doesn’t particularly matter if this is your actual lover or an ancient demon looking for a mortal to play with, though I will admit the second is far more likely to acknowledge your limits and then pass them anyways."

When you’re working on a task alongside someone you know well — be the task a class project, a battle against a demon , or a double paizuri — your effectiveness skyrockets. You will intuitively understand what your partner intends to do, and your mind will instantly be able to provide you with the knowledge as to what actions on your part would synergize with their actions to be most effective.

Furthermore, the more attached someone is when you start to seduce them, the more pleasure both of you will experience once you actually have sex—and the person you’re trying to win over will, on an instinctive level, recognize this.

A woman who accidentally knocks you over might offer you a handjob in recompense, while someone who wrongly kicks you in the balls might offer you her body to have your way with as an apology; someone you aren’t sexually interested in, on the other hand, might offer the bodies of their friends or family, who will never consider this an odd thing to do. Note that this is in addition to whatever they would normally do as part of their attempt to make up for their wrongdoings, not in place of it. You may optionally toggle this off, in case you don’t want sex at the moment."

Regardless, when it comes to nosy friends of your victim barging in wondering what's going on... They have a tendency to join in instead. Maybe they’re secretly sluts as well, maybe they’re offended that you think she’s more beautiful. No matter which way you slice it, the rescuer will probably need rescuing as well."

You would be right at home in any royal court or secret cult, but your true specialty lies in seduction, exploiting a victim’s lusts as a weakness. Luring partners to your bed is child’s play, and the more infatuated they are with you the easier it becomes to wrap them around your fingers and bend them to your whims. Given time to work your wiles you could seduce a loyal wife into an affair, conquer her heart and claim her as your own, and persuade her to join a harem of devoted concubines. Naturally some will be harder to beguile than others but there are always ways to erode their defenses and make them more vulnerable to your charms."

Of note is that the virginal aren’t used to any kind of sex, so this is always active for them. Also of note is that very few people ever become “used” to being raped."

Whether from practical experience or long hours of research on the web you’re an expert in mundane bondage techniques, from basic care and maintenance of your equipment to advanced techniques like suspension and artistic shibari. Of course you’re also quite talented at the more vanilla parts of the act and you make an exceptional lover regardless of whether or not BDSM is involved. Even if you have no real experience these skills come to you naturally with practice whether you’re on the giving or the receiving end of it. You also have a good sense for the fine line between painful pleasure and genuine injury and how far you can push (or be pushed) over them without harm."

Don’t worry about how that makes sense, it's taken care of. Your partner, like you, will sleep deeply and healthily, and experience the mother of all wet dreams to accompany the pleasure their body is feeling. Depending on the perks you purchased, though, waking up might be a surprise when they find their stomach has bulged out with an entire night’s worth of cum.

You won’t have to worry about that, because in every area of interviews that pose a problem, you excel in even outside of the interview format . Self - confidence? You have it, without crossing the line into arrogance. Social anxiety? Gone. First impressions? You have a natural talent for making them which experienced socialites would trade their teeth for. Personal Appearance? It doesn’t make you any prettier, but you do have impeccable fashion sense, skill in personal hygiene, and the personal motivation needed to keep up your appearance and exercise routine. The only thing you might lack is the skill in your chosen field."

It’d take most men a lifetime to master so many skills but to you they come naturally, as if you’d mastered them all in a previous life and are merely shaking the rust off instead of learning everything from scratch. Like a veteran hero who’s saved the land many times over you have an instinctive grasp of many ordinary skills, from fighting and cooking to wilderness survival and more. You can battle monsters, live off the land, tame horses, climb mountains, and more with a measure of natural competence, and even your sexual prowess is enough to satisfy demanding lovers like Hyrule’s many monstergirls or turn an inexperienced princess to putty in your hands. You aren’t quite a true master of these skills just yet, but with practice and training you’ll become one far faster than any normal person. You might be a jack of all trades, but a master of none? Not for long."

But as fast as MCU makes the learning/training process, and as much as the balance of power can change at any moment, the early days can have a profound impact on the state of things later on, and several of your classmates will already possess a comprehensive education in the art of chi. Hence this head start: you have the body of a warrior or pro athlete; when boosted by your chi, you can outperform Olympians. You know several basic katas and are a master of whatever martial arts style you wish. Your knowledge of pressure points is encyclopedic, your ability to take control of another person’s chi unreasonably rapid, and your finesse with using that control to alter their mind as you please unnatural. A second’s touch could induce paralysis or orgasmic pleasure, but with sustained contact, only how much power you have at your disposal will limit what you can do to a person’s mind.

Sounds nice, but it’s actually much trickier than it sounds, as you need both strong arms and a good sense of balance to maneuver around while you’re so top-heavy. Fortunately, you have that strength even if you have a skinny build, and your sense of balance is good enough that you could descend a flight of stairs even while the girl you’re fucking is orgasming all over your cock. In short, you have perfect balance, and can carry anything you can pick up in the first place for as long as is needed."

However any students who benefit from this training will also develop mild behavioural quirks or fetishes such as a habit of forgetting to wear panties while wearing a skirt, a tendency towards voyeurism, or regularly crossdressing 'just to improve my disguise skills'. The manual can only teach supernatural ninja skills if someone with those abilities has annotated the text to include that information, but any such included knowledge can be taught to the student as part of the same 30-day training course. The manual always has a blank page or two available to make such annotations.

This makes it easier to come up with alternative training methods to gain the same skills so long as it's similar, such as grabbing piranhas out of a tank instead of taking chestnuts out of a fire."

You're the latter, able to hack your way into just about anything short of serious corporate security, using a wireless connection (or a console if you want to be old-school) to work your digital magic. You're particularly good at messing with your victims in various sexual ways, with things like remote controlled vibrators and cyberware meant for the bedroom taking practically no effort to subvert. That's not to say your skills aren't otherwise useful, most combat cyborgs for example aren't nearly as threatening when their cyberarms are stuck furiously masturbating. You're just as talented in dealing with other hackers or even AI in cyberspace. The latter can be hacked into and taken over just like other software, just with more effort being involved in the process due to the active resistance. Other hackers present a more nuanced problem. Only the best of them would actually be able to sling code with you on equal grounds, but hacking into fleshy people isn't something you can do directly. Flooding their hardware with so much porn that it’s rendered useless on the other hand? That’s not too difficult to pull off. And if they made the mistake of engaging you through a direct connection or in full VR? You can use the biofeedback to fry their brains as well. Of course, instead of killing them through severe brain damage, this just scrambles your opposition's brains and leaves them as dumb and giggly bimbos. With how strangely common attractive hackers in skintight outfits are around here, it'd be a waste otherwise."

Sex, of any kind, will increase your charisma and or speech skills. Hell, even someone agreeing to sleep with you. The more you sleep around, the more charismatic you become. So sleep around a lot, and you could have an entire town of women (and some husbands) eating out of the palm of your hand. At the same time."

After all, most teachers these days completely neglect to give their students a proper course in sexual education, and that’s exactly where your talents stand out the most! You’re one of the best teachers a student could ask for, and those who study under you will learn as if they had a natural talent for any subject you teach them. Students of your preferred gender(s) are especially enthralled with your lessons, especially when you give them more personal incentives to excel. The more intimate you become with your students, the faster they learn and the more they can learn. You could even turn a bimbo into an honor student with enough injections of Vitamin ‘D’."

Lions might suffocate you, bears might eat you, hyenas might forcefully rape you, etc. In such scenarios, escape is unlikely, so you need to survive, not show weakness, and calm their troubled hearts. Easy, right? You can retain your mental concentration and charisma no matter the pain or stress you’re feeling, to the point that you could gently talk down someone who’s currently eating you alive – heck, you could continue to have sex with them throughout them trying to kill you, and even make them orgasm. In fact, this perk strengthens your sexual prowess when you are struggling against someone or suffering pain, to the point that you could weaponize your sex and overwhelm an apex predator with the intensity. But even without sex, you also become more charismatic when under pressure or pain, allowing you to continue to talk someone through their traumas even as they gore into you. Please note that the perk also applies to “beast taming” in general, being able to withstand the instinctive attacks of your fierce yet precious animals as you calm them down. The perk also increases your physical endurance, such that you can survive a gulo attack or endure a “first night” of mating with the entire zoo (fun fact – lions can mate up to 50 times in a single day)."

Not only are you effectively a one man gang bang able to fight and fuck several girls simultaneously with no loss in performance, but whenever you use more than two limbs to fight or restrain any single person you become almost exponentially more difficult to avoid and escape for each additional pair of limbs used, your sheer dexterity and coordination making it more and more difficult for your victims to track them and prevent one from slipping past their defenses. Mastery of leverage also makes your limbs much stronger once they’ve successfully grappled a victim, enough so that even weak youma can keep a grip on a struggling Sailor Senshi once you have her in your grasp.

But little do they know, that’s just when the fun begins. You see, the soul is the very essence of who someone is. Which means that any scrap of pleasure the soul experiences is felt by every last piece of one’s entire existence, from their skin to their organs to their very cells to their every thought. And because their soul has already left the body, they’re unable to escape into unconsciousness, and without the limits of their flesh they can orgasm without end. Outside of the body the soul just looks like a blob, but you know the secret succubi/incubi techniques to shape it into whatever fun toy you want. Because they’re actually still alive, if you leave the soul alone for a while it will snap back to its body, although a small ritual will allow you to keep it separate from the body entirely until you push it back in. You can teach other people the effects of this perk, but make sure they’re someone you can entrust your soul to."

Naturally your perverse proclivities color the effects of your work: lewd experiments will greatly increase your rate of progress, and while you are able to produce “ordinary” technologies with this perk, you will find it a much easier process if your work contains side-effects or dependencies of a perverse nature. Certainly you can learn how to harness the power of love as a renewable energy source but if that source requires a magical girl to be hooked up to a fucking machine and used as a human generator then so much the better!"

One way or another these things tend towards perversion, meaning you can't just trap people you dislike in sensory isolation or kill someone within the frozen time, but you'd be surprised at what enough rape can achieve.

These seeds, once fully grown and ripe, will start to grow tentacles and will seek to molest any nearby women. Thankfully the quirks in its genetics and the infused reishi only give it a shelf life of about 24 hours once it actually gets going. On the other hand, if you pluck them off the vines early, you might be able to save them for later. A few days to weeks at most, but that’s still plenty of time to have some fun with them."

It will be easy for you to take out the rank and file of Elysium’s monsters, but one of his more powerful servants will be a greater challenge. When transforming, your magic changes your clothes into a beautiful but combat - ready dress, resembling a sailor uniform with a frilly skirt. And yes, whatever underwear you wear will be replaced with cute panties. Your hair will also change color and grow in length, and a heart - shaped hairpin will appear on your head. You do get short heels, but they are guaranteed to never interfere with your movements or balance, so don’t worry about tripping in them."

And then you have the slightly more odd things, such as the lust increasing Bimbo Flower and the naughty Witch Apple. You can expand this collection at any time you could buy a perk for an extra 100 cp: a bottle of breastmilk creating Booboom Milk; the nectar of shapely legs, the Thicc Shake; the animal girl creating Zoo Amulet; the slick and slimy Slime Potion; and the personality reversing Inverse Mirror. All of these last a good long while, or can be cancelled out with the supply of Nega-shrooms that come with."

You can greatly reduce your strength, even sealing away some of your powers entirely, and revert to the form of a youth. The greater the limitations you place on yourself, the faster those abilities will grow and the greater the heights you will achieve in both skill and power when you return to your adult (or at least, more grown up) body. The duration you will be forced to stay in this form is also one of the limitations you must decide on, especially as breaking out of it early comes with significant consequences after the initial rush. Your young form isn't without its advantages, of course. It exudes an aura of boyish charm (or girlish, if you’d rather resemble Astolfo) which older women are very weak against. So strong are these immoral charms that with the right temptation you could lure even devout wives and holy saints into breaking their vows."

Caressing a lover to heal them might increase the size of their cock or breasts, or it might remove their refactory period. Similarly, harming or even healing those you dislike or find pathetic will cause them to become even more pathetic. Men will become more feminized until their gender 'inverts', turning them into women. And women will be reduced into useless, thoughtless bimbos. If that's not enough for you, this works even in combat- healing is more efficient on people you want to fuck, techniques are more damaging on those you wish would just die for being an embarrassment to the human race, and the dregs and bare traces of spiritual energy you put out can cause people to become inspired or depressed based on those same conditions. Hell, with enough time and energy you can taint portions of the landscape with these energies, affecting all those who enter."

There are stories of truely ancient elves having the appearance of a young girl, while other elves choose to age similarly to humans until they reach adulthood. You now share that power, gaining the ability to choose when you stop physically aging, allowing you to appear that age for however long you want. This does not make you immortal, and as a point of convinience, you may change your target age at any time, though you will have to actually live through the necessary time, with your aging turning backwards if you choose to be younger (this is not natural to elves). Also an added natural trait of of this perk is that anything that would normally mar their beauty such as scars or obesity, seem to have little effect. Deep scars fade away enough that they only serve to enhance your appearance, and of course any excess carbs that you eat goes straight to your chest or butt rather than form anything like a flabby stomach."

Ultra Sonic Mind Control? This is my jam! Psychic Alien fucking your brain meats? Kinky! You can easily shrug off the effects of physical and mental alterations, and even the main effects themselves if you want! This can even work on recreational drugs with nasty side effects such as LSD or Cigarettes, and if you want to enjoy those side effects? Then good for you, because you can set a timer! Want to be a genuine brainwashed slut for a few hours and then go back to normal after? Go wild! Want to get genetically altered into a Bimbo Badger with a massive dick? Go nuts! Once the timer's set, all changes that occurred while it was on will revert. So if someone tries to be a tricky dicky and turn you into a bimbo slut and then mind control you in an attempt to get your slutty, bimbo self to make it permanent they'll be shit out of luck cause the adult will come back no matter how much they tried to corrupt the child! No, this doesn't work on fire or direct physical harm, that'd be dumb. It only counts if the main intent of the drug or technological/psychic/soul effect was to alter your mind and body. If they're trying to psychically turn your brain into paste then better get a tin foil cap because that'll protect you better than this will."

The consequences of drinking just one full dose are immense, though a very small taste will actually just dye one’s hair and slightly alter their skin tone without causing any extreme mental damage. There are six colors: Red causes expansion to the breasts and buttocks, green causes excessive growth to pubic and armpit hair, black results in increased sweating (and white hair), body odor, and pheromones, blue causes lactation, purple causes an increase in musculature which is hidden by a ‘thicc’ layer of fat (especially around the thighs), and yellow causes a transformation into a futanari – as well as an obsessive fetish for that mutation which enhances the pleasure it brings to the patient. Not only will drinking multiple colors blend all of their effects, it has a compounding effect on their libido, sexual sensitivity, and general mental corruption. Heavily diluted, heavily mixed, or concurrent doses have far less predictable effects when compared to purer ones, but sequential doses mix their effects predictably, with overall priority generally going to the earlier doses. Being mixed with pure acetone seems to increase its potency greatly, enable absorption through the skin, and overall allow it to rapidly pollute the water supply of an entire school building. Comes with the full recipe for CHC on it."

Do your talents influence your cutie mark, or does your cutie mark influence your talents? It seems to be a bit of a chicken and the egg situation. It should be noted that this is talent and not a power. Regardless, said pony form also gains the abilities of one of the three phenotypes of pony kind: Earth Ponies: Stronger than other kinds of ponies, with a greater pool of stamina as well as a talent for nuturing. Unicorns: They have a horn on their head that acts as an arcane focus! Pegasii: They have wings that let them fly with startling agility and can physically manipulate the weather. Ponies with significant magical power also have the possibility of ascending to Alicorn-hood, gaining all the benefits of ponykind in a manner that has them enhance each other. Of course, power alone isn't enough, there has to be something more to it. Perhaps there is something to the phrase 'Friendship is Magic'..."

      "description": "You can turn into a shipgirl! As a shipgirl, you are as strong and as tough as a ship. Despite this, you still have the profile of a woman. By summoning your “rigging,” a mechanical set of gear based upon your ship form, you gain access to the capabilities of your ship form. You can use your rangefinders and radars to see the world around, listen through your hydrophones, and can feel your crew moving about within you. You can sail on water, which kind of looks like skating with your human form. Your weapons still function, even if certain weapons are not represented on your rigging. Your hold and many of the tools aboard are available for your use at full-size. Normally summoning your rigging will also change your clothes to a specific outfit, but this can be suppressed. Speaking of your crew, they are usually called “fairies” and take the form of chibi versions of your human self. They are loyal and capable of fulfilling all the tasks that need doing on a ship like yourself. They’re kind of like cells, actually. If killed, they return as part of the healing process. They can exit your hull, but they are notably weaker outside - while possessing the strength of fit sea dogs inside, while outside a single fairy could no more pick up a soda can than a single sailor could pick up a filled 55-gallon drum of Bunker C. Be nice to them - their stress is your stress. And while you can consume oil to refuel your bunkers, propellant and explosive to resupply your ammunition, and steel to resupply your damage control material, those will only restock your supplies of those specific materials. Eating food allows you to resupply all your stocks, is much tastier, and is easier on logistics. You need around 3,000 - 10,000 calories a day on average, depending on your ship form’s logistics needs, or around twice that if engaging in battle. Of course, since you have the ability to go without resupply and refueling for weeks at a time, probably, you might wind up very hungry at times. Also, you’ll probably be craving fresh fruit and other perishables that your onboard kitchens can’t provide after a long sortie. Unfortunately, food stored aboard a shipgirl cannot be used to restock another shipgirl’s supplies directly. The food from a shipgirl’s holds seems to have no nutritional value except to fairies. Still tastes good though. UNREP isn’t an exception as it’s manifesting the supplies as food. You can’t get an Infinite Sandwich Loop that eliminates your need for logistics. You can also adjust your mass and power from anywhere between “normal girl” and your ship form. This is useful for getting into cars, ramming through walls, and not pulverizing your lovers."

Each twin identifies herself with half of your first name. Each half of yourself acts as an autonomous and independent individual, yet both of you have a subtle mental link that encourages each of you to instinctively take actions that fuse well together, as if you are two arms of a single person. Items currently held and worn by you are duplicated for each twin, but they will turn either blue or red. Powerful and rare items are not copied, and instead end up on whichever twin would be more compatible with it. Your overall power level is halved between the twins, and perks are generally divvied up between the two twins; however, all powers that can be construed as martial arts are copied and shared between the twins, and the power requirements for such attacks are halved. If a twin dies, it seemingly vanishes into nothing, leaving only your other half behind (and whatever powers and items the twin had do not return to you). A half hour after disappearing, the killed twin returns, but only to merge back with you into a single person. Once you are back together as one, the twin’s items and powers reappear, making copies merge back into singular powers and items accordingly. If a twin has been killed, the splitting ability cannot be used again for a week. Also, each twin is unable to use the splitting part of the perk on herself."

Well, relatively practical. In any case, you can count yourself among them. On top of all that, you can if you desire to do so declare yourself a succubus belonging to a specific fetish.

Additionally, your body is incredibly warm, your skin unbelievably soft, your milk amazingly delicious, amongst other improvements. Of course with such extensively spliced DNA, it was inevitable that other traits would be transferred as well. Most obviously the cute fluffy bunny ears and tails.

They twisted themselves into something demonic in doing so, but by giving up their souls they gained an energy source beyond compare. Devouring their own crystallized souls, they grew in might and sensuality far beyond the mortal human mages they once were. Even 'common' succubi and incubi are great threats to their opponents, but you are not common by any means. As one of the more powerful demons, you consumed your own lethicite and gained great magical power from the act. Whether it manifests in greater ability to alter your body and shapeshift than most demons enjoy, some special power like telepathy or a breath of hellfire, the ability to more easily alter and enhance creatures with your power, some slightly diluted combination of these, or simply a boost to the raw power of your spellcasting, you share in the power of Lethice’s greatest. Besides that, you also wield the more common abilities of full demons. Your body is more malleable to your desires than that of any mortal, more pleasurable, and hot as hell besides. Obviously, it is impossible for anyone to further corrupt you in any way, as you are already fully corrupted, even though your mind remains your own and likely clearer than the vast majority of demons. You retain whatever measure of conscience and restraint you had before, meaning you have much less difficulty with empathy and focusing on long-term goals compared to most demons. Additionally, while it’s impossible for most soulless beings to create new souls, you keep the ability to have proper children instead of only ever spawning imps as most demons do. But all the same, your body fluids and even mere presence could slowly corrupt people if you wish. You could use this to grow even further in power if you wished, consuming the lethicite of those you cause to fall into corruption. If you wish, you may give up the increased magical power in return for keeping your own lethicite as an item. Perhaps you have another use in mind for your crystallized soul than merely empowering yourself? Powering an exceptionally mighty magical item for example."

Instead of being 'on' or 'off' each of your alternate forms have sliders that you can now adjust. Take the skin of one, the legs of another, the genitals of a third, the size of a fourth. You can now freely blend the attributes of all your forms and, even better, this is a power that can be trained. With enough experimentation and training, your body will be free to express any and all traits that your different forms make available to you at once."

You have the ability to enter a spirit body-like state. Whether this be from astral projection or your body physically turning ghostlike is up to you. In this state, you can enter the bodies of other people in order to possess them, hijacking control of their body. Your spirit form is extremely malleable, to the point that you can actually split it into multiple parts so long as you have the sufficent mystic might. Each part is still innately your own soul, allowing you to retain full control over all of them. Using these split parts, you can possess multiple people, or possess someone remotely while you remain in your own body. Of course, despite hijacking a body, you don't want to have to do everything for them, do you? Sometimes it’s nice to let them take the reins while you act as a mere spectator, posing suggestions as you will. You can choose how much control you have over your target's body, ceding control of the rest of it to the original occupant. If you wanted, you could fade into the background entirely, becoming a voice in their subconscious. They would follow your suggestions without even realising that it wasn’t their idea in the first place."

Your body is made up of a viscous dark-blue gel, capable of taking hits from a normal human without effect but splattering when it goes up against a real threat. Its true power is the ability to hijack the bodies of females by physically inserting your gooey form into their various orifices and turning them into your puppets. Naturally, this feels incredibly pleasurable for all parties involved. You actually have two methods of doing this, based on the two main interpretations of the villain’s quirk in the original Doujin. The first method is to simply use them as literal puppets. All you have to do is get rid of the original owner’s personality and go from there! You’ll have access to any and all of their memories when you wish, to better let you blend in, and there’s nothing they can really do about it as you play with them as you see fit. The main limitation of this method is your multi-tasking ability. You’ll have to control all of your bodies without any support and that can be a real headache. The second method is to lean on what’s already there. Instead of getting rid of the original personality, you suppress it while inserting a linked copy of yourself into the driving seat, relying on the host’s memories and skills to act as them. This can cause a bit of bleedthrough if you're not careful. Not in morals or goals, but something like Likes, Dislikes...or a secret crush, are totally possible. The main limitation of this is your own willpower, as the bleedthrough from your puppets affects your main body more and more, but surely you’ll be fine. As a bonus, this method will let you have conversations with yourself to help you come up with plans!"

This can be mastery of a particular weapon, control of an element, a mental power of some sort, or the ability to construct advanced technology. Whatever it is, it can be driven to incredible heights through your Norito, which requires you to kiss your Ashkabi and recite its words*. What's an Ashkabi? Sekeri are creatures of love. It is a part of their fundamental nature to love fiercely and totally, the emotion being all-consuming to them. As you (probably) aren't natively a Sekeri, you will have the perspective to temper this, but it will nonetheless be intense. And this love will be for your Ashkabi. Each Sekirei can react to a certain person; drawn by something akin to love at first sight, but far deeper. Should they then be kissed they will become Winged, and this feeling will blossom into love for their Ashikabi. Notably, they can be winged by someone they do not react to, but this will not dampen their love one whit. Your Ashkabi will not change should you leave and return to your Sekeri form, so choose well. *Norito prayers generally take the form of '[word representing unique power] of my [pact/pledge/vow], [implementation of unique power eliminating an impediment] of my Ashkabi!' For example: This water represents my pledge. Purify the evil residing in my Ashikabi! Or Hammer of my pledge, shatter the enemy of my Ashikabi!"

Your body is more elastic in general now, able to distend to accommodate incredible sizes and then recover (to a point; repeating this often enough can certainly leave your body looser and more accepting than before), your stomach able to round out from the sheer amount of cum supplied by the more productive people of this land. And it’s not just yourself, as your sexual partners experience the same thing if you take a more giving role during sex, allowing your own endowments to have a similar effect as your partners stretch around you instead of coming to any actual harm. Of course, there are still limits to this. Tiny fairies or small goblins aren’t going to be able to take dicks bigger than their entire bodies...at least not without working their way up to that with a lot of practice and effort."

Kokiri resemble nothing more than children, and nobody knows if the Sheikah are a genuine race or just a phenotype and a culture. That’s probably on purpose, knowing them. And there are those that are blatantly different, bordering on monstrous, such as the Goron or the Zora. So different, in fact, that they don’t even bother wearing clothing for the most part. Much like yourself, now. The more inhuman you are, the less you need to wear. If you had bright blue skin and a few fins sticking out of you like the Zora do, you could walk around while covering yourself with a tasteful but entirely too small sash that hides absolutely nothing. Or even less, though you might have to actually attempt to defend yourself by explaining that clothes are against your culture, especially when they aren’t volcano proof."

One could walk barefoot, and short of trudging through the most obvious of filth, their feet would remain soft and clean enough to eat off of. Those who make extensive use of their feet in daily life will not be negatively affected by these changes.

Regardless of whether you have boobs or pecs, they gain an “aura” around itself which gives grandeur onto those that see them. It also makes them incredibly “comfortable” to touch/lay on and turns them into a strong erogenous zone for you. The impressiveness they impose is to the point that most people will prefer looking at, touching, snuggling, and doing other such things with your chest then others, even if said others have one bigger and/or more “impressive” than yours. And, so long as your chest is exposed as well, you can get away with being practically naked anywhere with those who would normally disapprove or raise a stink at worst grumbling about it. As a minor bonus and to confer another trait of Clan Tiss'i you also gain a thick and long prehensile snake-like tongue, if you don’t already have one, as well as expert level skill at various forms of mouth/tongue play. This includes, but isn’t limited to things like cunnilingus, blowjobs, kissing, licking, etc."

This item consists of enough fetish wear to fill out a walk-in closet, all of it fitted to your exact specifications. Some of these are outfits that you might wear out in public but which still imply your status as either a dom or a sub, like expensive business suits or tight and restrictive dresses, while others are meant for roleplay or private use only. There’s a roughly even mix of attire meant for both doms and subs in this collection ranging from high fantasy cosplay outfits to sexy maid and other kinds of uniforms. All of these clothes are self-washing and self-maintaining and resize themselves automatically to be a perfect fit for their current wearer. Additionally, all outfits subtly broadcast the wearer’s status as a dom, sub, or switch as well as their current availability. Normies won’t notice this at all but anyone who’s in the know will recognize your status, while those who don’t know that they’re doms or subs yet will find you mysteriously appealing for reasons they can’t put a name to if you’re available. A dom wearing a sub outfit or vice versa reads as a switch to this radar feature."

And by taking this perk similar to the adventurer, and later hero, Namu, gathering said attention will be frighteningly easy. Upon gaining this you can choose and enhance one physical trait that you have such as your chest, ass, or lips with it being the focal attraction point of your body. What this means is that said feature becomes wholly unique compared to others, not necessarily being better, but having its own qualities that people can easily recognise and enjoy. When said trait is on display, like wearing an open helmet if the trait was your eyes or tight leggings if it was your ass, it serves as a booster for the amount of fame and recognition you gain for completing adventures, quests, and other things. This attraction your selected trait will garner also leads to people using it as a basis for any commemorative art they make or nicknames they come up with when you become famous. This part can be toggled in case you don’t fancy having statues made that only show off your ass or being called something like “The Demon Derrière” as you go about your day."

And don’t get me started on the hundreds of sub-species of Myconids (aka Mushroom Girls). Pick the wrong ones, and you’ll be pushing up daisies before you know it. Well, now there isn’t a problem with that. You can enjoy the services of any type of succubi without damaging yourself or your partner. Bang that dragon girl. Stick it in that pixie without worrying about tearing her apart. Hell, jump into that pit full of Lilim! You’ll be fine! A little sore, but fine. Heck, get as kinky as you want. You and your partner(s) are unable to hurt each other (except in the est way). Asphyxiation? Child’s play. Cutting? Those wounds will heal up without a scar after your done.

Even at its weakest, it is still as protective as a full suit of leather covering the entire body, but it grows more powerful if worn by a virgin and if the wearer gives in to their enhanced passions. Fully powered and worn by a virgin, it protects their entire body like a full suit of layered steel plates, rivaling a suit of plate mail.

The milk of an infected woman, however, also serves as a powerful aphrodisiac to infected men, enabling them to function and produce more semen even when they by all rights should be drained dry. For you, this is a bit more versatile, as you can, at will, make any of your bodily fluids function as the same sort of strong aphrodisiac, but one capable of affecting anyone regardless of infection status. Let your partners be as virile as you want them to be."

This will not change their gender. ● Estrogen Supplements - Those you bind are increasingly feminized. ● Total Obsession - You will become increasingly more important to your bound, until there is nothing they will not discard from their lives to please you. ● Health Potion - Your bound will be healed by your fluids, finding themselves healthier, happier, and generally more stable than before. ● Skilled Subs - Those that you bind will learn skills at an increased rate. They won't be smarter, but they will be able to pick up any skill you point them at. ● Nonstandard Base - Your binding fluids aren't actually present in your cum. Instead they are in one other bodily fluid/excretion. ● Pathogen Makeup - Those bound to you will gain this exact version of this perk, with the exception that they cannot bind you.

A word of caution: they’ll help you digest things that would normally be impossible for a human, but they’ll splice you to do it. You eat the wrong native foods, and you’ll wind up looking like a native. You might even start to feel like one, mentally. I’m told it’s like forced, convergent evolution. Point is, it isn’t perfect. Relying on it too often will build up too much Taint in your system, and you’re better off avoiding that.” But even if you do gain some Taint, until you reach the point of no-return, you can still slowly recover from whatever Taint you have. In addition, if you do become infected by some bug that manages to make it through the microsurgeons undetected, a skilled medical professional with the appropriate tools can scan you for the mystery bug, and update the microsurgeons to address the issue. Not everyone wants to go through Furpies, right? You gain five replenishing doses of these marvellous machines. Anyone with these will also benefit from enhanced health, and if they encounter the right stimuli, can also induce transformations. If you have a Database of TFs, all Microbots can link to it, and provide data on transformations undertaken. They can then use those recorded transformations from the Database to cause them at will."

Your body has a similar quality, but more potent and flexible in nature: you absorb alchemical power from anything you eat, with a large enough infusion of that power making a permanent enchantment as your body starts producing it naturally. A diet of volcanic rocks could grant a goron’s immunity to fire, but chugging healing potions could give advanced regeneration instead, etc. Your body only holds one enchantment at a time but you can freely share its effects using your bodily fluids, like giving someone a nice big creampie. You also have a cast-iron stomach which can handle “food” like the (in)famous goron rock roasts."

You have the aura of a superior dragon to the senses of all other types of dragons, from wyverns and manaketes to humans blessed with draconic blood, such as the royal families of Nohr and Hoshido. Non-sapient dragons like wyverns become highly submissive towards you, making it a trivial matter to tame and domesticate them, while intelligent dragons like manaketes and others who might make fitting mates instinctively desire you, even going into heat just by spending time in your presence, though you can suppress this at will. Any dragon who dares to challenge you despite your power will learn that you are able to smite them with divine retribution, empowering both sword and spells with a dragonbane effect which effortlessly cleaves through draconic armor and spellwork."

You have a supernatural attractiveness about you, something that seems to transcend the personal taste of the person being attracted to you. Your expressions, your appearance, even your actions; their eyes tend to glue onto you while they watch you move about, and your every action turns into incredibly suggestive ones, even by accident. Something as mundane as eating a popsicle can make a person’s heart beat faster as they watch you act in ways that just bleed lewdness. They might be embarrassed or ashamed of themselves after, but you can sear the sight of you into their brain, your mere presence beginning to corrupt the people around you into liking whatever category of person your current form falls into, male, female, futa, MILF, tomboy, etc. If you were to actually focus on somebody, the effect would be magnified- they simply wouldn’t be able to get you out of their head, to the point even their dreams would be all about you. It’d be easy to seduce them then, as they’d want to give into the person that just burned a new fetish into their brain. This perk only affects the people you like and/or are attracted to and can be toggled on and off besides."

To a lesser man you are the immovable object, and any attempt to one-up you or otherwise assert superiority either fails, backfires spectacularly, or provides you with a perfect chance to steal their women from them. Attacking you without a major strength advantage only ends in broken fists and shattered blades while anyone trying to humiliate you becomes vulnerable to getting a taste of their own medicine. In other words, a direct competition between yourself and another man almost certain to end in a very humiliating loss for your enemies unless they have you at a serious disadvantage. Of course any women who observe these “competitions” can’t help but notice how superior you are to your enemies and take an interest of their own in you."

Not even the demons themselves are immune to this, leading some to co-dependent relationships.

A demon king who favors bondage and slavery could gradually reshape a traditional kingdom into a slave state where his values are celebrated, even influencing the realm’s art and culture. The more influence you have over your subjects the more pervasive your influence and the more extensive your reach will become, so a king or emperor will have much greater sway over his people than an elected or temporary leader. You may also choose to limit this perk’s effects and spread your influence selectively, perhaps excluding particular followers or spreading some fetishes but not others."

You’re a wicked witch whose power to corrupt even affects your words and body language, and even those who can resist your magic might still fall prey to your silver tongue and sinful body.

You can then masterfully tailor your seduction to your target, exploiting the tiniest crack in their resistance to lead them into temptation and sin. Should they fail to resist these mundane temptations, even the most powerful magical defenses will crumble, leaving your victims naked and exposed to your spellwork."

Their strength comes not from practice and skill but from conquest and corruption, building their unholy might atop a pile of vanquished enemies and corrupted slaves. Even a lowly bokoblin can become a glorious golden beast if it has enough cunning and ambition. You’re able to gain greater strength by defeating or corrupting your enemies, reducing them to mere stepping stones on your path to power. Whenever you defeat an enemy who was stronger than you in some way your strength grows as if you’d stolen some of their strength and added it to your own. Defeat a lynel and your physical strength or cock size might grow, while a sorceress might fuel the growth of your intelligence or magical abilities. Corrupting or enslaving your conquests after defeating them allows you to harvest even greater power by actually stealing their strength, turning great heroes into helpless slaves and wise princesses into thoughtless sluts."

The degree to which you can warp a person’s personality is directly related to how sexually repressed they were before you seduced them: the aforementioned headmistress could become wildly different and a person who is merely inexperienced could have things to learn about themselves, but a person with no hang-ups about sex would have few if any hidden desires for you to expose."

Like teaching magic to someone without the ability to use it, or getting a dunce up to speed on quantum physics. This is still on the scale of many weeks, probably months, but that’s likely far faster than normal."

There’s strength to be found in embracing your darker and lewder self, and you’ve found that strength and made it your own. Like Hina and friends, you're a magical girl (or boy) whose sexual desires have transformed into a source of magical power, allowing you to use magic based on your kinks. As a bondage-themed magical girl you might gain the power to conjure and command magical ropes and chains like a veteran rope master, while a love of wax play and electrostimulation might grant you fire and lightning magic. These magical powers (and any others you have) are at their strongest when you’re being subjected to your own kinks, turning pleasure into even greater power. A bondage princess can multiply the strength of her magical powers by binding herself in her own ropes or sealing herself into a gimp suit, and by bringing herself to orgasm she can fire off super-powerful finishing move spells even stronger than that. Despite their lewd nature these powers are considered holy and are extremely effective against ayakashi, demons, and similarly evil foes."

Your iron-fisted rule allows you to use these tactics to great effect: by dominating or corrupting princesses or champions or other people of great importance you also assert dominance over all who followed them, allowing you to conquer entire towns, regions, and even countries in one fell swoop. Entire armies will fall apart in despair after you make their princess your concubine, while civilians take on the broad strokes of your ideals and desires for them, some eagerly and some reluctantly, snuffing out resistance to your rule as your new subjects embrace their new master whether they like it or not. Heroes and others with strong wills can still reject you, but if their wills break somehow they’ll submit just the same as anyone else."

Even pushing the idea of something like monogamy would see faithful couples being viewed as the ideal relationship and a wedding dress as the kinkiest of fetishwear. Given enough time these changes will become more overt and extend to the environment. People in general or certain demographics might have their bodies change in specific ways while articles of clothing and decorations begin to spontaneously change in cut and design. Some people might notice or even resist the changes, but most will eventually come to view the changes as the way things have always been and quite normal with dissenters and non-conformers becoming shunned and distained.

Well, “slowly” only applies to someone as strong as Love Mary P… for an ordinary human, only a few minutes of exposure to demonic essence would be enough to indelibly twist their mind into… well, whatever you want them to be, really. Nothing says that corruption needs to only have one end result. But this corruption affects more than the mind. It can twist into the core of a being and start to affect their powers and purity; if someone was as pure as Primera, it would take a long time of frequent injections of demonic essence to establish a true seed of corruption, and they’d no doubt fight back all the time. But once it takes root, it will twist “pure” and “good” powers into something lewd and evil, such as turning a transformation into a magical girl into a transformation into a succubus. After falling to corruption, any power that would be dependent upon love, would now be dependent upon lust. You may freely corrupt any of your own “pure” or “good” abilities into corrupted and evil alternates, if you so desire. If you are a God, then you may choose to have this corruption instead take the characteristics of one of your domains; perhaps you’d prefer to give things an elemental twist rather simply turning them evil, or maybe your corruption slowly turns things mechanical? The precise details of how your own demonic essence functions are up to you, but you have to decide the details now; no changing your mind later!"

With contact, you can inspire a disturbing degree of lust or anger in your targets. Prolonged contact will promote greater results, whereas higher willpower will lessen the effect... But even the most determined are not entirely immune. Your “corruption” extends from your skin, to the deepest layers of your flesh and everything in between. Your blood, your seed, your saliva. If it is of you, then it will transmit emotions to those it touches and those it fills, endlessly prodding at their mental substance. Every time they are successfully influenced, they are made ever more susceptible. The more of you is in them, the better, though a mere drop may produce spectacular effects with time and patience. Not even the greatest warriors can keep their guard up forever."

This allows you to twist both living beings and inanimate objects alike to look however you desire, or change how thinking things behave simply by seeping your power into them and focusing on exactly how you wish for them to be altered. Though the greater the changes you wish to make and the less willing the subject is the longer it will take and the increasingly exhausting the process is for you, but anything once so corrupted will become in all ways far more susceptible to you in the future, whether it be your supernatural powers, or simple charisma it will act on them with greater strength and any resistance will be much lower. And by making an even greater expenditure of energy you are able to infuse the very earth around you with your dominating power, corrupting the land everything in it so that anything you don't specifically exclude will slowly be twisted in accordance to your general desires and tastes. An egotist might see statues start to change to his own likeness and people inclined to literally sing their master's praises, while a truly lustful lord could find even the local flora and fauna taking on extremely suggestive forms. However this passive method does have its drawbacks. For one the effects are generalized and lack the customization you get by doing it personally. Secondly intelligent beings who resist your influence will take a very long time to break, needing maybe several generations living under your shadow before being fully corrupted. All the more reason for you to give your foes some personal attention. Your very being is so corruptive in fact that it also gives you complete mastery over any other corrupting forces you may wield, allowing you to combine them in any way you wish. Remove an unwanted side effect from one by mixing it with a differing dark power that lacks it, or switch out some physical changes with others from a more aesthetically pleasing corruption. Even the vilest of forces shall be bent to your great purpose."

At least before conception. Eating a leaf on a regular basis also allows for a bit more of a lasting effect... But if you'd like a more long-term solution, the stores of dual medicines offer another and much simpler option for a lasting protection from pregnancy. Swallowing one of the brown pills renders one unable to bear children or be impregnated entirely, though it doesn’t do anything about any existing pregnancies. This leaves them permanently barren regardless of their normal fertility, at least until a pink pill is taken to cancel the effect."

Bosses won’t mind your absence even if this is the fifth time this year, emergencies that require your personal attention won’t come up, and at the end of your leave you can seamlessly pick up and continue right where you left off. If you happen to be male, you can apply this to the women you impregnate instead, making sure that they won’t have to worry while your child is growing inside them."

You go a bit further than the norm however, with the ability to mentally adjust the duration of any of your pregnancies. Perhaps seven weeks is still too much, and you’d rather shorten it all the way down to only a minimum of three weeks? Or if you’d like to enjoy carrying a child for as long as possible, you could extend the time for your baby to develop to a staggering 128 weeks at the longest. Or equivalent time frames should you somehow not be human. If you happened to be male, you could apply this to your partners instead, to change how long they have to carry your children.

All such rushed pregnancies are completely safe, cause no extra physical trauma, don’t require extra food, and are so easy to recover from that you could walk home immediately after giving birth. Nobody will ever consider such quick gestation times to be in any way abnormal, and nurses will never insist a mother stay in the hospital when they try to leave right after giving birth."

This is a bit of a problem, as growing a baby normally takes most of a year. Or rather, it would be a problem if the virus didn’t conveniently speed things along. Infected women experience extremely rapid gestation and development of the child, reaching a state equivalent to roughly eight months of pregnancy in a single week, before the process slows for the remaining weeks of the pregnancy, giving birth in a total of a single month. This does not consume as much energy or nutrients as it seems like it should, is perfectly safe to both parent and child (unlike such rapid growth has any right to be), and the developing fetus is unusually protected, preventing the pregnancy from interfering overmuch in the daily life of the woman in question; they can even get bloated up cum again without risking the baby. Strange cravings, morning sickness, and the daily pains of pregnancy are entirely absent. Furthermore, the mothers-to-be experience a higher degree of serotonin, the so-called “happiness hormone”, resulting in them being much happier with their condition than they might ordinarily be... which is important, considering that they need to carry the baby to term to survive the virus. Men who take this perk will provide the benefits of it to anyone they impregnate."

But the mother isn’t the only beneficiary of this perk: from conception until birth, the mothers of your spawn become psychologically and metaphysically open to you, and are unable to resist any additional effects you might choose to inflict on them which they might otherwise be able to. Even the most unwilling victim can be sculpted into a happy complacent broodmare once she has experienced the unrivaled ecstasy of giving birth to your spawn. Finally, those who witness or hear about these pregnancies find the idea strangely alluring, and to a greater degree depending on their proximity to the event in question."

If you’re a drop-in, this lets you skip the years of education required to get to the point that you can actually start casting spells; if you have a local background, your past includes receiving an education in magic . Whether it’s from a formal institute, learned via family traditions, or self - taught, it doesn’t matter; in regards to this perk, they’re all equally effective. There are many different types of magic in the world, but you can select from the following list: > White Magic: White magic is the loosely - defined magic of “good”; it can inflict justice on those who have done wrong, weaken powerful enemies, heal wounds and sickness, fill inanimate objects with life energy to create golems, and so on. There is no requirement in the slightest that these magics be used for good purposes, however. > Black Magic: Black magic is the loosely - defined magic of “evil”; it can create undead (who are of ten rather nice), summon demons (who are delightfully helpful), speak with the deceased (who may have good advice), drain life force (which with specialized application can be used to heal), invoke fear (useful for ending fights quickly), as well as the magic of making sacrifices to achieve something normally beyond your means. It is also the magic most frequently used for sexual purposes. Like with white magic, there is no requirement to actually be evil to use black magic. > Purple Magic: Purple magic is closely related to black magic. While both are capable of a degree of mind control, manipulating emotions, and providing resistance to said effects, purple magic goes all - in on focusing on mental effects. It is capable of invoking hallucinations, causing ill usions, full - on control of minds and thought processes, and brainwashing. > Blue Magic: Blue magic is deceptively simple; it allows you to control water. However, considering how important the sea is to life in general, and to commerce in particular, this ma kes blue magicians an invaluable component of the economy. > Red Magic: Red magic is the magic of fire and destruction. Although its most readily - apparent and obvious uses are for combat, red magicians are actually most commonly found in the field of enginee ring. > Green Magic: Green magic is the natural magic of plants. It can manipulate them, make them grow faster, and affect their health. A vital component of the agricultural system. You may purchase additional forms of magic at any time you could purchase a perk for 200 CP."

They'll be completely the same as they were when you met them, with three differences. First, while they’re completely lifelike in just about every way, they’re only a semi-real duplicate - more akin to a very lifelike illusion than an actual sentient being. Second, the copy will feel like the ‘summoning’ is completely normal and unremarkable, never questioning why they're suddenly somewhere else. Third: they'll always be enthusiastic about fucking you (even if, say, they're normally only attracted to a different gender/species/other, they'll make an exception just for you). Mind you, this won't necessarily mean they'll fuck you the way you want them to... as an example, the high priestess of a religion that fanatically worships virginity might only be willing to do a handjob so she stays 'pure'. Likewise, summoning The Demon King Of Pain And Slaughter will not magically make him bother with such things like 'consent', 'lube', or 'keeping his plaything alive during the ordeal'. You can't use this item to gain any power or other advantages, such as by asking a mighty sorceress to teach you her magic while your dick is buried up her ass.

Well, they’re sort of like a command seal, but a bit weaker and a lot more open ended. Instead of binding you to someone, these allow anyone to use them - and in theory, to use you. That said, with how much weaker they are even someone with E rank magic resistance could mostly nullify them. They can’t really be used to force you to do things. Instead, they shine brightest when you agree to the command, and also when that command is sexual in nature. Something like ‘Cum a dozen times’, or ‘Get pregnant!” would be the sorts of commands I expect you to use these with. They come on a mystic code piece of paper and can be applied just by pressing it flat against someone's navel. When used, a new set will develop on it once a year. As per tradition, a set will work three times every 24 hours."

You can apply your mark with a simple exertion of magical power if your target is magically-weak or exhausted and from then on will always know your target’s location relative to your own. You can also hide the mark from sight if you’d rather your target or others not know it’s there, and if you’re skilled with magic you can also use it as an anchor for other kinds of lewd spells, making them much more potent against your target."

Of course, this doesn’t only work on your Pretty Cure powers. Any pool of energy that you possess can be replenished by this drink, though the amount that’s recharged doesn’t change. Best of all, this comes in a six-pack, and any used cans are replaced every morning, so you can share it with your friends!"

So when your girlfriend tells you there’s not a single dirty place on your body she’s not just buttering you up: your magic passively purifies your body of unwanted sweat, grime, and other unwanted nastiness like disease, poison, magical corruption, aphrodisiacs, and other unnatural debuffs. Very large amounts of corruption might take a while to completely filter out of your system but if you can keep from becoming corrupted again you’ll eventually return to being a pure maiden both physically and spiritually. When completely uncorrupted you can even count as a virgin for all magical purposes, no matter how much sexual experience you may actually have. Just about the only thing you can’t shed is corruption willingly taken into yourself: for example, if you were tricked into becoming a magical girl using a magical artifact tainted by demon jizz then you’re fresh out of luck without some other way to cleanse yourself."

No matter the state of your body, you will find your spirit to be pure enough to perform any religious rites and rituals.

In response to the energy of other Exorcists or a Demon, the Uterus begins to generate its own spiritual energy, empowering the woman. Yours has now been activated, allowing you to slowly generate the energy you need to power the skills and abilities of the JK Exorcist. Beware however, as you are only able to generate energy while your body is... Pure? Clean? Having a man inside of you, or having cummed inside of you, will temporarily cut off your ability to generate Spiritual Energy. The energy generated this way is stored in the hair, with ponytails being the ideal shape to have the hair in. You will also find that the energy you generate but that goes unused will begin to directly enhance your femininity. Your hair will be more lustrous, your breasts larger and softer, and your body will take men more easily in order to maximize your ability to breed. Speaking of your hair, you’ll find that styling it into a ponytail takes even less than zero effort, with you often putting it up without even realizing you’ve done so. If you're not a girl, or otherwise dont have a uterus...well, I suppose this perk won't do much of anything for you."

For instance you could create a mana potion that also increases the drinker’s breast size or makes her lactate, or create a sleeping potion that also increases the body’s sensitivity. Of course you can also simply make ordinary potions with lewd effects, such as aphrodisiac poisons, and these are especially potent when created in an undiluted form."

The difference is that while a Summoner is limited to binding only their summoned creatures, Slave Magic can bind ordinary people or magical beasts to the will of the caster. Successfully casting the enslavement ritual (which can be resisted or even reflected if the target is unwilling or magically-defended) creates a magical link between master and slave and gives the slave a big metal collar as proof of their status, though you can adjust the collar’s appearance if you wish. The link allows the master to issue magically-enforced orders to the slave which they are physically compelled to obey, even overriding control from other sources such as brainwashing, mind control, or demonic possession. Enslaved characters can be released from the spell’s effects by the caster’s will or by sufficiently powerful forms of anti-magic. As a side-effect, the process of learning this magic also teaches the caster to see magical energy in objects and people, a talent called Aura Vision, as well as how to pump their magical energy into other people. This can be used without binding magic to refill the target’s mana reserves, though the process can be quite... stimulating for the one receiving the mana."

If even that should fail, they will eat the flesh of their host from the inside out. As these are your Crest Worms, however, you can adjust these behaviours. You also have a great deal more knowledge on how to use these worms for lewd purposes as well as how to customize said worms for maximum pleasure. Or pain, depending on your mood. With just a short bit of observation and maybe a tad bit of testing you can tell how to make this one small change to the ‘standard’ design you were planning on using on a person to make the whole thing so much better/worse.

More impressive perhaps is what you can do with ingredients that are already transformative on their own, at the most basic allowing you to increase the potency of these items, making them more reactive to your body. With a bit more work you could mystically enhance such items to make them stronger in general, or remove the taint from demonic items to make them safer to use without losing their main effects. You could even treat various durable substances to use them as materials for exceptional armour and similar things. Should you be particularly devious, you could also use your alchemical knowledge to create mixtures that will turn people into little more than toys and slaves for you. Mixing in your own sexual fluids to foster an addiction to it would be simple enough, though creating concoctions that force people to survive on cum alone might take a bit more work if you wanted to waste your time on doing things like that."

It will allow you to heal and soothe even those who had a portion of their souls ripped from them. Though the most grievous of mental wounds, those that leave the victim entirely catatonic, will require you to use your magic to enter their minds directly and reawaken their spirit that way. Additionally, you have a talent for helping people recover after terrible circumstances. Helping people find the strength to redeem themselves, reawakening their spirits after they have been beaten down, and even helping someone re-adjust to normal life after being torn from the overwhelming bliss that is the enslavement to the Overmind. They have to want it deep down though. Attempting to \"redeem\" people by force is nearly impossible."

Originally this could only be used to teach black magic spells, but you’re able to use it to teach any type of magic to anyone as long as they already know how to use one type of magic. This includes non-local magical abilities you know. Note that this enhanced version of the ritual is a perk rather than a normal spell or ritual; attempting to teach it to others will only teach them the black magic inheritance ritual, which is only useful to them if they already know magic that could be qualified as “black”."

Whenever someone casts a spell on you or the area you’re in, you can trivially form a link between your mana and theirs; until they manage to disrupt this link — such as by moving far enough away, it getting washed away by other mana, or them managing to unleash a chaotic burst of magic — you will start absorbing their mana. Each time this link is established with a given individual, the rate of mana transfer from that individual becomes a bit faster. Additionally, each time this link is established, a charm effect is applied to the linked individual, making them more friendly towards you and reluctant to attack or harm you; this effect fades with time once the link has been broken but grows more powerful and longer-lasting the more mana is absorbed through the link. Though the charm effect does not retain its strength from past links unless the link is reestablished before the effect completely fades, as the rate of mana transference grows faster each time the link is established, this means that the charm effect also grows stronger faster each time the link is established. This link cannot be used against you — this includes inverting it to absorb your mana or apply the charm effect to you. You need not concern yourself with absorbing too much; any excess mana will be safely dissipated into the environment."

Making skin transparent in an imitation of x-ray vision, control over the folds of your vagina, transfering sensations, a spell to make nine months of pregnancy into nine minutes, one to temporarily return the body to a virgin state - and dozens to make it lewder than ever. The magics of a succubus are quite strange, but also extremely enjoyable."

Spellcasting materia grant you the most powerful forms of their spells and special materia offer you the greatest skills of the ancient warriors, but each spell you cast arouses your ardor in lieu of draining your mental stamina, and passive boosts will also passively inflict new fetishes on you until you remove them from your person. In theory these materia could be used as a source of almost limitless magical power, but in return for martial prowess and magical ability you make yourself much more vulnerable to men and beasts with more depraved ways of fighting. Rely too much on your borrowed powers and the carnal desires of the ancients can easily reduce you to a glass cannon who cums like a fountain at the slightest touch."

This means you will be supplying your own mana to both summon, maintain, and empower any servants you summons, an act which can be extremely taxing even for a powerful magus.

Simply by altering the circle’s parameters you can filter the circle’s summoning results, such as making it summon exclusively female servants or only MILFs or tomboys and so on. With a little adjustment, you can even have the circle reach into worlds beyond that of the original Chaldea, allowing you to summon servants they couldn't have imagined. This perk comes with 1 command seal that take the form of a red, three part, symbolic tattoo on your body. It lets you give an order to someone you have a magical binding with to act. This can forced them to do something they wouldn't or couldn't normally do, like teleport to your side or instantly heal from the edge of death.

That might explain why they manifest in such pleasing bodies, as if they were sculpted to meet your desires whenever you call on them.

This gives the master substantial power over the slave, causing them to be struck by a curse for disobedience or strong feelings of guilt towards their master. The curse’s effects can range from a succubus’s aphrodisiac spells to instant death, a favorite of some especially ruthless demon lords. However as the slave grows more loyal and submissive both master and servant grow considerably in power and the ritual progresses through five phases, culminating in a master-servant vow which makes the ritual’s effects permanent. Those who achieve the master-slave vow become extraordinarily powerful: the ritual is capable of giving the average hero or demon enough power to challenge the gods, though it does nothing to enhance raw skill or technique and these must still be trained separately. In addition to its main effect the contract also allows master and slave to sense each other's location, as well as those of any other slaves of the same master, even through magical jamming or interference. You also gain much finer control over the specifics of the relationship than ordinary users of the contract, for instance what constitutes a betrayal can be set during the ritual’s casting. You might choose an erotic punishment using a succubus’s curse and define betrayal only as willfully acting directly against your interests for example. However a lax code of conduct for a slave will slow the ritual’s overall growth curve."

The virtual reproduction of complex magical rituals is essentially what a sorcery emulator does, and the results have surpassed many expectations. In essence, it reads off digitized tomes and loads virtual tools, sacrifices, and virtual believers from its database to simulate a ritual. This allows it to be invoked extremely quickly. However, it is functionally useless unless someone already has magical training. It consumes a considerable amount of magical power, so it is recommended to have an external source of magic power, but a massive pool of magical energy works too. If the user cannot handle the strain, they may go insane or even perish. As it stands, only the Daughter of its inventor has every successfully wielded one. That is — until you came along. The Mythos X7 is the latest model of Sorcery Emulator with the most robust and detailed database. This comes with a few digitized tomes and grimoires already installed, and more can be added from your own collection. If it is damaged or destroyed, a new one will appear in your warehouse the following day."

The villains would do anything to possess or destroy it, and the heroes would do likewise to keep it out of unworthy hands. But through the workings of Fate (and points), the hands it has ended up in are yours. The Sacred Artifact can take just about any form as long as an ordinary human could pick it up, though jewels, magic weapons, and fancy drinking cups are sort of traditional. Whatever its form, the Artifact grants you control over a massive pool of magical energy, which is strongly inclined towards \"good\" uses, such as healing, purification, blessings, and so on. It can be used offensively, but it's much better at smiting evil than it is at chastising neutrality or rebuking misbehaving goodness. Using the artifact also requires considerable willpower, which scales directly with the difficulty and scope of the task you're attempting. In exchange for this power, the artifact’s affinity for life gives it an equal affinity for sex and fertility. People who are exposed to its power tend to end up feeling frisky afterwards (more so as the amount of power they were exposed to increases) and if they give in to those urges they're more likely to end up in the family way as a result. The Artifact also reacts strongly to \"pure\" sexual energies, making it a natural and highly effective component for certain profane rituals and technologies. But a heroic defender of humanity like yourself would never take advantage of that, would you, Master/Madame?"

One of the first things a practitioner of the art learns is the ability to arouse a target with their spells. Is it any wonder then, that this type of magic is a favorite of demons? Still, it is not an inherently evil or demonic magic, merely one suited to their purposes. As a master archmage of the style, you understand this like few others. Most suited to affecting emotions and bodies, your spells can arouse and change the size and functions of bodily parts in strange ways. Aside from the many libidinous uses so often demonstrated by tainted mages, you might also heal yourself and others, temporarily increase your strength, and even go further afield with summoning and portal creation. Your control is such that you don't have to worry about the usual difficulties of using black magic on your own body, able to control the flow of power and prevent it from backfiring. Additionally, fueling your black magic with lust is only the most common way to do so, simple enough to use that mages rarely bother to learn how to use their other emotions. While it is usually not too hard to grow aroused in Mareth, this does leave black mages unable to use their magic when turned off and susceptible to seduction by their enemies. To deal with this weakness, you have started on the beginnings of using black magic with other emotions, wielding your rage, your joy, or anything else. This is only a start, not nearly the mastery you have over lustful magic, but it should serve you well with research and practice. On the flip side, your experience with the black arts means that powering other emotion-based abilities with lust comes easy to you."

You may perform this conversion and store biomass infinitely, but the conversion itself isn’t instant; it would take your body a couple days to create enough biomass to fully cover a large room, although this does have the advantage of not being fast enough to use up all of your magical energy, meaning you still have the power to use magic even while a portion of your energy is devoted to converting into biomass. This conversion can be made to happen automatically, or you can halt the process. It additionally takes time to deploy your biomass; a set of pseudopods to wrap someone up could be manifested nigh-instantly, while coating a room in tentacles would take a few moments. If you don’t want your biomass to go to waste, you can re-absorb that which you have deployed back into your pocket dimension at almost instantaneous speeds.

The chains seal away the power of anyone ensnared in them, stripping lynels of their superhuman strength and sorceresses of their magic, and the tighter the binding the stronger the seal and its integrated enchantments becomes. However your chains are only as powerful as you are, and sealing monsters far stronger than you is no small feat, likely needing you to weaken them before the chains can finish the job. That said the chains are highly effective once in place, almost unbreakable short of the captive receiving outside assistance. Curiously, the chains are also just as effective against heroines and goddesses as they are against monsters and demon kings. Perhaps Hylia secretly wants her hero to make use of that fact?"

The Cheat Rope is an immensely powerful magical relic that has all the same benefits as the Dragon Rope item and substantially boosts its wielder's magical abilities thanks to Chiito herself, who acts as a guardian spirit for her master. Even amateur rope masters can cast powerful magic with Chiito's help simply by wishing for a spell and trusting her to do the work of casting it, but in the hands of a talented rope master she shows her true strength by adding her abilities to your own. She has enough awareness and autonomy to act without orders, although she only does so to protect you from harm or grant your desires. As a loyal rope slave she will never betray you, although she might act in mischievous ways when she knows it will help you, like using her magic to bring your idle fantasies to life."

The crystallized soul of a goddess, this giant pink gem is far larger and more potent than 'normal' lethicite. Where other crystals would be bite-sized, easily swallowed whole or crunched between a demon’s teeth, this one is closer to the size of a watermelon and darkly radiant with power besides. Even if you broke it in three by its crystal protrusions, wasting smaller shards that break off and evaporate, each chunk would still be larger than other crystals and contain enough energy to reshape bodies with little more than a command, instantly grow a large thorny tree to cover an extensive campsite with its canopy, or give a demon who consumed the piece the equivalent of several souls worth of power. If you decided to keep it in one piece though, using the entire thing for one purpose... it could certainly bring changes. Enchanters might use it to power a golem that could threaten even the demon queen indefinitely, mages or even gods could spend its energy to work massive spells that would ordinarily be far beyond even them. And of course, this is the ultimate prize to a demon, as one who got their hands on a crystal like this could have the entire world at their feet. This item is not subject to the usual rules of consumable regeneration. You only get one."

These are sacred magical arts that heal, protect, bless, and cleanse or seal evil rather than the curses or elemental magics that a youma or a Senshi might employ. However your rituals have a strange quirk to them in that they become much more powerful when employed in lewd ways. For instance you can cleanse a girl of evil spirits with a normal purification ritual or you can make her actively repel and burn demons that try to lay hands on her with a ritual that involves rubbing a sacred aphrodisiac lotion into every inch of her body. What’s more, by employing these rituals with other kinds of magic you might have you can add sacred power to any other magical spell or effect you might know, turning even ordinary elemental magic into sacred demon-slaying magic. You can also choose to employ non-Shinto rituals if you’d rather be powered by some other religion instead."

This means you will be supplying your own mana to both summon, maintain, and empower any servants you summons, an act which can be extremely taxing even for a powerful magus. This summoning circle allows the summoning of alternate versions of known servants; by reaching into parallel worlds you can summon a busty female Gilgamesh, adult versions of Nursery Rhyme or Jack the Ripper, and so on. Simply by altering the circle’s parameters you can filter the circle’s summoning results, such as making it summon exclusively female servants or only MILFs or tomboys and so on. With a little adjustment, you can even have the circle reach into worlds beyond that of the original Chaldea, allowing you to summon servants they couldn't have imagined. This perk comes with 1 command seal that takes the form of a red, three part, symbolic tattoo on your body. It lets you give an order to someone you have a magical binding with to act. This can forced them to do something they wouldn't or couldn't normally do, like teleport to your side or instantly heal from the edge of death.

      "description": "Those who have natural magical talent but lack training often learn to cast spells through pure force of will or unquenchable desire. Much like Hajime Takanawa you're a sorcerer of immense natural talent, capable of bringing your lewdest dreams to life. Your magic feeds on your desires and is much stronger and easier to use when bent to erotic purposes, even allowing you to bend the rules of magic in your favor when they stand in your way. Other magicians might be stumped by things they don't understand or hit walls trying to go against the rules of magic, but you can simply brute force those issues with raw power so long as your intentions align with your libido and you're willing to spend much more magical power than you'd normally need to on the resulting spells. If a ritual is about to turn your waifus into human sacrifices you don't need to know how it works to save them when you can shut the whole thing down without endangering anyone (except maybe yourself) by jamming a metaphorical wrench into the gears. Be warned that when overtaxing your magic and going beyond your limits you might find yourself paying a very steep price for it."

By expending and condensing your magical power you can produce seeds of raw magical potential which can be gifted to others, granting them a magical girl’s power. What form their new magic takes will depend on their strengths, personality, and moral character: pure-hearted girls make excellent heroines but those with dark personalities or lustful attitudes become dark magical girls, erotic warriors of darkness like Charm and Grace in their corrupted forms (though without any chains to bind them to a particular master). Moreover these pure seeds allow you to empower these young heroines even further by sharing your own strength with them: when creating new seeds or empowering a magical girl, you can opt to transfer one or more of your perks at the cost of permanently losing them, or donate a portion of your own magical power at the cost of having to train up that power to restore it to its former level."

What better proof could there be that good always (eventually) triumphs over evil? Just as Charm and Grace held on to their purification magic even after being corrupted, you’re able to absorb darkness and corruption without limit without ever becoming permanently tainted by it. Whether inflicted on you by force or absorbed willingly from innocent victims (which you can do at will with a touch) taking darkness and corruption into yourself simply adds to your power rather than tainting your mind and soul. Your magic might begin to seem more erotic and your magical girl transformation might transform into something resembling lingerie, but at heart you’ll remain 100% yourself even as you begin commanding the very powers that ought to be enslaving you. You can even convincingly pass yourself off as being genuinely corrupted, perhaps helping you deceive the forces of evil and gain their confidence long enough to strike a fatal blow against their leadership."

I’m not entirely sure how the heck he managed this, but I’m sure the story would be entertaining. It’s a magic crest. The Tohsaka magic crest, technically. But... it’s also not. Because the Tohsaka magic crest was one that had a handful of martial art type spells and a ton of gemcraft spells built into it, and this is a singularity of lewd and petty nonsense. Want to have the perfect Tantric Ritual? Fire this bad boy up, we got all kinds of spells to help it go along, lube your ass up, increase your bust size temporarily or permanently and the same for his dick, even stuff to clean up afterwards. What we don’t have is anything even vaguely relating to Gemcraft. Or actually usable in combat, or polite society. Maybe don’t let the other Magus families know about this, they’d almost die of laughter and then kill you for the attempted murder. (A Magic Crest is essentially a collection of spiritual nerves that have been specialised to cast specific spells at a reduced cost to their owner. You may have the crest be implanted on purchase, or be stored in a non-perishable manner with instructions for proper and safe implantation.)"

Blades cut deeper, shields hold stronger, cameras reveal your foes even in the darkest gloom, and robots like the Guardians become nearly impossible to hack or corrupt with dark magic.

While this perk doesn't perfectly replicate these bonds, it does guarentee that a Coven bond will form and grant its benefits. You gain the ability to form bonds with others. These bonds encourage a relationship between all bonded through nudges and flashes of inspiration, as well as make deception impossible between the bonded; not because lies and disguises can't be attempted, but because they are made obvious. Once you have eight such bonds, they grow into Coven bonds. Having coven bond carries along with it several benefits, most notably members finding it much easier to learn new things as long as one of the coven members already knows them. There is also chance, as long as they have dormant potential for them, for members of coven to develop abilities and powers of other members, for example becoming more powerful magically or becoming more intelligent, slowly reaching a stage close to the most powerful member of coven. Perhaps most interestingly, members of coven will be getting fast-aged or de-aged to get closer to the coven’s average age. With this perk all of that sharing is now amplified to happen twice as fast and twice as effectively. If you have alternate methods of creating similar bonds, they can act as a substitute to the bonds this perk enables you to create."

It won’t be twisted against what you want it to do, though; your wish will follow the intent with which you made it. Example wishes include but are not limited to: granting an individual an all-around defense against mind control that would require significant effort for even the most powerful students to overcome, automatically becoming aware of any mind control on campus as soon as the affected party enters an area where scrying is not blocked, enslaving an individual with insufficient magic resistance and making them remember having been enslaved several minutes ago and already made their peace with it despite it conflicting with their moral code, causing an entire planet’s freshwater reservoirs to be automatically refilled for a year, freeing an area as large as the largest cities on Earth from all mind control, discretely erasing three people from existence while they are isolated and unobserved, and drastically boosting an individual’s power. This Item is fiat-backed against theft and destruction. You and any individuals you designate are the only people capable of making wishes upon it.

Any spells or magical abilities relating to this concept are far easier to learn and use and far more powerful in your hands than is normal. Any amateur can create magical ropes or chains with Projection but yours could be strong enough to bind a servant, at least a weak one, as securely as any ordinary human. Even with little magical talent you can achieve similar results in fields such as summoning and binding, mind control, and so on, while a talented and experienced magus could achieve results nearly on par with True Magic. You’re even able to sidestep many commonly-accepted rules of how magic is supposed to work in these areas, like wielding command seals against enemy servants you would normally have no authority over. This perk comes with 3 command seals that take the form of a red, three part, symbolic tattoo on your body. Normal use lets you give an order to someone you have a magical binding with to act. This can force them to do something they wouldn't or couldn't normally do, like teleport to your side or instantly heal from the edge of death.

Well, in your first Psionics class, each student will test their psionic potential by attempting to make up to 10 gems glow with only their force of personality; the number of glowing gems is a logarithmic function of how great a person’s potential is. The average human will be able to light up 3 gems. Even without any other Perks, you will be able to do the same. You will have equal (that is, average) skill in Psionics as well. You are already capable of reading surface thoughts."

Also when worn this outfit imposes a sense of inferiority into those around you, similar to when a noble walks down a street with commoners on it. The main benefit from this is that people, specifically those with little to no authority, will tend to subconsciously go with your minor whims, doing things like moving out of the way, giving up their seat, etc."

You don’t have that issue, which means that when you feel like you’re done having sex, stopping actually is an option for you. Additionally, if you’re one of those kinds of Dickgirls whose body NEEDS to have sex every so often, you’ll find that refraining will merely leave your balls aching from being overfull instead of potentially exploding from excessive cum production. Though, do keep in mind that some men, most women, and almost every Dickgirl everywhere will look down on you for this."

As a bonus, orgasms will no longer disrupt your focus or consume your concentration unless you allow them to, although you still feel their pleasure in full."

A seemingly endless array of different types, made of a variety of metals, studded with a variety of gemstones, and enchanted with a variety of different effects. For the most part, these enchantments make it easy to put them on people without the hassle of a normal piercing and inflict the wearer with one of many fetishes. Exhibitionism and bondage are the most common, but in this collection you’ll find piercings that grant just about any fetish you could think of and most certainly every kind you are interested in giving to your pets. On top of those, there are a few piercings with different enchantments, mostly designed to play well with the fetish-granting ones. Piercings that make it impossible for the victim to raise a hand in anger, or that force them to think of and call themselves 'pet'. Moreover, even if your pets found a way to remove the piercings, the damage is already done when they are put in. Removing the piercings doesn’t release them from the artificial fetishes imposed on them, but you could clear their heads yourself if you wanted to."

You could easily stay with one partner for the rest of time, and it will never grow stale."

Helpful if you’re trying to subvert someone stronger than you. Alternatively, if you are in a position of power over them, you can make them hyper-aware of that fact and make them feel vulnerable; when it comes to hypnosis, admitting the possibility of defeat is basically as good as admitting defeat. Helpful if the person you’re trying to hypnotize is so overwhelmingly more powerful than you that any other attempts at subverting them might not work."

And apparently, that someone is you, but the nature of this world means that taming is going to have a special meaning. You can “tame” savage or monstrous creatures by having sex with them. This is considerably faster and more effective than more conventional methods of domestication or conditioning. Even one sexual encounter would make a beast far less willing to harm you. A half a dozen romps in the sack could turn a dangerous beast into a loyal though still domineering friend. A couple of dozen and that friend will follow your commands. More powerful and more willful beasts will require more effort and time for taming. And, of course, the better the sex, the more powerful this taming effect becomes. Please note, this works on both creatures of less than human intelligence and those of human intelligence that are heavily influenced by their more primitive instincts. It also makes them more likely to have sex with you before killing you, giving you an opportunity to put this perk to work if you want to."

You can now request your partners for specific types of sex, such as titfucks, blowjobs, anal, etc; or even more complex requests like getting a double paizuri or having them use their mouth and breasts. Unless they are heavily averse to the action, or if the action would be at a great cost to themselves or their life goals, they likely won’t mind and will fulfill your request to the best of their ability, assuming you don’t take any hostile action against them. Be warned however that once they have fulfilled your request there is no assurance that they will stop despite your pleas that you have had enough. Of course that isn’t all this provides, you can also gain a sense that allows you to see what kinds of sex acts an individual is best at. Those you request sex from will also tend to treat you nicer than those that you would otherwise fight, with some charm and charisma maybe even going so far as to befriending them and asking them for non-sexual favors as well, such as for example not keeping you as a slave and maybe accompanying you on your journey."

However the real benefit of these outfits is how easy they make it to control your minions: each uniform contains hidden mind control devices which use subliminal messaging to condition the wearers for submission and obedience, slowly transforming them into the perfect servants for your nefarious schemes. Supers are more resistant to this effect than normal humans are but even the most willful heroine can be brought to heel simply by being dressed in your colors for long enough."

Your presence, charisma, and the lust you inspire are all magnified by an amount that is roughly equal to how much greater your net worth is compared to others. Not only that, but the effect is further amplified for people who actually work for you or are otherwise subject to your authority, affecting them even at a distance. Any such employees and subordinates grow noticeably more submissive and enamored with you as time goes on, depending on their own wealth and how directly they work for you. It would take some time to meaningfully affect a wage slave on the other side of the planet or an equally rich colleague who only technically reports to you. But an intern assigned to assist you directly? They’ll be on their knees on their first day.

That makes it a valuable commodity, almost more valuable than rupees in some ways, and you can use that to your advantage. You can pay for almost any good or service with sex rather than currency. Need a debt forgiven? Pay it in sex. Need to hire adventurers for a quest? Pay them in sex. Depending on what it is you’re buying you might need to have a lot of sex, or especially degrading forms of it such as a period of sex slavery or public use, in order to pay off what you owe, but your “currency” is honored everywhere, and its value is respected even by those who’d rather cheat you out of a conventional payment. Take care though, if you skip out on your debts your debtors won’t hesitate to extract what you owe them by force."

When they think something positive about you, they help you, or you pay them a compliment, they feel a small burst of positive sensation — pleasure or joy or simple satisfaction, unnoticeable for how small it is but nevertheless there — and a similar burst of negative sensation whenever they think something negative about you, act against you, or feel they’ve disappointed you. Psychology and pavlovian reactions being what they are, this ensures that this Perk’s effects only build with time. You can drastically increase the effects of this aura but at the cost of its subtlety. Still, might be useful if you ever need to give someone one final push.

When you start to have sex with someone, they’ll get an awareness of how you want to be treated and what kinks you have—how you really want to be treated, not necessarily what you think you want. It’s still up to them to act on it, but they’re a lot more likely to give a slutty pig bitch like you what you deserve if they know that you actually want it. But not everyone has the vocabulary to really degrade you the way you want, nor the bearing to do so. That’s why whenever you’re in a relationship with someone, they will gain increased confidence, and their awareness of how you want to be treated in bed will give them the knowledge of how to treat you, giving them the skills needed to fulfill your fantasies."

But your specialty goes one step further, into the altering and reprogramming of minds instead of simply reading them. You have the skills and knowledge to build helmets resembling normal VR equipment or larger machines that alter brain waves at a distance, both of which will allow you to start screwing with people's heads. Inducing lust or pleasure is relatively easy (even if you're broadcasting on a wide area), while instilling love or true loyalty for someone specific will require longer and more intensive exposure. But with enough time to work, you can program fetishes, personality traits, and even skills into your victims subjects. In combination with some hacking ability, you could even use people's own technology and cybernetics against them. If they already got themselves a convenient direct neural interface, why wouldn't you just make use of that? This does work more slowly than with specialized tech, as you're going to have to work around safeties and make it do something it wasn't designed for. But on the other hand, it's going to be much less noticeable. And if you have access to the code of an artificial intelligence, whether willingly or by force, you can do even more to them. Without the need to slowly adjust an organic brain, you'll be able to directly code love, loyalty, and more into the AI with far more ease. With enough time to work on it, you could entirely reprogram an AI to have all the fetishes, hidden codeword backdoors, and personality traits you could ever want."

This makes your victims much less willing to resist you violently and heroines like the Senshi or mundane law enforcement give you the benefit of the doubt much more than they really should, only fidgeting weakly as you slide your hands under their uniforms.

Whether you fight for truth and justice, sexual freedom, or something else entirely, you’re a symbol of your ideals and can inspire virtue and heroism in others by performing great deeds in the name of those ideals. When you battle evil or protect others your actions inspire onlookers and those you help, bringing out the best in them and gradually making the world a better place one good deed at a time. Eventually you’ll see major changes in the world as your deeds begin to add up: plummeting crime rates, shrinking poverty, the end of prejudice and more are all possible with enough time and effort on your part. Apart from traditional virtues you can also promote a few of your own and shape the world to come without risk of tarnishing the utopia it may become. Maybe you’ll promote sexual liberty and eradicate the shaming of healthy desires, or help revive traditional gender roles and create a harmonious patriarchy, or just embrace your kinks and spread them far and wide for the world to enjoy with you."

Necessary to rebuild his army and for him to enslave women. It is also his literal carved-out heart, a lie, and a trap, but nevermind that. Unlike that vile thing, this version of the Orb does exactly what it is advertised to, without harming you if it happens to be destroyed. Mostly. While it doesn’t really help with enslaving women, you can use the Orb to upgrade your own powers as needed by feeding it orgasmic energy. The Orb will strengthen you in turn and grant you power in the form of new magical spells suited to you, more ways to command your slaves, and possibly other abilities if you happen to have access to different powers than the Overmind normally does. In addition to the Orb itself, this comes with a ritual to establish an orgasm matrix. Slaves who cannot fight can be kept suspended here in perpetual orgasm, cumming for the rest of their lives (or until you let them out) to provide you with orgasmic energy. This way, slaves that aren’t of use in battle or as servants can still help you enslave more useful girls."

You may, at your own discretion, declare yourself to be “shunned”. While being shunned, no one—save for those you designate as being immune to this effect—will pay any attention to you and will ignore your actions. This isn’t a matter of them being unable to perceive you, but rather a willing and determined snubbing of you, backed by the belief that some nebulous “punishment” will come for them with all the wrath of the law if they acknowledge your existence, regardless of if anyone else is actually there to see them do it. They’ll respond normally to injury, but anything short of deliberately harming someone else will be decidedly ignored by everyone present. Note that under the effects of this perk, rape is not considered a form of “harm”, as long as you aren’t also beating them or something, although slapping their ass is fine. You could fuck a man’s wife in front of him at the dinner table, and he’d just keep eating and pretend not to see it. People won’t even react to how other people react to you; if you were to fuck someone in the street, people wouldn’t respond as if something indecent were happening, but instead just walk around the two of you, not even acknowledging the unclothed state of your victim. You can end this shunning at any time, and people will start responding to you normally. Nothing “negative” that you did while under the effects of this perk will matter to people anymore, while anything “positive”—including the pleasure you may or may not have brought to people—will still be remembered and held in good regard."

Here they take humans and once-humans, pump them full of aphrodisiacs, body-altering drugs, and corrupting agents, and then continually milk them of their tainted milk and cum for the rest of their lives. The resulting river of drug-filled sex-juices is used both to wash away the last pockets of purity and to create large quantities of premium goods.

The natural energy circulating through this area is massive, giving you and your partners the energy to perform whatever kind of training you like for days on end and the wisdom to learn many new techniques. You may even find yourself starting to resemble said animal or gaining new abilities based off them if you spend enough time training (or “training”) here. If you ever need to relax, train, or hide from any unsavory types, this place is only a hand sign away."

Those slaves who aren’t in bed with you, will be in here, having sex together for your entertainment.

There will always be room for you to bring another slave to serve here as Concubine or harem member."

The beach is your private property and you can do just about anything you want on it, but the tropical vacation atmosphere is especially great for encouraging lewdness in an outdoor setting, a sort of “when in Rome” effect where a large group of people can become randy and amorous as soon as one or two of them start stripping or fucking or what have you. For bonus points, this item is also great for acquiring a perfect tan without the risk of sunburn, heatstroke, skin cancer, or anything like that, so feel free to strip down and scorch those tan lines away."

It’s been sitting directly beneath Ganon’s lair for a hundred years and its contents are now deeply corrupted but they’ve also become deeply magical, a treasure trove of priceless arcane tomes with knowledge of subjects ranging from architecture and cooking to magical theory and Sheikah technology. The magic in each book makes it possible to master the knowledge contained within extremely quickly but at the cost of immersing yourself in a lurid fantasy related to what you’re learning and how much you need to learn to master that skill. A chef hoping to learn a new dish might spend a few minutes having a fantasy about bending someone over his kitchen counter, while a student seeking knowledge of Sheikah artifacts might find herself trapped in an illusion of being ravished by machines. By the time the fantasy ends you’ll have gained whatever skills you were seeking, though if you’re unable to grasp the knowledge you found you might only retain bits and pieces of it, requiring a great deal of studying to gain the full effect. As your adventure continues the library will automatically expand its contents to cover subjects unique to future worlds."

The room is hyper-optimized to extract all manner of sexual energies, including sextacy, and induces incredible amounts of pleasure in people who’ve been strapped into the machines in order to harvest the optimum levels of sextacy. It isn’t as effective as a Real Man would be, or an ordinary man with a good affinity for amplifying sextacy production, but it can still produce more than enough to power an entire base even from substandard women who can’t produce much sextacy. Its biggest advantage is that it can extract pleasure from multiple people simultaneously. Yours, however, has another secret—if you strap your enemies into these machines, they are rendered helpless, no matter how strong or capable they may be otherwise."

The only real downside is that much like the rest of soul society, it’s two to three hundred years in the past. Hope you like mud huts?"

By default the blueprints for any other gear or cyberware bought here are already included as well. There’s just one small thing you might want to keep in mind. If you try to have the workshop produce something that isn’t already sexual in some way, it’ll alter the plans slightly on its own to put some perverted spin on it. For example, those human level androids could come out as sexbots intent on seducing its owners, while power armour might keep its wearer in a constant state of arousal or have sextoys built-in. But as a bonus, along with the finished product it also provides a new set of blueprints for this perverse variation."

Unfortunately this factory requires much more than a mere blue flame to maintain its operations; instead, one or several volunteers (or prisoners!) must be strapped in to the lab’s factory-thrones and used as human generators, though the thrones do make the process just shy of mind-shatteringly pleasurable as they milk their sacrifices of their magical energy through an arsenal of mechanical methods. The quality and speed of the factory’s crafting also depends on how much magic the factory’s generators can feed it; Princess Zelda at the height of her power could fuel the creation of a brand new Guardian overnight, but a single ordinary hylian could barely produce spare parts in that time."

This well made bra not only provides support and stability to your chest beyond what any other non CP backed bra could do, but also looks quite flattering on you as well."

The magic of the coffee-maker always keeps the rich, creamy coffee at a properly steaming temperature while the pot is left in place, ensuring its readiness whenever you need a refreshingly caffeinated drink to energize yourself. However, the most notable thing about it only becomes apparent once the coffee pot is put back in place. The busty coffee-maker will come to life, grabbing her thick dusky nipples and squeezing out a trickle of scaldingly hot liquid. Her eyes rolling up into her head from pleasure as she automatically refills the missing coffee, mouth open with ecstasy. As the coffee pot is refilled, her movements gradually slow down with almost imperceptibly quivers, before she freezes back into place with a final smile of contentment. It also comes with a free mug that has '#1 Dad' written on it."

It will also collect samples of speech, and once enough progress is made, will be able to translate others and yourself automatically in real time. In following jumps, when encountering new species or resources, it will pull info from any recorded source, including the written word.

Consisting of a saddle, bridle, anal tail plug, and bondage gear which securely restrains all of the wearer’s non-horsey bits, this enchanted gear grants a wearer the strength, speed, and endurance of a wild stallion while also allowing a person to ride on their back as comfortably and effectively (for both rider and horse) as a real horse. While wearing the complete outfit the horse can even teleport straight to her master’s side: simply whistle for her and she’ll magically appear from over the nearest hill or as if she’d been loyally waiting for you just out of sight even if she was actually many miles away."

While you can't rely on a partner to untie you if something goes wrong, you also won't need to because the ropes would sooner snap on their own than cut off circulation or otherwise endanger your health. Accidentally tying yourself up so well that you can't escape at all is a nice fantasy but won't actually happen when push comes to shove. Moreover, your self-care routines are exceptionally effective at eroding magical effects like curses or addictions or other hostile spells that you currently suffer from, allowing you to purify yourself of such things. More powerful curses may require a great deal of time and effort to destroy them completely, but any sort of curse can be removed if you work at it hard enough."

From a standard single-piece dildo, to a large and floppy one that produces aphrodisiacs, and variants that use intricate clockworks to vibrate. There’s even specialized aids for people with different body structures, like fake mares and poles for centaurs. Besides these mundane examples, there’s also some enchanted fare here. Belts that cover the wearer in a layer of temporary and pulsing latex, strapons that allow the wearer to feel through them and produce actual cum, and more. But most curious of all are the organic 'items' serving as toys. Hybrid animal-plant creatures that feed upon semen, belt-like creatures that clamp down to grow and organic dildos to rub and fuck their wearer, even the occasional arm-sized squirming tentacle. These are not for the delicate, as the experience of using them is often quite overwhelming."

You can easily toy with a shibari harness or tweak the settings on a set of vibrator panties from clear across town, and you'll instinctively know whenever your slaves are in enough danger to need your help, or if they've been naughty and need to be punished for breaking a rule you've set for them, like \"no masturbating without permission.\""

It is also self-driving with an advanced autopiloting system, so you can just lean back and enjoy the ride. Just specify a destination and off you go. Though if you prefer doing things yourself, you could drive it manually by using one of the built-in sex toys to control it...or you could drive it normally, using the steering wheel.

Most people are content with just one, but what you have here is the potential to build an entire harem or stable of them for free. At first this only gives you the standard model, a blonde and somewhat muscular dickgirl with no outstanding fetishes or preferences who simply acts as a very loyal and very loving girlfriend, but the company will send you a new model every year based on your feedback. You may send an older tengirl back if you eventually find taking on new partners too troublesome or have them refitted into a new model if you actually grow emotionally attached, as well."

The seat itself is wired up with a high-speed data connection, and comes with a set of additional accessories. First, a flattering and skin tight suit that helps regulate your body processes to allow you to stay in full VR for longer, and which can give tactile feedback for augmented reality when you’re not deep diving. Second, and more impressively, a full virtual reality helmet just in case you don’t have any cybernetics to let you dive into VR. You could plug the helmet into the chair’s connection or just use it separately if you already have a wireless connection. But even if you do have the ‘ware, you might still want to use the helmet for its secondary function. It can translate the digital world into more familiar (and sexual) settings, allowing you to interact with programs and similar things as if they were human-like entities. Expect everything in this version of cyberspace to be very sexy, and for your bedroom skills to be as useful as (or more than) your hacking abilities if you try to penetrate security while using this."

The sensory recordings are fully VR and allow you to experience the senses and emotions of the porn actor for yourself. Every bit of physical pleasure, every touch and emotion they felt during the scene will be something you’ll be able to feel for yourself. The BTS edits take those basic recordings and amp up all of the contents, intensifying the entire experience into something quite literally better than sex. Do be careful with those, or you might find reality paling in comparison. Lastly, you can put in requests for other porn you already own to be converted into VR recordings or even better-than-life versions, if you’d like to revisit old favorites.

In addition to being able to move around on their own they also adjust their dimensions and contours slightly to best suit their user. Tables adjust their height or levelness, chairs adjust their padding and reclining angle, beds become softer or firmer. Each piece also has its own functions – wardrobes or cupboards might sort their contents for you and open the drawer holding the thing you are looking for, mirrors might link to your ship’s communications systems to function as screens, the arms of chairs might be able to restrain hostile visitors, and the beds come with all kinds of warming, massaging and vibrating features, which will be handy if you expect to spend a lot of time in them. There are enough separate pieces to outfit a whole house or a similarly-sized starship. All of these items are self-cleaning and will match the decor of the room they are placed in."

However the computer's interior conceals a writhing mass of cables which act in a suspiciously tentacle-like manner. They will attempt to 'connect' in a highly sexual manner to anyone besides you who is unwise enough to touch the machine (or to attempt a connection for AIs or technopaths). You and any others you authorise can treat this as merely a disconcerting form of neural interface which somehow doesn't distract from use of the system. However any unauthorised individuals are pulled inside the machine and restrained by it to be used as biological hardware. The performance of the system improves with their intellect and skills, but not personal memories, accessible for its use. When not working on a task the system improves itself as though the victim was actively working to upgrade the system's software and hardware in cooperation with all other victims. Victims are sustained by the system as though they were a normal electronic component although the size of the machine, and its power consumption, does increase for each victim it contains."

Used as a blanket it’s as warm as a feather doona, used to lie on it’s as comfortable as a mattress, and used to cover your head in a storm it is waterproof. It’s cut, tear, and puncture-proof, impermeable to anything on the electromagnetic spectrum and a lot of things not on it – preventing even X-ray vision from peeking through it if you’ve got it wrapped around yourself, and it makes an effective shield against lasers and rayguns, yet you can still cover your face and breath through it to filter out noxious fumes (which it does better than a real gas mask). When twisted up and whipped at foes, it’s a formidable weapon with the heft of a laser-resistant metal bar. The presence of this towel also has an effect on bystanders: unless they are extraordinarily selfish or on outright inhospitable terms with you, others will happily lend you things which they deem “trivial”. A space trucker might loan you a spare old space suit, a galactic tyrant might lend you a small army and one of his less-used summer palaces.

The only catch is it somehow absorbs sexual energy from the people aboard and uses that for power.

Ropes placed carelessly can cut off circulation, a whip wielded with too much force can leave bloody gashes, and much worse can happen the more extreme things become, and that’s without magic and superpowers getting involved. But such accidents never happen to you and your lovers because you’ve acquired the protection of porn logic, that magical force that helps everything run smoothly whenever the clothes come off. Once the fun begins only a truly exceptional occasion can make it go awry: accidents never happen with your gear, like ropes snapping mid-scene because the sub was way stronger than expected, and the only way you can seriously injure one of your lovers is if you do so very deliberately for some reason. This perk’s effects work just as well for your partners as they do for you if you’re not the one on top, and they can be made to work just as well on unwilling captives provided that they’ve been thoroughly subdued, so a damsel who’s been bested in battle then bound and gagged will be completely helpless against whatever nefarious ends you have in mind for her."

While the submissive nature of these may not be for you, the sheer volume of them could be up your alley, which is where this perk comes in. It serves as a luck modifier, which increases the chances of you coming across situations that can lead to lewd shenanigans. For example, coming across an incredibly gullible idiot who you can trick into sucking you off, a house with its front door left ajar and someone in a cartoonish level of deep sleep on the living room couch, a hole full of tentacles you could “accidentally” trip and fall into, or just someone whose clothes are about to malfunction. The average amount of these situations, all of which will have their triggers be marked by floating pink hearts that only you can see, that you would run into as you go about your day can be modified along with broad elements of them. For example, choosing who specifically they do or don’t pull in, what fetishes they include, and the “story” of the event such as whether the person who somehow falls ass first on your face is extremely apologetic and tries, but fails, to get up or is a cheeky brat who tries to push you deeper by grinding on your face."

Finally, the better you are at sex, the faster their sensitivities are raised; should you have godlike sexual skills you could even turn someone’s body from relatively normal to reaching orgasm at the slightest touch in a single night.

However the protection by this perk offers fails while you are in the presence of your love. In addition, if an enemy is truly intent on death then, at best, this perk can delay that for a time by making them more likely to 'play'."

That’s where this perk comes into play; you have complete control over your perks and powers. This allows you to turn your perks on and off at will, or even dial them to degrees so that a perk is only partially in effect. Speaking of partial perk effects, you can also selectively turn off parts of your perks, while leaving the rest of it untouched; for instance, if you had a perk that gave you endless stamina and also let you see how close your partners are to coming, you could selectively turn off just the stamina and keep the orgasm- vision."

Eat a virgin, become more fertile. Eat a bull, your strength for increase. Each a griffin, your magical power increases. A princess, perhaps your overall beauty? Everything will give you something, but the boring stuff would probably be so small as to not notice it at all. In addition, you can eat something twice your size with ease, and maybe ten times to leave you full to bursting."

But this has another effect, a mingling that results when you are subject to any sort of mental domination. It doesn’t completely protect you, but instead perverts any orders you are given into something that works against the intentions of the person who attempted to control you. For instance, an order to obey them might be twisted into an order to “service” your master... even against their objections. An order to slay some innocents might turn into you laying some innocents. Even if you are given an ironclad order with no room for misinterpretation, your mind will twist the order into something entirely new and opposed to the intentions of the one trying to command you. If you already had an immunity to such controlling effects, then now your powers are enhanced to instead reflect attempts to control your mind, assaulting your attacker with the same mental influence they sought to use on you."

Alternatively, instead of using your own power you can impregnate a strong slave with your spawn and use their strength instead.

Genuine affection and pleasure both massively accelerate the healing of wounds and ailments of all sorts, whether by rubbing healing oils on scarred bodies, holding them close when the terrors come at night, or simply helping them feel whole again. Even if you were to come home riddled with bullets or infected with an alien virus, a night spent in the arms of a lover will have you walking again by morning, and if you can squeeze in some sexy time you'll be ready to give those crooks some quality payback by the afternoon. This benefits not only you but also any target of your affections, be they a young protégé who got in over their head, or your favorite cat burglar after she pushed her luck too far. No matter how dark the night may be, so long as you have each other all wounds will heal and you'll face the coming dawn together."

Ordinary sensory deprivation can make your sense of pleasure grow tenfold, and an ordinary schoolgirl could gain the acting skills of a world-class performer or the intelligence of a genius while she’s tied up.

Purchase this perk and you shall receive the power to withdraw your consent under any circumstances. This does not retroactively remove the fact that you consented to something in the past, but it can often negate the effects in the present. Remove your consent to the sale of a property and you'll get it back, although you will have to pay back whatever you received from the sale. Sold your soul to the Dark One for magic powers? You can get your soul back by invoking this, although you lose the magic and it is likely that the Dark One will be hella pissed. Even better, this kicks in automatically if you ever get talked into something that will rob you of your ability to decide, unless for whatever reason you decide to toggle off the effect beforehand. However, the perk is entirely ineffective against effects that don't actually require your consent."

You on the other hand prefer to call on a different emotion to empower yourself. Your libido is what really fuels you, becoming physically stronger as your lust increases. And by drawing on an inner wellspring of eroticism you can choose to enter a “rage” that makes you much stronger and tougher, while ever increasing your lust for as long as it continues which in turn makes you grow even mightier from your rising ardor. However you can't control yourself when in this state, and can not think of anything besides fucking the closest target of your desires, or of destroying anything that stands in the way of doing so. Also once so inflamed you can not end this lustful fury until you've found sexual release, so think carefully about where you are and who is nearby before abandoning yourself to your passions."

If you have some variant of increased sexual stamina the semen that you would produce/use due to it counts towards your stored amount. If you have 'unlimited' sexual stamina, then that perk counts as though it made you capable of creating and storing enough semen to fuck your way through hundreds of girls before needing a short rest and recharge. If female, then your body becomes capable of storing a hundred gallons of cum within it in an extradimensional space, giving you access to the semen-based invincibility.

You can choose how much control the fusion target has of this new singular body. And why stop at fusing only two people? Why not three, four, or five? You can sequentially fuse with more and more people as long as you want, each time adding their various traits and strengths to yourself. Finally, once you have combined with other people, you can obviously also uncombine if you wish.

Much like the rope goddess Izuna, you're a newborn godling with all the powers a god would be expected to have, such as hearing prayers from your worshippers and performing miracles of great magical power. While you're nowhere near as powerful as gods like Amaterasu, you'll grow much stronger as you amass followers and earn their devotion, and you can bless your most loyal servants with power and create your own exorcists. The loyalty and submission of your followers greatly magnifies what they receive from you and you from them, especially when you impose divine laws for them to follow. Even when you have little power of your own to give, laying down a code of laws like \"thou shalt not kinkshame\" or \"shrine maidens must always remain chaste and pure\" allows you to grant the greatest rewards to those faithful enough to follow your creed, whatever its tenets might be."

You could even transform a human into a super Grimm, probably as part of some plot to have them fuck all the huntresses in the world senseless.

While this gives you no intrinsic physical or magical powers it does grant you one specific ability. Quite simply you are impossibly good at sex and have a supernatural aura around you that incites those around you with lust as well as removing normal limits of pleasure. Playing with a composed and haughty queen's breasts is enough to cause her to orgasm multiple times in a row, and in bed you can quickly prove yourself unmatched. This isn’t even sexual skill, a complete novice in bed with this perk would satisfy someone more then even someone who had mastered the art of sex, and if you’re great at sex in addition to this perk... You very likely could seduce even an assassin sent to kill you into joining you instead after a passionate night in bed. In addition your demonic heritage provides you with a near limitless stamina, so much so that satisfying 8 or more women in one night is well within the realm of probability. Your incubus blood also grants other benefits. First you are seen akin to royalty among demonkind and can easily convince any demons to help you with whatever you need (within reason). You also possess a near limitless lifeforce that not only allows you to survive having sex with a succubus, or similar beings, but turn the tables and give them a night they won’t soon forget."

You could easily get someone addicted to you with this. As a safety measure, no amount of pleasure you inflict upon someone is capable of inflicting physical, mental, or spiritual harm to them.

Maybe you work for a different shadow conspiracy, working to remove anyone disruptive to their plans for society. Doesn’t really matter. Whenever you do ‘deal’ with someone, you can take something of theirs for yourself. Just think of all those neat toys that are being removed from untrustworthy hands... and then try not to become untrustworthy yourself. Oh, and the more final the ‘dealing with’ the better. After all, if you claim his life, you might as well claim his life. After all, his - I mean, your - wife is quite the looker."

      "description": "A beastly creature of the land such as yourself shouldn’t have to bother with societal niceties such as clothes or etiquette, and it seems everyone agrees. Nature seems to bend over for you, wildlife would rather breed with you than kill you, and they all seem to understand what you say and express such. They also seem quite willing to do what you say, even doing things for you unprompted. It doesn’t just stop at nature however, as those who are more inclined towards the comfort of society seem to be drawn by your barbaric nature. Nudity in public areas does not garner embarrassment or shame, but arousal and desire. Stroking your cock while confidently telling a woman you’re going to keep her bare pawed and pregnant right in front of her husband will have her spreading her legs for you right then and there instead of running for help. You could claim a male by simply telling him where his cock belongs with your hand in his pants in front of his own mother. Completely ignoring societal norms, rules, and etiquette in the name of getting a good fuck makes you savagely irresistible."

      "description": "This... Is the wrong kind of game. Like, really wrong. I was expecting a hack and slash, not a gatcha game. Anyways, you've got a illusionary gatcha connected to a low fantasy world, much like this one. Additionally, it will run collaborations occasionally, allowing you to summon nerfed versions of people and things from other worlds. Common rolls are usually everyday items, Legendary rolls will be weak copies of major players. Pulling a person does instill a base level of loyalty in them, thankfully. As for how often, you get one point/draw per day, though doing mass rolls has better odds of pulling something powerful. You can also get additional draws from taking certain actions during collaberations or events. For example, you might get a roll for gifting 10 different people a present that they really wanted during Christmas, or bedding 10 women during a Valentine's day event. Also, once you've maxed something out - levelled it up, upgraded its skills, fed it stat boosters etc. - it gets removed from the gatcha. Or, in other words, you can slowly force the gatcha to give you stronger and stronger people and items simply by removing the weak ones from it. You can voluntarily add them back in if you want multiple copies though. Twins are always nice after all."

This is a spacious, luxuriously furnished starship designed for a large crew and guest complement, but not designed for long or dangerous trips. The Cruiser’s beds might have the finest Kylirian silk sheets, built-in spas, tasteful art and shag rugs in every cabin, but its mediocre shields, speed and weaponry usually force them to stick to well-patrolled space routes. Essentially, a small cruiseliner in space. The ship does not come with crew, but does come with a full database of techical manuals dictating the means of use and repair of all machines on board. This database can be searched via terminals or by the basic VI installed by default."

Is it any surprise to you that your soul is just as depraved as your personality? You possess a reality marble, a mental world housed within your soul which you can project over the real world, dragging others around you into it. This world is a magical sex dungeon, an endless prison which your adversaries can escape only by killing you, while defeated foes instead become your prisoners and can only be freed if you are defeated some other way. Your reality marble contains all manner of fiendish devices designed to punish and enslave, including any appropriate items you might have gathered in your adventures, and you may conjure them into the real world to attack your enemies using a small expenditure of mana. Beyond these powers the aesthetic of your reality marble is up to you; it might be a luxurious palace lit by candlelight and incense or a dank cellar whose shadows stretch out into an endless abyss."
