Although called a bracelet, there are different forms for different races. Slime people might be injected with a nanite swarm programmed with the same effect, for example. Once you have equipped the bracelet, the AI will adapt itself to gain an ideal personality fitting your own. The AI of a loner might become their perfect friend, that of a rich girl always left alone might become a butler caring for her, and someone living a loveless life might find that their companion AI has all the qualities they'd want in their girlfriend.No matter how your companion AI will end up, they will always end up in your best interest. As they have a photographic memory and see the world through your senses, they can highlight important objects or places you might have missed, jog your memory if you forget something important, or browse through the internet to find information a million times faster than somebody with a human brain would.There are also various upgrades that can add to the functionality of the companion bracelet, such as identifying software allowing your companion AI to scan the Aura of creatures or objects to determine their ability, level, and other information, or even an upgrade to allow an instance of them to live in your brain and tap into your senses to control your body in dangerous situations, or just show the trajectories enemy projectiles will take so you can easily dodge them. For 50 CP each, you can apply one upgrade to your companion bracelet, with no limit on how many you can purchase.",

      "description": "-Key of Avatars (200CP) Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Avatars, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. The Arcana of Avatars first lets you craft, and then manifest, an Avatar. Crafting an Avatar starts modestly expensive in Arcane, and eventually becomes very expensive, though you only need to craft a given Avatar once. Manifesting it costs the same amount, and maintaining it ties up a petty amount of mind and intellect to start, growing to a modest amount for the greatest Avatars. Withdrawing the invested intelligence causes an Avatar to dissipate, but by paying the Arcane cost again it may be resummoned. The range that the Arcana of Avatars may summon at is normally dependent on your Arcane State, but by buying this perk you gain the maximum range - able to summon an avatar even into another plane of existence, though you need at least some way of targeting where you want it to manifest, of which you know several methods. Normally, it's only possible to manifest a single avatar at a time. Most avatars are constructs, though Greater and True Avatars are living creatures. Avatars are immune to mind affecting spells. You can look through your Avatar's eyes at any time. Your avatar is completely loyal and incorruptible by any force, magical or mundane. It will work towards your goals even if it doesn't know it's an avatar or that you exist. You may take control of your avatar at any time, and while doing so may channel your abilities through it - casting spells, manifesting powers, and so on. Likewise you can use your skills and feats through it. The avatar may be aware of this control or explain it away as you like. You may give them orders they will follow to the best of their abilities. There are several different stages of avatar that you can learn to manifest sequentially. Rudimentary: Has no mind of its own, is very fragile, cannot channel your powers, can't speak, and can't pass for a living thing. Will be destroyed by even a light blow. You must actively control it, or it will collapse to the ground. Lesser Has the mind of a dumb child but can follow orders, but won't do anything you didn't explicitly order. Can't yet channel your powers. Might survive a single light blow. Cannot speak. Can pass as a living thing at a distance, but is cold and doesn't breath. Standard: Has the mind of a slow adult. Can speak, but only in your voice. It cannot attack on its own, but it is able to be a channel for your powers and skills at this point. Its flesh is warm and it breathes, though it won't sweat or bleed. Superior: Has the mind of an average adult and can think independently as needed. It has the health of an average human. It can contact you to get further instructions if it needs them. It can use basic skills on its own. Greater: Is actually a living thing a first level character with skills and feats and the attributes of a starting adventurer, though it will never learn or grow. If you don't want it to, it won't even know it's an avatar, believing itself a real person, following your goals subconsciously. True: Nothing can detect that a True avatar is anything but a normal mortal. It can fall in love, have children, learn and grow, though it can't grow beyond a fourth of your own fully realized potential. Though it can be better than you at things by specializing differently. Once you grow able to manifest a True avatar, you'll start the cycle again with a second avatar, starting at Rudimentary and growing to True, at which point the cycle will repeat. -Hierarchy of Souls (100CP) Normally an Avatar is a transitory thing - even the True Avatar. Not for you. Once you have manifested a True Avatar you will be able to separate a piece of your soul - the part that's able to manifest that Avatar, and imbue it with vast quantities of Arcane, raising that Avatar to the status of Sub-Soul. You lose the ability to manifest one Avatar, but in return the Sub-Soul becomes a persistent being you don't need to maintain. If it should ever be slain, it will return in a night and a day for no cost. Its potential grows, being able to become as strong as you. This is just potential, it will have to get there the hard way. If you let it, it can channel your powers itself - casting your memorized spells, manifesting powers from your reserves, and so on. It also counts as a Bound Phylactery. So long as it lives, you will return. You can channel spells through it as if you were present, without having to take control of it or use its actions, and observe around it, rather then just through its eyes. You always count as touching it for the purposes of spells (and it counts as 'you' for purposes for self-only spells), and can flawlessly teleport to it over any distance by the spell, or for a small cost in Arcane. You can store Arcane in it, and both you and it can draw upon that Arcane to use Arcana itself. You can hang up to six spells in it for both of your uses, and hang another six spells as contingencies. If those contingencies are attack spells, they won't harm your Sub-Soul even if they drop down on top of it. It retains the incorruptibility and absolute loyalty of an Avatar, and counts as a living creature or as a construct, whichever is most advantageous at any given moment.",

Any perks from the Evil Genius tree that you share with them gain a substantial boost in effectiveness whenever you both use them simultaneously; experiments proceed more smoothly, collaborative inventions take much less time to perfect, and so on. A Stroke of Genius (200CP) No matter where he goes or what he’s doing, an Evil Genius is almost always the smartest person in the room, and probably the most perverted too. Your intelligence and creativity stand at the peak of ordinary human capacity and your knowledge of the sciences is equally vast, covering many different disciplines from robotics to programming to chemistry. Even magic is well within your grasp in any world where such power can be learned. But when your genius is fueled by depraved inspiration you can push these fields into the realm of comic book super-science. You might design machines that use orgasms to brainwash their wearers or discover a new kind of energy produced by sexual desire. The laws of science may seem hard and inflexible to others but in your hands they bend and flex like a stripper on a pole. Ward’s Maxim (200CP) Does nobody besides you read Lovecraft before they start dabbling with eldritch forces anymore?! You’ve learned to never call up anything that you can’t put down and you put that lesson into play by ensuring you’ll never lose control of your creations. Any creatures summoned or created by you as well as any devices you build have a built-in kill switch which you can use to restrain, kill, power off, or otherwise neutralize them at will. The nature of this trigger is up to you as long as the effects are the same, but it can only be exploited by you or those instructed in its use by you. You are also automatically inoculated against any chemical or biological agents you may create. Authoritative Lab Coat (100CP) This white lab coat is somehow viewed as appropriate garb for a scientist, researcher, or doctor regardless of what else you are (or aren't) wearing or the situation. In addition, the more you know about medical, technical, or scientific matters compared to someone else, the more easily they will believe you when you cloak your arguments in such 'facts'. Ritual Checklist (100CP) If you write the requirements for a ritual or magical procedure in this blank book then an unseen hand will annotate the list to indicate which have been met. The book updates as though you were continually checking the status of that requirement, giving you notice if that 'virgin sacrifice' manages to disqualify herself, but is unable to discern information that you either could not yourself find out or would be oblivious to.

To be a Forger of Legacies is to be one who can craft such things, handing them down to others in the expectation that they will grow as they are used, then be handed down again, and again, and again. A Legacy can take any shape, such a sword, a staff, a cloak, or even a title. When a Legacy is made, the Forger instills in it one singular effect, attack, or technique at its most basic level, then passes it off to a Bearer. As long as the Bearer possesses the Legacy, they can use that ability, and that ability will grow and grow with usage and insight. Eventually, it will reach a point where it can grow no further (level 100 as Jee Han would say), and the Legacy should be passed on to another person. In doing so, the Old Bearer can either choose to instill a second ability (another effect, attack, or technique) into the Legacy, or to evolve the first ability. Unless the Legacy is specifically passed upwards, or there are no descendants, previous Bearers will be unable to use the Legacy. Each Legacy is typically dedicated to a unifying concept, such as a family, a nation, or an ideal. Should keep.

Through metaphysical means, this chip has now fully merged with your soul and became one with your being. These are two of its primary functions: Data Storage and Analysis. The A.I. Chip stores everything you experience through your senses and records it down, analyzing data, gathering samples, importing and organizing your memory, running any types of simulations based on that data. For example, using data from a target, the A.I. chip can simulate a path to victory against that enemy, the greater the data the easier it would be one example of a potential result would be fighting an opponent without taking any damage as well as analysing the probability of injury occurring. Estimate wind, trajectory and analysing orbital shooting, and A.R.(Augmented Reality) assist giving a nigh-100% chance to hit the target. With this chip Leylin was able to create potions as a master when he was just an Acolyte, optimise an ancient knight breathing technique, refine the bloodline of a Giant Kemoyin Serpent from it's descendents, a very pure bloodline equal to that of a first generation warlock, analyze different layers of the Weave allowing him to gain all spell models of each layer. The Chip can also scan, analyze and create spell models that would take others months in days and transfer it straight into your memory, simulating creation of your own spell models based on data analyzed. Scanning you and others and you will get the statistics such as Strength, Agility, Vitality, Spiritual Force, Magical Power, Current Status, Skills, Elements Affinity, Feats, Specialties. This is only an example, you can freely change how your stats are categorized, and what the number represents. If you have access to Mana, Qi, Ki, Chi, Aura, Psionic, Esoteric Energies and such, the A.I. Chip will recognize and establish records about it and for others in future worlds. The A.I. Chip is also able warn you against danger,when your stats changed, undesired status afflictions, act as a firewall for your mind, perform surgery on your body, expel poisons, formulate cures for curses, improve recipes, control your energies, detect energy undulations, assist in breakthroughs, can connect to and interact with both magical and scientific technology, get rid of abnormal status, scan down to the sub-atomic level and observe antimatter, controlling your clones, etc. The A.I. Chip's capabilities improve as you and your soul grow stronger, those mentioned here are just PART of what the chip is capable of. Your chip starts out with the processing power of 10 supercomputers, enough to turn 10 years of research into 2 hours. It comes with a maximum scanning range of 10km. Both the A.I. Chip and its scanning ability is undetectable by any means, though it has a difficulty scanning those immensely stronger than you, and some are even able to prevent you from scanning them. You automatically know how to use your A.I. Chip to the best of its abilities. While a regular chip can store 10,000 years worth of memories, yours has infinite memory storage and as the A.I. Chip is bonded to your soul, everything in its memory is directly accessible to you wherever you desire it to be. Include basic scientific knowledge of Leylin's old world. For an extra 200 CP, your A.I. Chip is upgraded to gain all the same features at the same level of power Leylin's was at at the end of the novel, to the point that it could simulate and analyse universes and Daos of reality, and know everything there is in this verse. You still can upgrade it with the ease of a regular one, just not as much gain until you reach Rank 9/Overgod level. The A.I. Chip does not have any intelligence of its own, but you can import an already existing A.I. into the chip.",

      "description": "-Covenanter (100CP) Choose one of four elements earth, fire, water, or wind. You can now make covenants with elemental spirits and beings that embody that specific element. In exchange for giving them energy through various rituals, the elementals you made the pact with will loyally serve you with the magical power, while also teaching you and strengthening you in their specialty of magic. Elementals often have a mind of their own, so even after you bond with them you'll need to find ways to cooperate with them best. While you can potentially bond with multiple elemental spirits, since each individual elemental uses some of your energy for the covenant, it may be difficult to keep a lot of covenants steady simultaneously. The elemental spirits you bond with can follow you between jumps, but you can only have four elemental spirits in active status at one time, with the others being kept in a hibernation/stasis state until switched out; even so, the inactive spirits still require a minimum degree of energy from you to stay around. Elementals released from your service will likely move to the nearest environment that embodies their element; in the case that they have followed you across worlds, they will have the option of either returning to their homeworld or choosing to stay in an environment in the current setting. You can only purchase this perk once; if you wish for more opportunities, see All are the Elements, Elements are All. -Elements Taking Shape (200CP) You can apply this perk to a specific element you interact with (must be the same element chosen for other Elemental Faith-discounted perks). By focusing your power into the element, it will begin to gain self-awareness and intelligence, and eventually a human form. If you are interacting with a personification of that element but it is not in human form, the perk will help it reach a humanoid form, and give it sapience if it didn't have it already. Said beings would therefore qualify for contracts under Covenanter. Moreover, the perk compels elementals you link your power with to treat you in a friendlier manner. -Spreading Nature's Heart (300CP) For a specific element (must be the same as that chosen for other Elemental Faith-discounted perks), you can apply your power to that element to help it expand its influence over the region you are in. Earth will create fertility for plant growth and encourage the growth of land. Fire will encourage warm things in the environment, from sunny days to hot springs, while also fueling the hearts of living things with fiery vigor. Water purifies water and protects it against stagnation and pollutants, while also multiplying the amount of water in existence. Wind naturally enhances the, well, wind, providing sufficient amounts of wind to carry the currents of life throughout the world while also tempering more violent aspects such as tornadoes and storms. Apply enough power over an extended duration to an area, and the elemental improvement will merge with the natural environment and become a permanent fixture of the region. Please note that while the element you choose must be the same as that you would choose for other Elemental Faith perks, you can still enhance that element even without any other Elemental Faith purchases. -All are the Elements, Elements are All (600CP) While specific practitioners focus on one element or another, the Elemental Faith has always given equal respect to all elements, and you are one of the lucky few who have mastered them all. You are no longer restricted to a single element for any of the other Elemental Faith-discounted perks, and instead you can apply your powers to all of the four elements. Furthermore, you can potentially apply your powers to other elements, whether scientific ones or metaphysical ones that embody the world around you. Plus, assuming you took Covenanter, you can now also make covenants with demi-elementals that only partially embody elements. In the case that you didn't purchase any of the other Elemental Faith-discounted perks, don't worry this perk will nevertheless significantly improve your affinity with all elements accessible in different worlds, making it easier for you to find, build and strengthen connections to those elements.",

You're a savant when it comes to making meals, not just limited to Eastern dishes either. With a little experimentation, you can make almost anything into a mouth watering feast for both the taste buds and the eyes. The real problem isn't making a good meal but keeping all these greedy pigs from eating you out of house and home. Don't even try making hamburgers around any blonde ladies, it never ends well. Now, while cooking good food is a prize well worth it, you do also have a more useful aspect here. By channeling magical energy into your tools and ingredients as you work, you're able to 'enchant' the meal with a variety of useful effects. A hearty beef stew that lets a warrior heal their wounds much faster than normal, sugary sweets that give people the speed of the wind, a mighty hamburger that temporarily bulges the muscles to greater heights. Even negative effects are possible, if you want to taint your food that way. They only last for a temporary period and the effects tend to be fairly weak without a lot of mana put in but it makes your food all the more popular."

Many techniques that were once burned away by She Who Lives in Her Name have been rediscovered. Foremost in these are the techniques to allow demons to build structures that do not need pillars, arches and other support structures. Buildings hundreds if not thousands of feet high can be built without any apparent load-bearing walls or struts. Windows and doors can be placed anywhere without disrupting the integrity of a building. Of course these techniques work best with the brass and black stone common to Malfeas, even if they work to a lesser extent with other materials. So it is just one more reason most buildings in Malfeas are made of brass and basalt, along with their abundant presence. Yet many more techniques are used by the artisans and architects of Malfeas, even aside from the omnipresent murals, wall carvings, and other ornamentations. Techniques to create such marvels as buildings that sprout from the ground at unnatural angles and made of polished brass turned a rainbow of colors by a process known only to the most skilled of architects. In many of these techniques you have gained the pinnacle of skill and knowledge, that you might replicate the Demon City's constructions even in other realms. While you might not have reliable access to the materials common to those in hell, you will be able to substitute many other materials for these in your structures. And as a truly talented architect you will find the design and construction of Manses comes just as easily to you, even gleaning some additional power from the conflux of essence it is build upon if you do use these hellish methods."

For some, it's an apparently ramshackle old house on a deserted lane, the windows all boarded over and the doors nailed shut. For others it's a disused factory in the industrial district, refitted with the latest steel security doors and electronic locks. Whatever form it takes, it serves one purpose: trammelling some unfortunate quarry into a confined space from which there is no escape. This Perk represents the ability and skill to construct a proper murder-castle. Utilizing this perk allows a Slasher to construct buildings and architecture with inbuilt and near invisible traps that serve to maim and prevent escape. Any normal living space can be converted to a deadly death maze with only a few weeks work. But when an individual with this perk constructs a new structure with the intention of making it into such a place of murder, this ability truly shines. Such a building is an impossibly deadly and nearly impossible to escape structure that would confuse even the most intelligent and crafty individuals. Go ahead and re-create H.H.

Purchasing this will even make you substantially better than other Exalted craftsmen, assuming you put in the same amount of effort that they did. Wonder Forging Genius (200CP)Your crafting abilities need to be seen to be believed. From your hands pour forth miracles given form, works of art of peerless and breathtaking magnificence, works of culinary delight that would leave Emperors sullen at the thought that no other foods could compare, weapons that could last hundreds of years of constant use that would leave men feeling honored to have been slain by them, all these and more take shape under the guidance of your hands.

You won't be master chef or an expert enchanter, but you don't really have to be either to create something useful. Novice (100CP) - By studying with a variety of craftsmen for a few weeks at a time, either due to an inability to focus or a desire to obtain a general knowledge base, you've cobbled together your own set of skills and have figured out how to combine items in odd ways. Sewing taught you how to make a doll, while alchemy allowed you to grind down a certain plant into magical dust. You by combining the two, you can create a Voodoo Doll that causes pain to the one you throw it at. This is, of course, just one example of what you might be able to come up with.

Hunter's Tools are pieces of equipment with special abilities activated by using Blood Bullets or Quicksilver Bullets as a medium. Hunter's Tools are usually supernatural items that have been made to work using a Blood/Quicksilver Bullet medium, such as the Beast Roar, a beast's claw that when activated, allows the wielder to roar like a beast. Some Hunter's Tools are completely man made as well, though this is a relative minority. Basically, you now know how to convert things into being activated and powered by Blood Bullets and Quicksilver Bullets. Doing so allows anyone to use them, even if they are completely mundane beings, so long as they have the bullets mentioned above on their person. When making Hunter's Tools, remember that the more power something requires, the bullets the wielder will need. These skills granted to you may be honed over time, just as any other skill can."

      "description": "When hunters were focused on tackling the mouse problem around Gnawnia, there wasn't much of a need for trap variety. The mice around Gnawnia are simple critters, and even a simple mallet trap would work against them. But then the problem was suppressed, and hunters began moving to different regions. This led to them encountering mice for which the traditional mousetrap was utterly ineffective, marking the beginning of an arms race with no apparent end. Whether you're working on a project for a friend or for personal use, this allows you to modify a very specific property, the power type. Seen as an elemental affinity of sorts, this property is key to making tools effective under a wide range of circumstances. The traditional Physical trap doesn't do all that well against ghostly entities, but Shadow traps tend to work well. Arcane traps excel against magical entities, but certain mice are too strategically minded that they specifically require Tactical traps in order to be bested. There are nine different power types which can be cycled through. Physical, Tactical, Shadow, Arcane, Hydro, Forgotten, Draconic, Parental, Law and Rift. Most of these are rather straightforward except for the extremely esoteric ones like Forgotten (intended for eldritch entities...like the Old One Mice), Law (intended for criminals and outlaws) and Parental (intended for effectively anything that isn't an adult). It's important to note that this modification is more akin to an addition rather than a replacement. Existing elemental affinities on the target item are unaffected by this. You could take what is potentially a Physical Trap and give it Arcane properties."

For you, painting is not merely a physical skill, but a magical one, as you can literally determine the color of things by painting them. Any change you make to a target’s color becomes its true, permanent color unless you use a new paint. The colors will also enhance certain traits and strengths of the subject depending on the symbolism; for instance, blue embodies depth and stability, while orange represents joy and excitement. And if the colors should belong on something else, it can become that thing; for instance, painting stripes on a horse makes it a zebra, and painting a dome brown or white could turn it into an earthy hill or an igloo respectively. This ability also allows you to change the seasons by painting leaves either green or orange; once you paint enough of them the same color, the world will conclude that it must be time for that season and change accordingly."

No matter how great, they do not remember the makers of armor or shields like they do artisans of the blade. On the level of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split magical steel and blades that don't shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much greater distance than just the physical blade. Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps. With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword."

They will learn at a rate equivalent to an Exalt so long as you personally teach them, even if they aren't an Exalt.

      "description": "Originality and uniqueness may certainly be the king of the high class art world but that's only when people can tell it's there. If not, a revision works just as well. Sublimation is the name of this capability you now have, which allows you to reproduce objects you have a chance to study and 'revise' them in the process, like stealing and rewriting a play. You'll need the desired item as a catalyst but this will let you slowly make copies of it, quality depending on the time and resources you invest into each one. A few hours is usually all it takes but already powerful items can take expensive, rare or dangerous to acquire materials to remake. More uniquely, your revision ability allows you to alter these catalysts. Again, basing the extent of the effect on time and resources, but you can certainly make a magical sword several times as powerful or add numerous new abilities to it, altering it's history or composition so that it always had those qualities. Perhaps a cart of raw materials from the local town square is all it'd take to take an ordinary iron blade and make it sharp enough to cut metal and alight in flame on command. But improving an already legendary blade like Durandal even moderately could take fortune's worth of materials that would already be difficult to attain, even for a king. There is not technically a limit on how far an object may be revised, though the cost of doing so will continue to grow greatly. Of course, selling your reproductions and revisions would certainly help build the fortune needed for something big."

Gungnir, Mjolnir, Gleipnir, these legendary objects and more are some of the things you could make, provided the time and resources were available. You are equally skilled at modifying already existing things too, finding it no different to add more onto an item than if you were making it from the ground up, even if it was already a complex mechanism. Lastly, all that you make carries a powerful dwarven curse that will afflict and harm any who use it without your permission, even those on a Divine level.

First, the user's creativity will be elevated to top even the greatest of artists, for the purpose of designing what he chooses to create. Second, a set of tools shall appear, perfect for whatever creation the user wanted to make. Third, the user shall gain temporary knowledge of magic to enchant, curse or bless his creation as he had envisioned. Be it buildings, songs, weapons, armor or the likes, even with the worst materials something that borders the divine can be made. Downsides: The user must have something he wants to make before calling the Authority. The materials are not provided for this. Depending on the creation, the time spent making it will vary. Once a project has been started, the Authority won't let another start until the first is done. Pandora's Child (600CP) Ah, the Campione, the unrivaled humans that managed the impossible: to slay a deity by themselves. They are Pandora's adopted children and the owners of a few advantages. Now, you're one of them too. As a Campione, you gain an all around stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn't have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay. Don't get too lazy because of this, I must warn you, many Campiones have fell after relying too much on their natural advantages, since there are ways to go around them."

The weapons and armor you create are reliable and easy to make, the kind used by Travelers and Soldiers all around Hyrule. Gimmick and Trick (200CP) Arrows are a vital resource, not in the least because they are simple and easy to adjust. With your help, the humble arrow can go from a projectile to a problem solver! You now know how to make the 'trick' arrows utilized in Hyrule, the elemental arrows of fire, lightning and ice as well as the explosive bomb arrows. If you wished, you could extend this tinkering habit to non-projectiles, allowing you to create gimmick weapons and tools similar to that created by Kilton, proprietor of the Fang and Bone. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, the quality of your crafted items is increased - allowing you to craft weapons of the quality of non-Hylian special weapons such as the Drillshaft or Gerudo Scimitar, or the quality of the weapons used by the Knights of Hyrule. Fire and Ice (400CP) The mark of a true journeyman of the trade, you have learned how to infuse elemental properties into the weapons you've forged, as well as create the entirely elemental weapons known as Rods. Though both of these require some 'infused' mystical energy to make, once forged anyone can wield them. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil and Gimmick and Trick, your crafting expertise is now such that you could create weapons worthy of the Royalty of Hyrule itself, granted to their guardians or rewarded to those who have shown great skill as a hero - yet nothing quite unique.

No, not the fact that the current Master married his teacher's only daughter and inherited his position in the guild. A True Master of his craft is person whose work is akin to art. Perhaps even the Art snobbish sorcerers like to call their magic, because when someone looks at what was made by your hand they cannot believe it is not magic. When someone thinks about your chosen profession your name is often found to be synonymous to it. Not surprisingly the rich and powerful will easily agree to outrageous prices to own what you make. This is what it is to be the Master, but there is more, for you are gifted with talent for organization. Your subordinates always perform to the best of their abilities and always remain very loyal to you. Your businesses don't suffer from misfortune, working like well-oiled mechanisms as long as their focus is on your craft. They need so little oversight that you can spend your time on other pursuits almost without worry for your business. Eventually every master will take an apprentice, or several, and you can fully teach them what you know about your chosen art, almost regardless of how inept they are. They may not be able to surpass you but your legacy will live on through them and their work, and the work of their students and beyond, forever immortalizing your name. Even if history may not remember your other deeds expect to become a folklore hero in the future. Oh, and good news to you who are Gnomes! You are now also a master metallurgist and have mastered the art of Gwyhyr blades, which are known to be among the greatest weapons ever forged on the continent, with each blade being a masterful work of art. Those unfortunate enough not to be Gnomish may also gain this understanding of their metallurgy and metalworks. Of the Elder Blood (500CP) It appears that you are an unaccounted for relative of Ciri, by way of Laura Dorren, being an active carrier of the Elder Blood, as it seems that you can travel in the local multiverse; from shifting through time and space to crossing through worlds like stepping through a door, though your control over your ability is rather crude and in dire need of training before it becomes useful. But be wary, refining such a gift is a dangerous process, for the worlds are filled not just with wonders but horrors as well - how else do you think the monsters that witchers hunt appeared, other than when the worlds collided long ago?"

Furthermore, you can use this magic to also fuse beasts to your body to gain their own special powers. However, since they are not a natural part of you, the beasts can resist the fusion, with the level of success depending on their willpower and intelligence; even after they fuse to you, their individual personalities will remain intact, and may lead to your mind shifting to their personas now and then. You can reverse the fusions at any point if you want to."

If you take this option Cobra-La will be placed in the Gi Joe setting you went to, and will be an issue at some point. Though probably in a similar vein to the movie, but might be a reoccurring friend/foe. If you join Gi Joe or a drop in and take this option, you are a traitor to your people and can expect a Spore bath if they catch you. If you are a member of Cobra, Cobra Commander takes much of the blame as he did in the movie, and you are not blamed for Cobra's failure. Though Globius might have a low opinion on you depending on how you acted. Cobra-la biotechnology: You leave Cobra-La with a fairly in depth knowledge of Cobra-La's biotechnology. Its not all comprehensive but will get better in time. As such you can make biological items, weapons, and vehicles equivalent to or surpassing their hard tech counterparts. You can also identify biotech and will have a good idea of how it works and what it does. This would also apply to other Jump's with biotechnology and means you can master those sciences easier. Even truly alien ones. By the time you leave the Jump you can even upgrade humans into bio-soldiers in much the same manner as Cobra-La can, and make truly impressive (also weird and bizarre) biotech."

This isn't just reactive evolution, though it is that - it's the brute-force computation of a billion tiny computers, a constant drive to exploit every advantage. While it's very slow, you may find yourself growing internal electroreceptors when your cells notice that most of the really dangerous things around you have EM signatures, or find your dietary preferences shifting to include metals and silicon to reinforce your bones and slowly hybridise into a truly biological robot. When you do actually struggle and fight and bleed, this process is sped up by an order of magnitude in the course of a single fight you might find your blood incorporating foaming clotting agents, or your eyes and visual cortex adapting to cyborg-speed combat. You can ultimately develop any biological ability you want, though whether you get it is based on your cleverness in providing the right evolutionary pressures - you might want a secondary heart and end up with none at all. Additionally, while results never really cease, they tend to plateau when you cannot actually challenge yourself meaningfully in life-or-death situations. Any other biological powers that you have benefit from this as well, constant tweaks and adaptations that may not be quite what you expect, but always fulfil a purpose."

      "description": "You possess the inherent understanding and skill with geomancy and the manipulation of natural energies such that you may now create manses in any area where such a thing could conceivably be created. The stronger the mystic or magical significance of a given place the more powerful the manse that can be built there, but even in the barest and most mystically barren areas you will still be capable of producing, given some time, a manse of the least (1-dot) power. The process of creating a Manse is tremendously faster for you than it would be for others, the necessary geomantic arrays and arrangements seeming to simply leap to your mind with a clarity of insight few if any could match. The Eight-Fold part of it is that you understand the methods for creating manses aspected towards all five of the elemental essences of fire, earth, wind, water, and wood as well as manses aspected towards solar, lunar, and stellar (sidereal) energies. Given time and effort you may discern methods for creating other types of manse, twisted mockeries of what nature intended, but such insights will take considerable effort, time, and resources to bear fruit. Taking this perk explicitly allows you to create manses even outside of Creation and, indeed, is the only way to create manses outside of Creation."

A way of sword smithing only a demon could manage, a brutal and unrefined method that results in a brutal and unrefined sword. But that sword is powerful, near unbreakable and holds the furious grudges of the Oni sacrificed to make it, giving the weapon a deadly cursed aura. This sort of feat is much more applicable to your skills now, as you find it far easier to turn your own innate abilities to the work of crafting things. A dragon's fire improves the quality of things forged in it, rather than just destroying the entire workshop. Cooling a forged sword in your own Youkai poison will still cool it as if with water but also imbue powerful toxins into the metal itself. You are able to add your abilities in creative ways to your creations without compromising them. Better still, you're very good at focusing what you create to not harm yourself. Using the bones of hundreds of hate-filled demons to create a cursed sword would direct those curses at your enemies, not at the original wielder of the sword.

They can run the gamut of all sorts of things, though there is no certainty people will be born with an ability they will actually be able to make use of. For example someone born with an innate talent for learning magic doesn't actually help them find a magic teacher, and thus some innate talents may go to waste. Thankfully for you you can choose what Innate Talent you have from the following list. You possess the unheard of ability to have more than one Innate Talent, assuming you purchase more than one. You're really, unnaturally, good at making magic items. If you know how to make something then you can make it magical. Spoons, bowls, armor, books, weapons, toasters, anything. You actually have to know some magic in order to enchant items with a magical effect, and you don't gain any skills in actually making items, so if you want to make magic swords you'll have to learn some magic and then how to make regular swords first. You can copy down into scrolls any spell you know, which others can use to learn those spells (if they are capable of using that magic system and put in the time to study) or use them as one-use magic items. Additionally any magic item you create will be marginally better than it would have otherwise been, regardless of whatever abilities you might have brought with you from other worlds. You don't have to have this talent to make magic items or spell scrolls, but someone that does have this talent will always be much better than someone that doesn't."

      "description": "Key of Artifice (200CP) Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifice, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. The Key of Artifice allows liches who practice it to form a sort of reserve of artifice energy inside themselves that they can invest into items to create various Arcane tools. The amount of energy they can invest grows with each rank, but is fixed. They must recover the invested Artifice energy if they want to reinvest it in a new item. Normally it's somewhat annoying to reclaim energy from an item you don't have control of, but because you bought it as a perk, you may freely reclaim it at any time. Actually investing Artifice energy requires enchantment work and spending three parts Arcane energy for every bit of Artifice invested. A lich gains the ability to make items in this order - Arcane Focus: An Arcane Focus can have a number of abilities depending on the amount of Artifice invested in it, and how those points are invested. Only the Lich who makes it can use it. It can store Arcane, though it's not as efficient as an Arcane Crystal. It can be made to regenerate Arcane on its own for a somewhat high cost in Artifice. It can be made into a tool that can hold spells for you. It can make your spells deal greater damage. It can make it easier to use Sorcerae. It can help maintain Arcana for you with a phantom mind. It can help protect you from the threat of insanity from overusing Arcana - though unless you take certain disadvantages, you're already protected. It can have any other reasonable power that is in line with these. Arcane Crystal: These crystals can hold Arcane Energy, and are easy to move energy into and out of. No other function, but they are more cost effective for the amount stored then a Focus. They're made from precious gems, with the more precious the gem, the better a focus it can make. A simple one is in the 10 gp range, while the greatest ones are crystals worth 500 gp. Since you purchased this perk, it's possible for you to potentially use exotic / rarer / more expensive gems, but such would require research on your part. Occularum: An Occularum is a kind of immaterial drone used as a spy or seeker. Appearing as inky globes of misty darkness about two feet across, their shape seems to hint at being a giant eye. They usually remain on the Spectral Plane, only called when needed. Even when called forth, they are immaterial presences, hiding in the folds between the Material and the Spectral plane. Made of the substance of thought and imagination, they can slip through the tiniest crack even in substances that can block the immaterial. They can't really be damaged, though they can be stopped by forces that guard against immaterial and extra-dimensional intrusions. While on the Material Plane, it will see into both the Material and Spectral planes at the same time. It can clearly see for a mile on the Material, though it has ten times the range of vision on the Spectral plane. It has all the same vision modes you have, and you can use any spell to detect or see things through it. They always have Darkvision, Arcane Sight, and Detect Magic active. Your Arcane rank determines how well they can perceive and notice things, with the higher your rank the better their perception, easily reaching into the superhuman range by the 2nd or 3rd rank. They fly at about twice the speed of a normal human running, with perfect mobility. They require a moderate amount of Arcane to create, and no investment of your Artifice potential. You can have a number of them in existence at the same time based on your Intelligence. You can call one down anywhere on the same plane of existence as you, though you need some way of targeting the landing, of which you know several methods. Finally they can follow simple instructions on their own, and can 'contact' you for clarification, or you can actively control them, and they're well suited to searches or as sentinels. Greater Phylactery: An Arcane Lich who has achieved the penultimate technique of Artifice can create a Bound Phylactery, a greater form of Phylactery. There are many advantages to a Greater Phylactery. The first advantage is that they are far tougher than a normal Phylactery. You are always aware of where it is, as long as it's on the same plane as you. If it isn't, you're aware of what plane it is on. You always know when it's been touched by another being, and when it's taken damage. You can spend a trivial amount of Arcane to see the area around your Phylactery, and maintain that vision as long as you concentrate. Your Phylactery can also store up to six motes of Arcane energy, and regenerates a single one each day. You must be able to touch it to draw on that Arcane. You may also set up to six spells upon your Phylactery to trigger on contingencies you define. If they activate dangerous damaging spells, your Phylactery won't be harmed. You can hang six spells inside your Phylactery to draw upon when you need them. You don't need to be touching it to draw upon them, but it does take a moment of concentration. Creating a Greater Phylactery ties up an entire Rank's worth of Artifice Points. Bound Phylactery: The most ambitious liches won't be satisfied with a 'mere' Greater Phylactery. A bound phylactery isn't an object, it's a place. A house on chicken legs, an undersea palace of impossible geometries, a mountain. It takes physical work through the entire structure to be bound, and an investment of resources directly proportional to the volume being bound, but there is no limit on size. In return, a Lich can bind themselves to something that isn't carried so much as lived within. Here are some common properties that show up in most Bound Phylacteries. * You can see from anywhere on or in it, as if you were standing there. * You can teleport to any part of it for a modest cost in Arcane. You can be perfectly accurate with the spell as long as the destination is within or on it. * You can cast spells through it, as if you were there. * You can manipulate space and dimensions inside and around it. * You can make it shift and cause parts of it to move. If it's built correctly, you can make it walk la Baba Yaga's hut or Howl's Moving Castle. * You know everyone who is in contact with it, and where they are. * It regenerates at 5% of its total 'health' per day if damaged, and you can speed it up massively by meditating on making it fix itself. Bound Phylacteries are grand works of Artifice, and they tend to have unique properties in addition to these. It binds two whole ranks worth of Artifice points to make a Bound Phylactery. In addition to those more permanent constructions, Liches with the Arcana of Artifice also learn the technique of Arcane Enhancement. This essentially lets the lich turn prepared objects into enchanted objects with a temporary enhancement based on your Arcane State. As you bought this as a perk, you can always treat it as the final Arcane state (Spectral Lich), for an enhancement bonus of six on the item. You don't have to use the full bonus, as the higher bonus you use the more expensive in Arcane it gets. Such tools are Arcane weapons or armor. The Arcane Trait makes them especially good against the forces of the Void. In future worlds, it will work against forces of unmaking, oblivion, and the like, as well as undead in general. Weapons with the Arcane trait ignore defenses and immunities. Armor is stronger and helps you resist magical attacks. Other items are harder for forces of the void to resist. Who knows what incredible things you'll to make as your mastery of Artifice continues to grow? Grand Artificer (100CP) While every artificer will continue to grow in the amount of Artifice they can keep invested, your growth is doubled here. More than that, you find you can permanently empower things, freeing you from having to maintain an ongoing investment. It takes a fifty-to-one ratio of Arcane to Artifice to replace the Artifice investment, and you can't empower something beyond your theoretical maximum Artifice - how much you could invest if all of it was available for you to use at one time. Using this, it's possible to make Arcane Foci that other people can use. As long as all the investment is permanent investment paid in Arcane, then you can set criteria for who or what can use it. Note that there aren't a lot of limits on what an Arcane Foci can do. You can also make an Arcane Enhancement permanent. It requires ten times as much Arcane to make it permanent as temporary. Such enhancement overlaps with standard enchantment, but does count as the required '+1' needed before other special abilities might be added, and an item so enhanced is considered an Arcane Enchantment for the purposes of ignoring anti-magic and spells. Yes, you can make an item a permanent Arcana Foci with interesting abilities, make it permanently Arcane Enhanced, and then enchant it. Something like that is basically a minor artifact though, and represents a huge investment of time and effort, without other perks."

Golems are a common tool for the Liches of the Guild of Wizards. The greatest are the semi-real Artifex Golems of the Order of Artifex, but making them is hardly limited to just those master craftsman. The common Arcane Golem is created from a Heart. These Golem Hearts are crafted from precious stones and metals, growing increasingly grand for more impressive Golem Hearts, and then they're empowered with an investment of energy. A lich may temporarily invest part of their Permanent Arcane, tying it up in the empowerment of the heart. They can reclaim that investment at any time, but the heart will break and must be crafted anew. Alternatively, if the Lich also practices the Arcana of Artifice, they may instead invest Artifice into empowering a Heart. A lich may only have a limited number of hearts in existence at once, restricted by the height of their Intelligence. Once empowered, a golem heart is very similar to a Occularum, though unlike those devices it has no sense of its own. Instead, it can bind its now immaterial essence to a piece of the world, and reshape that piece into a Golem. Such crude golems might be relatively weak on their own, but can channel a shadow of their makers might and skill. If destroyed, the Heart is dissipated from reality into potentiality for a time, but will reform after a day. It's also possible to build prepared vessels for the Golem Heart. Such vessels are far stronger than an ad-hoc animation, and the destruction of such a vessel will not dissipate the Golem Heart, letting it jump to a new vessel immediately. That strength though comes at the cost of, well, cost. Resources and time and effort to craft such. A Crystal Golem for example may be a juggernaut, but it's also a ten foot tall statue made of diamond and platinum. Making it costs. Obviously you are not limited to just Crystal Golems, and can use other materials you have access to, with more powerful and exotic materials tending to result in more powerful and exotic golems. With effort even things like the mighty and near indestructible Adamantium Golem may be in your reach. You may see out of the eyes of your Golems (or roughly where their head is, should they not have eyes), and project your mind into them to control them directly. They can obey simple orders and routines, and make fine guards and wardens, if unimaginative ones. Unliving Soldiers (100CP) Your Golem Hearts aren't LIKE Occularum. They are an extra set of Occularum, with all the abilities of one. Even when invested in matter, the Occularum part keeps watch around its golem, seeing and spying. They also gain real, if unimaginative, intelligence. They're as smart as a somewhat dumb mortal, but they're perfectly logical and throurogh, and they feel no emotions that would make them perform badly. In the end, they're surprisingly good at working around their limitations. They also reform in only six hours, and they're better at animating their bodies than normal golem hearts. They might have the same basic attributes, but their reflexes and skill at using those attributes is improved. Occularum abilities are described in the Key Of Artifice perk. Should you also possess the upgraded Key Of Artifice perk you may make these Occularum Golem Hearts without a permanent investiture of Arcane or Artifice energy, though it does still require an expenditure of such energies during the initial creation."

You're also pretty good at forging and upgrading normal weapons and armor. There is more to this craft than you would first think, as Smiths in this world are capable of several unique acts. In this land, smiths can use special stones to imbue weapons with various types of power, such as Fire or Lightning, during the forging process. Given enough time and practice, they can even forge powerful souls into their handiwork to create unique and often times powerful equipment. While this skill doesn't make you the best in the world at this craft, it gives you a solid foundation with room to improve."

      "description": "Deplorable Forge of Tormented Souls (200CP) Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. While the willingness to do so must come from yourself, almost everything else can be bought right here, providing you with equipment and inexhaustible supplies of the raw materials ones need to forge a soul into steel. Full usage of the craft requires artifacts to forge the metal, a hammer and anvil composed of soulsteel or jade (whichever you prefer) to hammer the molten ghost-alloys into shape, another artifact known as an Essence-forge to melt down the unfortunate ghost's corpus and other materials, soulfire crystals replete with essence to stoke the forge, and black ores taken from the Labyrinth to grant it the ghastly, magical strength of soulsteel. Even the alchemical agents, wrought from the Labyrinth, which are needed to create the rarefied void-coated plates of Oblivion's Panoply are in refilling supplies amongst these, should you have need of them. With this, the only thing you would still require for your dread craft is a supply of souls to feed your forge. Hammer Upon the Wailing Muse (200CP) Much of the Underworld's economy rests on the production of soulsteel, one of the magical materials, which can only be produced by combining shavings from the walls of the Mouth of Oblivion with the melted corpus of a ghost. Forging soulsteel is difficult for even the best smiths. Soulforging is the process by which the souls of the dead are melted down and then shaped into useful items or are used to produce soulsteel. First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking. Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith's hammer. Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords. Though you would need to delve deep into necromancy to put the latter into actual practice."

With enough practice, you could even include aspects of the world of dreams in your dimensions."

When you give away part of your body willingly, the part so removed becomes akin to a magic item, holding supernatural abilities appropriate to the relevant part and your own wishes at the time of creation. Perhaps a cut of your mane large enough to use as a cloak could grant another your durability, or a scale from your legs could be used to grant them your speed. Of course, having more esoteric abilities will let you grant more esoteric effects. A fang capable of shattering enemy spells, or perhaps a claw capable of shooting beams of force when wielded like a sword? I won't presume to know everything you're capable of. Still, these items can't last forever, and every use of them will bring them closer to the breaking point. Equipping someone before they go on a monthslong journey is well within the cards, but I would not hope to stockpile these if I were you. The lingering will left inside those magic items will also make sure they can not be used in ways you'd disapprove of, as well."

      "description": "Mo Weapon Master (200CP) The way the Mo forge their weapons is unique from how Xiuzhe create their talismans. Through the process of forging already high class materials the Mo forging method focuses far less on creating a weapon with specific new traits, and focuses far more on emphasising and enhancing the properties which already exist in the materials by forging them in the deep cold flowing waters of the Mo Forging Pools. You are now a master Mo Weaponsmith, able to look at a pile of materials and bring out the absolute best of what they could be, enhancing the traits they would naturally have if you forged them. A dagger forged from a beast which breathed fire will have a fiery aura, or even possibly burn upon touch of the blade, while more complex things such as a sword made from the tongue of a rotten undead carp soaked in the water of a necrotic realm may be able to cause things in a small area to decompose. Through hard work and study you can do much with this art, and should you have other means of forging or creating weapons the results will only grow more impressive. Also comes with the knowledge of how to create a Mo Weapon Forging Pool. Holy Mo Forging Pool (300CP) The Underground Nether River is silent, it is 60 feet wide and spectacular to see. The river water of the Underground Nether River is as sticky as glue, is black yet clear, and flows without making a sound. The water in this river is extremely suitable for the creation of Mo Weapons, by placing a part of yourself or another creature as well as a weapon into the waters you can guide them to merge and create a Mo Weapon, a weapon connected to you much like a talisman or a flying sword, though often times more powerful, not because of superior forging techniques but because of the superior materials conglomerating to create a weapon. The pool has the special property to not only work well for forging Mo Weapons it also has the effect of combining multiple weapons or items into one, as Xiao Mo Ge did with his Sky Snake Ten Transformations Pike. Doing this imbues all the powers of the items into one while allowing them to shift between the forms of up to ten of the items used in its creation. For example the Sky Snake Ten Transformations Pike was a powerful Earth Mo Weapon created, but its real power came from its ability to shift into ten different weapons in an instant. Now you can create something similar. When used to forge with the parts of a creature it forges a better weapon depending on how strong the creature was and has minor affinities based on the creature and part used. For instance using the claw of a fire dragon will probably create a fire attributed Mo Weapon ranging between a dagger and a sword (considering how big the claw is). Though weapons created will be much more impressive if you have some training in forging already After the jump it can become a warehouse attachment should you wish it."

You develop phantom ink and oil stains on your skin, if you still have skin. At the end of the Jump, these effects will become a template you may apply or remove as you wish. But that's just your body, the thing you probably care the least about. You are of the Artifex, the great Craftsman of the Guild of Wizards. The true mark isn't on your body, but the body that you make, your Artifex golem. But that’s just your body, the thing you probably care the least about. You are of the Artifex, the great Craftsman of the Guild of Wizards. The true mark isn’t on your body, but the body that you make, your Artifex golem. Artifex Golem: An Artifex golem is crafted from a ripped free fragment of your intellect, will, and force of personality, damaging you when it’s first created, though this damage will heal over time. It also requires an investment of the same while you manifest it, though that cost is covered by you buying this perk. An Artifex Golem’s advancement is normally linked to your Arcane State, but yours grows independent of that. A new Artifex Lich normally creates a Golem slightly weaker than a Flesh Golem, while a Spectral Lich creates something the equal of an Anaxim. Artifex golems, being made of thought rather than matter can be summoned and dismissed with a thought, but can only exist near you. Normally this would be limited by your Arcane State, but as you paid for this, you have the maximum range, like a Spectral Lich. You can manifest or send your Golem up to 200 yards away. Your Artifex golem shares your resistances to damage. You may transfer health to and from your Golem. You may also meditate to heal your golem at a decent rate. All Artifex Liches excel at crafts, just being better at them then they should be. You also receive half again as much Artifice as another lich. You are also slightly better at Sorcerae that conjures or creates things. Lastly, you gain the Arcana of Artifex. You gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifex, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. Artifex allows you to enhance your projected Artifex Golem, giving it the essence of different materials to further strengthen it. Magically pure examples of that element are invested in the golem, which are expensive to acquire and can normally only be purchased in Kethak, though nothing stops you from sourcing your own should you have other methods, or experimenting with more exotic materials. The possible enhancements are ● Quartz for Strength ● Granite for Armor ● Mercury for Dexterity ● Platinum to grant it fast healing. ● Diamond to make it tougher and able to take more damage ● Sapphire to give it a freezing aura and make its strikes bite with cold. Incompatible with Ruby. ● Ruby to give it a burning aura and make its strikes burn with flame. Incompatible with Sapphire. ● Adamantine to make it resist all damage from lesser sources. While the initial enhancement is small, it can be grown by binding a piece of mind and intellect to further grow that enhancement, with a greater binding allowing for more enhancement, capped by the lich’s normal intelligence. It can be enhanced further with Arcane energy, capped by the lich’s rank of accomplishment in the Arcana of Artifex. Finally, since it’s made of thought, you can basically have it manifest looking however you might want it to look, and since it is (very) technically a form of summon after being made, any abilities you have that enhance summons will also work on it. Useless! (100CP) You find that your Artifex Golem is greater than others of its kind. Even when manifested, it is corporeal or incorporeal as would be most advantageous at that moment. A telekinetic barrier of intent deflects away harm, greatly armoring it based on your intelligence. You also find that you don't need to invest mind and intellect to empower it through the Arcana of Artifex - the fragment of mind you've invested to create it will maintain its own enhancements. You may still further enhance it by pouring in Arcana, to push it to the absolute limit. If your golem is destroyed, you can quickly rebuild it, and the personal cost is lessened, so that it takes only hours to recover from creating your Golem.

A song containing civilization would only be able to get across the most important ideas with very little nuance, a sword containing a storm would strike with the force of a single thunderbolt rather than the thousands within the true storm, being struck by a shield containing Greece would be like being hit by a mountain rather than a country. It would take incredibly intense effort to create anything containing a microcosm more powerful or complex then Greece."

To that effect, most of the magically inclined make money by selling alchemical solutions and other plant-based compounds. Your knowledge of alchemy and herbalism lets you craft everything from common medicines to potent poisons. While not as powerful as purpose-built magic, these natural alternatives are the preferred purchases for all but the wealthiest of patrons. Any village would welcome an alchemist like you. Artificer (400CP) Of course, plenty of people will pay serious coin for self-contained magic. You now have the skill to build magical artifacts and constructs. These items can replicate any spell you are capable of casting, so long as they are supplied with sufficient mana. More powerful artifacts will require more expensive materials and longer construction times, but the demand for reliable, consistent spellworks exists in every community on Mekkan. Whether you make these devices for yourself or for others, your devices are only limited by your access to materials and arcane knowledge. If you have the Natural Remedies perk, you may now brew potions that confer spell effects. Whether you bottle an Invisibility spell or cook up a cauldron of Cat's Grace, your spells now come in a convenient liquid package."

You can invent, develop, and introduce an item that can reproduce just about any magical effect you are personally capable of. While your initial prototypes might only just work, and not terribly well, you'll always be able to continually improve on your designs, with no particular ceiling in what you can manage beyond the time you're willing to invest and dedicate towards improvement. Furthermore, the rate at which you make improvements, and just design and build such artifacts in the first place, is tremendously enhanced, far beyond what other individuals that fancy themselves artificers could manage. Where the creation of magical items for the average practitioner is a long involved process requiring careful and painstaking effort, you are practically the equivalent of a one (wo)man production line. Finally, you may substitute pure magical energy for all but the rarest materials required during the creation process of your artifacts, though at an extremely unfavorable cost ratio until you dedicate significant time and effort towards refining this ability."

      "source": "Overlord - The Series",
      "chapter": "Domain: Crafting: Magical Items",
      "description": "Crafting Classes (200CP) You now possess classes and abilities aspected towards and in the service of creating a specific type of craft or trade good, and will be able to easily come up with new recipes or innovations for the crafts you select. Examples include cooking, smithing, scroll making, jewelry crafting, and so forth. For 50 cp you may choose one specific type of craft, however for 200cp you may instead have crafting abilities that are equally applicable to every possible crafting pursuit. Examples include food and drinks that give low level buffs when eaten, low end (but still serviceable) magical weapons, armors, and misc magic items, and so forth. The sort of equipment that would be considered useful and practical enough (in terms of use and cost) for even a more experienced adventurer to eye them appreciatively and think them a worthy addition to their arsenal. In the Realm of Heroes however you could make items that would be considered national treasures by the locals, things like swords so sharp that they could hit 'above their level' such as damaging someone that would normally ignore them (for example, bypassing the high-tier physical nullification of a level 100), rings of potent regeneration and stamina recovery, masterwork armor that even a hero would be honored to wear, food and drink that could potentially heal a man of injury instantly or empower him to staggering heights (temporarily at least), and so forth. At Level One Hundred however your crafting skills have hit their zenith. At this point you could make items on par with Divine Tier equipment, things even beings of godlike strength would find no complaint in, or foods and drinks so nourishing that someone might not need to eat or drink for a month or more afterwards, and conveying extremely potent temporary buffs alongside that. However, of course, no matter what your level of skill one simple fact remains; your skills are largely worthless without materials to use them with. While you might be able to take even subpar ingredients and fashion something workable only with truly excellent materials will you be able to craft something genuinely great, especially at the highest levels of crafting. Realm of Heroes (300CP) You have stepped into a realm that only the greatest that have ever lived can truthfully claim to be a part of. If you are a Warrior you could potentially cut down an army of a thousand regular men all by yourself, and would be capable of feats of skill and martial prowess that would leave regular folk in stunned awe of your capabilities, and have them whispering that maybe you aren't a mortal at all. If you are a Magic Caster you are capable of spells up to the sixth tier, believed to be the highest tier of magic that a mortal could possibly ever achieve. Spells of the sixth tier can perform things that would be miraculous to the common folk, such as resurrecting the dead, teleporting over unbelievable distances without error, summoning forth powerful creatures as servitors, or potentially casting spells that would let you defeat upwards of a hundred men with no more than a few words and gestures. If you are a Generalist your luck, wit, cunning, and skill are so profound that you have an answer for virtually every situation, and while your combat prowess won't be as great as a warrior of the same level, and your magic won't be as good as a magic caster of the same level, you'll far outstrip anyone that isn't in the realm of heroes in those abilities. Level 100 (600CP) You've hit the pinnacle. There is no higher level, not within YGGDRASIL at least. As a Player you have hit level 100, not exactly a surprise since most Players had done that, and represent the absolute peak of personal power and ability. If you're a Local then you're quite frankly a freak of nature and are probably seen as a god by any other locals that actually know what you're really capable of. Literally, by the way, the Slane Theocracy actually worships as gods a group of six level one hundred Players that appeared to them in the past, though virtually no one still alive outside the highest echelons of the Theocracy itself actually knows that. All level one hundred individuals possess high-tier nullification defensive abilities. This means that individuals won't be able to even hurt you that aren't, at the very least, within the fabled 'Realm of Heroes' and even then they'd have to be a hero among heroes to manage it, and they'd still have to get past your normal defenses even if they manage that much. The only hope they'd normally have is if they possessed access to some magical artifact of sufficient power to get past your defenses. That said the high-tier nullification is an all or nothing ability, either it works or it doesn't. Your physical and magical statistics are absolutely mind boggling as far as the locals are concerned. Even magic casters, if they're level one hundred, will possess physical strength and defenses on par with a warrior that is 'only' in the 'Realm of Heroes', and warriors can expect to be far far beyond even that. Magic casters actual magic power is enough that it could literally bring even the greatest human archmage to his knees in awe and shame at his own weakness, were he to actually witness your true strength. Even warriors that only dabbled in magic would still be on par with magic casters in the 'Realm of Heroes' at the very least. The abilities of a Generalist, both physical and magical, will outstrip everyone other than their level 100 peers by a tremendous degree. As a warrior you are capable of annihilating armies of tens of thousands of regular men on your own, and likely wouldn't even notice them. It would take legendary heroes or beasts to actually make you break your stride. You'll possess skills that will let you nullify certain damage types outright, perform swings of your weapon that can hit dozens of individuals at once with air pressure alone, and provide you with a myriad of defenses against magic casters that would seek to stymie you and prevent you from closing the distance. You are literally a one-man army killing machine. As a Warrior you additionally possess 'super moves' that can do things like grant temporary invulnerability to virtually anything, allow you to strike everything in your line of sight with a single powerful blow at the same time, or hit one opponent dozens of times with a single strike. As a magic caster you are capable of casting spells of every tier up to the 10th Tier. This is a tier of magic that only a bare handful of people in the entire world even know exists, with most believing that 7th tier is as high as it goes. 10th Tier magic is the stuff of legends, capable of healing armies or slaying them, resurrecting the dead en mass, permanent teleportation circles, 'buffing' or 'debuffing' entire armies, summoning forth creatures of legend as servitors, and so forth. As a Magic Caster you'll also be capable of 'Over-rank Magic', also known as Super-tier magic, that exceeds even that. Singular spells that could slay 70,000 men in one go and then also summon massively powerful eldritch nightmares under your command at the same time, destroying entire cities with rain that infects those it falls upon with an undead plague, conjuring forth miles upon miles of enchanted forest that responds to your will and will empower you while you are within, or spells of similar such scale and effect. Unlike normal spells 'over-rank' spells don't actually cost mana and are more akin to skills, they always have a long casting time, usually a minute or so, and you must stand still and can not do anything else while casting them. Additionally you can only use them a few times per day. If you are a Generalist there really isn't a question of 'can you do something' so much as 'how do you do it today, and will you do it differently tomorrow'. You're not quite on the same tier of skill as the warrior at combat, or the magic caster at magic, but you're just below both of them. Magic of the 9th tier is yours to command, and while you're not the combat beast a warrior could be you find that your command of both the physical and magical aspects give you a range of utility and versatility no one else could boast. As a Generalist you don't benefit from super moves or over-rank magic but in compensation your statistics are significantly better overall in the areas where the other origins would be weak. You do have one area however where you particularly shine. You are blisteringly fast. You could run circles around the warrior even if you couldn't beat him at swordplay, and you can certainly close the distance (or run away) from a magic caster in the blink of an eye. You've also picked up a penchant for sneak attacks, and opponents that don't see you coming rarely get the opportunity to learn from that mistake."

Through this connection, Ruin can manipulate the beneficiaries of Hemalurgy towards his own destructive ends. With this perk, you gain the tiniest sliver of Ruin's power just enough to fuel your own Hemalurgy without Ruin's help. Hemalurgic spikes you create have no connection to Ruin, and their users cannot be controlled by him or by emotional Allomancy. You can also make Hemalurgic spikes outside of this Jump. This does not confer any knowledge or ability with Hemalurgy you'll either have to take another perk, or find someone who can teach you. Unfortunately, the only people who can teach you are more likely to kill you instead. A Messy Process (200CP) You have a basic knowledge of Hemalurgy. You know which metals steal which attributes, if you didn't already. More importantly, you have a basic knowledge of the bind points on a human body, and you have a superhumanly steady hand when preparing to drive sharp metal objects into someone's body, even your own. In addition to some minor combat benefits, you can safely use place a hemalurgic spike into somebody's body in the exact right location to avoid injuring them and allowing them to draw on its power. However, the ability to twist humans into nonhuman forms or to implant hemalurgic spikes into nonhumans is beyond you. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane. Preservation of Ruin (400CP) You can now charge a Hemalurgic spike without killing the victim. So long as the metal touches their still coursing blood, energy will be drained from the victim to charge the spike, leaving them alive. A spike made in this fashion will be slightly less powerful, but will last longer outside a human body. A victim drained by this ability will become noticeably paler, and their personality will shift to become slightly more dour and less energetic. If the drained attribute is a supernatural ability, it is removed entirely if it is a natural ability such as strength, it is radically weakened. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane. Hemalurgic Genius (600CP) You are a genius in the art of Hemalurgy. You have the knowledge to twist a humans form into a variety of shapes with Hemalurgy, creating entirely new creatures formed from the hemalurgic charge in the spike and the recipient's own soul. This process usually requires multiple spikes, and twisting a human too far from their natural form can destroy their mind. The more a person is twisted in this fashion, the more powerful the charge in their spikes becomes, enhancing whatever abilities they gain from it. You also gain the ability to find the bind points in any nonhuman creature. Creatures that are largely humanoid only take a few minutes of visual inspection animals can take hours of intensive study. Sufficiently bizarre creatures may require days or weeks, and you may need to perform vivisection or other intrusive and indepth analysis in order fully map the creature's bind points. As a side benefit, hemalurgic spikes you make are more efficient, storing greater chargers and degrading slower than normal. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane. Furthermore, attempting to use this ability without A Messy Process results in having very little control over the exact mutations your subject manifests. You know which bind points trigger mutation, but without the knowledge of which bind point does what you're largely striking blind. Experimentation can teach you, of course."

If it's not something you yourself can do, you might need some assistance or 'assistance' from someone or something which can, but as long as you have that and understand the base principles, you're good to go."

With time, effort, and study, it would not be unusual to see you creating technomagical wonders on par with the atomic bomb, or even greater things still such as the Root of Life, a material capable of healing any injury and even creating entirely new bodies by connecting not to the body, but the soul. This and far more fantastical creations will one day be at your fingertips."

Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you've taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset. First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it's something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it. The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you'd be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection. But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there's no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create."

      "description": "In essence, magitek is simply the use of magical energies as a power and fuel source for technology. Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own. By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source. From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers. Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully. There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly. Unfortunately, this can have dangerous side effects, as giving them too much to handle at once can lead to mental instability or even insanity, the severity rapidly scaling upwards the more initial energy put in."

If you created and spread around the world the secret of electricity, which revolutionised the entire world, you would then be able to create electrical devices that allowed you to do battle with even some of the mightiest Servants in history.

And now you are one of them. But not just a normal one, oh no. Your talent with Technomancy can rightfully be said to be quite monstrous. Whether it is commanding machines to do your bidding with just a thought, probing devices with your magic to discover their functions and any possible flaws, or disassembling and reassembling them, you can do it all with contemptuous ease. If you trained a bit, you could of course also create your own technology to use, entirely through magic, as long as you have any necessary materials before you. Another interesting ability of Technomancy is its function to let you interface with technology and use yourself as a medium for information to be displayed. So if you, for example, wrote a program to let something pass through your Aura, such as the hologram function of your companion bracelet, you could simply use Technomancy to establish a connection with the bracelet and yourself. But your biggest talent lies in the replication of implants and other technological marvels within yourself and others. You could for example quite easily copy the aura of a camera and adapt your eye to mirror it, or do the same to the auras of memory banks and computers to enhance your brain. With your skill, you don't even have to worry about overloading your puny biological body by using technology that is too advanced. Beyond that, what you can do is up to you. After all, the potential of magic is only limited by its users ability, creativity, and skill. Though I'm sure that with your potential, you'll manage to go quite far in the rat race of life. Concerning technology at least, social skills are not included in this package."

You are an absolute master of the art of Techno-Magic. Making machines that run on magic, or just magical equivalents of Muggle technology, or something as simple as just making muggle devices work in magical environments is all child's play for you. You can translate flawlessly between technology and magic, meaning that you can make technological equivalents to all magic you know and magical equivalents to all technology you can make without losing so much as an iota of effectiveness. Merlin Returned Boosted - While being good at merging magic and technology is pretty good, being able to merge wildly futuristic technology with highly advanced magic is better. Not only are you highly skilled at magic, but you're now just as good at the technology side of it, being a certifiable genius among geniuses. Your merged devices now run far superior to either the magic or the tech would run alone, providing dramatically higher effectiveness and utility. In addition, your skills with the more 'technical' branches of magic, such as Arithmancy and such cross all imagined levels. Finally, you can achieve even things normally believed impossible through combining spells and technology. You can dispense with the more symbolic and ritualistic components of any and all magic you do, making it entirely as reproducible as technology. Merlin Returned (600CP) (Capstone Booster) There were ancient tales of your coming, Jumper. Actually, wait, no. There weren't. But there should have been. You were born to greatness, and this reflects in everything you do. Magic is second nature to you. While you don't get any skill or knowledge innate with this perk, nor any gifts or talents that pass down bloodlines or through rituals, you now have limitless talent in every single branch of magic apart from these limitations. Besides that, you are a genius at learning magic too, mastering years' worth of material in days and weeks without even stressing yourself. This growth continues indefinitely, never slowing no matter what. Your grasp of magic and its theoretical framework is such that you can manipulate the very nature of it, and do so with an almost contemptuous ease. You can take apart spells, rituals or even entire magic systems, and put them back together in whatever different arrangement you like, even in entirely new magic systems of your own. Even altering spells in real time is second nature to you, changing their effects, size, scope, everything. As is coming up with entirely new pieces of magic, with due research and innovation. Finally, to fuel all this, your 'Magical Core', per se, is proportionately vast. You have a humongous amount of magic at your fingertips, stretching far and beyond any known metrics well into the realm of legends like Merlin and the Founders. This perk follows you in the future too, providing you all of these effects in any and all magic you become able to do. This perk is a capstone booster, meaning that it serves to enhance each of the origin capstones in their own ways. The interactions are mentioned alongside the respective perks."

The larger and more powerful the construct, the longer it takes to create. Your constructs are capable of what limited independent thought and action might be necessary to carry out relatively simple orders. This style of creating magical constructs is light on crafting and heavy on magic. Golem Crafting SP: Your connection to your magical creations is especially strong, which has allowed you to figure out how to summon any of them to your side with a few words and a gesture, no matter where they might be. Machine Crafting (400CP) Golem crafters make enchanted mobile sculptures. You consider this crude and inefficient. You know that by carefully designing and assembling all the moving parts, you can make things that require far less magic to power them. Not only are your creations more energy efficient, they are also faster, more versatile, able to follow more complex commands... And less durable. The unfortunate downside of building complex machines is that tiny moving parts are easier to break than carved blocks of stone. This style of creating magical constructs is heavy on crafting and light on magic. Machine Crafting SP: You have figured out space compression enchantments that allow your creations to have more stored within them than they should be able to hold. This allows you to pack them full of tools, weapons, extra cargo space, or mess with their designs in imaginative ways. Stupidly Powerful (600CP) You are an exceptional example of your origin, both mightier and more impressive than the ordinary. You gain enhanced versions of every perk you buy that is free or discounted for your origin. These enhancements are marked SP in each perk description. Unfortunately this also means that you draw a lot of attention to yourself, and are an interesting topic of conversation. You gain the Light Speed Gossip drawback for +0cp. 17 (0CP) Your maturity grants you insight and focus, allowing you to craft constructs that are far more powerful than before in a fraction of the time that it used to take you to build your old weaker ones."

You are able to make equipment with special traits and great power to aid the one who wields and wears them. What the gear is able to do and how strong it is is dependent on your skill, the processes used, and the reagents that go into their creation - for example, if you wanted to make a flaming sword, you would need a source of magical or conceptual fire to infuse into the blade. With sufficient time and skill the stuff you make can decide the fate of nations, planets, and even entire dimensions. Furthermore the arms and armor you can create are nearly half-again as powerful as they would otherwise be, given similar materials, time, and effort in their creation."

On the level of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split magical steel and blades that don't shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much greater distance than just the physical blade. Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps. With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword."

It's real value however, is the smithy itself.

Your craftsmanship is nothing less than perfection and your opportunity to grow is great as well.

Ahzidal's Apprentice (400CP) The art of spellcasting has more to it than just flinging fireballs and screaming about UNLIMITED POWER as one electrocutes their enemies. The arts of Enchantment and Alteration stand as testaments to this fact, enchantment in particular stands as a powerful, yet indirect system of magic and when it comes to this branch and the operation of it only the Dragon Priest Ahzidal is your equal. Like him you've collected vast knowledge pertaining to the various magical bases of the Mer, whether it be the ancient runes of the Ayleids or the process of harmonizing the seven natures of metal. This craft extends far and wide and with it even a mere band of 500 warriors could be given equipment powerful enough to fell a powerful race of spellcasters like the Falmer, or in other, more simple words your enchantments are legendary. You could perhaps go even further, runes are simply another language, and if understanding them allows you to use them, then perhaps even others like that of the Dovah might be as well. This is lore based Daedric artifacts which includes shit like instant kill weapons or key that can conceptually unlock anything. Or a sword that stole power from a daedra and flew a floating city of soul warriors into mundus. Pretty much all major Daedric artifacts are conceptual even if they are nerfed for the game."

While the shielding and mobility systems that carry these devices into battle are relatively simple to create, you understand the intricacies of how physics and performance are affected by up-sizing technology. With sufficient data on the function of a humble lasgun or arc rifle to extrapolate from, you could smoothly transition that device to function when a hundred or more times larger - and to be appropriately more powerful than the simple multiplication of its output would suggest. The weapons you create and oversee are fit for a god-machine to wield, and the likes of Nova Cannons and weapons arrays on board the largest ships of the Mechanicus are also within your purview."

You are something never seen before; a genuine omni-Tinker, and one of truly amazing capacity. Your aptitude and intuition for all sorts of research, science, engineering, and design is absolutely unbelievable. If a project is even halfway related to any of the hard sciences then you can get it done, and do so with a speed and efficiency that makes even experienced Tinkers working within their own specialities look like clumsy beginners. And you can rapidly reverse-engineer other technology given sufficient opportunity to study it, however complex or esoteric it might be. You can even study and analyze exotic and anomalous phenomena, such as cape powers in action, to hopefully gain inspiration for new Tinkertech. You have a volume knob in your head for making your designs either easily reproducible by mundane methods or totally blackboxed vs. any reverse-engineering or anything in between. You can perform what would have required clean room levels of precision assembly for mundane engineers with ordinary tools and under rough conditions. Troubleshooting or repairing tech that you already understand is a job you could practically do in your sleep, and anything you build or overhaul is maintenance-optional. With time and practice your Tinker abilities can improve and grow indefinitely, without any upper limit. You can't do things like 'perfected social sciences' or 'auto-win personal interaction methodologies', though. That sort of thing is for Thinkers, not Tinkers."

You have a copy of a technique scroll for the shadow clone jutsu, of such quality that an idiot could teach himself from this thing in virtually no time at all. It even has safeguards built-in that eliminate any possibility of killing yourself by putting too much chakra into it, or getting a headache from too many clones dispelling at once or anything like that. The worst that can possibly happen is that it fails to work. You still can only make as many shadow clones as your chakra can support but outside of that you can feel free to abuse this handy jutsu for training, decoys, diversions, paperwork, chores, or whatever else you can imagine. In the event that this technique is supposed to have some additional features in the particular fanfiction you go to, or even a better version, this scroll will contain both versions. Some of the best shadow clone fanfic features include shadow clone self charka regeneration, temporal split clones instead of normal clones, mind merging without dispel, constant hivemind like connection etc. FREE: Chakra Coils- The basic ability to use chakra, as represented by \"chakra coils\" that are a nebulous part of your body and/or soul now. You have top-quality chakra coils which would place you in the top 5% in this world in terms of both capacity and control. After this jump your chakra system and body continue to function just as they do in this world, retaining any improvements or additions made along the way. You may also, if you choose to, induce the development of chakra coils in other people simply by pushing some of your chakra into them. FREE: Academy Training- You already have all the basic training necessary to start on your career as a ninja. Your physical stats and resilience are what civilians would call 'peak human' and you can mold chakra, use kunai and shuriken, do the academy three jutsu (henge, kawarimi, and bunshin), and have learned a basic taijutsu style. You've even studied ahead a little and learned tree climbing, chakra-boosted jumping, and several D-rank techniques. FREE: Elemental Affinity- Not much to see here. You have an extremely strong elemental affinity in one of the five primary elements of this world, those being Fire, Wind, Water, Earth and Lightning. The first purchase of this perk is free, second and onwards cost 100 CP though you must purchase a different primary element each time. FREE: Ninja Weapons-You have a pouch full of all kinds of general use ninja weapons, like shuriken, kunai, senbon, each of multiple kinds and sizes, up to and including things like fuuma shurikens and the rest. It also has many spools of ninja wire, along with the other slightly niche materials, and everything is of the very highest quality, prime Higurashi product."

While rare diamonds of practical knowledge are scattered between the books, the more academic literature is likely to help you in developing your own magics or rituals. The Grand Library updates for each new jump, adding further shelves of books along grey stone escarpments, and providing a comprehensive academic knowledge base of the metaphysics, magic and dimensions of your local setting, though it will not contain books which already exist. The Grand Library attaches to your Cosmic Warehouse or other pocket dimension."

Any knowledge that wasn't limited to literally just one person, family, or bloodline or was based purely on sealless chakra manipulation (such as the Rasengan) and thus uncopyable by the Sharingan is in the archive, all of them laid out in such a clear and concise format that any half-competent ninja could teach himself just by reading the scroll. This archive will update with a complete set of spells, fighting styles, etc, etc. from any setting that you have visited and will visit in the future. Provided it could be generously called public, or even semi-private, knowledge it will be in here. Only the most super-secret, utterly private techniques are missing; after all, even the best copyright pirates can't get everything. This place is comprehensively warded against thievery, somewhat ironically, and it would take a team of top-tier infiltration specialists to even attempt to breach it.

It is a place where they can open their mind, and truly ascend to new heights in awareness as they explore Creation itself. Alas... even they knew not to focus everything in one place, and it is with that in mind that I offer you this. Whether you wish to place this in a mountain range so that it is hidden away from the eyes of most, or have it as a Warehouse attachment, this ancient site contains everything one needs to build an order. Rooms for monks to stay in, a great library to fill with many books, a courtyard to practice, an armory for magical items you may possess, and even a storage unit that supplies as much mundane food, water, and tea to sate those who follow the Mystic Arts. Even better, those who practice here will find their minds opening more quickly than usual, having an accelerated effect that will leave training of the body and mystical practices half again as effective. ...oh, and there's a wifi router installed. Chakra Books (100CP) It can be difficult for those who are unaware of the world around them to grasp that they know nothing. It can also be difficult to show them just how small their worldview has been all this time, or help them. But the first step to learning is awareness. This is a substantial supply of books regarding the body, such as a map of the nervous system, MRIs, and more importantly, chakra points and how to open them. These maps for the body will help bring awareness to would-be students, and how to show them the wonders of the world or themselves. For an additional undiscounted 100CP, you may also gain a substantial collection of spellbooks that will assist in helping you learn the formation of spells, the art of drawing energies to power them, and the basics in casting them. Just be aware that the warning labels come AFTER the spells. * The cost includes the upgrade\" FREE: You're Welcome, By The Way: You might have noticed that as time went on, a lot of the people here have become... snarky, for a lack of better words. Snippy, bantering, sarcastic, call it whatever you want because they'll call it whatever they want as well. The point is they're not the only ones now. That is, they don't have a monopoly on sounding high and mighty. Mainly because you can keep up with them.

It's in charge of all management, and while there aren't any guards stationed here, there will never be any incident happen here. The huge library could be said to have everything. Its information was not limited to that about the Magus World and World of Gods; there was data about other worlds as well. There was a large bright hall past the entrance that could hold over a thousand people without becoming crowded. At the middle were hundreds of tables, and what looked like terminals, of which one can use to browse through the information the library has. Further in from the data terminals and the hall was the gigantic library that resembled a palace. Some sort of technique had been employed to expand the space within. At a glimpse, one would see bookshelves as massive as mountains, all so densely packed and numerous that there seemed to be no end. Upon visiting any Worlds/Jumps/Dimensions, the library also updates to contain every public information, including any data that you can easily acquire if you put your mind to it, of that Worlds and its neighbor, which include other dimensions. And will continuously update, self-correct and improve any information it has. As long as it's information that the spirit genie has a backup of, it can be duplicated as anything you want, such as books, scrolls, data pad, storage drive, etc, as long as you have the materials required. It can contain an immeasurable amount of data, and will never forget it. Even if the data has already been updated and improved or even if the timeline changes, it will still contain the old versions. You can place the Great Library in the real world, letting in all kinds of people to exchange for information, you can freely set the payment. Such as making it so that to obtain information inside, one needs to give it information that the library did not have, paying your preferred currencies to view it, or doing some mission you set out to gain access to it. It will be completely normal for everyone, and won't trigger any red flag, taxes, government authority, copyright infringement, Gods, World Will, etc. You can freely set which information is public, which requires payment, and which is never to be seen by the public. Its information can never be copied, stolen or otherwise accessed without your permission and knowledge. If it somehow is destroyed, it will return to your Warehouse/Personal Reality with none worse for the wear. Those other than you and your companions cannot use the library to access your Warehouse/Personal Reality. If you have the A.I. Chip, then it can always be connected to the Great Library. Allowing you to control the Great Library remotely while providing you with it continuously updating and self-correcting information anytime, anyplace.

It could take a hundred mortal lifetimes to glean even the barest secrets of this knowledge, though one who is Exalted above others might manage it in as little as one. It contains instructions on how to make all the various types of Alchemical Exalted and, unlike the Alchemicals that were first created, these instructions show how to create improved versions. Ones that are immune to the dread sickness that so afflicted the Maker and far less susceptible to the vagaries of Clarity. This is only the knowledge to create these beings, and someone that desires to make use of this knowledge will need to secure the materials, infrastructure, and other reagents needed on their own. The Jumper, and only the Jumper, is guaranteed to one day be able to make Alchemical Exalts if they study this, even if they wouldn't normally be capable of such, though it may take a very long time indeed. While you may discover the method of the creation of Alchemicals, how their Exaltation itself is formed will elude you, no matter what method you attempt, until such time as you have gained your Spark. Further you will discover that no method you are capable of will be able to utilize the Alchemical Exaltation for anything other than powering the Alchemical that it has attached itself to. This, too, will be something that will be beyond your comprehension until such a time as you have gained your Spark. As a reminder Alchemicals were once people and while the process may have changed them both in looks and abilities they are people still. So unless you take them as companions, or have some other method of bringing them with you into future worlds, you will not be able to take them with you. Finally the process of making an Alchemical does not infuse into them any sort of loyalty to you, so beware if you have used this knowledge to force this condition upon the unwilling."

Research Notes (200CP) A tome of notes compiled by numerous doctors in biology, including one Doctor Frankenstein. These notes detail much about biological make-up of different creatures. But... wait, what's this? A hidden flap in the last half of the tome reveals a smaller book - filled to the brim with dark, scientific knowledge. With this knowledge, you are capable of creating life - creating monsters like Adam, creatures sewn from flesh and defying the laws of reality by their mere existence. Dark Journal (200CP) An inconspicuous, black leather journal. Not that big, so you wouldn't expect much. It's contents prove surprising however - for what you hold is no ordinary journal, but possibly the largest composition of necromantic rituals in existence. Each page details the rituals required to create - and control - a great variety of undead monsters. Ranging from ghouls, ghosts, and skeletons to vampires & even more monstrous beings, you'll have no lack of possible minions. Note: The rituals for higherpowered undead will take more material - and more time - to enact. * If you check the Van helsing jumpchain, just below the blueprints, research notes and dark journal, it mentions that all of these are written by the same person and having all of them will let you combine the last pages from each book, in order to construct, and I quotetechnological marvels and monstrous creations unlike any other It apparently merges science technology and magic in seamless harmony."

It seems like somehow, you have the fully compiled data and knowledge from the entirety of Neolife, an artificial future set 3000 years after the current time, all contained within a tiny little USB stick. This includes technology and magitech schematics, the research on countless spells and abilities, a bestiary and the aura-makeup of nigh-any creature and animal ever recorded, star maps, and even all the movies and songs known at that point in time. It isn't limited to a single galaxy, but rather contains data from the entire universe in Neolife. Let alone several lifetimes, you'd probably need an entire planet worth of people sifting through those records for the same amount of time if you want to catalogue everything. But believe me, it is very much worth the effort. If you shared this with the galactic community, you'd be able to prevent many possible and very real problems from popping up, and everyone could get their foot in the door that much sooner. Perhaps even more interestingly, this USB stick will update itself as you travel to other worlds, granting you the same data about their own futures, and even works retroactively, covering settings you have been to in the past. Of course, that's only if they even have a future. Exactly from how far off in the future you get this data depends on how far along the society of a world is. If you spent ten years in a setting fighting dinosaurs, well, the records you get might be from a few dozen million years in the future, while starting on a 21st century Earth would give you data a few thousand years in the future as normal, give or take."

This bar may be relatively high if one was to compare it to that of previous Jumps. Sentient computer systems, widely available commercial FTL, weapons that can scour planets, miraculous medical technology and gravity manipulation to name a few. An extremely comprehensive database of all these discoveries, refined and developed over the course of millennia, will be mentally accessible for you. Should you have the resources and tools on hand, there's no reason you couldn't create almost anything natively produced in this galaxy. Forceful Engineer (200CP) Force sensitive individuals and species have created wondrous unions of engineering genius and Force energies. Prisons to hold eldritch nightmares, holocrons and seemingly infinite factories that strip entire stars for the resources needed for your unending fleets. You are inspired when it comes to the design of such marvels, even being able to use the Light Side for unseen effects. This brilliance extends beyond the Force into the wider realm of 'Magitek'. The potential trichotomy of Machine, 'Magic' and The Force could give birth to near unimaginable wonders for the inventive mind. Extragalactic Tech (200CP) Exo-technology is a field of science that specialized in studying in combining the technologies of various species of the galaxy. Your nature as a Jumper allows you to go beyond merely marrying the design sensibilities of several alien peoples. You easily blend the the varying physical laws and examples of causality you've encountered in the creation of any one thing. Force Sensitive (0CP) The Force is what gives a Jedi, or a Sith, his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. You are a member of a small percentage of the galactic population that can tap into and utilise the Force to effect the world around you. Also comes with basic knowledge on how to use the force"

Also for those already asking, the knowledge of how to in theory remake the Numidium is here, however you'll notice it's not going to give a step by step guide, and the requirements and skill necessary will be far beyond all but the greatest, and most legendary Tonal Architects. Make sure to use this with care, the Dwemer were among the most powerful races to live and the damage that could be done with their advancements is immense. Knowledge of Infinity (600CP) Knowledge is power, or at least that's how the saying goes, and the Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora would happen to agree. Within your hands is a very strange and almost disgusting book known as the Oghma Infinium, bound with the skin of each of the Mer races, both extinct and not, this book stands as one of the greatest depositories of knowledge in the Elder Scrolls universe. Filled with everything from swordplay to ancient and forgotten spells not seen since ages past, this book represents an immense amount of power should you utilize the knowledge within. Of course, while that would be quite the bounty on its own it seems your version has retained the inquisitive nature of its master, each setting you go to represents a font of knowledge never before seen in the halls of Apocrypha or the pages of the book. Like Mora himself the book will gather information from each setting you go to as if Mora himself was gathering it, this isn't instantaneous and don't expect it to pull information that's under incredible concealment or protected by entities of immense power with ease. At most the book will take a full decade to gather an equivalent amount of information on each world as it does the Elder Scrolls."

Beware its tendencies to amplify the personality traits of the user, or be prepared to find a way to fix that fact.

A typical Nitramene bomb has a blast radius of five hundred yards after which it creates a vacuum that causes an implosion as matter rushes to fill the void that it has created, but a grenade of that size will do considerably less damage. On the other hand, Nitramene also emits low levels of Vita Radiation, which has a specific wavelength that has stabilizing properties."

Other names include that bouncy stuff, the blue gel, and unknown skeletonhating element. Unlike Aperture's current expensive and lengthy recipe, this one involves precisely combining rubber with hydrogen and oxygen. Blue dye is optional. Washes off with water. Why is this recipe so expensive? Repulsion Gel can be used as a potent weapon against anything mobile that relies on solid structural integrity by covering that thing in the Gel. It will repulse any movement back in the other direction, creating a movement which is then repulsed in the other direction by the Gel covering the other size of that thing. One twitch becomes movement in every direction at terminal velocity, tearing that thing apart. This includes the human body. Propulsion Gel recipe (100CP) This is a recipe.. Okay, you get the picture. The acceleration gel is created by adding seemingly random elements to a modern recipe for no-stick spray. The gel increases the velocity of any object moving on it unless that object is at rest. Washes off with water Unexplained Science Thing (200CP) You have no idea what this thing does. No idea at all! It could have the effect of any one of Aperture's miscellaneous inventions depending on how you try to use it. Shape the ill-defined mass into the shape of a disk and put it in a computer? You've discovered the annotated source code for Aperture's OS, able to run an AI on the power from a potato battery. Disperse it into an air vent and record the results? You now have the ability to convert type AB blood into pure gasoline with laser technology.

While the exterior doesn't have any noticeable features, aside from maybe a gigantic image of your face carved into the rock, the interior houses a large hanger bay, numerous defensive drones, an imposing throne room, and a massive digital library containing information on the culture, history, inhabitants, and technology of over a hundred worlds, including krypton. If someone were to study all the archives in this station they would gain incredible insights into robotics, cybernetics, energy weaponry, space travel, A.I, and many other topics from countless space faring civilizations. Enough to build weapons and starships that can pose a serious threat to Earth and Apokolips. Additionally this station contains a small fragment of Brainiac itself. The fragment is currently inactive and safe to handle, and while it would be possible for a smart enough individual to reverse engineer Brainiac's most powerful technology from this thing it would come at the cost of possibly awaking the copy of the A.I hidden inside and If that were to happen it would quickly attempt to possess whoever or whatever was nearby to ensure it's continued survival, replication, and improvement. However someone would have to be as smart as Lex Luthor in order to even have a chance of reactivating this device. If you do manage to get it working however then you'll have a sample of the nanotech Brainiac uses to modify and possess living beings and assimilate alien technology. Aside from replicating the nanotech in this fragment you could also purposefully reawaken the copy of Brainiac stored within and try to use it for your own ends, but this really isn't recommended since it's a crazy murderous A.I that's only interesting in collecting knowledge. If you do manage to reawaken Brainiac it won't count as a companion. * Braniac fragment is a part of this perk"

Alternatively, you could instead have a similar database encompassing Heleus Cluster civilizations (excluding Remnant Tech). You could also pay an additional 100CP to get both Milky Way and Heleus databases. If you've already bought both of those, you can also pay an additional 200CP for access to a sprawling library of Remnant tech, enough to make Peebee swear eternal servitude to you just to have access to it. If you pay an additional 200CP on top of the Remnant tech option, this database will update per each civilization you interact with. Dead or remnant civilizations will take a bit of a research period before you get an update for them, but when you do, you'll be the envy of any archeological expert in that civilization. But regardless of whatever level you buy, you have a media/cultural/historical archive of each culture/civilization you have the technology of. The dead/remnant civilizations still need to be researched first though. * The 600cp cost includes all the upgrades"

      "description": "The blueprints and schematics for the device known as the Timespinner. It is a form of temporal gateway that is capable of precisely sending a user through time into the past or future. The ordinary version has several limitations, the most important of which is that travelling through it is a one-way trip, and results in the removal of the traveller from history, leaving them as a person without a history on the other side. Similarly, until upgraded by Lachiemi science, the portal only allowed for travel through time, not space, and would deposit the user at the same point, relative to the planet they are on, in whatever era they targeted. This version has altered those restrictions. Firstly, it is capable of travelling through both space and time. Secondly, it has a recall function, which allows a user who has travelled through it to 'snap back' to the device the moment after they went through, re-entering their old timeline at that point. The device does still retain the restriction that the timeline being travelled to will be one where the user never existed, but the recall function means that they can travel between that timeline and this one as they please. The third restriction is related to that, namely that this device can only target a single 'new' timeline per person per Jump, and thus that as they travel around in the new timeline and make changes, they will be making changes to the same timeline, even when they shift back and forth between the old and new timelines. It is possible to bring back objects from the new timeline into the old timeline, or vice versa, but not people. Finally, this Timespinner has safeguards to ensure that no matter how much you mess with time, it will not cause an existential breakdown or destroy the universe (which could be a danger with the normal Timespinner, or that might just be a lie told by the Sandman). This purchase does come with the necessary materials to make a single Timespinner, which will replenish at the beginning of each new Jump. A Timespinner can only target times and spaces within the current Jump. * Worse than the tardis but the protection feature is unique"

This would be a complete database, with complete and full information on every piece of technology they have. Cloning, spaceships, hibernation, the works. The 400 CP version lets you get tech from the more advanced species, instead, like 'future humanity' with Time Travel and Galaxy Cracker bombs, or data on similar levels from other species like the Time Lords or so. For 800 CP, though... all bets are off. This is the complete, no-holds barred archive of every single scrap of knowledge ever assembled in the history of this universe. From the blood and magic manipulations of the Carrionites, to the works crafted by the Ancients to bind the Beast, to every piece of Time Lord and Dalek technology, the in-depth studies of Time Lord biologies... the mother lode. It's all here,everything, ready for you to learn, teach others, and use however you will. Jumpers of any particular species can take their species's archives at a discount... except Daleks and Time Lords, who can at best get the 400 level info at a discount. The 800 CP archive is not discounted to anyone. In future jumps, wherever applicable every version updates to hold the same level of knowledge from the local universe."

Though heavily damaged and weathered by the passage of time, many of the devices within still function, and the inscriptions recovered from the Martian dig sites have contained information beyond anything humanity understood - leading to some of the most advanced scientific theories of the modern day. You are now in charge of a sizable dig site working through these ruins, with direct authority over the discoveries made within.

Full usage of the craft requires artifacts to forge the metal, a hammer and anvil composed of soulsteel or jade (whichever you prefer) to hammer the molten ghost-alloys into shape, another artifact known as an Essence-forge to melt down the unfortunate ghost's corpus and other materials, soulfire crystals replete with essence to stoke the forge, and black ores taken from the Labyrinth to grant it the ghastly, magical strength of soulsteel. Even the alchemical agents, wrought from the Labyrinth, which are needed to create the rarefied void-coated plates of Oblivion's Panoply are in refilling supplies amongst these, should you have need of them. With this, the only thing you would still require for your dread craft is a supply of souls to feed your forge. * The new CF has some souls available in supplies that can be used guilt free."

      "source": "Lords of the Night - Liches",
      "chapter": "Domain: Facilities: Magical",
      "description": "Tower of Sorcerae (100CP) You have a tower dreamt into reality. Maybe by you, maybe by someone else, but it was never made a concrete and defined thing. It starts out a thing the size of a city block, and thirty stories high. It can be something of stone, or glass, or crystal, or wood. When no one is watching it, the tower can change its outer facade. Inside it has a basic layout, though you can change that layout whenever it is unobserved by people other than you. Both the inside and out will repair themselves over time, and the tower may slowly shift itself, faster if unobserved, though still slowly. The tower echoes any crafting perks you possess, gaining technologies and magics in keeping with the secrets and arts you've seized. You may feed the tower vast quantities of Arcane over time to make it grow. You may make it grow in luxury, making everything inside the tower higher quality over time and more comfortable and beautiful. You may make it grow in utility causing it to grow embedded magical items, and if you have the perks, technological ones. You may make it grow in size, becoming broader or taller or both, or even make it grow inside without growing outside, though that's even more expensive. If you make the Tower a bound artifact, all those functions will be enhanced. You can also have it already on legs, or other appropriate mechanisms, so that it can move about. You may import an existing property as your Tower, though if that combination would be especially powerful you must pay an extra 100cp for the privilege. Floating Isle (100CP) Your Tower flies, and so does a modest amount of land around it. Enough for a small family farm though like with the rest of the tower it's possible to expand this. The weather's always pleasant - the air elementals bound to moving it make sure. They're quick to defend the tower if need be, and there are many permanent unseen servants to invisibly serve guests and do work about the place. And the elementals can push the tower at a decent pace. You get about a dozen elder air elemental servants. If killed, they will come back in a day and a night. They can't leave the premise, but otherwise faithfully obey you. They're also surprisingly bright, for elementals at least. You know methods of binding more with the same properties should you require them, though it is neither a fast nor easy process. Moving Locations (100CP) Your tower has several dozen portals to major population centers, a few smaller towns, and an interesting hidden place of wonder or magic. It has this... for every major plane of existence in the local cosmology, and several of the minor ones. These portals form extensions of the tower on the other end, small buildings or annexes built of the towers essence. The portals work automatically for you, and you can key other people to use them. Minions created by your power always count as 'keyed,' unless you've unkeyed them. The portals are near impossible to notice for those not keyed to them, and would require something on the level of epic magic or similar in order to force open. All of the portals are clearly marked as to where they go... but only to those that are actually keyed to using them. Arcane (0CP) You have traded away Life for a measure of the Arcane, writing the truth of yourself upon the fabric of Reality. It is the Wellspring of Creation, the fire from which things become Possible. It opposes destruction and stagnation. Though it's worth noting that a nova consuming a world full of life and culture doesn't qualify as 'destruction' or 'stagnation.' Merely change, and change is interesting. Arcane has a kind of supremacy over mortal magics - not just normal arcane magic either. An Arcane Lich can strip a Dragon of its breath, a Beholder of its gaze, and a Sorcerer of their spells. Such work are the products of specialized Arcana, formal techniques some Liches learn. The converse is not true. An Anti-Magic field does nothing to something fueled with Arcane, while an Arcane Null-Magic Field shuts down mortal magic. An Arcane Item won't show up to Detect Magic, won't be damaged by Disjunction, and generally speaking ignores all such forces. In future jumps, it's safe to treat Arcane as a 'higher' force, except when it runs against other explicitly 'higher' reality rewriting forces, such as the Power Cosmic of Marvel or Flame Imperishable of LotR. It can affect the 'lesser forces', and they cannot affect it. On its own, this perk gives you a small pool of Arcane which can be used several ways * You can fuel Sorcerae - unstructured magic where you simply create the effect you want. * You can transfer it from or to another being or object that can hold it. This can't be used to steal it from another being or to grant the ability to hold or use Arcane to people that cannot already do so. As its own regeneration rate is trivial, storing Arcane energy in prepared crystal and gemstone receptacles ahead of time is the normal method of getting it. * Your creative mental energies lets you slowly dream more of it into being. Mechanically your regeneration rate is tied to your Intelligence. * You can see Arcane Script, a magical language written in Arcane energies. It has some use in magical items. If you know the script (which you do), you can also write it, though that costs energy. It's possible to drain the Arcane energy used to write the script, erasing what was written. * They can develop Arcana, special disciplines fueled by their Arcane energies. Arcane naturally recovers at a snail's pace for all but the most intelligent. More evolved liches gain bonuses to its recovery. However even for superhumanly intelligent spectral liches (the most advanced kind) the recovery rate for Arcane energy is still not terribly quick. (see notes) Sorcerae (0CP) You can perform Sorcerae, dreaming what you want to happen into being. This is a dangerous power, and the very power the Guild of Wizards claim was used to bring Reality into being. There are ways of sensing its use, and mortal minds were not designed to bear witness to such shapings. There are stacking bonuses and penalties to an attempt, but how difficult it will be and how much it will cost is a shifting thing. Taking extra time makes it easier, but also makes finding you easier for those keeping an eye out for such things. * Spending extra Arcane can reduce the difficulty. * The easiest form of this is dreaming into being an effect you could cast - the known spells of a Sorcerer or the prepared spells of a Wizard. The known spells, that aren't prepared, of a Wizard (and equivalents) are also pretty easy. * Any spell you've seen cast, that matches a type you can cast. If you've cast it, you've seen it cast, so these bonuses often go together. * Any other effect you've seen is a bit easier, but not much. * A spell you can cast, but from an alternative source is a bit easier, but not as much. If you're a specialist wizard, and you somehow learn a forbidden spell, or if you have Cleric levels and decide to copy a Cleric spell, you use this modifier instead * A spell from a type you can cast, that you haven't seen, is a little more difficult. * A spell that isn't appropriate (Cleric, Druid, other spell list) is more difficult. * A spell that's higher level then you can cast is more difficult. * A completely new effect is even more difficult. Such effects cost Arcana the more powerful they are, and with factors that increase difficulty. There are also some special modifiers. * Truly destroying something, Be Not, involves a massive spike in cost. * Making something real and permanent multiples the cost by ten. So if you can afford ten times the cost of Summon Monster IX, then you can permanently call such a set of helpers into being. *Groups can pool their efforts to achieve greater effects. A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (0CP) The power of the Arcane, and the necromantic forces that bolt it to a human soul... the mind was not built to cope with such things. Well, other people's minds might not be. You deal with it fine. In fact, you'll find that you deal with everything fine. Madness just doesn't 'take' when it's you. Your mind refuses to warp, your personality stays stable, and your view of reality matches what you sense and perceive. * Just read the perk, its one of the best things in the CF, scaling, with unlimited potential for both magic and tech * Limited reality warping styled magic free along with it and to fuel it * Arcane energy was used to create the entire dnd multiverse of this setting."

Almost none of these wondrous factory-cathedrals endure today, and those that remain are terribly damaged or lost to the impassable wilderness. But while practically no one alive could build a factory-cathedral today, the Deathlords are some of the few beings that could. Still, only one amongst the deathlords is officially known to possess an equivalent... And now, you may acquire one of these wonders of dark design. Built as a great tower, this imposing manse has been designed to serve both as a factory-cathedral reminiscent of those built in the First Age and as an equally effective necrosurgery laboratory using more recent designs pioneered by the Deathlords. Unlike the hallowed cathedrals built by the Solars of old, these halls have not been sanctified or constructed as a temple-manse. Instead, special precautions have been taken to ensure the cold, sterile perfection of the Abyssal Essence that powers the horrible machines within. Within these workshops, long forgotten First Age tools are set side by side with just as sophisticated new innovations. Here, eldritch suspension vats preserve the dead. Essence-fueled welding tools fuse bone to bone. Flasks of reagents bubble and strange devices whir, spark and glow. The place carries about it a dark majesty that scares away most natural animals and invites bad weather, yet the environment stays oddly dry and cool. Black ornaments inset with iron, onyx, and obsidian further channel the manse's Essence into necromantic power, such that the costs of necromantic spells cast within the manse's walls are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the manse bolsters the strength of such spells beyond the capabilities of the necromancer's own Essence. All the better to animated the necrotic warmachines one might create within."

While it has many rather ominous pictures on its walls and no small amount of unused sports equipment, the houses true appeal is what lies underneath it. Thought a secret passageway, you may access an extensive labyrinth hidden below the property. This labyrinth, called the Caves of the Void, is home to a variety of monsters capable of smelling magic, which they use to hunt intruders. You of course, won't be hunted by these beasts (unless you want to be, for whatever reason). Within this maze are veins of a special black crystal, which has been a key component used to create weapons like the Sceptre of the Ancients, capable of killing gods. And in the deepest part of the caves is the Source Fountain, a pool that turns whatever you place within it magical. The house is completely paid off, and has free running water, electricity, AC and secure internet."

As comfortable as the house it is, its real draw is actually the basement hidden beneath the home. Completely undetectable without significant supernatural powers or actually blowing open the ground, this basement holds an extensive magical workshop. Filled with common and rare magical reagents and ingredients, both of which replenish over time. Numerous magical tools for crafting, enchantment and a variety of other disciplines can also be found here, as well as a fair sized but empty room for summoning. Magic cast here is undetectable to those outside the basement, though the basement itself is not indestructible in any way. If you blow the place up, people will notice."

Filled with technology and academic research at the very cutting edge of the 20th century, and somehow a few steps further in some cases, on three different fields of technology as well as a wide range of magecraft tools, research and notes on three magical topics of choice that would be well regarded even in the upper echelons of the Mages' Association. While each side is already quite impressive, it is the small library regarding the efforts of the previous owner of the home to find applications towards mixing each side that is the hidden gold here. Notes on how to truly bring out the potential of technology with magecraft and vice versa are here. As well as all this, the entire estate, manor and laboratory are surrounded with multiple layers of defense and obfuscation of both technological and magical means. A small army could not break in, even if they could find the place. You may import a property into this."

      "description": "-Temple of Solomon (400CP) A place that has long been abandoned or, at least, a replica of the one currently in use. The Temple of Solomon is perhaps the grandest magical workshop ever to be created, one so great that it does not even exist in the mundane world. Sealed away in imaginary number space, it is only accessible to others through highly complex and difficult magical workings, though you can enter your hidden base with nothing but a thought provided you are not blocked by some means. The temple itself is quite large, with the small dimension covering several city blocks of area and the building being the size of a large mansion. Within is almost every one of Solomon's personal notes and research on magecraft and magic, along with a great deal of lore from other famous magicians of his time and from later on as well. The small dimension has been connected to a replica of Solomon's created magical circuits which empower the framework the workshop sits on, serving to provide a immense magical fuel source for any project you might wish to run within this space as you can freely draw on the amount of energy the King of Magic had while alive when you are in here. Finally, death in this realm is not permanent and it is far easier to bring back those who die when it is within this place. For your purposes, this means that dying in this temple will not count as an end to your chain. You may import an existing structure into this role. * Solomon made the entire modern magic framework that allows for magecraft in fate -An Age of Gods (0CP) The Age of Gods is certainly a time to be alive. Humanity is far from as weak as it will become in the modern era, so you will require a suitable body to these early times. Should you be born later in this world’s life, after the Age of Gods has ended, you will be quite the anomaly. A human with a body from the Age of Gods yet born in the latter ages. You have the physical and mental capabilities that any modern human would believe you are superhuman. You can tear through the stone or metal of the modern day without much exertion, perhaps even lift a tonne of weight over your head, and certainly outrun any horse. You have magical power unlike what appears to those who use magecraft, as you do not have magic circuits. Instead, through your body runs pure magical energy, allowing you to much more easily manipulate your own energy and that of the world around you. Of course, such a thing requires training to utilise to any real effect but once you have that training, there is no modern mage not considered a freakish prodigy that could level with you. As befits a time of myths and heroes, you will be assured to be at least somewhat attractive and it is possible for your body to grow to somewhat inhuman degrees, though whether that manifests as being eight feet tall and bulging with muscles or the sort of beauty normally seen only in the depictions of fertility goddesses in the temples of Babylon…that’s still to be decided. -Little Shadow (0CP) A slip of a girl, barely noticeable in the corner of your eye. She found you one day or you found her and she refused to accept that she’d been found. She was barely standing but still held a sharp knife firmly as she glared at you. A spared scrap of bread and those eyes changed quickly. Now she follows you around, claiming that it is her duty to protect your life, meeting you was just a sign from God. Soft purple hair is her only distinguishing feature but her hard eyes give away her training. A failed member of the Hassan, left behind with nothing more than a dutiful will. She thinks of herself as a trained Hashashin even though she only knows simple knife fighting and basic stealth. Her eyes roam around, checking for weak points and hiding places, even if she doesn’t know what those are. Her cheeks get vibrantly red if you point this out and she will stomp slightly further away in a huff. Any hint of lessons or wisdom on her dream will be eagerly grasped however, her eyes starting to shine with wonder and hope. Maybe one day, she really will grow into the amazing assassin and protector the order believed she couldn’t hope to be. -Sphinx Awlad (0CP) It’s only the cutest, cuddliest little thing in this sub-continental region. With skin in the pattern of the cosmos of stars, these kittens are offspring of one of the legendary Sphinxes of Egypt. The golden headdresses they wear, in the shape of little lion ears, is quite the hint. Fortunately, they’re as weak as actual kittens in strength and only as sturdy as a normal human, so this fella won’t need to be put in any sort of danger. They love to play around with gold and magic, bounding through the desert sand unbothered by the sun. This one looks up to you like a parent, affectionately nuzzling you and doing it’s best to look big and scary whenever it thinks someone is threatening you. It’ll be a long, long time before it grows up into a big bad lion though. Probably a few hundred years."

Thus, this temple cannot exist despite its meticulously artful design and wondrously magnificence the likes of which seem impossible to ever match in other architecture. And in truth, this is correct. For this temple exists Beyond, the place of things which are cast out and never existed at all. All around it are floating worldscapes; upside-down places, angled places, in-and-out places. Existence seems to have the quality of a cube winding in toward a central locus, and all through the air floated things unguessed and never before seen. Here, in these alien vistas beyond perception, which are an infinite forge of the impossible that stirred the very Wyld into forms and patterns by the movement of your thoughts, you may create and think on those things deemed impossible by all. Still, caution is for the wise, for while you are protected by reality within the walls of this temple, the outside is not so kind and should you get lost behind babbling brooks of names... you might find that you never really existed at all. Of course, bringing this manse within Creation or Hell would defeat the very point of its construction. And so alternative measure have been devised. With but a sideways step through any doorway, the holder of the temple's hearthstone may step within its walls, and from inside you may also open a stable portal to other realms so that others might likewise enter."

The Forge itself is located deep underground, only accessible by following a tunnel that can easily be used as a chokepoint to bottleneck an invading army or fortified into a near- impenetrable hall of traps and sealed dwemer-metal blast doors. It's real value however, is the smithy itself. Using flame salts (which never seem to run low), raw magma (which never seems to burn or cause heatstroke unless you physically leap into it) and a massive blast furnace (which never breaks or needs refueling) in addition to its magical nature and tools surpassing what even the Grand-Masters of Tamriel could hope to lay their hands on, the Earth Forge is quite possibly one of, if not the, greatest smith's workshops on Nirn, equaled perhaps only by the yet-undiscovered Aetherium Forge and the factories of Sotha Sil the Clockwork King. Comes with a small retinue of NPC guards to... well... guard it."

The castes serve to diversify the bearers of the exaltation and is brought into harmony within a perfect circle, a gathering of a single member of each of the five castes. And in honor of this most sacred harmony, this manse has been constructed. A great manor built in the style of the early first age, where perfect geometry and design met with principles of practicality and efficiency; a far cry from the ostentatious grandeur of the later years. But within the main hall rests five doors in perfect symmetry, each bearing the mark of a different caste emblazoned upon their face. Behind each door lies a room constructed to push the abilities of the Lawgivers to their very limits, to awaken further understanding through adversity. For the Bronze Tigers an ever shifting battlefield, complete with highly skilled automatons and simulated environments to push even the most skilled warriors to their very limits. For the Golden Bulls therein lies a temple to the Highest of Holies, a place where they can focus and realign themselves to their cause. As an additional provision this temple also contains tools and features to help train resistance, such as meditations on a bed of spikes or walking across molten orichalcum. For the Copper Spiders, a most wondrous forge to be theirs. Complete with all the tools required to construct some truly awe inspiring works of artifice should they possess the talent and the patience. For the Iron Wolves, their room contains an ever shifting puzzle building. Fixed only when the door is opened this place is designed to push stealth and infiltration techniques to the highest possible level. However one other benefit is the owner can submit the plans to a compound, real or not, and find it simulated here as a way to test their skills through places of their own devising. And finally for the Quicksilver Falcons, within their portal lies the ballroom of a magnificent manor. Within here simulacrums vie and jockey for social standing, ever perceptive to the slightest misstep and always eager for the slightest loophole in an agreement. After learning to survive and thrive in this merciless atmosphere, navigating most other social events is almost no effort at all."

Instead, it is a network of six smaller manses arranged in an artful pattern of geomantic resonance, empowering the central manse with the essence gleaned of the other five. Each created from white brass and inlaid with black basalt, the five are formed into slender towers that channel their essence towards the center, while on their own providing little more than a luxurious abode and a minor hearthstone. It is the central manse that is of most note to you, though it is still build up a weaker demesne than the other manses you might acquire here, the difference is more than made up for by the creative power funneled into it by the supporting manses. A palace of white brass walls and ringed by streets of black basalt, it is a marvel to the eye built to be just as aesthetically pleasing as it is functional. Her walls are decorated with frescoes bearing differing images of the Mother of Creation and the demon princes descended from her, fortified to withstand the greatest of sieges. Her halls are lit with purest white flames that burn eternally, miniscule fragments taken from the flame that would become the Daystar's solar flames. Her rooms are furnished with wealth to bankrupt many princes, every need and want you might have catered to by the servile intelligence of the manse itself, her only desire to aid you. Even the essence of the manse adapts to make sure you are comfortable and every small detail aligns in your favor. And beyond all that, you will find many, many rooms filled with magnificent workshops for every craft imaginable. Glassworking, pottery, smithing, painting, woodworking, jewelcrafting, and many more. The manse itself will aid you with any project you wish to take on within these halls, tools responding to your desires as eagerly as to your touch, and even gentle advice given on any of your handiwork if you wish for another opinion. Should you desire to, you may rearrange the flow of essence from the supporting manses to another manse than this one, but in reaction the palace shall become still, unable to help you as it wishes."

With no interference, they will soon rediscover it and slowly begin gaining access to the variety of rooms it houses. But due to a wrinkle in time, space, or perhaps simply in response to your own special nature, a copy of that magical space seems to have sprung into existence. Not a perfect copy with bound elementals and a Tapestry of Time, mind, but similar enough to service as a fine base in the space between worlds. The Second Sanctuary can be accessed through a small magical emerald in the shape of a pyramid. Tapping it will teleport you directly to the dining hall. Tapping it once inside will teleport you back to exactly where you were when you came in. The Second Sanctuary will be surrounded on all sides by empty space, with stars sprinkling the blackness off in the far distance. This is merely an illusion as the rooms occupy a pocket dimension and are not actually situated in outer space. If you desire, you can set the view to that of appearing to float amidst a certain solar system you have already encountered. It contains two plush bedrooms, each with a queen-sized four-post bed, desk, a chair, several chests, and a wardrobe, everything crafted from wood and comfortable red fabrics. In addition there is a small dining hall set off to one side in the midst of a well-tended garden. The table will feed anyone who sits down at it with simple, but filling, food and drink. The Second Sanctuary also comes equipped with a large, but currently empty, library and a workshop that includes a classic forge, tools and all. Don't be surprised to if you find a tall Elf wandering the library or relaxing at the feasting table. He dresses as loudly as a rainbow on several kinds of narcotics and is a little too friendly when it comes to invading personal space, but he's worth listening to. When he does stop by, his pockets, packs, and spaceship (How do you think he got here? Flapping his arms?) will be simply packed to the gills with magical weapons, enchanted armor, mysterious trinkets, and mystic essences brought with him from Rivellon proper. His stock tends to very wildly with each visit, but he'll usually have at least a few eye-catching artifacts. Who know what he might find in his travels through the multiverse? You might be surprised just what he can get his fingers on. Just don't expect him to sell anything for less than it's truly worth. He's too cunning for that. And yes, his name is Jack. How did you guess?"

Werewolves and fera treasure and protect them as holy sites and places to renew their spiritual ties and gather for various rituals. Unlike normal caerns that can be exhausted or fade without ritual support, yours will never fade and has a regenerating supply of spiritual energy and magic. You may freely allow or bar people from using the energy the caern provides to refill their gnosis pool. Normally the garou nation would make a rather large stink about a couple of low rank werewolves owning a caern, but the property it sits on is legally yours via inheritance, hook or crook, or outright buying it from some human that didn't know any better. Drop Ins that purchase this find a deed in their warehouse. It comes with ten acres of forest, but you may import another property to get the benefits. For an extra 100 points the forest increases to 100 acres, becomes tax free, and becomes immune to attempts to buy it or steal it via shenanigans legal shenanigans."

      "description": "A rare thing in Nexus, the Enchanter's Forges are the result of a magical catastrophe well before recorded history, considered myths by most people to this day. An Enchanter's Forge is actually a chaotic collection of magics and Mist in a small pocket dimension that will bind itself to an individual that claims it. The power held within this collection of magics is potent and may be worked as if it were a material substance, though it must be anchored to a physical medium to be of actual use, effectively tying the resulting magics to an object. This creates an enchantment that can potentially carry a wide variety of effects. Working the magic within an Enchanter's Forge is exceptionally difficult, requiring a lifetime of work to master the process and gain the potential to create truly powerful enchantments. Until then, you can only really give minor ones such as an enchantment for a blade to drink in blood to repair itself or creating a bow that produces its own arrows. Actually making enchantments with the Enchanter's Forge takes a great deal of time, requiring a heavy investment in time to actually create any powerful enchantments. Even then, you must experiment and practice with it to garner any results, no two Enchanter's Forges are the same, meaning you cannot rely on the experiences of others to guide your own use. The power within an Enchanter's Forge never seems to run out, and it is a great source of magical power if you possess some other way to utilize it"

These structures are known as Manses, and they are valuable resources to those that hold them. Thanks to the approval of your benefactor, we have been authorized to construct a place of power which can be attached to your warehouse, whatever that is. This manse will take the form of a luscious two story manor, with the in depth specifications up to you, with its elemental affinity matching yours. However what we can guarantee is a fully stocked library where you will likely find all manner of useful tomes, one of the most advanced workshops we can create to ensure you have somewhere to ply your crafts, a full set of bound servants to maintain the property, and a considerable allotment space. From the inherent power present in the manse you will find it much easier to grasp the secrets of essence, as it is a font of gaian magics; as well as any children you may have here bearing the dragon's blood will find it far more likely to exalt in the future, thanks to the potent elemental essence empowering all of its residents. Oh and one final feature we should add, is that it also generates a Hearthstone. This jewel, roughly the size of a chicken's egg, can either aid in your ability to recover essence through proximity or be used to power any magitech you may possess. Should you take it into the world and plant it in the ground, within one hour your manse will sprout from the ground fully formed.

Alternatively, if that isn't enough, you may pay a full 600 cp and get something much more expansive. Instead of merely receiving a dark mirror of your warehouse, each of the various attachments, properties, and lands that follow you will have underworld reflections of their own. These properties shall sit as anchors within the world and each of your properties, in whole or in part, may be made into shadowlands to lead down into this greater Underhaus. Connecting all of these disjointed underworld landmarks will be an underworld appropriate to the world they stand in, a dark world that gains solidity and detail from the memories of the dead. Where none have lived or died, the terrain is grey and nearly featureless phantasms. But where many people have lived their lives and breathed their last, this underworld is filled with dark reflections and remnants of what has been lost. Primeval forests that have since been cut down and burnt for farmland, the remnants of cities lost to war and villages lost to plague, and whatever else has been lost to the sands of time in the world you find yourself in. The population of this underworld, aside from any followers you bring with you, would be composed merely of plasmic creatures and echoes of the dead, not true ghosts of the natives. However, once established below a world, the dead of that place may choose to resist the call of whatever fate would normally remain for them past death, to linger within the Underhaus as ghosts. * Gives all the workshops and lands a underworld layer to craft with plus some other stuff"

This base has a craft bench, equipment workshop, a molecular analysis machine, an RTG that produces a small amount of power perpetually, and a spot for the research dropship to land. In addition, it has a rack with a few standard storage boxes and a bunk room big enough for all of you. You start with all recipes that you get from completing the HUB in-game unlocked. Respawns monthly. In addition, you can keep this and drop it at your starting location in future Jumps, if you want. -Satisfactorio Builder (0CP) The buildy gun from Satisfactory. It can place down buildings and other artificial structures, either from parts or premade. It can deconstruct buildings and other artificial objects, either breaking them down or storing them whole. It can give orders to logistic or construction systems that you are authorized on (including the ones from this Gauntlet.) It can configure the settings of machines. It has an internal inventory that can be upgraded (to a limited extent until you leave the Gauntlet.) Always fully charged, can be upgraded in other ways, automatically imports into similar handheld stuff, and syncs up with other inventory/storage Perks, Items, and items. If lost, stolen, or broken, it will respawn in an appropriate and safe place immediately, even during the Gauntlet. * Builder is required to make use of the HUB, it is also a free item."

Although you will need the knowledge to properly utilize it, the Chrysalis gives all the benefits of a professional, well-funded surgery room in it's compact organic form."

Its output could supply weapons, armor, ammunition, mechanized armor, and miscellaneous supplies for a 50,000 ordinary T'au Fire Caste in combat, constantly, on its own, without worrying about supplies, though upgrading its technologies or providing additional raw materials could increase its output. At your discretion, this factory may be replaced with an orbital Shipyard with similar output capabilities and modularity, save for a required focus on void vessels, aerospace vessels, and the ancillary technologies required to construct them."

You may have the factory create omnics for you as is its purpose, though you will need to supply the materials necessary for doing so. You may also fully customize the appearance, personality, intelligence level, and capabilities of your creations though if the specifications are too far removed from basic omnics, you will need to supply the necessary designs for them."

It will manage itself and churn out research into various mundane technologies on its own, though you can direct it to specific purposes, and will manage its own staffing, though you can hire or fire staff as you please (within limits, don't expect to hire an entire sept to work for this lab). But moreover, this laboratory has some unique properties. Firstly, no research you perform will result in catastrophic destruction, by accident or by sabotage. No nanobots you research here will result in a Grey Goo scenario, no virus will mutate into a global pandemic, no dinosaurs will be unleashed on the public as a staffer flees with their DNA. If such research would normally result in such an issue, your staff will find that their research just stalls, failing to progress at all but not resulting in harm. And secondly, if you deign to perform research in this laboratory personally, then you, and your staff, will find your research accelerated by an order of magnitude as research cycles blaze by and prototype units roll out of machine shops far more quickly than possible, so long as you personally spend at least 40 man-hours a week performing research of some kind, with lesser boosts available if you spend less time contributing to the labs productivity."

From a combat knife to an ack-am launcher to a camouflaged assassin's needler, this fabricator can not only manufacture any handheld weapon it has the schematics for, but it can also merge and customize their functions, appearances, programming and ergonomics to any user's vague, general or very specific requirements. It comes equipped with a knowledgeable gamma-level personality to interpret your requests and offer suggestions. You'll get to specify the personality, so you don't get annoyed by it. The warchive will automatically acquire the blueprints of any weapons you currently possess or acquire to add to its collection, with the stipulation that it cannot reproduce enchantments or other added magical effects, and you may have to supply a bit of raw material and some of the rarer components yourself (like antimatter or setting-specific materials like kryptonite, eezo or uru). The warchive takes up a room which may be placed in your warehouse, a large starship or another property. Naturally, you can restrict access to the warchive."

Even the most exacting genius or craftsman would find no reason to fault letting the systems here do the work for them, allowing them to focus entirely on pushing the boundaries and leaving grunt work to the machines. These systems effectively share your crafting skills and abilities including the effects of perks. If you've purchased the Augmentation Suite and/or Keys to the Matrix then they are seamlessly integrated, and with the Personal Arm Computer the entire sight could be managed trivially from it's interface.

FREE: Spell Cards - The Spell Card system was invented to ensure that youkai and humans could fight each other in a non-lethal way and on relatively even ground.

Accordingly, you too can tone any of your abilities down as low as simply performing pretty light shows, and as your artistic skills improve so will the beauty of your spell card attacks. FREE: Flight: You can fly, a power that is nigh-universal in Gensokyo. Flying as fast as you can walk is simple, and you can push yourself to fly faster, up to how fast you can run, which will tire you proportionately. FREE: Cute Girls - Nobody in these manga are anything but cute, and by taking this perk you share this same trait. For free, all minor traits that would detract from your appearance (including blemishes, bodily hair and especially armpit hair) are cleared up.

This doesn't help you learn a skill - instead, it lets you take a skill you've already gotten to a solid point, and lets you push it to the level of preternatural mastery. Instead of slowing down and growing more difficult, your learning becomes easier and speeds up when it hits the normal point of diminishing return. Eventually you'll hit a new plateau, but it's well on the far side of 'inhuman.' This will usually take about as much time and effort as it took you to become a journeyman in that skill in the first place.

Then, if you were to focus on magic yourself, would it not be appropriate to have the same skillset? Certainly, your natural ability in these disciplines would make you a welcome guest in any mage society. You have the grit it takes to repeat an experiment as many times as it takes to get results, know how to be objective in all things related to your job and look at things without any biases, even subconscious ones, and live with the tenets of the scientific method in your mind. Most importantly of all, you have an intuitive and instinctive understanding of scientific principles. Even if you were a farm boy with no formal education to speak of, just a few years of schooling could get you to the point where you would make observations and discoveries that would impress even people with PhDs in those fields. This scales with your knowledge and expertise, so I have high expectations if you were already smart before getting this perk. You also won't get bogged down with false positives or negatives: in anything you do or try, you know whether it is possible at all, and if you get a result, whether it is truthful, and if it is not, what you can do to make it so. Yet another problem that many scientists face is the lacking relevancy and application of their research in real life. But no more. At any time, you have an instinctive knowledge of what you should prioritize in your research. Some madman is trying to conquer the galaxy in secret? You'll get a hunch that it might be time to work on that antimatter generator again. The aftereffects of a supernova will cook your planet with radiation in a few years? A spark of inspiration will cause you to create vastly improved radiation shields and implement them planetwide for a test run. From a certain perspective, it really does look like the hand of a God is guiding your scientific aspirations. Do you have blue skin, perchance?"

With training you'll be able to use more complex puppets and perform more complex maneuvers with them, maybe eventually using multiple puppets at same time. Includes training to care for and repair your puppet, a battle puppet to use it on, and increased skill with designing and building mechanical things (such as ninja puppets). Puppets usually rely on mechanical weaponry, such as poisoned blades and napalm to dish out the hurt. Particularly sturdy puppets can be used as shields and front line fighters instead though. The chakra strings used to control the puppets are constructs made from concentrated chakra so they can be seen with a naked eye, though a skilled user can suppress the chakra so that the strings become hard to see, or even invisible. They essentially act as an extension of the user which allows the manipulation of whatever is attached to their strings, such as hidden weaponry in a puppet as they please. They can also be attached to other objects, allowing the user to control, or at the very least disrupt other things. Chakra can also be transferred via the strings, such as to activate techniques that the puppets can use. If you purchase this, you may select Sunagakure as your starting location for free, as the art of puppetry originates from there."

You can intuit a machine's function or weaknesses simply by looking at it, as well as judge what it can do and how you can break them, and how to improve them simply by watching it run for a few moments. Not only that, but you know how to understand the fundamental psychology of a thinking machine, how to manipulate, limit, or liberate such a machine, and how to (perhaps) convince it not to seek to destroy or control humanity. You can fundamentally understand any machine or technology you're exposed to, though you'll have to experiment with it and test the limits of it to maximize this understanding. Note, this isn't Technopathic control over machines, merely the ability to feel how they function... of course, it also allows you to intuit any kind of machine password, no matter how unlikely cracking it might otherwise be."

With enough work, you can even get some of your items to somehow “mate” and have baby items, which sometimes inherit traits from their parents. However, there are a few risks to shifting your items toward an organic level. First, with intelligence comes independence, so hopefully they won’t enter a rebellious phase against their caretaker. Second, just as it is possible for your chosen items to give birth, it is also now possible for them to die. On the other hand, items, particularly magical ones, may have heartier constitutions than most organisms (for instance, an enchanted ice crystal is unlikely to get frostbite, and a flaming sword is hardly going to pass out from heat stroke. Also, try as you like, you will never be able to determine exactly how your items mate; all you know is that if they are left close by each other for an extended duration, you will start finding babies."

There was no incentive for research, as all that could be done by means of technology had been done.

This Path, above all else, is dedicated to the reclamation of ancient knowledge and the acquisition of new information. You have walked this Path for some time, and each bend in the Path bears its own experiences and rewards. Your years of study have given you a cursory knowledge of the biology of the lesser species and of your own, including your dark kin, and the history of multiple civilizations dead and alive. Perhaps, if you were to find a head garment made of animal hide, shaped in a wide brim, you would retain your grace and poise while wearing it. Seeing as you are an accomplished archaeologist, you are gifted with the skills to excavate and piece together the past using psychometry and intuition.

In any case, your mind is able to access scientific advancements that humanity has not yet reached, and recognizes signs of approaching large-scale events civilization-changing in scale, like the Melding Plague and the activation of the Inhibitors - in ways humans do not normally sense. The benefit is that warnings of large-scale change come back clearly, as do hints about crucial, necessary technological advancements, allowing you to build things decades or centuries in advance of what you might otherwise have. This information is very 'noisy', jumbled and hard to pick out details, but you can usually understand the gist of the principles - a few equations that would otherwise have stumped you, a new reference frame from which to look at a problem, or a warning ahead of a time of destruction.

The release of the Hyperdrive design has led to a new arms race of unprecedented might but that also means you can end up caught completely off-guard. Over-extending your technological R&D into missiles might end up with your forces utterly outmatched if an enemy starts equipping their ships with masses of point defenses, ECM, and other anti-missile systems, and the same is true if you're built to defend against mass drivers and suddenly face ships with energy beams instead. If only you had a decent energy weapon or some Mass Drivers instead and now, you likely will. You and your people will find that any kind of military technology, be it weaponry, defenses, or any other such systems you need for your forces, is now merely the first option of many. The time and effort needed to develop alternative military options (based on existing but 'lesser' methods you might possess) to match what you can already do is vastly reduced. So if your most powerful weapon is a Mass Driver of some sort (say a Quantum Driver), you could get your hands on Beam Weapons or Missile tech that are equally effective - except your opponent might not have suitable defenses for them. Likewise, if all you have is armor and your foes start using beam weapons, your desk will probably see a report or two on breakthroughs in shield technologies before the week is over. Furthermore, you'll find that adjusting any existing systems you have deployed is far easier than it otherwise was - modular components and interchangeable system parts ensuring that equipping your fleets with what they need to turn the tide is not going to stay a mere idea."

Core Competence (400CP) The Cradle is a dangerous place for the Spiral Order, and not only due to it's indigenous wildlife. There are too many unknowns, too many variables to be comfortable with. That is why it falls to people like you, One of the most naturally gifted researchers within the Order, to increase the odds of safety. Your attention to detail has increased dramatically, letting you pick out and recognize patterns in the construction and design of machinery much more quickly than others. Understanding these patterns has given you incredible insights into technology found in the Cradle and in the Gremlin bases, along with how it can compare and blend with technology of the Order you are so familiar with... and your own, which you are even more familiar with. When the Order finally reaches The Core, perhaps you will be one of the most likely members of it to unlock the secrets held within."

This ability is heavily reliant on your resources, how difficult a problem the completely, incredibly different thing is, and pays out only in the long term, but it's worth it. In honor of Cave, I'll explain it using Aperture's history. In the 1940's the curtain company Aperture Fixtures tried to solve a problem that our Earth scientific community still has no definite answer for: the shower curtain effect. Somehow, Cave's engineers managed to solve it by creating a quantum tunnel between the inside and outside of a shower. In the 50's, they were researching that effect with funding second only to Black Mesa and used astronauts and Olympians as test subjects. They threw employee safety and retention out the window, disregarded every form of ethics imaginable, and were ultimately driven into an absurd level of bankruptcy thirty years later. Even when the company was on its last legs after GLaDOS was activated and tried to kill everyone with neurotoxin, she described the team at Aperture as being the greatest minds of a generation. This can be considered the perfect scenario for helping this perk function at full capacity. Fifty years of constant, no expenses spared, abnormally efficient research primarily focused on a single effect using a gigantic testing facility and eschewing all concerns except results. A Jumper doesn't have to disregard ethics to have the perk working at that level, but they'd need to use human equivalent robots like GLaDOS eventually did. What did that half century result in? They perfected the portal gun, which functions by harnessing and stabilizing a black hole in a device half the size of someone's arm. Ignoring the potential for free energy with careful use of portals, they built the black hole equivalent of a dyson sphere and used it to create tunnels in the fabric of reality. Why? Because fifty years ago, they wanted to make a really useful shower curtain. That's what this perk can look like. It's never clear when this perk is going to proc, but it will happen often enough to make the capstone worth taking. If the Jumper isn't helping it run at peak capacity or spending decades on one project, it'll result in innovations that are still useful but aren't on the level of the portal gun. Some examples are repulsion gel, storage containers that can survive the heat of the sun, tiny fusion reactors, and footwear that allows a human to jump off a building and land unharmed. Technologies researched with this ability can't always be generalized. The portal gun uses a black hole to tear holes in the fabric of reality, but that was the only thing Aperture could reliably do with one. They didn't have any ability to build a black hole into a weapon or use it for energy."

Naturally, you also understand other forms of machinery much better than normal now. If you wanted to, surely you could find the best place to get the parts you need."

Plug In Chips can upgrade the functions of a robot's body, making them faster or improving their mental faculties or even giving them incredible new abilities but all robots can only handle so much increased power due to these Chips, though that storage can be upgraded. You'll need to find or buy more Chips to gain such effects however. For 200CP this option may be upgraded. You now gain a few dozen Chips of varying uses, from attack enhancers to things that will automatically collect loot for you in a short area around you. You don't have every Plug In Chip in the game nor can you hold more than the normal max storage for a YoRHa unit but you are instead given the knowledge on how to create and combine Plug In Chips of your own, as well as how to upgrade storage capacity.

Your magic energy is enough to provide the necessary activation energy, and it'll drain you for as long as it's functioning, but you can convert freely between bullets and lasers, such that your gatling gun will now spray laser beams, while your laser cannon can fire heavy shell rounds, your missiles can explode into plasma, and so forth.

Where an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, Kinetic Theory can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy so too with the behaviour of intelligent beings. Psychohistory allows the long-range prediction and manipulation of the future, provided the population is of sufficient size, without directly infringing on the free will of the individual. Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil. Nano Karmatron Theory Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness. It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs. These Imaginos Bodies are a perfect fusion of the will of the mind and the power of the physical form. However, at least with the current state of Karmatron Dynamics, very few are capable of making the transition successfully their wills disintegrating their body into a screaming crumble. At the moment, only karmic singularities individuals of exceptional and unpredictable influence on the destiny of mankind can be reasonably expected to make the leap into the new flesh. Their base appearance reflects the self-image of the mind. As the mind reflects upon itself it may learn to change colour and gradually shape. Assimilation of cherished weapons, generation of new systems and limbs, intuitive hacking the full capacity of the Imaginos is limited only by the imagination and will. With Karma Chameleon, you injected yourself with a prototype form of the Imaginos nanomachines. The result is initially little more than human, but far more capable of self-improvement and adaptation and it can be actively guided and designed by your own will. Effectively starts with Regenerator Nano, which will usually become slower and slower as your body becomes more powerfully augmented. With Berserker Body, you now have an Imaginos v1 body.

You can walk into an Advanced Calculus classroom and then walk out with the professor whimpering on the floor ten minutes later. I'm pretty sure you'll be showing up other scientists in no time! But, uh, do try to go out more, alright? All that textbook reading isn't gonna do wonders for your eyesight. Cuh-Ray-Zee! (0CP) The moment you step into the world of Devil May Cry, you, and anyone you brought with you, will have the innate potential to do incredibly amazing stuff all day long, pal. However, it will take great skill and effort to pull off anything like blocking attacks with the back of your hand, or playing an air guitar that actually produces audible sound for others to hear. But never fear, if you train hard enough, and git gud enough, you too will be able to deflect bullets with other bullets, destroy buildings by spouting out innuendos, and become a worthy disciple of my ways. And yes, you totally get to see your rank whenever you're doing anything. Taunts (0CP) Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries! You are able to come up with witty dialogue, insults, jokes, and one-liners on the fly. Now, taunting does three very useful things. First, it will boost your Style rating. I know, I know, that's amazing, and awesome, and all that. Second, taunting pisses off your enemies. A lot. So much that they'll try to stomp your pretty little face in. While this may seem like a bad thing, it can also be good for you, as the dumbass you're fighting will make a mistake in their rage. And thirdly, a successful taunt will help you get your game on and replenish your stamina. You won't be able to run entirely on smack-talking suckers while you rip them a new rectal cavity, but it will definitely ensure that you'll be able to fight for hours, sustained only by the power of your quips. Weapon Swapping (0CP) The ability to swap between your weapons in the middle of battle. These weapons are stored in a pocket dimension known only to you, and can be switched instantly with but a thought. Style: Trickster (0CP) Ah, Trickster Style, what a life saver you are. This here is the easiest style for beginners, but don't go thinking that it's some sort of newbie exclusive deal. Trickster allows you to quickly dash and dodge around enemy attacks in the blink of an eye, allowing you to quickly weave away from their attacks and get behind them, strike from the blind spot, and then dash away before they know what hit 'em. You can also do some sick wall running, dash while in the air, and do a short-range teleport that'll either get you some breathing space, or put you right above your enemy, ready to deliver a badass plunging attack"

Not creative or innovative like your normal thoughts, but absolutely patient, and never stopping, slowing, or growing bored. If you need a material with a certain set of properties, they can go over everything you know about material science and systematically work through it until they find such a material. If you need to make a process more efficient, they can systematically go over all possible iterations, checking them one by one, simplifying one way, then another, and another, seeing what works and what doesn't. You always know how many steps you went up or down on a stairway, how long your stride was, how many windows you passed, and other such points of data. This doesn't give you bottomless memory, but the machine minds in the back of your head miss nothing, and can ponder anything and everything. They can even outperform a more brilliant mind, because they never dismiss anything and leave no stone unturned, even ones a more intuitive thinker would overlook. They excel at keeping the facts in mind, and only the facts. What they lack in creativity or innovation they make up for in being utterly systematic. You also find it easier to work methodically through things with your normal thoughts, and when you do you can work with the machine thoughts, using your intuition and creativity to help them overcome problems and find solutions faster. These extra thought trains always equal your normal ones in raw processing, but are otherwise crippled as described above. However, they will take on weakened shadows of any mental or social enhancing perks you possess. For example, if you have the Social Intelligence perk, they will pick up on social data, and can work with it despite not being creative or intuitive, processing through such data in bulk to help you solve larger social questions. They won't be as capable as if you focused on those things with your normal thoughts, but their methodical approach means they can handle bigger datasets then you can, and nothing stops you from considering the ideas and thoughts they come up with your normal less restricted thought processes."

It’s almost like you think things are meant to be difficult here for you or something. When it comes to lost magic or technology, events align to make it simple for you to figure out how to use it and all its little features. As long as the main purpose is for something lewd. Whether that’s on the original technology or just your purposes, that’s what you’ll find so effortlessly easy to learn. The rest? If it’s mostly perverted in purpose already, that stuff follows easily. Otherwise you’ll just find yourself unnaturally talented and still need to put in some hard work. An ancient language might take a month to decipher as opposed to years but the instructions to a variety of chemicals that alter the body in perverted ways take just minutes to understand."

Either way, you're a brilliant and creative man but the first special advantage is great talent for improving and iterating upon the inventions of others. So long as another made it, you find yourself naturally realising how and where it could be improved, finding it easy to accomplish these further developments and even having some skill at taking the parts you like of a technology and applying them to something else. The other special trait you gain is to instead focus on the advancement of technology yourself, making new technology comes far faster to you, especially if no one else has explored the present field.

Indeed, this perk, in addition to paying the full 800 CP price above, would let you even be an extra-dimensional being like a Dreen or somesuch, limited by and large only by your own imagination. But that aside, you’re the finest, most capable beings of your kind anywhere out there. Physically, mentally… in every way that counts, your actions come across as deeper, more important, your everything screams of something that defies any and all mortal limits. Indeed, none apply to you now. Any limits on your training, physical capacity, mental enhancements… any limits on anything relating to you ceases to exist. You can grow without end, continuing in an endless growth regardless of how much or how little sense it might make. Exemplar Boosted: Your talents with the sparks cross the basic boundaries all the way, transforming you into something altogether beyond. You have had the second breakthrough, the transformation that makes you from a Spark into true Spark Royalty! You are like one of the Immortal God-Queens of old, of which only a precious few remain today. You’re not a fully grown, matured God-Spark like Albia, but you’re further along than Agatha or Lord Snackleford. Along with having psychic powers like levitation and telepathy, you can release blasts of pure energy to scour your foes from the earth. You can see in more than three dimensions, and even interact with beings beyond the mortal plane in several ways. You have the power to shapeshift freely, going from giant to normal in an instant, and acquiring any colour, appearance or form you desire. You can possess willing subjects, and break any mind control or subversion on your subjects. You can control energy in various forms, most of them rather unspecified. Most importantly, of course, your talents with actual Sparking transcend any ordinary sparks entirely, being almost as much beyond them as they are beyond mundane scientists. You have a surfeit of ideas, almost as if you can do anything! You don’t even need to bother with Madness Places very much anymore, that is, being ‘Suspended in an Eternal Moment of Supreme Clarity’. You do retain your ability to scare lesser minds out of their skin just by talking. Oh, and you gain a rotating Halo of any symbols of your choice, turning around your head in an endless circle. Basically, you have somewhat weaker versions of any powers displayed by Albia, even those not mentioned here. And you would grow to match her as soon as you acquire enough experience. You can hide the obvious bits of this, but why would you want to?"

      "description": "Elder Immortal (300CP) Not some young thing anymore, are you? No, you've been here for quite a while. Centuries in fact. Instead of starting as a hot blooded youth, just coming into their immortal life, you'll begin as an immortal who has already been present in this world for several hundred years. While this has certainly given you a wealth of background memories, provided you chose to have any, the main effect this has is that it has boosted certain perks to account for centuries of use, practice and study. These perks will be marked with an (EI) in their title and their effects will be described in a second paragraph below the main perk description. If you choose a Demihuman option that has powers of it's own, Elder Immortal will also give similar levels of skill and experience with them as it would do the perks and immortality options. Scientist (200CP) The power that you need is all there in your head already. The many disciplines of science and academics became your swords and spells to use against your foes. With a brilliant mind able to keep up with humanity's best, you've taken on a very wide degree of learning in a variety of different fields. Enough that even without specialising in a specific study, you can do things like creating combat capable robots, jetpacks, laser weapons, short ranged teleports and a variety of other devices able to mimic lower strength magic. Focusing on one field in particular might let you threaten a moderately strong wizard or fighter with your creations. You do need to put in the time and resources to create things however. With this, you'll start with a few decent creations to help you in battle, such as some capable firearms and armor or a powerful robotic assistant you created. Elder Immortal Boost Centuries of study, research and cribbing from every other genius you can have left you quite the astounding genius. Your mind boosted into the stratosphere by training and enhancements, it's allowed you to come to be close or even an equal to legends like Chao herself. With enough time and money, there is little that is impossible for you to create through science. Time and dimension travel, space elevators to connect Earth and Mars, machines or cyborg bodies capable of destroying entire cities. It's all possible, though some can still be pretty time consuming, and choosing to specialise will greatly aid your speed and talent."

You now have, and thus are, one of the strongest Sparks on the planet now, an absolute, blazing genius like Agatha Heterodyne,either of the Wulfenbachs, Dr Vapnoople, or others at the same tier. The Spark, that something that makes the wonders of this world possible, is plugged into your mind and soul, inflaming it, filling it with a fire that boosts your mental facilities to unbelievable extents such that many things that should be impossible... suddenly aren't. While you specialise in some field to extraordinary degrees, like being able to create artificial sparks if you choose 'Von Neumann Clanks', your genius is unbound by the petty concerns lesser sparks suffer from, allowing you to shine equally bright in every field from Microbiology to Trans-Dimensional Aeronautics. You have an instinctive grasp for scientific principles, can reverse engineer technology more or less just from seeing it, and have a head for calculation and numbers that defies belief. You can decrypt data in your head, have a completely flawless memory, and are in general the quintessential Mad Scientist. Complete with a gift for cackling and rants that can terrify anyone who isn't, by the way. When in the Madness Place, especially, you have an outright effect that allows you to warp time and space in a small area around you, letting you do weeks' worth of work in hours, and outright warp, twist, spindle the mutilate the very laws of physics as you craft your wonders... and horrors. Apart from the SCIENCE!, you have a charisma that borders on mind control, as anyone without a spark, or an exceptionally strong willpower is drawn into your orbit by your sheer force of will, ready to help and serve wherever they can. Your body is also somewhat better than most, allowing you to go all those allnighters without food and fight off highly trained fighters while barely paying attention. Exemplar Boosted Your talents with the sparks cross the basic boundaries all the way, transforming you into something altogether beyond.

Not only that, but you can deliberately forget anything you've ever learned... and be perfectly aware you've deleted it... and undelete it later if you feel like it, though you can never be compelled to do that last. You could even schedule it to undelete itself at some later date. Anyone attempting to access your memory without your permission is liable to get lost in the nigh-infinite maze of idle wonderings or catalogues of all the itches you've ever had and never be heard from again.

Create a cure for cancer, true cybernetic bodies, unlock the secrets of turning matter to pure energy or creating true space flight. They'll likely take years of work but you well and truly can change the world. But why cure cancer when you can make superheroes and monsters instead? You might have a world class mind but you also have truly superb talent for creating technology meant to interact with super powers. Giving, taking or altering the superhuman powers found in this world. Making a man have the powers of a spider or creating a monstrous symbiote superweapon or sealing the negative powers of a poor young child. Even technology meant to enhance, weaken or otherwise interact with these powers is within your grasp.

You are a creative and intuitive genius that could build futuristic projects, make armours capable of fighting veteran Viltrumites to a standstill and reverse engineer or better alien technologies that are centuries more advanced than you are. You are also quite skilled at cloning technologies and enhancing normal people far beyond their original limits through cybernetics, genetic modification and incredibly sophisticated gear. Without a doubt you are one of the most intelligent individuals in the world, with a knack for the physical and mass production sides of science. While you can go beyond the more physical sciences, it may take you about fifteen years to properly create a time travel device or a device that would allow you to hop between universes. Capstone Boosted: Screw being one of the smartest beings on the planet you are without a doubt the smartest being on the planet. Master time travel technology, hop between universes before brunch, build incredible FTL drives. You alone could catapult the Earth into being a major player in the galaxy through technological prowess within your lifetime. Screw reverse engineering alien tech, aliens now want to reverse engineer your tech. You Have Been Reborn (400CP) You have somehow been caught in a time machine accident, and have been reconstituted with molecules from millions of years in the future. Thanks to this you have become better than you once were, far better. You have gained slightly beyond peak human physical and mental attributes, and neither your body or skills ever degrade in any way due to the passing of time or lack of exertion. Given time and effort you could easily win the entire Olympics if you'd like, break world records daily, become the greatest Chess Master in the world, these are all now possible for you. Beyond this however you have gained a minor ability to use Telekinesis. Able to use Telekinesis to lift a maximum of 10 lbs currently, though should you train enough this ability will quickly grow seemingly without limit. Given a year or two, you might be able to lift houses with no effort. More than this however these future atoms seem to have had an interesting effect on your existing abilities and will operate as a Capstone Booster on all capstones."

      "description": "Building things is a major part of the Starbound experience, and with this perk, you gain a leg-up on crafting and building. You now have a basic knowledge of how to craft things, to the point where you can take a mental concept for some simple item or piece of furniture and flesh it out into a full crafting blueprints given a few hours to sit and think about it. Anvil Specialty You know how to shape metal, extracting it from ores and turning it into items, mostly melee weapons of various sorts. You have an instinctive understanding of how to make different alloys, and you can even break down existing metals and reshape them, without the metals weakening. Farming Specialty You have an instinctive knowledge of how to make plants grow, even those with more exotic requirements. Plants under your care will flourish, even those that might normally require extremely delicate care, and best of all, the growth of any plants in your care is extremely accelerated. Plants that might take months to produce a harvest will grow to fruition in mere weeks, or possibly even days. Kitchen Specialty You are a whiz in the kitchen, capable of making dishes with a variety of health benefits, that also happen to be both filling and delicious. The foods that you make will actually produce tangible bonuses in those that eat them, starting with enhanced healing, and branching out into increased strength, agility, energy, resistance to heat or flame, to such exotic effects as glowing in the dark or damaging those that touch you. Medicine Specialty You can make a variety of medical treatments, suitable for handling a wide range of bumps, bruises, burns, and more. Your treatments will have boosted effectiveness, with everything from your bandages on up promoting healing beyond the norm. You also know how to make certain chemical stimulants, which can safely (and non-addictively) provide a boost to those who use them. Tech Specialty Beyond the twelve basic Techs, there are many more possibilities for implanted techbased abilities. With this perk, you gain the ability to craft techs for yourself, which could perform functions such as creating a temporary sphere of null gravity around you, giving you a short ranged burst of super-speed, allowing you to shoot energy from the soles of your feet to fly, or even giving you a short-range, line-of-sight teleport. You will have to work out how to craft these abilities for implanting, and you'll have greater success with designing tech-based versions of movement abilities that you already possess. However, the more powerful the ability, the more energy it will take as a Tech. Only three Techs can be implanted in any one person at a given time."

It may take hours to complete as it weakens the donor’s ability to resist further climaxes, but only does so when the last of the donors involved is overcome. The rarer, or larger, the amount of energy you require the more that will need to be taken from the donors, and there is a chance that there may not be enough for the intended purpose.

A particularly despised design (mostly by enemies, sometimes by allies) are electrified cogs designed to drain mana and harm any enemies who draw near. Also includes the groundwork for a suit of armor able to stand up against mythic beasts and sorcery alike, giving you the strength of an army and protection stronger than most bunkers. While some would overlook it, grappling hooks can be projected enormously well with some of these mechanisms, allowing you to fly across battlefields. Aircrafts: While most have long since accepted the idea of mechanical flight to be impossible, some Keen have held on to the dream, you included. At last, it has paid off. You've gotten a basic design for a fully functioning flying machine, able to mount weapons and withstand some amount of stress. Expanding that into something good for transport (the initial design might hold up to two people, if you give up fighting) is your prerogative, but really? YOU'VE DEVELOPED FLIGHT! TAKE THAT, STUPID WIZARDS! Guns: Exactly what it sounds like. Tubular devices which discharge projectiles at high speeds, there's no muss or fuss about what it does, even if making a good design might be fiddly. Includes good prototypes for personal firearms such as rifles and light artillery such as cannons. Groundwork to scale upwards for versions mounted on ships, castles, or flying devices is included, but finalization is your job."

Any combat utility is purely incidental... but certainly welcomed. Rocketry: Projectiles propelled by internal combustion. It's simple, some would call it crude, but it works. Includes the underlying theory behind heat-seekers, intercontinental systems, homing technology, and of course, explosives. Although, everything other than that last one will likely require some personal touches to maximize combat ability. Robotics: Simple and clean, it is the construction of independently moving machinery, otherwise known as robots. Does not include much in the way of AI. Basic designs are better than any knight, but numbers are the best bet against most enemies to be found here unless you devote significant time towards the construction of any given craft.

There are (3) particular fields you've studied, and have a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge of, for both general tool development and combat duty. Choose from the following. Transdimensional Theory: Particularly exotic and full of potential, the field of transdimensional studies is rather young and as much as it has allowed incredible advances it also has brought forth great calamities. Never forget the Violet Plateau Incident. Either way, while you are only able to study dimensional and spatial anomalies caused by other sources for now, the idea of crossing continents with the press of a button, calling resources and tools from faraway bases and workshops then sending them back home once you're done, and exploring new universes entirely remains a very realistic goal. Just, keep in mind that there's plenty of nightmarish monstrosities sitting around our reality which would just love it if some schmuck opened the door for them. I reckon that'll probably stop being a problem for you in a decade's time, but still. Chainsaws, Chains, Saws, and General Anti-Flora Equipment: Besides the utility for wood harvesting purposes, you also have great knowledge of what to do with wood itself, being able to engineer around wood's strong and weak points in order to replace metal during the construction of things such as armor or general machinery. Why, you could even create a suit of armor able to cut down forests in record time while defending from any attacking trees, saw whirling around you as an active defense, chains pulling you along while tearing leafage from its foundation, and your main blade spinning around the battlefield to cut down any straggling trees. Does not come with traumatic memories of plant-based murder or rampant paranoia."

Most people tend to have dozens of skills at this level. ◦ Level 1 (100cp) Relative talent that lets the user perform the skill up to a professional level, while it’s not bad by any means, one shouldn’t expect to gain fame with this alone. For example, Sill Plain possess a Level 1 Skill at Magic, while she is decent in the magic arts and can use it effectively in battle, there’s a lack of power and versatility. ◦ Level 2 (200cp) At this point the user is a genius at their skill. More than enough to create unique signature abilities. Respected swordsmen like Rick Addison or Rance have a Sword Combat Skill of Level 2, it what lets them create their special attacks. For comparison Shizuka Masou also possess a Level 2 Skill at Magic. ◦ Level 3 (500cp) This level is basically legendary, and the user is the best of the best at the skill. Few people in history had a skill at this level and their potential is insanely high. As example, Annise Sawatari has the Magic Skill Level 3 and easily overpowers any other mage in the Continent.

      "description": "As a product of evolutionary science and genetic modification yourself, you have learned to incorporate genetic algorithms into essentially any software you construct. Genetic software starts out a little clunky depending how good a programmer you are to start with but over time it evolves and improves itself to suit its purpose, whether that's target tracking software that learns to ignore feints and decoys or a word processor that improves its UI and file format to suit its users. The end result, after many iterations, is something exceptionally honed to its purpose, without placing the burden on the programmer to get it perfect the first time. Now take care: The transhuman mind is considered software itself, so tread cautiously should you attempt to blend these algorithms with psychosurgery. Down that path many Exhumans have already tread, and while each one certainly became better suited to their chosen path, I'm not sure how many could really be called successes."

Not just in computer hardware, although the NerveGear and Medicuboid inventions have revolutionised entertainment and medical treatment for terminal patients, but also in the fields of computer software and code design. He was instrumental in the goal of crafting artificial intelligence, serving both as the creator regarding top-down AI such as Yui and Cardinal and massive inspiration and guide for the bottom-up AI known as Fluctlight. Now, you happen to be just as smart as him. A revolutionary in electronic hardware and software design, able to recreate his inventions and even improve on them with your own special touches (or perhaps just more time and prior working examples), you possess all the knowledge and skills this one man was known for. Crafting your own virtual worlds is now entirely possible, as is life born of electronics and computer code instead of flesh and blood. The very secrets of the soul are now known to you, Jumper, in the form of Fluctlight creation."

Instead of having an expert level of knowledge and proficiency, you are considered to be one of the absolute best transhumanity can offer in that particular field. It would take a serious handicap for you to screw up at whatever this skill is. You can purchase this perk multiple times, applying to a different skill package each time. Skill Packages (800CP) You get the Gear for all Skill Packages you purchase. A skill package gives you professional levels of proficiency in the main areas, as well as minor proficiency in related areas (fanwank as needed). Eg: it would be safe to assume that someone with the Marksman package could use a tactical network or mapping software to make sure they're in the right position, calculate bullet drop at long range, or identify common guns by sight, in addition to the primary skill of shooting things. Biohacker You are skilled in designing genetically modified organisms from existing species. This includes developing Uplifts (if the base species is smart enough) and designing new transgenic morphs and designer organisms. Gear: Healing vat Hard Hat You are an expert software engineer, capable of writing programs to carry out complex and interlinked tasks. You could write an AI from scratch (in time) and design simulspaces for the best VR games and sims. Gear: Software writing AI, work simulspace environment. Mega-Engineering You like to build big things. Spaceships capable of holding thousands of people, space habitats, surface colonies, dams, ocean- spanning bridges, orbital elevators. Knowing how the diverse systems that megastructures need interact with the forces they are under is just as important as how they are arranged. Gear: Structural Sim Simulspace, Engineering AI. White Hat You are an expert at defending your personal WAN or other networks and mesh sites from intrusion, finding backdoors and backtracing the physical location of intruders. Gear: Firewall software & Sysadmin Assistant AI Black Hat You are an expert at breaking into secure computer networks or mesh sites and wreaking as much havoc as you like. Security AIs are no match for you, but a competent sysadmin can make things very difficult or even impossible for you. Gear: Kaos AI & Common Exploit Software bundle. Device Engineering You are an expert at designing and building portable and mobile items from scratch. Anything from a flashlight up to a flying car. You can build items from scrounged materials and put disused materials to new uses without having to disassemble it all the way back to raw materials. Gear: Disassembly tools & wrist-mounted tools augmentation. MedTech You are a medical technician, trained in emergency first aid and field surgery - you know, the kind they used to do before they could just dump the injured in a healing vat and let the nanomachines do the work. You can install and remove over-the-counter cyberware and wetware, and perform reconstructive surgery. Gear: Doctor-Bot (contains a healing vat). Nanotechnician You specialise in building things small. You are capable of designing most types of nanotech systems, from flea-sized microbots, free- roaming nanoswarms, internal nanoware for morphs, and the nanofabrication systems that make life in the solar system possible through Fabbers, Makers and Desktop Cornucopia Machines. Gear: A nanoengineering simulspace & a General Nanobot Hive capable of manufacturing any nanites up to current transhuman level."

A magical girl’s transformation magic could be broken down and reproduced in the form of a henshin device, while an eldritch horror’s regeneration power could lead you to a cure for cancer, or of cloning the beast and creating loyal monster spawn based off of it. Naturally your perverse proclivities color the effects of your work: while you are able to produce “ordinary” technologies with this perk, you will find it a much easier process if your work contains side-effects or dependencies of a perverse nature. Certainly you can learn how to harness the power of love as a renewable energy source but if that source requires a magical girl to be hooked up to a fucking machine and used as a human generator then so much the better!"

To you however these seem like silly limitations to have when one has the potential to bring so much peace and prosperity to the world with these amazing inventions. You happen to have the best ability for the job of ushering in this new age as well. As long as you look closely at something hard enough and do some basic study it is possible to completely understand the inner workings of any technology or object down to the tiniest details. While this works best for technology anything that is an object will do just fine. No object or piece of technology whether it be slightly ahead of modern times to the cosmic magitech of the future can't be understood by you. As mentioned above objects and technology in this sense even has a very loose definition as it can range from robots, indestructible metal, swords that grant the power of gods, to even the ultimate of Macguffins. You'll be able to reverse engineer and mass produce practically anything you want from in a cave with a box of scraps. The objects will always contain their original properties but you can go further beyond that. You can alter the properties, strengthen them, weaken them, make it so only select people can wield them, and much more. With enough creativity and effort you may even create superior items than the original ever was."

The knowledge that a few errant bubbles in a flask can quickly turn into boiling so violently that even the open end of it isn't enough to let all of its energy out, turning it into a chemical explosive, is not lost on you. Neither is the fact that that open flask over there just bubbled when a piece of dust fell into it. If you're running the experiments, you know how to avoid those circumstances, and how to extinguish the fires if and when they break out."

However, you know how to make the experience mutually beneficial. If you are infected with a parasite, you can merge with the parasite and take control of it, thus preventing it from harming you; in fact, the parasite, having merged with you, will now often be beneficial for your body, covering defences that your body alone could not handle. You will essentially be sharing the same mind and memory (with you in charge), and since the host (you) is now bonded with the parasite, there will be no further conflict over living space or control. On the flipside, if you are in the form of a parasite and have infected a living host, you can, by gaining consent from the host or by overpowering the host's will, merge with the host, you becoming the host and the host becoming the parasite. Either way, parasite or host, you remain the dominant one in the bond. If you wish to break off the merge on either end of the spectrum, you can separate again, on condition that the parasite (even if it's you) will be automatically ejected from the host's body. Please note that the perk applies not only to physical parasitism, but also spiritual forms of parasitism such as possession (which is also pretty common here with things like Cursed Swords)."

No matter how flimsy or how little it leaves to the imagination, your armor is just that. Armor. A steel plate bikini is as good as a set of full steel plate, and something made of a magical metal like mythril would be even better. Basically, you can now get away with absurd ‘fantasy style armor’ without the logical consequences of leaving your boobs/abdomen exposed that would normally ensue."

      "description": "Science is a learning process and sometimes that learning process involves explosions, malfunctions, or idiots messing with things they shouldn't. Well, they used to, anyways. When technology you've built or used would normally suffer a malfunction or an experiment would become a disaster, it will instead create a harmless inconvenience instead of blowing up in your face. A device's sensitive power core being struck would see it shut down immediately, a DNA serum you inject into yourself gives you mild indigestion instead of mutating you into a horrible monster, and so on. If a result would be entirely negative for you, the impact is dulled to a comical accident instead of something that could endanger your life and those of others. How lucky for you. FREE: Smartest In Five Galaxies [Free for Genius] – Three galaxies! THREE! Why is that so hard to get right?! Either way, people tend not to question or doubt you in your fields of expertise, which given your experiences on this journey, might well be a lot of things! When you speak, others tend to believe you're the smartest one in the room or at least somebody worth listening to when it comes to a matter you're an expert of, like advanced technology or just using common sense. Even if you've done very questionable things with that expertise, people tend to consider your input important enough to at least hear out. FREE: Look, this sort of thing just happens. Sometimes you're doing a normal experiment and suddenly the lab has an accident and now whatever you're working on is starting to talk to you. When it does, it's your duty to take responsibility for it like a good creator should. Whenever you create life, whether by accident or design, you know how to properly treat and either tame or raise your creations. Regardless of whether they're as smart as a small puppy or able to speak fluently in your language a day in, you know how to treat them properly to the point they will obey you or at least not try to bite your head off. This only works if you don't abuse or hurt them, mind, so try not to be an idiot when your toaster starts speaking in tongues."

The Minds and Ships you build have a strong loyalty and connection to you.

      "description": "Very few are capable of touching the Lance of Longinus and surviving. Only two men at this time are great enough to truly wield it. The reason for this is that the Lance seeks to protect itself from outsiders, burning away at the body, mind and soul of any who touch it without permission. Only those of earth shattering power can bypass this without being the true owner of the Lance. Now they'll need the same permission to touch anything that you own. So long as it is a possession of yours, you are able to extend this same three target ward to any object you possess. Any who touch your weapons, armor, accessories, clothes or even idle trinkets or money without permission will find their bodies rotting, their minds shattering and their souls burning away, quickly enough to kill in just seconds for most or even less for those truly weak compared to you. Those near or equal to your power will still be harmed but it would take a few minutes of contact for them to be severely harmed. Those far above you will be unfortunately largely unaffected, at least until you become stronger. You can choose to disable this effect for specific objects, specific people or overall as you please."

Regardless, when people see your art, or your icon, or your words scrawled on public facades, that message will shine through loud and clear. And if they're amenable to the message, who knows? Maybe it will inspire them to action, to go above and beyond. The Yellow Sign (600CP) Now this is a trick with a rather more...specific meaning. Not to mention a lot more vitriol. Normal graffiti is the stylization of words, to make sure the right people can read it. This is the opposite: a single word, filled with love for those you care about, and hatred for those who would do them harm, carefully constructed so that only the latter group can comprehend it. When they do, the message encoded within takes its love and its hatred, and forms a spike of righteous fury that slams through their cerebral cortex. In a single moment, excuses, justifications, and rationalizations for their misdeeds are stripped away. Depending on just how many misdeeds they've committed, they might be given pause, reel in horror, or even break entirely under the weight of their past actions."

As an added benefit, you also get the ability to break weapons and tools down into parts - specifically frames, tools, tips, accessories, and upgrade chips, see the Notes section for more information - and reconfigure them to your liking. You can even upgrade those parts individually using power nodes. Modular Designs (400CP) It's always easier to make better things from better materials, and your knowledge of far-future engineering is top-notch, meaning that all of the things you make are all that much better for it. Aside from being able to upgrade parts, tools, and weapons further, and make better base parts for tools and weapons, you can apply the bonuses of Infinitely Customizable to things other than tools and weapons, breaking anything down into classes of modular parts and swapping them around to your heart's content. This nearly obviates every part of the process of retro-fitting older creations with newer parts, aside from the actual manual labor and time."

As long as you have the time and resources, you can easily build things such as several spaceships that combine into one large mecha able to fight space monsters in melee, with its pilots linking their minds to fight as one, that will be far stronger than the sum of its parts. If you ever come upon a race with collective chuunibyou, I'm sure you'd find many friends in them. You can also build similar technology that is smaller in scale, like for example autonomously fighting swords that combine together for a devastating final attack, or something as advanced as nanite swarms able to transform into almost anything you could possibly conceive of. Furthermore, with some work you could also combine devices that weren't designed to do so, taking their best parts but leaving out their individual flaws to make something exponentially more powerful or useful than either of the originals. Somehow, you are able to do this without the end product ending up any larger, clunkier, or needing more energy. So making the most powerful gun you are able to build, but which uses up an inordinate amount of energy, and combining it with the most energy efficient one in your arsenal is a real possibility open to you."

But maybe if you could use a different material, things might be different? The principle of this weave is the same as when you made inner linings. But whereas inner linings allowed you to split open layers in order to weave enchantments and magic inside, now you have folded layer upon layer with inlaid crystals to attain a weave that can withstand blows just as well as a suit of plate might. The amount of crystals you need for the process is substantial - but the magic is ultimately necessary, so that you don't leave a single imperfection which may ruin the final product, and also so that it doesn't end up looking bulky and cumbersome. Objects that you craft with the same principle exhibit durability several times stronger than what you would have expected from an equivalent of similar weight."

And when your technology's defenses are finally broken, it 'petrifies', dumbing down its present form and function rather than growing wild and further spreading the plague; able to continue being used for a more limited application rather than failing outright. For example, an infected fabricator might reduce its construction resolution to components larger than one millimeter, losing its ability to produce micro-scale items but still able to be used, rather than churning out a froth of contagious plague spores."

There's no need to sharpen it, but what about its inherent qualities? You know that magic enchantment on it? Or that spell it seems to cast every once in a while? Our form of blacksmithing works on those innate properties and spells instead. We don't strengthen the exterior; we strengthen what's inside, and bring the potential of that weapon up even higher.

So too, may you now infuse your works with emotion and dreams, that all who drink from your hand, all who look upon your works, all who read you writing, all who hear your voice and more besides are affected by the emotions you choose to infuse. Delirious passions, mad fear, and ever-changing visions are yours to grant to all you wish. Such is the strength of these moods and visions that you could drive mortals mad with them, if you are not careful. Though those of stronger make, like demons, will delight in them and revel in the exquisite experience."

You can either sacrifice things of material value (I.E. money) or can dump mana into improving the object.

However, one benefit is that your process is refined enough that you can push the reforging to either make the item better or worse, rather than relying on random chance. That said, it is possible for a highly improved object to simply eat the cost and then not change at all, so there is still a risk."

It keenly details the techniques, methods and setup required to create weapons using traditional Japanese techniques. This text goes beyond that however, and if the directions are followed perfectly it can be used to forge weapons, armor, and tools that are far better than anything that could possibly be made even with the most advanced metallurgic technology. Objects created while still composed of steelwill be significantly stronger than steel and can withstand blows from a Martial Arts Master. Blades made using these techniques will be preternaturally sharp, able to cut through stone, steel and perhaps even more with proper strength and training. Such bladed weapons will almost never lose their edge and require virtually no maintenance. Armor made using these techniques is nearly indestructible and will never rust or corrode. Normal tools will work with such efficiency that even primitive tools can accomplish feats of scale equivalent to highly advanced modern technology. For example, a scythe made with these techniques could harvest an entire field in the same amount of time as a combine harvester or a simple hoe could do the work of a tractor towed plough. * Does not only work on steel, it works on other metals too * This is a low level cultivation setting, Martial Arts Masters can take on tank shells and missiles and destroy armored buildings in one sword swipe. So the new strength of items made with the help of this perk can be imagined."

In high civilizational scales, the musty old tech used by Elder civs cannot necessarily be improved on by those of younger, more vibrant species and in around 40% of cases, the older forms of technology win out over the newfangled stuff. Your stuff is almost always in that 40%. Unless something is specifically engineered to counter your own tech or an effect your tech produces, newer technology is likely to have holes that your older tech somehow gets through. Software designed to counter sentient viruses might let an old malware script you invented decades ago through; armor made to turn aside bullets and beam weapons might fail before the simple geometry of your knife blade...and should you slumber for a vast amount of time, the world you wake to will likely have forgotten what you are and what you are capable of, innocent to any of your devices that have been forgotten along with you."

      "description": "Again, and again, people assume science immediately yields results. That there is one final answer to be found, which magically brings about utopia. Many would disagree in what specific meaningless poetic way they prefer science as, but it is easy to see that the more one works the more results they may potentially attain. That's not to say dead ends don't exist, and that one can mindlessly bash their head against a wall until a new weapons design pops out. Either way, your methodology has embodied the constant march of science on a philosophical and practical level. You switch yesterday's capacitor for tomorrow's, yesterday's explosives for tomorrow's, every single bit of information gained from field tests and routine maintenance near-instantly analyzed in order to devise a new upgrade, meager as it might be. So it is, that a gun designed and wielded by your hand will change from firing rounds heard long before they strike to punching through a dark sorcerer's inner sanctum and striking them down before the soldiers outside hear it in a year of daily use. Channels give way to water wheels give way to pumps and complex sets of tubes as one realizes the imperfections in a system and creates a better method. While these simple refinements are surprisingly unhelpful in regards to the mystical arts and physical practices, a constant level of technological enhancement is incredibly helpful, even for one who lacks eternity."

      "description": "In many ways mages are on top of the world power-wise. After all, someone can only get so good at swinging a sword or hammer before things sort of just stop getting better. Magic isn't limited like that, someone can go from throwing a fireball that engulfs a tree or two, to casting grand spells that can change the world or lay the groundwork for apotheosis. However, there is one primary issue with magic as a whole, and it can be summed up in two words: magic resistance. The power to rip someone's soul out is only good if it works, and it'd be quite unfortunate for you to attempt something of that nature, only to have some meathead barbarian bash your skull in with an axe because of some amulet or innate resistance. Now that's no longer a problem. An absolute resistance to magic is now nothing before you. Your spells and magical items do damage like they weren't even there to begin with, and that's if they had a full immunity. For those unfortunate enough to have less than full immunities, or none at all, they'll see your offensive magic becoming that much more effective against them. * Bypass magic resistance with your items"

For gross structure, you can form a half-real substance from Corpus and Gold that, when invested in an object, perfects and transcends that object. Afterwords, you're left with the perfected shadow of the transcended object. Such shadows resist damage much like lesser artifacts, and if they are somehow damaged will restore themselves over time. The shadow is also just better then the original untransended object was. It costs roughly five parts gold for every one part of the object to be transcended. For engines and other systems that need to be fuelled, it starts out costing as if to pay to transcend enough fuel for it to run all day to create a perpetual engine that runs on a common fuel. There is no good benchmark for all the different exotic fuels you might have, but it's safe to say that it grows exponentially more expensive the more exotic the fuel."

For any item that this is applied to, it will retain a single trait from the sacrificed item. It's almost as if you were breeding items.

Choose one god from any pantheon and gain a minor boon from them. The god will care slightly about you but unless you go on to further distinguish yourself it will be more of a minor interest in your affairs than someone they feel the need to help (Effectively think a diminished version of one ability a demigod might have, think minor ones are stuff along the lines of breathing water, lucid dreaming, or appropriate vague extra senses, useful but nothing especially major). This can be taken multiple times. Unnatural Skill (200CP) Whether from your heritage or just being that good you've got one particular mundane skill that your feats which border on supernatural. Whether you're a smith on the level of the Cyclopes, a near prescient tactician or a swordsman who is nigh unstoppable with a blade your feats will be legendary. You are on a level within your skill such that only other beings of legend can hope to match you. This may be taken multiple times. You may not choose magic but you may choose a particular application of magic if you have it already (so curses, enchanting might work, more specific gets a bigger boost). Divine Child (400CP) You are the direct child of a god of your associated pantheon and gain various benefits from this. You gain lesser manifestations of your parent's domains as well as generally being better than an ordinary mortal. You may take most any god as your parent but to take one of the heads of a pantheon as a parent you must take the \"Fate finds you interesting\" drawback receiving no points for it (you can also do this with a lesser god to get greater powers). Generally this will give you insight into and some control over your divine parent's domains, a son of Poseidon for example can control water and ships, talk to horses, cause minor earthquakes and is empowered within water."

Super strength make a gun's bullets shoot harder, super speed makes it shoot faster, and the bullets can be imbued with your magical energies. In the hands of a slayer, a wooden stake could punch through a robot's metal shell, though this isn't to say weapon quality doesn't matter, as a slayer with a metal axe would still hit considerably harder than one with a wooden stake. Furthermore, weapons become perfectly compatible with you; a holy sword could easily channel demonic power in your hands. CAPSTONE BOOSTER: This now greatly enhances your relationship with all items, allowing fragments of your power, skill, and knowledge to remain in the item when you're done with it. The more effort you exert while using the item, the more of your essence is reflected in the item. The item will, in turn, begin boosting the powers it has absorbed whenever you wield them. If you loaned a weapon out to someone, they would find themselves having some of your powers, skills, and knowledge that pertained to that particular weapon. A hammer you used to build a house would make anyone wielding it more proficient in construction, and the pen you used to write down your biology notes would make someone better at biology. Ancient Empowerment (400CP) CAPSTONE BOOSTER. Just as the very first slayer was empowered with the essence of a demon, you too have been greatly empowered by an ancient essence. This empowerment comes with the obvious physical enhancement we see in slayers, as literally being a slayer is one way this perk may manifest, so it will come with the super strength, the durability, healing slightly quicker, general threat detection instincts, but that's hardly all you get. Your empowerment reflects your origin, drop ins and fighters get the aforementioned super strength, but sorcerers and engineers can trade this for magical power. You also get this whole Chosen One vibe going about you, such that ritual, magic, or mad science project that uses your blood is now twice as effective. Finally, by having this \"chosen one\" blood, your blood can be substituted for any blood seals meant for specific people. Your blood can open the Seal of Danzalthar even if you're not a vampire, your blood can substitute for lamb's blood in a plagues of Egypt type scenario, your blood can open (and shut) the gateway to Glory's Hell Dimension. This also extends to any item that's restricted by users or race, you can use anything you can get your hands on. You're just really special."

You are not full-blooded, but the effects have been prevalent on you nonetheless; your size may be increased up to fifteen meters in height, with your strength as such that you could throw pieces of buildings one-handed at your enemies. You may also choose one Titan you are a descendent from, gaining aesthetic appearance changes similar to them. But more importantly, you may relax yourself and 'commune' with the world and nature around you; by opening your mind to the world you can learn about it and its secrets quite quickly, along with finding what is the largest threat to the balance of nature. You are of the planet, child. It is your birthright to know these things. *Titan's Blood also grants access to the following boosts for capstones you've purchased: * 'Daedalus' Student': Your crafting has undergone a dramatic improvement, to the point where you can make incredible works with the strength of an army within them.

This talent will also inherently improve the durability of such improvised equipment to function even when such materials should not feasible hold up under the strains of use."

But when your focus is on keeping your head on your shoulders, who has time to pick up those supplies you ran past 3 hours ago? You, that's who! You now have two things: First, you have some sort of pocket-universe/bag-of-holding/bigger-on-the-inside backpack/whatever that allows you to carry a large amount of loot. The loot will be unsorted, and while you can carry a lot and not notice, you also cannot immediately use what's in your loot bag. You'll first have to have your mineral wealth in the right place to build something with it, and equipment needs to actually be equipped before it can be used. Second, you gain a sort of aura or field that will automatically put anything (that hasn't been claimed by another being) nearby you into your loot bag. Stumble across a dead Kett, you get all the loot a thorough check would have found you if you'd taken your time. A farmer's vegetable field wouldn't work, unless you are knowingly stealing from the owner. The size of the looting-aura grows with how quickly you can move and what areas you can actually access. And the loot you get is determined by your skills. For example, if you have butchery skills, you can auto-loot meat, bones, and/or skin, while skills with electronics would let you get intact pieces of robots. The size of a single item would go up to and include a shuttle or the Nomad. If you run into something bigger than that, you'd need to have the skills to break it down to fit it. Waste Not, Want Not (200CP) Sometimes a Technician just doesn't have the resources they need to get the job done. That's when you have to get creative with what you consider a resource. You have the ability to break down objects that you can personally move into their component parts and/or resources, whichever you wish. If you need a bit of Eezo, an Initiative gun should have some. Don't want to murder some harmless Eirochs? Kett gear usually has some Eiroch Fluid Sacs incorporated into it. In addition to breaking down objects, you also have an accompanying pocket dimension for just resources and/or component parts. It doesn't weigh on you, and you can easily carry around enough resources for any job. If you have the Automatic Looting perk, you can choose to have any raw resources you pick up to go straight into your Resources Bag.

This magic grants incredible resistance, bordering on immunity, to heat and flames, though it does nothing for the pain that heat can cause. However, that is merely a side effect. The true use of Ember is as a form of refinement, materials exposed to ember infused flame have their traits enhanced. Food becomes tastier and more nutritious, metals become more resilient, and potions last longer or have an increased effect. This does, however, require the material to be exposed to flame, so this will not work on certain materials. Quick Seed (200CP) Seeds are normally slow to grow, with more Light potentially cracking it open and wasting the effort. Sapphire goblins, however, have taken what many would consider a hazard and turned it into an art. Any Seed formed by a sapphire goblin is more stable, able to be pushed farther before it breaks open, allowing them to build them up faster. Additionally, in moments of need, a sapphire goblin can overload a Seed, holding it together just long enough to overpower it, before they let it break to use the Seed at a much higher power than normal."

Adopting those same practices, you've improved on the harvesting efficiency for all manners of things, not just restricted to trees -but other plant life as well. So at least the plant doesn't simply die off after one round. Harmless Extraction (200CP) With hempen yarn and animal skins in shorter supply since the catastrophe, you and other craftsmen have had to adapt your practices in order to keep the orders met. Practices to minimize the amount of animals killed, to make the most out of that which you have on hand are all crucial nowadays as resources grow scarcer. While the animals still aren't too comfortable with it, with this magic you can weave together a copy of their skin or wool, while only taking a small portion of what they have. It doesn't really feel right, but at least the animal is still alive! It'll take time, but what you've taken will slowly grow back. Rapid Growth (200CP) You can't afford to wait years for a forest to regrow! By the time that forest grows to a state where it's ready for harvest, you won't even need the lumber to build your house anymore! No, in order to make it in time for harvest this season, you're going to need to draw on some more potent forces.It might be a little bit dangerous to use Aether in such a fashion, but by imbuing the saplings with concentrated Aether, you've successfully sped up the growth rate of the trees -to a point where you can harvest them again. Well, unfortunately, the trees did grow a bit bigger than normal, but you expect that's just a normal side effect from using concentrated Aether to grow things."

      "description": "The secrets of research and duplication are now at your fingertips, though there are a few changes compared to the version from the game. The basic process is still the same. You can 'destructively research' a given item in your inventory or that you can and are holding entirely in your hands, and once you have researched enough of them, you will be able to instantly duplicate said item. However, you aren't able to simply duplicate it for free. Instead, you can sacrifice additional items to build up a reservoir of 'material' that can then be used to create duplicates. Rarer items provide more material, with the amount needed to research a given item being a general baseline. So, if it took 100 items to research one item, and only 1 item to research another, then you would have to sacrifice 100 more of the first item to make one duplicate of the second. A second change is that the number of items that must be researched has been increased. Items that normally might have only taken 1 item to research now need 3 or more, and an item that might have normally taken 10 could take 40 or 50. CP-Backed items can be researched, but their duplicates won't have their CP-backed powers, only the default powers of whatever type of item they are. You can substitute raw mana for 'material', allowing you to create items without having to sacrifice other items first, as long as you have a sufficient amount of mana."

Your faction's knowledge of materials science has minimized this loss to the utmost; When destroying buildings, recovering crashed vehicles, or decommissioning equipment, you always recover the same amount of material put into its construction, ripe for being re-applied to other tasks. Artificial Alloys (600CP) Naturally occurring substances can offer a good start point for the development of new and innovative machinery and technology. However, oftentimes these natural resources have limitations - whether it be rarity, difficulty of acquisition, and so on. In such cases, science steps to the fore, fashioning new materials unseen by nature to do that which mother nature started. This ability allows, with enough time and research invested, to create substances that mimic those found in nature, albeit manufactured artificially. While these new artificial substances do not surpass the original, it can for all purposes be substituted by it with no drawbacks. However, the material must still be manufactured - but, once the process is known, other factions, civilizations, and individuals, by following the process, can also create the artificial material. This ability works post-jump, even for materials that do not naturally occur in the new universe."

You may also start acting as an Controller, Corrupter, and Enhancer when and as you wish. Basically, you can sense what goes on around your object, you may animate moving parts (make a crossbow load itself, make a wagon roll), may curse those who use your object in a way you don't want, and may make it act like a magical item whose strength depends on your strength. These roles are laid out in The Book of Vile Darkness. This perk may be bought more then once. Each time it's bought, you rip free another splinter to invest.

For instance, you could have each individual soldier make a single part in his spare time and have your general assemble them together in pitch darkness without peeking, and the secret superweapon will be constructed just as according to plan. That said, it won't work if you need to tell people what the plan is, and sometimes it's a good idea to let your allies know what's up before they reach (wrong) conclusions of their own."

The good news is you're not stupid it's the Genius tree, not the Drooling Idiot tree! You have excellent insight into the moral implications and long-term effects of your inventions if they were used by others or made commonly available, especially when it would be a purely bad idea. Also, just to make sure nobody steals or misuses it, any sort of failsafe you make to keep it from being abused is unable to be hacked or bypassed...if you made a device that works only for a certain person, no amount of hacking or DNA swapping will make someone else pass off as that person. If you need two keys to unlock a certain feature, you bet only those two keys will work. This goes both ways all your devices will come with a backdoor for you to take back control if someone does misuse it, and it will always succeed.

At first however this power will only work on willing targets, and will not work on incurable, especially virulent nanite infested EVOs. However with training and time, your powers can grow to circumvent these rules. Your greatest limitation is the fact that as you absorb nanites your reservoirs fill to the breaking point, causing dangerous flare ups and rendering your abilities unstable. You can purge these nanities, but figuring out how to do so in a safe way with a large amount of unstable nanites may take some effort. After this Jump your nanites can be used to heal people, whether of wounds, diseases, or possibly even mutations or others turned into a monster. Success will vary depending on factors, a mystical curse is probably beyond your nanites, a really out of this world super virus might be cured, but that's iffy.

Grace, realism, detail, you are almost unsurpassed in all areas. But you have a certain specialisation, one more suited for a Necrotect than any other. The bigger it is, the more complex it is, the easier it is for you to make it. The larger the tomb and more intricate its design, the less time it takes for you to have fully working plans drawn up. Even the actual construction becomes easier in the same way, with larger and larger constructions seeming to be more and more fortunate. Extra supplies turn up out of nowhere, the slaves are in perpetual good moods and shortcuts tha cut time and resources needed without lowering quality are found aplenty."

If you then make them at the usual size, they'll be far better than they usually would as you pack so much into them.

You need proper tools to work and transform the materials you're working with. You're alchemically treating the materials, not enchanting them, so you can't simply 'lay' the effect on them.

Medicine, botany and chemistry is where your talent lies, and while the 'wet sciences' are not as flashy as those of clockworks or galvanics, there is no end to the utility they can be put to. You are a masterful producer of tinctures and remedies, but also poisons and other chemicals that find use in combat, like gunpowder and the ingredients used in explosive projectiles and the Howlers' bombs. You'll be sure to get a lot of customers, whether for your beneficial concoctions, or your baneful ones. You might even surprise yourself with what your mixtures are capable of."

From there, many alchemists learn the difficult and resource intensive formula for altering one material into another, and that's where their knowledge ends. But the true potential of alchemy is that it holds the ability to manipulate life, much like necromancy manipulates the dead. With the right knowledge, an alchemist can experiment and create horrible monsters and abominations, even imbuing them with magic and other mystical abilities, or even create a perfect simulacra of human. The one thing outside of Alchemy's power is the creation of souls, so their creations may be alive or even think, but they don't truly feel the way a natural creature would. There's nothing preventing an alchemist with knowledge of other disciplines from transferring a soul into an empty vessel, however. On the other hand, there is much more to to alchemy that nobody has yet uncovered, and further research can uncover further uses of alchemy."

First, one must select an object with a useful quality, then they must understand this object fully through study. Then, through this understanding, one may refine this quality into a free-floating concept. This concept may then be applied to a useful vessel, which will benefit from such. For example, one may learn all that there is about a fighter jet, to the point of being capable of explaining everything about it and its operation and function with absolute certainty no matter what circumstances befall it. Then, one may reduce this particular jet to its Flight alone. One could then add its Flight to a suit of armor. An alchemist could then tap into the concept of Flight within it to soar. One could do the same to an industrial electromagnetic order to acquire the concept of Magnetic Attraction, or even a living being in order to acquire the concept of Self-Replication. However, one may only bind two concepts to any given object, and they may not be removed once set."

[2] All that the first dot offered and more. The alchemist can create short lived steroids and potions that grant mystical senses for short periods. [3] The alchemist's enhancements can now create mildly superhuman physical abilities and grant low level psychic powers, at least for short periods. They can also create materials and alloys that surpass what should be possible. [4] More potent versions of what is available at 3 dots. [5] With great study - or a sample - of a supernatural creature, the alchemist may replicate their various mid-level abilities for short periods. More potent abilities come with side effects. [6] At this level, an alchemist may create such miracles as the Elixir of Eternal Youth, or even induce an Awakening. Alchemy Rituals One dot: A powder that, when mixed with alcohol, induced sleep almost instantly., or a pill that suppresses the symptoms of the common cold or flu for a full day and halves recovery time. Two dots: A form of LSD that grants vague but accurate visions of the future or a drug that doubles running speed for up to an hour, but leaves those with low stamina shaky and out of breath for the next. Three dots: A metal alloy that is lighter and stronger than titanium, but easier to work, can retain an edge almost forever, and stays more resilient than the finest blade,or a metallic dust that reveals hidden, disguised, or invisible things for what they are, disrupting illusions. Four dots: A chemical that raises physical abilities for up to eight hours, possibly even to superhuman levels. Side effects include an insatiable appetite during this period. Another option is a regiment of drugs that slows down the aging process to one twelve its natural speed. [5] A potion of this magnitude allows its drinker to match the physical abilities of a vampire for an hour. [5] A pungent substance that is especially disgusting to werewolves, to the point where none dare come within five feet of whatever it is smeared upon. Anyone else with a sense of smell will also be reluctant to do so, but not to the same extent."

You are decently trained in all these skills, which are the basis for any alchemist to thrive in society. The God-Catching Alchemy Meister (600CP) When someone asks a kid what an alchemist is, they think of a great creator that takes leaves and lumps of iron, making them into elixirs and legendary weapons.

From accessories that make the user immune to some element, trinkets that allow for teleportation or the more direct weapons that can cause an instant death in the victims. Furthermore, your talent hasn't weaned at all, and you still see room for improvement in your works. You're one that could take the precious title of 'Meister', if not aim ever higher."

      "description": "Synthesis (400CP) Synthesis is the most basic art of the alchemist and deals with the creation of items, usually through simple mixing, though sometimes synthesis can be a complex sequence of magical and chemical reactions. All alchemists learn this to some degree. Seeing as you're an alchemist, the synthesis of items should really be second nature to you. That being said, even if you're already an expert, there's nothing saying that you don't have room to improve further. Also there is no reason why we can't help you improve, if you're willing to put in the effort to learn. Rank 0: The basics of synthesis, learning how to make basic potions and food without proper ingredients is still pretty helpful. Sure, you won't be making anything high quality anytime soon, but at least you can make something safely edible from refuse material. It still won't be good for you, but it won't kill you. Rank 1: Don't like the looks of what you've made? No matter, just give it a makeover! You can substitute the appearance of what you've made with something else similar to it in nature. Of course, appearances are exactly that, so don't expect the function of your item to change. Rank 2: Enhancing what is already present, the items that you create will often possess some small trait related to its original function, generally acting as a sort of minor boost. The nature of the trait will never go against the intended purpose of the item a potion that normally heals health may also help recover a small bit of your magic. Rank 3: Practice makes perfect, and you're still a long ways away from perfect. Each time you make that same item, the quality of the product increases, resulting in increased magnitude of the intended effects. Though the gains will diminish the more you create a single item, you'll find that by the time you reach the plateau you'll have nearly twice the original effect. Efficiency (600CP) As you grow in your skills as a crafter, you'll start to see more and more requests being handed your way. Before long, you're going to realize that you don't have all the time in the world to make everything that is requested of you, and that's when it becomes all the more important to complete your assignments efficiently. Efficiency isn't just a matter of time management it's about managing waste, reducing redundancies, and above all improving yourself. Yes, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of wasteful choices you have to make but should you apply yourself to this, there's a lot more to efficiency than what you'll learn by scratching the surface. All it depends on is whether you're disciplined enough to follow through. Rank 0: As advertised, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of waste produced during your crafting process. Achieving a 1:1 conversion will not be possible with this alone, but being able to turn the waste product into a desired product can go a long way to making synthesis more manageable. Rank 1: if you can use less of an item, you won't need to make as much. The effect of any item that you craft is increased slightly from its original magnitude, and their durations are again increased slightly. It will take you a little longer than usual to create items but that's an acceptable sacrifice."

      "description": "Mist Alchemy (100CP) Mist has more uses than simply being used to create Mistlight Manifestations, the most common form is Mist Alchemy, imbuing Mist into a material to subtly alter its properties. This is a minor boon, imbuing heat aligned Mist into metal might prevent it from forming stress fractures during quenching or remove the need for tempering, while imbuing an herb with life aligned Mist might make it better suited to making a healing poultice. Minor things that, combined together, can provide useful results. This is commonly used for making simple conveniences or simple tricks, such as pots or pans that more evenly distribute and hold heat or musical instruments that carry their tune farther than normal, rather than proper enhancements. Though medicine enhanced in this way is fairly potent. As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to synergize the traits of wisps of Mist used for Mist Alchemy to achieve greater effects and gives you an innate intuition for how a wisp of Mist will affect an object when imbued in various ways. This stacks with the Mist Affinity perk. Core Artificer (200CP) A surprisingly rare item to be found in Nexus is the Core, a metal, stone, or wood sphere imbued with Mist and possessing carved 'instructions' in the form of various patterns and runes. Cores are used as a way to give greater flexibility to someone's use of Light for Seed Sorcery. The Mist within the Core can be used as an external lens that rapidly shifts the Light within a Seed towards its own traits, changing a Seed to match its alignment within seconds (if already blank) or just over a minute (if already colored in another way). You know how to create such Cores. Do note, however, that this requires a good deal of Mist to accomplish, and it needs to be strong before it is imbued into a Core or it will provide minimal results. As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to power Cores with powers other than Seed Sorcery and you are capable of creating Cores that are not spheres, or are even another item entirely, such as a sword. Refined Ichor (400CP) This small jug is filled with the refined ichor of a hacker. Worth its weight in gold, this substance is useful for a number of purposes. Most commonly, it is used alongside Mist Alchemy in enhancing a material or object or to directly enhance the effects of Mist Alchemy. Further refinement turns it into essence, which can temporarily boost one's Light as if they'd cracked a blank seed or it can be mixed with other substances to give a minor increase in Light, this is an incredibly small boost, but is noticeable. It can also be used in manipulating Mist, making refinement more precise, improving cultivation results, and making smelting easier. Finally, it can be used to enhance the innate physical ability of the user, though how this is done is only known by the demons of the Border Ring. There may be other uses, but they are largely unknown. Mist Collector (50CP) When any creature with Light dies, they leave behind a small echo, a wisp of glittering Mist, colored similarly to the Lenses the individual possessed in life. These wisps are also touched by the memories and emotions of the being's life, altering its properties somewhat. The collection and manipulation of these wisps of Mist are the basis on which Mistlight Manifestations come into existence. Collecting a wisp of Mist is easy, simply touching it will stabilize it and allow it to be stored indefinitely. But utilizing a single wisp of Mist to create a Mistlight Manifestation will result in a lackluster Manifestation, weak enough that even humans, who lack the reserves of light necessary to become proper hunters, prefer to make at least a few modifications before doing so. To that end, there are three methods of strengthening a wisp. First is smelting or fusing. Taking two or more wisps of Mist and combining them into a single, new one with the traits of both. This is by far the easiest and fastest method of empowering a wisp of Mist. However, unless you know exactly what your wisps of Mist are and how they'll react, combining them in this way may lead to complications, such as opposing traits canceling out or mutating into a new trait that has a negative impact on the whole. Second is cultivation. By 'feeding' a wisp of Mist, it is allowed to grow organically and produce new qualities and traits over time. Allowing a wisp of Mist to grow in this way is fairly simple, and with its organic growth it's unlikely to have any complications, but this process is time consuming, potentially taking weeks or months to yield the results on par with smelting or refinement. Lastly is refinement. This is a rather difficult process that removes unwanted traits from a wisp of Mist, much like cutting and polishing a gem. This process has you excise traits and qualities from a wisp of Mist, allowing the other aspects to grow in strength as a result. This is a quick process and is unlikely to cause any real trouble, but you must be very precise and careful during the process or you may leave behind bits of what you wanted removed. Additionally, wisps of Mist are useful for another purpose. By binding a wisp to a Seed, it can act as an artificial Lens in the use of Seed Sorcery. Seeds formed with a wisp are, however, slower to grow than those that use your own Lenses. Cracking a Seed with a wisp will often cause the wisp to dissipate, though some Seed Sorcerer's have learned how to reclaim the wisp used for this prior to cracking the Seed. Harvester (100CP) You know a somewhat uncommon technique known as Harvesting, a process by which someone extracts a wisp of Mist from a still living being. This is not damaging, per se, but can put stress on the mind, body, and Light of the one having this done to them. Fighters will sometimes use this to get an edge if they can find an opening to pull it off. It is possible to pull wisps of Mist from yourself with this technique, but it requires a large amount of focus to accomplish without failing. You are able to reclaim wisps used in Seed Sorcery. As this technique can be learned in jump, paying for it makes it more effective, reducing the necessary focus and allowing you to use more advanced forms of harvesting, such as causing greater levels of fatigue with each wisp pulled from an individual or to temporarily empower your Light by consuming the resulting wisp of Mist. Lens Mastery (100CP) Lenses tint Light towards their own alignment, and using them together is a matter of experimentation to get the desired results. Sapphire goblins find this far more intuitive, able to carefully manage their Seeds with ease, as if each seed had their full attention, easily sliding lenses between Seeds to create a desired result."

There was an entire field of geneticists tinkering in their labs on how best to mix the human genome like a cocktail. You were one of these minds. You have a decade of practical experience playing and modifying genetics, but are particularly skilled when it comes to creating Plasmids and Tonics. While you are by no means a world-changing genius like the two greats previously mentioned, you are more than capable of creating your own ADAM-based products given a lab and supply of the substance.

It's not like you would implant them in little girls and then harvest their blood for larger amounts of ADAM. That would be monstrous. The slugs come in a small aquarium that won't need maintenance to keep them alive and will refill to contain six slugs every week. Just keep the lid on. They like to wander."

      "description": "Potion Grandmaster (600CP) Potioneering is the art of using ingredients both from the natural world and from the body of powerful beasts to create powerful concoctions with an incredible range of effects. From increasing spiritual force, to creating powerful attacks that can be combined to create stronger attacks, to poisons that can kill Magus of a higher rank before they can even notice, to elixirs that can help increase vitality or help to purify a Warlock's bloodline. With time and ingredients, a potioneer grandmaster can create potions for every situation and event. From Acolytes to Rank 9 Magus all Magi of each rank require potions. You are as the name suggests now, a Grandmaster of the art with a masterful aptitude to potion making as well as the knowledge of how a wide variety of ingredients interact. Allowing you to make leaps in the process of potion making as well as creating new or re-making old ones that would for other potioneers take decades of mind-breaking work. Of course, you wouldn't be a grandmaster with just knowledge, would you. So this comes with a 100 years of actual experience in the art, as well as a host of knowledge of all recipes found in this world barring those lost to the world. But hell maybe you can find them one day. For another 300 CP you also gain the knowledge and skills of an Alchemical Grandmaster, which are experts in the creation of all kinds of magical items. From defensive items that protect from attacks of other mages, to one shot attacks that contain far greater power than the actual creator. But remember, the quality of an item is not just dependent on the creator but the materials as well. Magus Cultivation (0CP) In this world there are 12 ranks that a being can achieve, 3 Acolyte ranks and 9 Magus ranks. To improve and advance through the ranks of Acolytes, an Acolyte must improve their spiritual force to reach a certain number, and have to construct mind runes with each level increasing the number of mind runes being needed. To advance to a rank 1 Magus, an Acolyte requires their spiritual force to reach a certain number, a rank 1 spell model and either Grine water or a high-grade meditation technique. From Magus rank 1 to 2 a Magus's spiritual force must reach 80 and their elemental conversion must reach over 80%, with 99% being the maximum being reached. To advance further from rank 2-6, can simply be done by improving spiritual and soul force. From 6-8 is done by comprehending different laws and smelting those laws into their own and finding your own path. Then comprehending the laws of space and time into your own path to reach rank 9. What many do not know is that there is a 10th rank that can only be reached by creating a greater law. Wizard Cultivation (500CP) In the World of Gods, there exist many different classes and many ways to reach stronger tiers of power. There are also ranks and tiers, to become stronger a being must reach rank 20 to become Legendary and from there can advance from a Demigod to a Greater God and eventually can become an Overgod. The most powerful class here are Wizards, magic casters who utilize the Weave, a creation of one of the Greater Gods. The way Wizards work is by paying spiritual force to the Goddess Of The Weave to buy the authority to use magic, this manifests as spell slots. Each Wizard gains an additional spell slot as they advance in rank, with them gaining access to deeper levels of the Weave as they reach certain milestones. However as soon as they use the spells they lose the memory of the spell models. Drop-In starts out at Wizard Rank 1, Acolyte's Wizard Rank 4, Old Monster Rank 6 and Mortals start out with nothing. Before you get too excited, Wizards come with drawbacks you see. As you are using spiritual energy to pay for spell models to insert into the spell slots. It doesn't matter how much spiritual force you possess, as the same amount is needed to pay for all the different ranks of spells. If you use all the spells and have none left you will be powerless unless you use scrolls. Also as soon as you have cast the spells, the spell models you see within the Weave are forgotten. For 300 CP, whether as a result of luck or bloodline you are not a Wizard but an Arcanist, an attempt by Ancient Magi to merge the power of a Wizard and a Magi. Arcanists are the founding fathers of Wizardry, able to supersede the Weave's restrictions. By perceiving the energies in the environment and utilizing the elemental particles in the air, they can draw it to form arcane spells. So long as an Arcanist has enough arcane energy and the correct spell models, any spell under the legendary realm can be cast (that limitation is only if the Arcanist themselves are not in the legendary realm). They also possess the passive ability to amplify arcane energy by 10-20% when they cast spells. Arcanists can also remember any and all spell models within the Weave. Now, if you think that isn't worth 300 CP there is something you should know Arcanists aren't simply battle spellcasters an Arcanist can do anything a Magi can; alchemy, enchanting, force-fields Arcanists are Magi with the ability to utilize the Weave and are not suppressed by the World Of The Gods. In order for an Arcanist to advance requires their spiritual/soul force to grow as well as comprehension and sensing of arcane energy. Now, you are probably thinking that isn't good enough especially the Wizard option and you would be right so for just an extra 200 CP you are not tied to Myastra's weave anyone but to your very own. Just like Shar has her Shadow Weave you now have the Jumper Weave (name totally your decision). This weave possesses all the spells and features Myastra's does but is totally under your control giving you access to every inch of it. Unlike Myastra's, your Weave is linked to every jump you go to from now or from the past to the future allowing you access to it whenever and wherever. Oh and don't worry about it getting destroyed no one will ever notice it. High Grade Meditation Technique (400CP) When it comes to advancing into an official Magus there are two ways this can happen either through Grine water or a high grade meditation technique. The difference between the two being that through the former you could turn a spell 1 model of your choice into your own innate one however with this method when you wished to advance later on if the spell model you chose was incompatible with your earlier ones it could result in the Magus's death as well as the fact the Grine water damages the Magus's spiritual force preventing further advancement, the latter using techniques is far greater as the technique itself provides the Magus with innate complementary spell models. With this perk, you can purchase your own meditation techniques whether canon or one you thought of yourself and yes this includes Warlock techniques. You can purchase as many as you wish for 200/400 CP each. For 200 CP: The technique will be limited to the Breaking Dawn Realm or Rank 6 Magus/Warlock and with just this technique you will no longer be able to advance further as Rank 7 Magus/Warlock and higher needs to comprehend Laws to advance. For 400 CP: Normally meditation techniques would be useless at Rank 7 Magus/Warlock and higher but this one is special as it compliments your elemental affinities allowing you to gain comprehension on the laws based on your elemental affinities thus allowing you to reach and become a Rank 9 Magus/Warlock. There is no limit to the rank you will be able to reach with this one day reach rank 9 of course, just because you have the way doesn't mean you WILL reach it after all talent is everything and for rank 9 you still require comprehension of space and time this method only gives you a path to that rank that will never cripple you. Post-Jump meditation techniques works in cultivation jumps as its equivalent to the highest quality version of cultivation techniques, for 200 CP version it would only allow you to reach half of the cultivation path meaning if there are 12 ranks you can only reach peak of Rank 6, for 400 CP version would allow you to reach Rank 12 or the highest level of Cultivation. If there are two or more cultivations paths like cultivating the body and ki, the meditation techniques would become a two in one that cultivates both body and ki, if there are more cultivating path like body, mind, soul and ki, the meditation techniques would become a four in one that cultivates all paths. If you already have Magus Cultivation, Wizard Cultivation and High Grade Meditation Technique then subtract 900 from the cost of this You need higher and higher cultivation to craft those items, pills and potions so these extra perks are needed."

However, the smart clothing remains all one piece no matter how many parts it looks like it has, and making it look like armour or a radiation suit doesn't afford any more protection than its (moderately tough) fibres already do. Smart Clothing can be combined with an outfit you already own for free, such as your free Light Vacsuit, upgrading it to a Smart Fabric Vac Suit. As you have chosen to upgrade, your suit has all the extra features. The clothing is very heavily armored against both kinetic and energy attacks (easily shrugging off small calibre rounds or a laser pistol), and has a whole host of defensive modifications that make different attack modes (like laser, flame and acid) far less effective. The colour-shifting pattern can give you active camouflage and thermal signature dampening at a moment's notice, and you can even electrically shock anyone in contact with you. * Smart fabric Vac Suit is essentially a high tech space suit"

You could literally shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, perform delicate brain surgery with a shard of glass in a tenth the normal time, or write a song that inspires a national revolution within days.

They're capable of protecting the wearer from most things, including bullets, knives, magic, extreme heat, and large amounts of blunt-force trauma. They also look damn stylish. Resolute Thread (200CP) You have a spool of thread that's supposedly made from the stomach lining of an Emperor Dragon over 2000 years ago. The more pressure applied to it, the stronger it becomes. You could bind a superhuman or use it to hang hundreds of tons off of the ground. Spool refills and used thread once a month. Magic (0CP) This world’s magic is not exactly what you normally come across. Here everyone (barring one) has a True Name. This name is the source of magic and what allows sorcerers to use magic. Learning someone else’s True Name will allow you to have absolute control over everything they do and vice versa if someone learns yours. The only way to prevent this is to seal your name. On the other hand, learning your own True Name allows a sorcerer to access godlike magic and power. You arrive here with the spark of magic inside you, allowing you to bring it to the surface and wield it as a weapon. Regardless of your chosen Origin, your ability to wield magic and the skill you possess is roughly equivalent to that of a local wielding the same discipline that has lived for about one hundred years. Longevity (0CP) In this world, magic has a sort of rejuvenating effect, decreasing the speed at which a sorcerer/ress ages. Sorcerers can live for hundreds of years, with some exemplary individuals managing to live for even a thousand. However, barring vampires, this is not immortality; a magic-user will still age and eventually die, with their magic simply slowing the process down. Combat Training (0CP) This world isn’t like Harry Potter where fighting is always done at a distance and only with magic. Here, sorcerers use every advantage they have to fight, win, and survive. All origins receive training in a single form of combat equal to that of a master of said discipline. The definition of combat training is rather broad, and can cover anything from a specific martial art to swordsmanship to the use of firearms. Now before you get a big head, I should remind you that the majority of the main characters are masters of several martial arts, so do try to be careful."

Silk Spinning (200CP) With a prayer to Elhrim, you can purify a Firefly Cocoon (a cocoon filled with a monster using the Requiem of Souls perk above) and spin it into silk. This kills the monster but produces truly breathtaking silk. The stronger the monster, the better quality of silk is produced. The strongest Minions could produce silk fit for a god.

      "description": "The art of geomancy (known as feng shui in the East) is the study of harmonizing the physical environment with the flow of energy. The goal of feng-shui is to create the ideal place to live or work. Through a combination of architectural design and mystic mathematics, a geomancer plans a pattern that must be duplicated within the entire structure (in the case of a building) or the layout of a room or series of connected rooms (in the case of interior design). Implementing this design increases the time required and the cost of the work involved, but practitioners consider it well worth the effort. When designing a geomancy effect, the thaumaturge chooses a single Attribute or Skill to be the focus. Once assigned, the Trait cannot be changed without completely redesigning the location. Attribute-based designs are more difficult to create than Skill-based ones. The selected Trait must reflect the building or space's function. For example, a library might enhance academic or research skills. If the thaumaturge is successful, she creates a unique design that benefits those who use the location in the manner for which it was created, provided that the design is followed perfectly. If the thaumaturge creates her geomancy design successfully, and the architect or interior designer successfully integrates the design into the physical location, the flow of energy is modified within the space. Any action that takes place in the space using the designated Attribute or Skill may gain a bonus. Once a geomantic design is created and implemented, it remains in effect indefinitely unless something happens to disrupt or change the flow of energy. Natural disasters may change the magical landscape more than they appear to affect it physically, requiring geomantic designs to be realigned. New construction or destruction of buildings or even spaces within a building may require that a thaumaturge reassess the location for potential updates. Poorly designed geomantic locations may disrupt those around them, as well. The only limits on the number of designs a geomancer may create are her time, her capability and the ability of others to come up with the resources to put her designs into place."

Instead of trying to enchant a single jacket multiple times, he would wear multiple jackets enchanted once. But you can improve on that idea. Instead of attempting to craft multiple thinner jackets, you've opened up inner linings in existing pieces of work. As you predicted, while the ease of stacking enchantments has gone up, the overall durability of the item has dropped by a bit.

Loremasters nearly always have some form of magical talent, as it is the study of the arcane in essence. However, there are those for whom it is the extent of their abilities to draw out a few secrets from the books and little else. Apprentices of the old lore are taught, not by rote, but by arguments. They are told to seek out the flaws in others' logic, to pick apart the minutia of another's words, and to seek the shades of truth in every conversation. While at first no student sees the value in this, they soon learn that they can apply such introspection to the magical items they find. With a few moments study and a jeweler's loupe they can discern the enchantment bound to a particular item. Unlike the other skills, this one requires further training to see its true worth. In the beginning, a novice Loremaster will only be able to discover the basics of an enchantment. The essential element or driving force. But as one grows more experienced they will be able to pick up the minutia, dipping into the ins and outs of even the most subtle enhancements."

      "description": "It's time to choose the Magical Styles that you have already learned upon entering this world. Whilst most magical styles can be learned with time and effort and the right teacher or source of knowledge, buying them here will allow them to benefit from the skill that Magic Skill ranks grant as well as allow access to extremely rare or lost magics or magics that require certain traits to use. A list of the magics that can be bought as well as their costs can be found at the end of the jump document. It should be noted that some Magic Styles will not be purchasable through this option. Most of these are Holder Type magics, which all deal with magical items that are offered for purchase in the item section, and some are simply Caster Type magics that are too unique and either offered as part of a separate perk or not at all. This may change in the future as the series progresses or not. Magic (Fairy Tail) (FREE) Ethernano is the source of energy that runs through our world of Earthland and from the bodies of those native to this place. It’s what allows us all to accomplish the act known as Magic, casting spells and the like. Not everyone has the ability to use magic but you’re one of those lucky ones, like about a tenth of Earthland’s population. How powerful and talented you are, along with what magic you know already, will be decided below. Before we go on, the most important thing to know about magic in this world is that it is more than just a source of energy like what you get from food and more than just a power that you study and practice with to use in battle like a gun or martial arts. It is part of you, ebbing and flowing as you do. When your heart soars and your soul burns hot, your magic will answer with a leap and a bound in might. Intense emotions can colour and enhance magical power, sometimes to massive extents, and no emotion is greater at this than love. Both friendship and romance, the magic of this world responds in purest form to these emotions and what makes you feel them. Some say that this might even be the true source of all magic in the world, the love that let us come so far. Magic Power: Rank 1 (Fairy Tail) (FREE) You have the innate potential to be a Mage and to use Magic, that’s for certain. But not all Wizards are equal to each other. The amount of Magical Power you have and can use is different for every person. It can be trained and improved over time but that’ll take effort and time. The ranks below are made on the assumption that you are human, being a race with more innate magic will increase the benefits of various ranks as well. It is important to note that, in general, magical power generally translates into physical power, though it is unclear whether this is a natural boost or the effect of basic and easy to learn enhancement magic that most mages make use of. You begin with Rank 1 for free. Rank 1 The average for any combat capable Wizard. You’re certainly able to fight and no normal humans are likely to stand up to you at first but you’ll be tired after a few minutes and don’t expect to be blowing up houses. Levy McGarden and Lucy Heartfilia at the start of the Fairy Tail series are examples of this level. Magic Skill: Rank 1 (Fairy Tail) (FREE) Magical Power is not the only thing that governs your overall might. Any fool can fling about his energy like a brute but only with skill and knowledge will a sorceress be able to use her magic to its utmost limit. This option describes the talent for magic in general you have as well as the specific training in any Styles you have bought from the start. Magic Skill applies to all Magic Styles you have bought with the option following this one, not to ones you learn in the future, though higher ranks of this option will grant greater skill with magic as a whole as well. You can choose how exactly your Skill manifests for your Styles, such as if you want to focus in a certain area. You might want to be an Ice Mage that focuses on Make Magic to create tools or creatures from Ice, rather than manipulate Ice directly. Rank 1 You know your magics and how to use them but many of the advanced moves and tricks are still hidden from you. You’re an effective combatant using your magic and so long as they’re not stronger than you in Magical Power, you’ll have a good chance of winning against your peers. Grey Fullbuster at the start of the series is an example of this."

First, you can only animate works that you made by your own hands. Second, they cannot be of people who exist in the real world; in the case of inanimate things such as moons and stars, or things that have multiple copies such as a species of snake, they can still be created. Third, to give life to an artwork you must sacrifice a small but vital piece of your own life. It is possible to recover in time, but overdoing things may put you at the edge of death. Although you can create works that have magical powers, to fully use their magic in the real world they would require continual magic support from you. Also, the act of creation does not give you control over the animated works, and they retain independent wills, though they will generally respect their maker."

More advanced techniques still follow this same principle, but to great effect.

It's only downside is that this art is massively difficult to learn even for the talented, and will take years of intense study to master. You start off knowing how to make the two most basic of seals: The storage seal which allows you to store items in slips of paper much smaller than they are, and the explosive seal which is basically a few glyphs on a piece of paper the size of a greeting card that explodes like a small amount of plastique."

Firstly, you are capable of creating multiple focuses for the same ability with no loss in their overall power level, and using the same item as a focus for more than a single ability. The true strength of this ability, however, is that each and every one of your powers has become semi-sentient being of its own, a kind of pseudo-consciousness based on your will attached to the ability. These consciousnesses are aligned with you in terms of morality and intent, and can add their force of will to yours. When you work in concert with them, your precision, control, and raw power output increase without any additional exertion on your part. Furthermore, in the event that you are incapacitated in some fashion, these consciousnesses can take control of your body, wielding the power they are attached to in order to protect your body until you return. Alternatively, you could grant your powers control of your body while you fully devote your mind to other tasks. Because of this boost, you may choose to make your focuses tangible avatars of your individual powers, turning them from semi-sentient objects to fully sapient ones. These conscious powers will not manifest as whispering voices in the back of your head unless you want them to."

Though most enchantments are powered by mana you can offset this somewhat in two ways, either by instead binding the souls of the dead to your creations lowering the mana cost considerably the more souls you bind to it or by burning gold to take the place of mana that would be spent if you are squeamish."

      "chapter": "Domain: Skills: Enchanting",
      "description": "The Rune Is Mightier Than The Sword (100CP) The one thing throwing people off the runic language is its sheer volume. Considering that there are ninety-nine million, two hundred and thirty thousand, seven hundred and sixty nine of them, representing every single word and concept in all known languages, even things such as watering the grass every week, that's no surprise. Because of that, even learning the runic language can be a challenge, requiring either a brain implant or some other form of perfect memory. Anyone who doesn't have access to these things needs to spend time and effort to search for those runes they'll actually use and transcribe them into a book or save them to their computer. Luckily, you won't have to deal with such shortcuts: as of now, you are fluent in the entirety of the runic language, and will never forget it. Furthermore, as you will undoubtedly encounter words and concepts foreign to the people in this universe throughout your travels, it will update itself to include runes for anything you might encounter in the future. Runic Spell Innovator (200CP) Considering that one simply needs to combine the runes for Blast and Fire to make a fireball, or use the do the same with the Reinforce and Mind runes to create a basic spell to protect against mind altering effects, one might think that runic magic is incredibly easy. Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over your mana, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing hello world and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience. Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it's bashing someone's head in with the Force rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach. Enchanting (400CP) Enchanting is a skill probably best described as the enhancement of an object's Aura. At first, one would need to find out which enhancement fits an object best, though skilled enchanters obviously do not need to care about that, and then lay down a basic enchantment that increases a stat, like wisdom and strength, or attack and defence. Like normal magic, there are two forms of enchanting, arcane and runic, though enchanting is by no means a magic, but rather a skill like sewing or tailoring. The former requires you to know the right school of magic related to your enchantments, like a magic that increases toughness for a durability enchantment, but is more powerful because of that, while the latter simply requires you to know the right runes and how to use them. Although normally people would specialize in one of these forms of enchanting, you're skilled in both of them, enough that you'll soon be able to easily start using more advanced form of enchanting, such as giving objects elemental enchantments or even very specific abilities, though for the latter you need to be at least somewhat familiar with them yourself. With some experimentation, you'll also be able to learn techniques that will increase the power of your enchantments by dozens of times, like material enchanting, where you enchant an object at every stage of its creation, such as enchanting the steel a sword will be forged from, the fire that will be used to melt it, and the water used to cool it, after which you enchant the finished sword one last time after its completion. Another trick to enchanting is that natural objects like wood or animal parts can fit up to two or three times more enchantments like man made ones in them. After a creature dies, and its soul dissipates, the aura is left withered, a shadow of its former self. But because of that hollowness, that emptiness, those items have far more room for improvement of their aura, allowing for the creation of a staff that can match up to any plasma weapon, or a bow that will never miss its mark. You excel at finding similar loopholes and techniques to advance your skills whether they are enchanting or not, and even if you were ever stuck, with seemingly no way to advance your skills to the next level, as long as you continue to research and experiment, you'll also be able to either innovate or learn something that will allow them to continue on growing. This works even when it absolutely shouldn't. Rest assured, there will be no barriers to bar you from growing ever more competent. Work at it for a few years, and even something on the level of the Seeds would not be beyond you. And considering your skill at enchanting, that will become useful far sooner than you might've thought, starting at a level others would need years to reach. You can probe the Aura of anything with a mere glance, knowing at a moment's notice what enchantments would fit best, and the speed at which you work your magic might make other people think you're doing it with just a wave of your hand. And you'll continue to be able to work at that speed no matter how complex the work you're attempting. Who knows, you might even become the first combat enchanter with that kind of skill."

      "description": "Lordship of All Things (800CP) Formations can, through being shaped in particular directions, powered by multiple people or formation flags, result in a variety of different effects. Such effects include creating an attacking formation which would allow a small number of weaker cultivators to take out one stronger than them, or a trapping formation that only brute strength completely eclipsing that of the people controlling it could hope to break, and finally, one can even use formations to help gather elemental energy and ki so they can train much faster than what would normally be possible. All of this knowledge and more is now passed on to you, as you find yourself a master of Formations, their creation, and their utilization, as well as heavy insight into the Grand Dao of Formations. With a year of practice and the proper reagents, you could even conceivably create formations of the scope which caused the four thousand kilometer wide elemental stone mine in the Ji Clan's territory through the gathering of elemental energy, and with a decade, setting down formations like ones that would normally be set around the Ji Clan territory, capable of killing Celestial Immortals, could be qualified as a warm up (depending on your own level of power of course) Creating a formation such as the Rahu Formation that allows a multitude of cultivators to band together in order to form an avatar that is vastly stronger than the sum of its parts would take you a decade or so of research (once again, that is if you had the required level of power for it). Keep in mind, however, that creating formations also requires insight into the Daos. Creating a Wind Formation will be absolutely impossible without the necessary insight into the Dao of Wind. To add to this, you also gain tremendous insight into the Grand Dao of Constructs, allowing you to, with enough practice, create golems equal to the Daofather Golems that the Lord of All Things created, and make them in bulk just as he did. You do need the right materials and many assistants for that, however. Finally, you gain the ability to create and cultivate strange creatures known as Queens who are able to give birth to hundreds of warriors to create an army. Both the appearance of the Queens and warriors are completely up to you, and they'll be at the same level of intelligence as a normal sentient being. At first, you'll simply be able to make one or two of them at the Xiantian Level, with their children only being at the Houtian Realm, and only in their dozens. But as your own personal power increases, you could create or upgrade queens capable of rivaling even Empyrean Gods and cultivators stronger stall, with them being capable of birthing thousands of lesser creatures. The intelligence of their spawn is also variable, with some of the weaker grunts simply being like insects that the Queens can see through and puppet from a distance, and their generals being at the very top of the level they were spawned at and being just as intelligent as the Queens. This scales with your cultivation level as the Golems or Queens are always one level below you. In future Jumps you'll find yourself picking up arts and abilities similar to constructs and formations incredibly quickly. Cultivation (0CP) In this world, people use the art of cultivation to increase their powers. This practice is mostly divided into two ranks: Ki refiners, who generally rely on magical techniques and treasures to fight, powered by the Elemental Essences they absorb, and Fiendgod Body Refiners, who strive to turn their bodies into those of the ancient Fiendgods and utilize divine abilities with vastly varying effects, such as increasing their size, adding extra arms, or even strengthening their bodies beyond their already impressive levels, making their physical abilities and general battle prowess much higher than those of a Ki refiner in exchange for lacking the ability to use treasures and weapons. Thus you get a technique from each of these two types of cultivation to study. Be warned though, that although Fiendgod Body Refiners are much more powerful, their ways of cultivation may be painful to the extreme, or extremely hard to advance in, resulting in decades of effort for just a bit of progress. There are many stages to cultivation, starting with the Houtian Stage, which signals the very start of a journey, as well as the increase of a cultivator's lifespan to over a hundred years. Then comes the Xiantian Stage, where the body is completely reforged for perfection, and the cultivator's lifespan increases to over two hundred years. The third stage is called Zifu, in which the practitioner forms their own Violet Palace which contains their liquified Ki energy, and enables them to live over four hundred years. The fourth stage, called Wanxiang, is the stage of manifestation, where the practitioner gains access to Divine Will, and increases their lifespan to eight hundred years. The fifth stage, called Primal, gives the practitioner the ability to live forever* (not actually forever)*, with no limits on their lifespan After that comes the Void or Earth mmortal Stage. When a practitioner reaches the Void Stage and attempts to progress to the next level. they shall be met with a final Tribulation. This is a test sent down by the heavens in the form of heavenly wind, fire, and lightning strikes that they must either bear or face total soul annihilation. Then they must pass a test of their Dao Heart in the form of the Demonheart Tribulation, where they shall be tested to see if they are truly dedicated in the matters of Cultivation, and whether they are willing to abandon everything for its sake, though it can be resisted with a powerful Heartforce. If they succeed in this Tribulation, they shall reach the Celestial Immortal Stage, or, in the case of Body Refiners, the Empyrean God Stage, where they shall break free of the mortal coil and the five elements. After that, there are two more stages for both paths of Cultivation: True Immortal for Ki Refiners, or True God for Body Refiners, and then Daofather for Ki Refiners, and Elder God for Body Refiners. Finally, there is the very pinnacle of power in the Three Realms, the World level. This is the level of cultivation Pangu was at when he created the Pangu Chaosworld, and Nuwa similarly reached. While there are even higher levels of power to be grasped, they need not be mentioned for now, and you won't be able to reach them during this jump. On a final note, once every three hundred years after a practitioner steps into the Zifu Realm, they will be met with a minor tribulation, which will build up in power until finally, they shall face one major tribulation every nine hundred years. Three centuries a Tribulation, nine a Calamity, this shall continue until they either reach the Celestial Immortal stage, or have their souls shattered. For the purposes of this perk you'll be given a technique in both Body Refining and Ki Refining that will last you until the Wanxiang Stage, at which point you'll have to fend for yourself. For 50 CP you can get one that will allow you to advance to the Celestial Immortal and Empyrean God level, using both types of cultivation. Regardless of whether you buy the technique that allows you to train to the Celestial Immortal/Empyrean God level or not, the technique you get is of the highest quality, and you won't need to worry about your future growth being crippled by using it. Your cultivation technique may be aligned towards whatever Dao you wish it to be. Required Secondary Abilities (0CP) The laws of this Universe are very different from those you are used to, and things such as moving faster than sound are possible for even the most base rank and file Yet they find themselves lacking things such as sonic booms. In this Universe and the ones you will travel to in the future, such protections will thus continue to exist. In addition to this, spending countless years on a single task, or just on living a normal life, also don't seem to be a problem for you anymore. * Just as a note any creatures created in the world by someone like those queens are absolutely loyalty"

Darkness is primordial energy and to call on its power is to grasp magic limited only by the caster’s own abilities. You have learned to harness this power for yourself, and your ability to customize and design spells and hexes is greatly enhanced. Using dark magic with any sort of magic system makes the end result much more flexible in possible effects than that system would normally allow, leaving the caster’s own abilities as the primary limiting factor. However breaking those limits or miscasting dark magic spells will inflict backlash on the caster. Your spells will tend to do so in ways that are perverse and inconvenient rather than life-threatening, but don’t push your luck unless you enjoy side-effects like nymphomania or comically-large breast enhancements which can’t be easily undone."

Often called scavenger's magic, Delfire is the combination of different forms of magic that has taken on new properties, becoming a small orb surrounded by an oddly colored flame-like aura. This is the source of delfire's name, and they do not emphasize fire over any other element. You are able to store these orbs of delfire within yourself, giving you resistance to disease, poison, curses, and corruption as it is eaten away by the delfire. Additionally, delfire acts as a spell matrix, capable of producing unusual effects when fueled by any type of energy. If you possess the Natural Magic perk, you may create orbs of Delfire by mixing various energies together. Post jump, you will be able to come across new orbs of Delfire naturally if you wish, however it is up to you whether the delfire spawns in the setting. Raven (0CP) Every villager that leaves the bounds of Ravenwood is accompanied by a raven. These ravens are fairly weak, but incredibly intelligent for animals and are able to act as scouts. You can double the number of ravens you possess by paying 50cp, this may be done multiple times (to a maximum of 16 ravens for 200cp, or 250cp for Denizens). A killed raven returns the next dawn. If you purchase a pet or similar creature in another jump, you may instead import your ravens, all of them, to gain any special traits the pet would offer. If you have the option to import a pet in some way, you may import all of your ravens with a single purchase, all of them gaining the same benefit. Additionally, you may purchase the following modifiers that may be added to your ravens; you may to decide how many of your ravens possess the modifier, including all of them. All such modifiers are discounted to Locals, if this would bring the price under 50cp or the modifier is already discounted, it is free Raven – Tempered (0CP) Your raven(s) are instead tempered ravens, with a slightly metallic appearance to their feathers, claws, and beak. These ravens possess incredible stamina and recover it quite quickly, which they can use to power delfire or to create a flame-like effect along their feathers that increases their speed, durability, and sharpness of their claws and beak at the cost of tiring themselves quickly. Finally, they are able to hold a single orb of delfire within their body to use, with all that entails"

Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over your mana, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing hello world and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience. Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it's bashing someone's head in with the Force rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach."

This perk gives you a measure of power in some form of mystic art common to your chosen setting, such as magic. The specific rules of this system will be down to your setting to determine but it must require the expenditure of a limited power supply such as mana, chakra, ki, spirit energy, or some other source of arcane energy. As with Inhuman we’ll use a tier system to describe your capabilities with this magic system but these tiers only describe the starting point of your power, you are fully capable of developing your skill and power with the abilities provided by this perk. For 100 CP you can be a Tier 1 mystic. This tier describes beings with very limited magical power such as newly-awakened magical girls or very weak monsters. Beings with this tier can choose for their magic to be weak but flexible, such as an apprentice wizard who has mastered 4-5 cantrips, or stronger but more specialized, such as a magical girl who can only cast fire magic but can do so strongly enough to fight a Tier 2 monster. This tier is at the lower end of what might be considered “street level”. Characters of the Demon King origin receive this tier for free and deduct its cost from the cost of the higher tiers. For 200 CP you can be a Tier 2 mystic. This tier describes experienced mages and powerful monsters at the upper end of street level. A Tier 2 mage can defend himself against most conventional threats such as men with guns and often has an array of powers at the level of a Tier 1 specialist. A Tier 2 specialist might be a psychic with telekinesis strong enough to knock a small building off its foundations or a magical girl who can pose a serious threat to a full-fledged demon king. For 300 CP you can be a Tier 3 mystic, which is the realm of the aforementioned demon kings as well as powerful wizards with years of training and experience. A generalist of this level may have over a dozen separate powers ranging from shields to illusions to fireballs to teleportation, all of it at the level of a Tier 2 specialist, and Tier 3 specialists may be as powerful as a Tier 3 monster, able to pose a significant threat to entire military forces and deal damage to whole city blocks at a time with their magic."

You could consider it a magical blueprint of how something works. And it truly shows everything: skills, abilities, physical makeup, personality, memory, and much more. Animals and plants have flowing auras, full of twists and turns, whereas processed items like machines have jagged auras, full of hard lines like a 3D circuit diagram. One peculiarity of Aura is that any of its changes are reflected in the being or object possessing the Aura. Xeno-shifters, an advanced Druid class, make use of that to mimic the aura of lifeforms they have studied in order to gain both their forms and abilities, for example. It is also how Technomancers are able to replicate the effects of implants within themselves, by simply copying their Auras into their bodies. But for all of its potential advantages, tampering with your own Aura can also go incredibly wrong if you mess it up, especially when it involves your brain, such as causing brain damage, death of personality, or just the normal kind of death. It's good, then, that with your skill at manipulating and changing Auras, yours and those of others, mistakes like that won't ever happen. It wouldn't be wrong to call you an Aura Artisan. So long as you have an example to study, you'll be able to safely and successfully apply any of its abilities or peculiarities either to yourself or somebody else, and even combine parts of the Auras of many beings to create truly powerful forms. After studying a massive amount of different Auras to get a feel for how they work, you'll even be able to go so far as to create original Auras and beings, or change parts of your Aura to give yourself entirely new abilities."

These are the natural flows of the world’s core energy, called Earth energy but it's nearly indistinguishable with magical and spiritual energy, the very source of a Earth Spirits power and the connection they have with the world. Whilst it is true that most Earth Lines are immobile and new ones don't appear, without the intervention of a powerful Earth Spirit, God, or Demon you thankfully are a strong enough spirit to do so. You're roughly equal to a God(dess) of the Second Class in raw power and able to move existing lines around to be more in tune with urbane developments or even produce new lines, though such an act would be hugely draining upon the you, on the level of spiritually and magically draining yourself completely in one go to be exact. These Earth Lines can be tapped into by Earth Spirits like yourself, or maybe if your nice and grant permission a few others could gain some benefits of these mystic lines of power, but only an Earth Spirit could use the power found in the Earth Lines to its full potential and non Earth Spirits will find the power on par with a diminished Third Class Earth Spirit."

This allows you to permanently merge items together, even CP items, but the more dissimilar they are, the more potential power is lost in the merge. Two magic swords would usually stack their power, but a magic sword and a magic bow combining would be reduced to one form and reduce the power of the final item a fair amount, though it would still be more powerful than either original. You can't do more than double the power of the strongest original item merged in this way, but you could add lots of bells and whistles that don't directly make it more powerful such as additional elemental affinities. Items that are designed to be merged (like gems) do not have the limitation of doubling their starting power, so if you merge 64 level one gems, you will end up with a level 6 gem."

These are much simpler to create compared to artifacts, requiring only the right herbs, water, and a catalyst of magical energy, which can be provided by even the most basic of spell matrices.

You have the knowledge and skill to be able to craft portals between different locations in space. Something within the range of a city can be done 'freestyle', using only your own Aura, though you may need to charge up energy beforehand. Longer range portals would need anchors and magical focuses, but you know how to craft such very easily. Through practice and study, the range of your personal portals and permanent portals can both expand, with personal portals eventually reaching intercontinental distances, while your permanent portals could eventually reach between stars. FREE: Aura - You possess the power of aura. Aura is something that bridges the divide between psychic powers and magic, being halfway between both. You can telekinetically manipulate the world around you to a limited degree, light fires, strengthen your body, boost your reflexes, etc. Aura is primarily used via Orbs, which will be discussed later. Your Aura level is slightly above average, by the lower standards of Lachiem, and slightly below average by the high standards of Vilete. In other words, you are overall very average. However, it is possible for this power to grow, given time, training, and use. As this power is halfway between a psychic power and magic, it can act as a bridge between other powers you have that fall in those areas. If you already possess psychic or magic powers, or if you gain them in the future, this power can draw on those powers' sources for energy, provide energy to them, or be used as a conduit for channeling energy between those powers. FREE: Paradox Proof - You will not be at risk of being erased or removed from time due to alterations to the timeline. When such changes happen, the area around you will shift to reveal the new timeline, and you will retain general memories of the prior timeline as well as gaining new memories from the new one. Time will bend to ensure that in the new timeline, you aren't in immediate danger following the shift. In this Jump in particular, such a shift will happen moments after someone travels to the past, with any and all changes they make occurring at once."

Their roots go back to hidden corners where a young wizard with more ambition and curiosity than sense discovered lore they weren't ready for, and started off on a journey to seize true might. Maybe some grow beyond that, but most don't. Whatever is the case, your magical growth is potent and many faceted. You can craft anything a mortal wizard could - any feat of craftsmanship short of the epic is yours. The understanding is solid enough to act as a prerequisite for you seeking more transcendent craftsmanship. You may also freely add a certain level of metamagic to anything you cast - up to the same limit as what you can cast normally. A Wizard who can cast fourth level spells could freely add up to four circles worth of metamagic without making the spell harder to cast. This empowerment doesn't need to happen in advance, and can instead be applied to spells as they are cast, taking no extra time to do so. Lastly, whenever they deepen their connection to the Arcane, more aspects of magic reveal themselves. Every Arcane 'Feat' they achieve, helps them achieve another three feats of magic - Metamagic, Reserve, Spell Penetration, or something else appropriate."

However, the main benefit of this technique lies in the increased flexibility, as each Seed may be Cracked to fuel each other rather than simply their own effect, even combining their effects if multiple Seeds are Cracked at once. This technique also frees any Seeds so they may move within the user's Light, allowing it to be moved and used to enhance the body when it normally wouldn't be able to, a fact that makes hunters that know this technique quite dangerous to fight as they can maintain far more Seeds than more restricted Seed Sorcerers. The process to learn this technique is difficult, requiring years of training to accomplish, and most won't be able to do more than a single Weaving at once. You, however, are skilled in the technique, able to weave up to four Seeds in a single Weaving and up to three such Weavings at the same time. You may teach others to use this technique."

      "description": "Spiritual Array Master (400CP) Making a Spiritual Array is simply a special method of resonating Spiritual Energy. It will activate the Spiritual Aura within the world, creating both offensive and defensive measures. Spiritual Arrays are made up of Spiritual Seals. The more powerful and talented someone is, the more seals they can make. The more complex the array, the more seals are needed. Seal masters are divided into 9 ranks, 1 to 9, each much harder to reach than the last, though the actual ranks are slightly more complicated after the 5th rank. Few people will even be able to reach the 5th rank. Despite it sounding simple, once you get to the threshold of a rank making the next seal becomes much harder, similar to making a breakthrough in cultivation. You have been trained up to 3rd rank, able to create more than 100 seals. Nothing groundbreaking but impressive nonetheless. But you also have an advantage that would make many envious; you have the potential to enter the Heart Array State at will, allowing you to improve your array skills extremely quickly, as well as increasing your ability in its use while in the state. Keep training and you can eventually enter the higher forms of it like the Heart Eye State which greatly increases your array capability. Book of Array Diagrams (100CP) Having the ability to create and summon array seals is all well and good, but it is next to useless if you do not know any of the ways to arrange them in order to create an array. There are hundreds of different kinds of arrays one can make and a single misstep will cause your array to collapse. This book that you have found yourself with contains the formula for several arrays of your skill level. This book also gives details into creating your own arrays and a bit into how they work. A good starter guide if you ever wanted to teach others. These arrays will range from defensive ones, to attacking ones, to illusion ones. Cultivation (0CP) You gain the ability to cultivate, starting off at the Spiritual Movement Stage. The cultivation of the Great Thousand Worlds is Spiritual Power. If you happen to have already cultivated Dou Qi from Battle Through The Heavens, you will find that the Dou Qi has the unique ability to convert itself into the purer Spiritual Power. This means that you can essentially choose to integrate your two cultivations together and boost your Spiritual Power to high levels immediately, or keep them separate. The cultivation of the Thousand Worlds goes several realms higher than that of Dou Qi, so it can become much stronger. There are 12 stages of the cultivation of Spiritual Power, with each stage being split into a variety of levels. In the more backwater places, you would be lucky to find someone who has reached the level of Heavenly Fusion, while in the more populated areas it is not uncommon to find Sovereign class cultivators. In the Spirit Stage of the Spiritual Energy cultivation path, one has the ability to ingest the Soul Essence of a Spiritual Beast. However, there is a limit to the Soul Essence. As you get stronger, the Soul Essence that you have refined before will gradually lose its effect. This means that most essences will lose their effect before the Heavenly Completion Stage. However, if the Soul Essence that you have refined is powerful enough, the power will still remain even in the later level, giving those that have them an edge. Reaching the Sovereign Stage marks a major change in your cultivation. One must pass through 3 'disasters' where your body, energy, and soul are refined to a higher grade, yet failure is easy and can carry fatal consequences. Once you reach pass these trials and reach the Sovereign stage you will gain the Sovereign Sea, which is a much more powerful container for your Spiritual Power. The spiritual energy itself of Sovereign Masters possesses unique attributes. Some people's spiritual energies are cold in nature, and some are blazing hot. This is because their spiritual energies have their own sagacities depending on what kind of energies they take in and have attuned it to. Sovereigns also gain the ability to cultivate a Sovereigns Body which, depending on the rank, can give them great physical power. There are certain Celestial Body techniques one can cultivate to gain a more powerful Sovereigns Body, though they are often closely guarded secrets of clans. By pouring your Spiritual Power into someone else, you can awaken their ability to cultivate, not that that will do them much good without further guidance."

While levels are increased the more one trains, skill levels are set in stone by birth, and do not rise or fall. Level 0 (Free) Makes the individual capable of effectively doing the task normally, but without any particular aptitude for it. Most people tend to have dozens of skills at this level. Level 1 (100CP) Relative talent that lets the user perform the skill up to a professional level, while it’s not bad by any means, one shouldn’t expect to gain fame with this alone. For example, Sill Plain possess a Level 1 Skill at Magic, while she is decent in the magic arts and can use it effectively in battle, there’s a lack of power and versatility. Level 2 (200CP) At this point the user is a genius at their skill. More than enough to create unique signature abilities. Respected swordsmen like Rick Addison or Rance have a Sword Combat Skill of Level 2, it what lets them create their special attacks. For comparison Shizuka Masou also possess a Level 2 Skill at Magic. Level 3 (500CP) This level is basically legendary, and the user is the best of the best at the skill. Few people in history had a skill at this level and their potential is insanely high. As example, Annise Sawatari has the Magic Skill Level 3 and easily overpowers any other mage in the Continent. Even with little finesse and experience, the raw power of her spells can easily exceed the combined effort of 2000 mages."

This perk follows you in the future too, providing you all of these effects in any and all magic you become able to do. This perk is a capstone booster, meaning that it serves to enhance each of the origin capstones in their own ways. The interactions are mentioned alongside the respective perks."

Now older, you've put your heart and soul into refining that artistic talent to the point it became a bit...mad in the process, Jumper. You can manipulate 2D and flat 3D images in impossible ways like making non-magical paintings talk, turning a picture of running shoes into actual running shoes, and if you draw a T-Rex bursting out of the wall with chalk it can attack and drag people into the wall with it, and many more strange things besides. You also have a close connection with the things you draw as well as the 2D dimension and can interact with them in strange ways. Draw a dark tunnel with an exit at the end and you can walk through it like a portal, stick your hand to a flat wall and become a 2D cartoon painting that can move and travel through deep cracks to enter rooms, even create traps just by drawing them where people will step. You can do all this and more, Jumper, so long as you have the materials or viable surfaces, as your artistic talent could make Michelangelo weep if you put enough thought into it."

Nowhere is this clearer than the debate on whether a fake thing can surpass the real thing or not. You have a certain ability based on what is real and what is fake, depending on which of the three options below you pick from. You may buy this perk multiple times, though each option is only discounted to Specialists. The first option is to believe that what is real will always trump what is not. You gain the ability to make any real thing automatically trump over any fake copies over that same real thing, such as making a genuine legendary sword always cut straight through any replicas made of that legendary sword, and that these real things will also possess a strong advantage against any fake thing in general, such as a genuinely made shield being much stronger against imaginary bullets or magical fire. The second option is to believe that there is no actual difference between a fake and the real thing. This allows you to treat good quality fake things as if they were actually the real thing, even if they don't match exactly. Those fake legendary swords, even if they are normally significantly weaker than the real deal, can instead become the real thing in full at your command. The final option is for you to believe that fake things can eventually surpass the real thing, if they earnestly try for such a thing. With this, you can force fake copies of things to slowly grow in power until they are twice as good as the original real thing and then improve further so long as they are constantly used. Those fake blades might not be as good as the real deal"

Such spell matrices last much longer than common spells, able to persist for weeks on a single casting. Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes. This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years.

As a result High Elves have a slew of powerful traits and abilities that have them stand out from normal elves. Your bloodline, in addition to granting you a powerful raw talent in magic and a lifespan measured in millenia instead of centuries, also allows you to sense the flow of the world’s magic around you, detecting any irregularities so that they can be corrected. The most potent ability of the High Elves however, is that they each are born with a divine connection to the goddess, and through that connection can cast potent ‘miracles’ that she channels through your body. While many of these miracles are of a more minor note, such as healing the sick or restoring the stamina of an exhausted elven warrior, occasionally she even deigns to grant powerful boons to her chosen, allowing them to call down vicious storms or arouse the spirits of nature to attack your enemies. Additionally, since they share a direct connection with the Goddess, other elves were spiritually programmed to treat them and their words with religious reverence that exceeds even the authority of elven monarchs, so you have a lot more social leeway and influence for whatever tasks you need done. As an added bonus, since the Goddess desired her chosen to stand above other elves, you are surprisingly tall too and possess much longer (and more sensitive) ears than the common elf. While High Elves are uniformly female, I’ll allow you to become one as a male if you so wish. The miracles the goddess grants you are especially potent if you are bathed in her divine mana near the Divine Trees. Be careful though as the farther you go from the Divine Trees (and the mana of the goddess) the weaker your miracles will get. If say, some random humans were to knock you out and bring you back to one of their cities or a magically warded area you’d be vulnerable to whatever deviant desires they may have. Any High Elf who finds themselves in this situation will find the voice of the goddess oddly silent to their pleas for help. Oddly enough the few lust corrupted High Elves that exist claim that the Goddess has not abandoned them, instead gazing over in the perversions they are committing to the point where the High Elf can feel the intensity of her presence. One of these High Elves even went so far as to say that they heard a soft moaning on the other side of their connection to the Goddess. But that’s probably just falsehoods they use to justify their debauchery."

For instance you can cleanse a girl of evil spirits with a normal purification ritual or you can make her actively repel and burn demons that try to lay hands on her with a ritual that involves rubbing a sacred aphrodisiac lotion into every inch of her body. What’s more, by employing these rituals with other kinds of magic you might have you can add sacred power to any other magical spell or effect you might know, turning even ordinary elemental magic into sacred demon-slaying magic. You can also choose to employ non-Shinto rituals if you’d rather be powered by some other religion instead."

      "description": "Restriction/Formation Expert (300CP) Formations and restrictions are two different yet similar methods of achieving similar results. Formations are ordered structures built from materials and powerful resources that can accomplish a variety of tasks, including teleportation across vast distances to pre-set destinations, creating incredibly powerful barriers to keep enemies out or allowing multiple weaker people to work together to create a far more powerful force. One of the most potent examples of formations, one that only late Second Step and Third Step cultivators would know about, is the Realm Sealing Formation, an unimaginably vast sealing formation that separates the Cave World into the Inner and Outer Realms. Restrictions, on the other hand, require no resources aside from knowledge and the divine sense and they can change according to the will of the user, making them much more dynamic and free-form as compared to formations. The most common use for restrictions is to boobytrap an area, filling a space with manifold restrictions that require long periods of careful study to bypass, lest you step on a blade of grass that will become a storm of blades that simultaneously sets off all the adjacent restrictions and creates a truly dangerous predicament. You have an incredible talent for your chosen discipline, as well as years of experience and a well honed sense of intuition for unknown restrictions or formations. This talent and experience has manifested in a particularly piercing gaze, allowing you see through restrictions, formations and patterns with incredible ease. Cultivation (0CP) This represents your ability to cultivate, be it your body, your soul, your spirit or stranger things. Whatever the path, you have an average talent with all of them, representing a span of physical potential, mental ability and potency of self. Your willpower is bolstered, enough that the pains and hardships everyone must face are bearable. Focusing on one thing or another for long periods of time is now easy. Drop-ins start at the first stage of Qi Condensation, but have no method or techniques they didn't buy here. Mortals have no cultivation and thus no method or technique, but still retain the same level of talent as the others, barring any other purchases. Young Cultivators have a method of average value, a small handful of middling techniques and a cultivation mid-way through Qi Condensation. Old Cultivators have a cultivation of early Foundation Establishment, a potent method and a collection of techniques that would make any junior envious. You aren't restricted in the heights your cultivation can reach, but with just this it's unlikely you'll make it far with just this. Once you leave this jump you will be able to give other people the ability to cultivate. Formation and Restriction Flags (500CP) This is a set of formation or restriction flags, created from a great deal of resources, that allow you to easily set up formations, or employ restrictions, on the fly. For 100 CP you receive a set of nine basic formation or restriction flags. The set of formation flags each have one fairly basic formation that can be set up on any location in moments, and removed just as easily. They contain basic formations such as ones that can gather enough spiritual energy from the surroundings to greatly aid the cultivation of even a Foundation Establishment cultivator, seal areas so that even peak Foundation Establishment cultivators have to go to great lengths to break into them, or link the energies of a set of people inside a certain area so that each of them is as strong as all of them put together, up to the peak of the great circle of Foundation Establishment. The set of restriction flags contains flags of the same strength except that these contain one restriction each. They contain basic restrictions such as ones that can launch attacks when unauthorized people trespass on certain places, restrictions that can trap locations, doors, chests or items and trigger preset effects when they are interacted with in certain manners, or even restrictions that act like spells and abilities of significant strength and can be used actively in combat. You can obtain either set for 100 CP and both for 200 CP. Formation Experts receive a basic set of Formation Flags for free and Restriction Experts receive a basic set of restriction flags for free. And both of them can modify and even replace the formations and restrictions in the flags. For an undiscounted 100 CP you can upgrade all your sets of flags. Upgraded sets have flags that can hold multiple formations or restrictions, up to nine each. The upgraded flags can hold restrictions of any level of strength and the formations or restrictions they hold to start with have increased in strength to the Core Formation level. * Cultivation is needed to make use for formations/restrictions"

      "description": "Wizard (200CP) You're a full-fledged member of the White Council, with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that entails. A lot of times that's more hassle than it's worth, especially with a war on, but there's a lot of resources you can call on when you need to, as long as you're prepared to repay the favor when need be. What this background really gets you is the full training a wizarding background offers, which has left you able to call on the entire array of everything magic is capable of. And, with enough time and preparation, there's very little which doesn't fit within that category. One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in \"When all you have is a hammer\" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation. 1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law. 2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target. 3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience. 4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one. 5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line. 6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands. 7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the \"local\" Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters. Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree. They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it. Soul Source (600CP) Somehow, you've gained the power of Soulfire; the ability to use the energies of your soul to enhance your magic. By infusing a spell with notjust your will, but all your being, it'll be infused with a sort of \"mystic rebar,\" granting it a lot of strength and giving it significantly more structure. Since your self is part of the spell now, it also functions more along the lines of your intentions, rather than just providing you with a raw boost. Of course, this comes at a cost: you're literally burning away part of your soul for power. Souls do heal up, especially when engaged in \"soul-affirming\" activities, but overuse might be worse than fatal."

You can even make gynoids and transfer the consciousness of a person into said gynoid if you felt like it. All Magic Affinity (400CP) Like what it implies, you have an Affinity with all types of magic, including all types of Null magic. This means that you have the (possibly unique) ability to use all types of magic in the world, needing only to know the chant needed to activate it and a general idea of what the magic is supposed to do. For example by knowing that the Gate spell requires the chant of gate and that it is a spell that opens a portal to a place you have already been you would be capable of casting that spell.

      "description": "Mantra Generation (0CP) A being with a soul (you do have a soul, right?) can generate Mantra by prayer or feeling emotion. This mantra can be utilized by devices powered by Mantra Technology, or the Demigods of Shinkoku Trastrium. Guide of Naraka (100CP) You gain a secondary form that of a golden spider. You gain the ability to visit Naraka, the space between the living world and the engine of reincarnation, dangling from a single spool of divine spider silk. When inside Naraka, you may manipulate souls who are attempting to climb the infinite towers and return to their lives, rendering them your catspaws. Finally, when in this state your voice takes on an eerie intonation that subliminally influences a subject's emotional state. The spiderform also helps you think up armor piercing questions and baffling Koans. You cannot spend more than 24 hours in Naraka. If you do, you must climb out as described in Tower of Naraka. Demigod (100CP) You are one of the elite masters of Mantra, equivalent to the Eight Guardian Generals/Seven Divinities in power if not actual rank. You have access to the most extensive theotechonological advancements and training techniques. Mantra Levels: Your maximum Mantra Level is what you can safely wield before damaging yourself. If more Mantra is focused your way, you run the risk of exploding, or turning into a planet powered rage monster. Neither of these outcome are guaranteed, of course. Your Maximum Mantra Level begins at 0 before any perks. Mantra Affinity (100CP) You are empowered by a single flavor of sentient emotion. When acting within the themes of your dominant Mantra, you are capable of peak human feats. You count as both a prayer source and an emotional source of Mantra. There are eight Mantra affinities, Wrath, Violence, Vanity, Sloth, Melancholy, Lust, Greed, and Pride. Without a Mantra Affinity, you are denied the strength of emotion, and must subsist on ordinary Mantra. By taking this perk, your safe Mantra Level is set to 2, and you always count as having a minimum of Mantral Level 1 for purposes of determining such feats. A Tangled Web Weaved (200CP) You gain a true god's understanding of Mantra's fundamental nature. Strangely, it seems to resemble a spider's web, and you are able to manipulate it into a batch of silken threads. You may spin silk in your spider form, or from your hands. It can be anchored to air itself, and are made of glittering golden Mantra. The strands are nigh unbreakable save by superhuman effort. With skill, care and practice over centuries, perhaps it can be manipulated to more complex tasks than mere ensnarement... Mantra Training and Techniques (200CP) You have learned or been taught numerous techniques to focus and express your Mantra, rendered as supernatural martial arts and superhuman feats of agility, durability and so on. Meditative Kata can extend your natural lifespan, heal minor wounds and fight off sickness, while strikes and attacks could shatter walls. This increases your maximum Mantra level by 1. As an added benefit, this perk also allows you to create your own personal Mantra Form. Your first form will take approximately five years of study and meditation to fully construct, but when completed, you will be able to manifest an external mantra interface. To most people, it will look like an ornate halo, evocative of your personality and mantra affinity. A Mantra Form usually has a core theme, such as improved combat ability, damage resistance, speed or other such boosts. Establishing a form enhances your abilities, even beyond what a given level of Mantra would normally allow. With a mantra form active, you may easily perform superhuman physical, mental and social feats, even before the direct application of Mantra. These stances and techniques however cannot enhance stranger powers such as psychic blasts or arcane magic, short of ensuring you can survive to perform them. Successfully creating an initial form and manifesting it increases your capacity for Mantra by 1. Subsequent forms and other perks can increase this cap further, to a maximum of 8. You may use any mantra form you know, but you cannot stack them. Creating a new form takes ten years, times the number of forms you have already mastered. Your halos can be attacked however, and if knocked aside or even destroyed. If that happens, you immediately drop down to Mantra Level 3, and any excess Mantra is wasted. Cyborg Hindu Godbody (400CP) You have a genetically, cybernetically and magically enhanced physiology, and the knowledge to propagate this technology. Your capacity to wield Mantra is enhanced, both accepting general Mantra as well as your primary association. This constructed body can heal itself, or be repaired by yourself or others. Your magical physiology is obvious, but always aesthetically pleasing. You can survive in space without a suit, endure planet busting attacks with sufficient Mantra, and are otherwise ageless. This increases your maximum Mantra Level by 2."

Sockets are the mounting points for gems, and they define how the gem's power is expressed in the world. They don't provide any power, but they provide a path for existing power to flow along in order to achieve specific results. This perk makes you an expert at the types of sockets in the gemcraft world, and also allows you to come up with novel designs in the future. All gemcrafters know how to create Towers, Gem-Traps, Lanterns, Amplifiers, and Pylons, but you can make more efficient versions of them that syphon off some of a gem's spare power to reinforce themselves. Oh, and we'll even toss in Magical Walls for free. Be aware that these structures are made of solidified mana and thus the more of them you have linked to your Orb of Presence (or around your personal fortress) the more building a new one will cost. Chromafactor (600CP) Different wizards use different colors of gems to enact different effects. This perk allows you to create new gem colors based on any magic that you understand at a fundamental level. The gems can then be used as inflexible but incredibly potent foci for those effects. If a normal sleep spell could cause a strong foe to become drowsy, the applications of a gem that can send entire armies into eternal slumber are hopefully obvious. This also acts as a capstone booster, providing additional benefits from each origin's capstone perk"

Those with Kuroinu alignment gain access to Keanne’s particular brand of skills. Whether it be creating magic sealing collars, an elixir that makes a woman's mouth incredibly sensitive, modifying monsters/humans to greater (sexual) heights, or even creating a spell that allows you to command those under its power to follow your exact commands, emphasis on exact. Your powers aren’t just sexual either as you also can create a powerful barrier that greatly weaken a mage and disables their magic. Those with the Seven Shields Alliance on the other hand will find a much more noble form of magic. Empowering your allies to stand strong and match the beastmen and orcs in strength while standing up to juggernauts such as the ogres with much greater strength. You can also heal their wounds, at low power allowing those affected to recover from minor wounds much faster from battle damage, and at max power regenerating even lost limbs in seconds, although such powerful healing magic would take a lot out of you. Or rejecting both you could always gain powerful dark magic instead, while you are no Queen Olga, you would still have noticeable skill. Dark magic includes things such as raising the dead to act as minions, directly lashing out at foes with your magical power and Queen Olga was able to make the lands around her Black Citadel inhospitable to all but the most stalwart of creatures to deter and weaken her enemies. If you happened to buy Voice of God then in addition to your chosen magic you also have learned Kaguya’s ability to craft magical talismans. While these magical creations don’t pack the punch that someone like Olga would have as a mage they still can be used to weaken or even kill those hit with them and you can even give them out to your followers for them to use in a pinch. If you are ever desperate you could always craft a talisman placed on your own body that kills anyone who has sex with you, but a strong enough constitution such as an ogre can always...pierce that protection. Voice of God (400 CP Discount Seven Shields Alliance): Perhaps you lead another band of religious warriors similar to Kaguya, are a high ranking member of the church around Celestine, or are simply just some random cult leader that is aligned with the Seven Shield’s Alliance. No matter the case you hold great sway over the religious. The power of this perk is three fold. First you seem to exclude a voice that speaks with god’s Authority and if the god you worship actually exists then you have the ability to speak with them directly or at the very least know what they wish for you to do in a situation. As an added bonus you also seem to have gained the Priestess's God’s ability to communicate with workshippers. Whether God is an actually divinity or just a mage pretending to be one like Shamhaza claims, his power could still serve you well if you ever wanted to found a religion of your own or wanted to inspire those that follow you."

While you cannot make life from nothing, you can harness any source of life or spirit to create a soul for a living being. Without a source you may still make complicated facsimiles of life similar to A.I. and or elementals. You may forge, re-forge, temper, purify, and heal any kind of mind, spirit, body, or soul cleaning it of corruption, deterioration, disease, tarnish, blemish or error, strengthening it against harm or others interference. While you do have the ability to do the same to even yourself, it will take a great deal of time or power, as you were crafted by the titans themselves and already tempered to such an extent to be able to wage war against the corrupting and chaotic forces of the old gods and elementals. Your ability to craft and uplift bodies and souls allows you to create races up to a similar power and form as the Mogu, Tol'vir, Iron Vrykul, Earthen, and Giants. You have the ability to resurrect any being weaker than yourself into its original body or into a new body up to a form you could create, as long as a beings, mind, spirit, soul hasn't been captured or restrained you can resurrect it freely, even if its essence is being restrained. You have the ability to transition between the realms of the living and the dead, attack incorporeal beings with physical matter and even if a soul is destroyed as long as you can find even a fragment of it or the being that destroyed it you can use the fragment or shatter the destroyers soul to re-forge the original soul, you may need a source of life or spirit to rebuild it as if creating a new soul from scratch. You May Choose: Priest Enhanced: Given the same amount of time and effort you could create beings on par with the titanic-watchers themselves, elevate the proto-dragons into full dragons, or raise the dead as Val'kyr. But now given enough time those are not limitations to what you can create, given enough time to forge and craft you could create a being to rival anything, old god, naaru, dragon aspect there is no limit as long as you have the time to forge strengthen and imbue more energy or craft with better materials. The stronger and more skilled you grow the faster this process becomes. The life you create can be given extraordinary abilities to travel between the realms of the living and dead or the dream interacting with such realms with ease. You could craft intangible or incorporeal bodies, or forms made of living lighting. Even without access to spirit you could craft a soul from any of the primal forces creating an arcane soul or a soul of light, while they fundamentally work differently and some scholars may argue with you it is life. Anything you craft will be unfalteringly loyal to you, obeying any order or command you have never trying to betray you. While this is happily and willingly desired by things you create from scratch or imbue with its first wil., the resurrected may only be begrudgingly held to this standard. This specialty applies to anything you can create not just life. No sword you forged could ever harm you unless you wanted it to and if it was a living weapon it may even slice it own wielders throat if they tried to use it against you. You may put limitations on wielders like Odin did with Mjolnir. You are now a font of Light, you may wield and imbue light into all your magic and crafts, while not infinite or even at the level of a Na'ru the light in you will continue to grow and will eventually allow for true light forging.

You have the ability to craft landscapes, you can easily shape mountains, valleys, rivers and seas to your liking in minutes enriching the earth and sky with magic to amplify and encourage or discourage the flourishing of life or specific species. Everything you build is a masterful work of art, both beautiful and functional beyond compare. The things you create being sturdier and nearly indestructible fighting off the weathering of time and the environment even without the use of magic, a painting you made could be lost in an acid swamp for millennia and barely need a light dusting and drying to make it presentable. You also have an intuitive sense of any crafts you come across instinctively knowing what it once was no matter how rundown it is, even a small shred of a few strands of a quilt would do, having visions of and knowing its full purpose, intent, and how it was used; you have the ability to understand the original creators design and how to improve it both functionally and artistically. Anything you restore qualifies as being crafted by you for the purposes of any effects you have, including your preservation skills and quality skills. Anything you are actively crafting, have crafted, or in charge of can be preserved by your will and an occasional thought, this being an active force protected against harm, decay and entropy. Only beings who directly intend to harm you or the things you have crafted or preserved can hope to damage them and even still such damage is lessened, and you will be able to restore such things later. You may repair and restore things to exactly as they were or an improved state up to your level of crafting; your powers of preservation and restoration can apply to non-crafted things that you watch over such as the environment, climate, weather, and enchantments. You May Choose: Hunter Enhanced: You may now craft impossibilities into your lands, cut a mountain or raise a continent into the sky where it will stay, imbue the land with the ability to fight back and defend itself against invaders, build world machines and city forges to aid in the creation of anything you can imagine. Your crafts are as immortal and timeless as yourself, nearly impervious to outside forces. You can build temples to enhance the gather of worship and various types of energy, forge and craft mega structures like sky elevators and dyson spheres, even artificial suns and black holes are within your grasp as long as you have the materials and magics. The prisons you build could trap old gods, multidimensional beings, eldrazi, or the like forever this extends to the point of beings that aren't just stronger than you but god like in their strength to you. You could build a tomb to imprison Sargeras till the end of time long after the heat death of the universe and your prison will still stand. Whatever you build will function as intended no matter how impractical the design is. This comes with the added ability of being able to force higher dimensional beings or entities from other realms into whatever realm you are crafting in. That ghost who can phase through solid objects can't phase through your bricks, or fist, unless you allow it. This comes with more esoteric capabilities like building rivers out of fire, mountains out of smoke, a living tree out of feathers and glass that is still capable of photosynthesis. Your alchemical capabilities are to the point you can not only transmute metals to stone, or vise versa, you could transmute things into organic materials of your liking or something between organic, inorganic, energy, and dreams. You are now a font, well, and battery of Arcane. Short of the titans themselves you are the strongest source of arcane energy. Arcane energy flows from you with ease allowing you to supply this power to whatever you like. You May choose: Monk"

Designed to act as a medium between the Pantheon and Azeroth, flesh from one, mind and soul from the other. Traits - All titanic-watchers are immensely powerful beings, expert craftsmen, and masterful warriors wielding magics and skills for the purpose of destroying the old gods, taming the elementals, and ordering worlds from chaos. You must choose whether you are of the stone crafted Vanir or the metal crafted Aesir. The Vanir are titan-forged watchers fashioned from stone with command over the powers of the earth and fire. The Aesir are titan-forged watchers fashioned from metal with command over the powers of storms, wind, and lightning. While all titanic-watchers are already more skilled than even the greatest of mortals dare to dream, all titanic-watchers have specialties. You may choose Warrior or Mage as a class, and you choose one of the following specialties: Weaver of Dreams: You have the ability to design new spells from scratch if need be, but you have an intrinsic understanding of all forms of magic or spells you come across. While you might not have enough power to actually wield those forces you will absolutely understand them. But what good is knowledge if you can't do anything with it? You laugh at such notions as you can always find a way to improve any magic, making any given spell, enchantment, or ritual more versatility, faster to cast, faster to recover, require less mana or resources, stronger, and increasing the duration; basically, any means by which a spell or enchantment could be improved is improved by double or half as appropriate. But you do not simply cast spells, you craft magic itself, from arcane sources, wielding forces beyond compare, making new spells, enchantments, and rituals as needed. Even on the fly, with comparative capabilities of other magics within that area, your improvisational magic is inspired and artistic in the extreme allowing you to incorporate any kinds of themes for your magics or supernatural abilities. As you are wielding the raw craft of the arcane itself, your spells cannot be countered unless the counter would negate magic itself (a counter fireball or counter any fire magic spell would not work against your fireball, they would have to have a counter for any magic spell, anti-magic effect.) Your magic is more resilient and more easily bypasses defenses, your enchantments take on a life of their own as you are able to weave enchantments into intrinsic natures to create wonders of spell craft such as true alchemy creating new substances, pocket dimensions, magical terrains and sacred places on the order of mythals, legendary spells, and magical items akin to artifacts, and mythical charms. Your magical strength and reserves are increased by an order of magnitude , and this specialty implies to any kinds of magic or similar supernatural abilities you have such as divinity or psionics. You May Choose: Druid Enhanced: You can weave magic into intricate reality so as to define the laws and natures of the world it's in and create spaces, realms, and dimensions that overlap with each other. With enough arcane energy magic can even be used to create realities and dreams that are interchangeable making something real into a dream or something that was once a dream into real thereby granting you the ability to craft matter and dreams themselves. Creating something like the Emerald Dream, for the dreams of life and world, or even the shadowlands, for the souls of the dead, would be easy for someone like you, if not time consuming, It took Freya a few thousand years to complete the emerald dream, which still required regular maintenance, preservation, and protection. Not only are you able to create new realms, you can freely travel worlds and sub-planes such as the old planes of the dream or the emerald nightmare. You can build gates to other worlds and planes or simply travel there directly, you can enter the spaces between spaces or even make them yourself. You have an intrinsic understanding of your place in the world and where to find things, lost or known, physical, ephemeral, or even knowledge. You are never lost, can easily find your way home or through any maze or labyrinth uncover all its secrets like child's play. And if someone ever does try to trap or endanger you you may simply step back into one of the realms you've made from anywhere. You have also become a font, or well, and battery of Life and spirit able to wield not only arcane magics, but druidic and shamanic ones as well, imbuing it into your craft. Your spirit energy and life force will continue to grow, which can be enhanced by proper usage of your realms and enchantments. You May Choose: Shaman While your abilities and skills are far more vast, varied, and greater than any other races, besides your makers, your power is not. You are stronger than any normal dragon, but the dragon aspects outclass you, it would take dozens of you to kill an elemental lord, and a small army of you may not succeed in defeating an old god let alone killing one. However, for an additional 500 cp you will be a Keeper, personally chosen out of the army of titanic-watchers, imbued with strength beyond compare. Your power is so great that many of the lesser races worship you as a god. Two Keepers working together could kill an elemental lord with relative ease, and a keeper with a small squadron of titanic-watchers could defeat and capture an old god. You may choose one of the following: You gain a second specialization blending them so that both specialization's traits apply to all aspects of the other specialization , or you may gain an unmatched level of combat experience removing the restrictions on your class - any class or profession you gain you become the paragon of that class outmatching anyone with that same class as you to the point of being able to hit one level above your weight/power class with ease you can pick one extra class for free. Either way the strength of all your specializations are doubled and you gain Enhanced capabilities with them. You will be a leader and a tactician capable of organizing thousands upon thousands of people with ease to accomplish specific goals such as war, combating poverty, or finding a cure for a disease. People will be more likely to help you than not, even if they have nothing in particular to gain. Any companions, followers, friends, organizations, and family you had before find their loyalty towards you increased. Things that are a direct benefit to you are guaranteed to have any organizations you control work their hardest to see you succeed."

The more energy a person contains, the hornier they get. Usually in the breasts, testicles and cock. Note this growth isn’t permanent and shrinkage will occur as the energy is drained. Which can be done by draining the fluids. More energy is generated over time. By filling a person with a large amount of your fluids, you can jumpstart their own production of Winger energy. If you do the same to an animal, they will transform into a furry/anthro. Note that you can choose not to infect them with winger energy. You can also absorb energy from winger tainted fluids.

For 400 CP, not only can you infuse someone with Winger energy, but you can pass on your origin from this jump, as well as the 100 CP perk from that origin. As well, your energy transfer/absorption ratio becomes 1/5. For 600 CP, you can not only do the 400 CP abilities, but you can pass on any other biological perks you have. At first, they will be 1/100th of the power you have. But the more you stuff them with your cum, the close the perk will become to its original power. As well, your energy transfer/absorption ratio becomes ½ ◦ Unlimited power (600 CP): Congratulations. You have no limit to how much Winger Energy your body can store. You will never have to worry about becoming a level 5 or 6, with sexual organs too big to move. How is this even possible? This should not be physically possible. You are not physically possible!"

However, you also move at a reduced pace, as the sheer effort of manifesting this unnatural phenomenon drains you in more ways than simply energy. After trying this twice in rapid succession, you found yourself completely drained, but if you alone could perform such a feat even with significant support from any piece of ancient AMP technology then perhaps the Fal'Cie banned it out of fear that it would evolve to something greater Without this research available, and with most of the team lost, you wonder if it would have been impossible otherwise to reconstruct this technology. After all, only the significant presence of Chaos provoked the research to begin with, long after Gran Pulse had fallen."

It's also something you have the knowledge to make and more besides.

This covers both ordinary scientific knowledge and occult magecraft focused towards artificial bodies like this. It's quite possible to turn an existing person into one of these puppets, albeit more difficult than making it from scratch. One of the more impressive parts of this field is the techniques that allow for the recording and uploading of knowledge or skills that people possess. With a willing or incapacitated subject, you know how to examine what they know and copy it over to another person. Your studies in this field have also helped you realize how to capably combine magic with technology, creating things where the two work together to support and enhance both sides' effects instead of interfering. While you can't alter the basic metaphysics behind things such as mystery, you do know how to work it to your advantage."

CAPSTONE BOOSTED: This now extends to any abilities you have. Your creations are inherently linked to you and are receptive to your powers. You may have trouble finding a way to provide enough energy to machines to let them wield your full power, but you at least have the means to imbue any ability, perk, or attribute into your creations."

Understanding it allows for travel, for communication, and to battle the daemonic on even terms. You have come to be one of the very few experts on the subject of the warp, and know how to manipulate it through technology. You can easily craft psy-implants that boost or suppress psychic powers, weaponry incorporating psychic components, or hexagrammatic wards. With enough time and resources you could build or even improve upon existing patterns of gellar field generators, warp drives, and immaterial sensors. You have even made inroads into understanding the genetic influence behind the manifestation of psyker, pariah and navigator abilities. This is not an easy path to tread, for the slightest misstep or moment of carelessness can see you damned, and even with the most exacting precautions it is a road fraught with peril."

      "description": "In medieval Europe, Heron of Alexandria was known mostly for his philosophical works, but he also produced extensive texts on mathematics, physics and mechanics, which inspired a group of mechanic-mages known as the Mechanicians. These Mechanicians created magical mechanical beings known as Mechanica, some of which even had human-level intelligence. This knowledge spread throughout much of the Eastern Roman Empire, but died out in the fifth century as a result of religious persecution. You now have the knowledge and skill to revive this tradition, being capable of building Mechanica yourself. While these can be designed to perform simple mechanical tasks, they can also duplicate spell effects, and, with extra effort, they can be awakened, granting them magic resistance, the intelligence of an average human and a personality based on their form and materials. For example, a mechanical snake might be deceptive and prone to telling lies, while a being made from iron may be particularly stubborn. A being awakened this way begins its life very loyal to its creator, and will likely remain that way as long as it is not mistreated. Creating Mechanica does not require vis despite the fact that they will operate indefinitely if kept safe and well-maintained. The components required for their construction are very expensive, however."

A minimum of 200,000 souls all playing in your world all believing in it and wishing it was real will be your lower threshold for such a feat, that is your minimum threshold to start an unreal world down its path become a real world of its own.

      "description": "Vitriolic Craftsman (400CP) The artifacts of Malfeas differ on a fundamental level from those of Creation, and as such Infernal artisans have devised many techniques to create these infernal relics. The making of such artifacts requires the pure form of the dark and acrid liquid known as vitriol, and the binding of demons into these relics, dissolving their forms and integrating their still-living Essences into their creation. Under an infernal artisan's ministrations, pure vitriol serves as a catalyst. Objects bathed in it are seared free of weakness, making them as strong as any of Creation's magical materials; component parts flow together and intermingle, amalgamating into a unified whole. Where an artificer in Creation would spend months carving and shaping an artifact's components, his Malfean counterpart immerses them in vitriol and guides their slow, inextricable melding. Then, one slowly integrates the dissolved form of a living demon, known as Chalcanth or Azoth depending on their power, into the device's nascent structure. A demon must be of sufficient stature to match the power of a relic in order to bond with it, and likewise must its nature also accord with the relic's function if the procedure is to succeed. Now you too will join the ranks of hell's greatest artisans, with knowledge and skill that encompasses vitriol itself, the acids and catalysts derived from it and its use in the crafting of infernal relics. Your knowledge encompasses much understanding of demonic Essence, as well as the instinctive ability to use the appropriate mundane crafts to use together with vitriol as the catalyst. Bonding the Chalcanth to a Brass blade of your own design shall be a labor almost considered easy to an craftsman of your skill. Likewise the arts of demonic magi-technology and the creation and modification of life through vitalizing essence are known and practised by you, though their applications are somewhat more complex. As one of Hell's master artisans you may even surpass the limitations of the dull and feeble demonic essence contained within your creations, to instill them with a demonic will as a true Hellforged wonder with its own intellect and awakened essence. Demonic Bartender (Exalted - The Infernals) (200CP) Demons love their liquor. As water is extremely rare and milk nearly unknown in the demon realm, Hell instead offers a thousand infernal wines, whiskeys, brandies, vodkas and other drinks. Many of them contain other drugs, both natural and supernatural. Some are flat-out toxic to mortals. Still, those Exalts who cultivates an immunity to poison and cast-iron gullet can explore a world of strange intoxicants that range from gut-ripping vileness to soul-shuddering delight. You've gained an understanding on how to create all these brews yourself. How to ferment bone-wine, thanachvil, and gurshant. How to distill liquid emotions and waking dreams derived from Hegra's rains into elixirs. How to bottle the perfect pleasure that is sypax, or the liquid Lethe of final rest elixir... and finally, even the most precious drink in all of Malfeas, chalcanth. chalcanth is the liquefied, distilled essence of a demon. The unfortunate demon is dissolved in pure vitriol while still alive, so that drinking chalcanth is like tasting pure Being to a demon, and grants both Essence and memories to any who drink it. Of course if you'd prefer, it could also be used in forging infernal relics, by far the most common artifacts in hell. Chalcanth (50CP) The life force of a demon preserved in vitriol, chalcanth appears as a cupful of vibrant liquid. The color and consistency of any given dose varies with its origin, but the fluid always stirs restlessly of its own accord and issues a faint susurrus, as the demon liquified in its creation still lives. Chalcanth's primary purpose is the creation of infernal relics, but that is not its only use. Many in Malfeas seek it out as an intoxicating source of essence, because if one drinks it they will be energized as the flavors of the demon's mind and soul tumble through the drinker's brain in a synesthetic wash of images and emotions. With one purchase of this, you will gain a cupful of high quality Chalcanth once every five days. Purest Vitriol (50CP) Passive and reactive in nature, Vitriol was designed by the Primordials to catalyze evolutionary transformation in matter and Essence. But in the millennia since the Primordial War, the Yozis' loathing for their jailers, their captivity, and their own broken natures has permeated the very nature of vitriol, infusing it with their hate. Now, it consumes all that it encounters. The stuff bubbles in open pits laden with the detritus of all that it has dissolved, and these impurities must be removed before the vitriol may be used for magical purposes. With one purchase of this, you will gain a weekly supply of enough pure Vitriol to dissolve a demon in or baptise one relic smaller than a vehicle. Exotic Components (50CP) Artificers of hell construct their relics with a greater pool of exotic reagents than those of Creation-made artifacts, for the world-bodies of the Yozi are rich with alien metals, stones and woods, not to mention the tissues and excretions of countless species of lesser demons, animals, plants and other entities that mortal savants might not even recognize as life. Of course, while these many be easy to come across in hell itself, not all Infernals have the luxury of staying there whenever they work on their relics. So with one purchase of this, you will gain a starting wealth of exotic components and an additional weekly supply of more than enough to construct a lesser relic, straight from the Demon Realm."

Your brain and nervous system is such that your thoughts can travel ridiculously, mind-bogglingly fast, giving you a peerless speed of processing info. You can control this, to prevent going nuts from boredom if nothing else. Not that you would, your patience is inexhaustible and infinite, though your reflexes remain sharp through any length of time. You can focus on any number of things at once, working at all of them as if you were working on that thing alone. Your analysis and comprehension skills are similarly ridiculous, being practically miraculous. Patterns and puzzles unravel in front of you, revealing their secrets almost as if they want to, to you. You can analyze legal cases, codes, riddles and puzzles, conspiracies and schemes, and break them in less time than it takes most people to figure out what is happening at all.

The details are mentioned in the perk descriptions. Foaly Koboi Jumper (600CP) You're a genius among geniuses, in technology and magic both. Your technological skill is such that you find it child's play to create gadgets and weapons like Bio-Bombs, or the technological wonders that are LEP uniforms, or small devices that make toy cars nuclear-powered. You can even improve them or come up with more tech of similar levels, if not even more advanced. You're also a hacker of absolutely unmatched skill, capable of slicing through any and all systems, firewalls and defenses like a knife through butter, bending networks and websites to your will, and all the rest that comes with it. It doesn't matter how advanced or sophisticated it is, if it's electronic or digital and it can be accessed at all, you can penetrate all aspects of it until you control it outright - it's just a matter of time and effort. And very little of either, really. Your skills at magic are nothing less, either. Well, if you can do it at all. If you can, then your talent is nothing short of legendary, allowing you to master spells and rituals that would take other a lifetime in days, if not less. Your skills are distributed equally in all fields of magic, so much so that any advancement in one area automatically improves the others too. You could do things like study necromancy for a month and come out tossing lightning bolts like a pro. Capstone Boost Both your scientific and magical abilities get a massive boost, advancing you several times over in both fields. In addition, they work together now, making you an expert in making technology that mimics magic and vice-versa. You know how to create both technology and magic to do anything and everything you yourself are capable of doing. Spells to replace devices, vice-versa, and products that use both, that is, techno-magic. You're also capable of reverse engineering any and all magic and technology you encounter, now. No matter how advanced the tech or how obscure the magic, how powerful and complicated they may be, all you need is one look at any magic or technology to know the underlying principles under it, and how to recreate, modify and improve it in a hundred different ways."

While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn't included here - you'll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of 'SimilarPrinciples' to streamline the process...it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough. Mysterious Serum (300CP) Fascinating.

While this creates no stress or strain on your personality, the connection is diluted enough that you can't consciously access this memory...but when you come into contact with Lost Logia, you will rapidly gain insight into how it functions and possibly ways to engineer it once again. You will need actual technical skills to pull this off, but with a little bit of time, perhaps you can restore what is lost? Post-jump, this same insight applies to 'lost' or 'forgotten' technology, though you will likely need other sources of knowledge and abilities to truly restore it, depending on its complexity. May or may not come with brief instances of acting and speaking like a resident of the Belkan Empire at random intervals."

To you, magic is engineering, and can be automated and reproduced on an Industrial scale... at a considerable cost in life, as this sort of magitech runs not merely on Electricity, but also on the life Essence extracted from the bodies of the dying. This liquid Essence permits the manufacture of potions and enchanted items on an automated assembly line, or the breakdown of enchanted items into Essence and component materials. This can even extend to potions and enchanted items from other universes, provided you have mastered the relevant techniques, and have enough of the required raw materials to make automation worthwhile. IndustrialCraft (400CP) Working your way up from simple machines, you are able to build a vast array of advanced machinery, from the humble ore grinding Macerator, to the futuristic Mass Fabricator. In time, you'll be able to build automated factory complexes, supply all your power needs with nuclear energy, protect yourself with nigh impervious Quantum Armour, teleport between bases with ease, and terraform vast areas to suit your whims. Buildcraft (200CP) You aren't limited to building things yourself given some basic supplies and some redstone, you can use a system of gears and tubes to automate your crafting tables, create an item sorting system, and build massive automated quarries capable of stripping the land of all resources down to the bedrock. It'll take a bit to get started, but once you're up and running, you'll be sure to have all the resources you need. Railcraft (100CP) Instead of the crude minecart tracks you were able to make before, you are now able to make properly sturdy rails, able to bear the weight of full Steampowered trains that can pull a variety of useful carts. Using a system of tracks and automatic loader/unloaders, you can automate the delivery of resources and liquids from one place to another, or deploy 'railgun' systems to launch explosive filled carts at your enemies!

Lore of Alex (100) You know the mystic secrets of this world, and can easily assemble a portal to the Nether, given a supply of Obsidian. Should you acquire the necessary hellish reagents there, you'll be able to brew a number of useful magical potions.

It is notable that all these effects work generally in this world, and anyone can learn them here you just know it all from the start, and will be able to apply these effects with confidence in other worlds, or to things not normally found in this world. For instance, you'll be able to judge the enchantment capacity of arbitrary items with a glance, and that amount will be greater for you than it might be for other magi. Nether Eye (50) You'll be able to craft Nether Eyes from Ender Pearls and Magma Cream, which will allow you to easily locate Nether Fortresses, when you visit the Nether. You'll also have a pretty solid grasp of Overworld/Nether geometry, thus allowing you to 'safely' use Nether Portals as 'shortcuts' between distant parts of the overworld.

Your warehouse gains a portal that is linked to an artificial plane of existence that is of infinite size in all directions, where humanity or sapience of any kind never developed. You can find an unlimited number of any resources given enough time, but they are spread around as would naturally occur in nature, meaning you have to often move when you exhaust the local supply. Resources are always located in environments where you would find them on Earth, and when you travel to this world, you are able to choose which environment you arrive in, or return to any prior location you have been before. Environments have realistic distances between them, so if you need something found in several biodomes you need to return to your warehouse, or use a fast transport of some kind. Every time you gain a perk that requires access to a new raw material, this raw material appears in the most native form in this supply world and has to be collected as it normally would be. If your material is only found inside stars, you better be ready to get a rocket to go collect it somehow."

Your guild base also possesses a World Item of similar potency integrated into it, and you may purchase this option multiple times. Maybe you possess the Rainbow Bridge, which forbids all hostile forms of spatial manipulation within the guild base, while simultaneously providing unparalleled mobility to your own forces that pass through it, allowing them to quickly appear across any distance and even breach dimensional borders, and allowing them to quickly return once finished with whatever task they were set. Perhaps instead your guild base contains within it the Garden of Eden, a place said to contain at least a single copy of every plant (or plant like thing) in the entire world, and often many many times more than that for more common things, regrowing within a day anything that is taken. To say nothing of the mighty plant-based creatures that spawn from it that will help to defend your guild base, or how you could harvest from it constantly to feed an immense population. Or perhaps instead your guild base possesses an entrance to the legendary Agartha, a subterranean city long abandoned but filled with such mineral wealth that it could be mined forever, with an ore vein for every type of metal or precious stone one could imagine no matter how rare that replenish a mere day after excavation. If those don't tickle your interest, perhaps you will find the Scholomance to be to your liking? A school of dark and forbidden magic, filled with the knowledge of every spell imaginable, and that allows unparalleled control and manipulation of the weather and empowers the magic of all rightful inhabitants of the Guild Base while they are inside. Or maybe none of these things appeal, and you have a different idea in mind? So long as it is not one of The Twenty (ie: expendable 1-time effects), and so long as it remains entirely tied to the Guild Base itself, you may instead come up with your own World Item, with appropriate effects to apply to your base.

Though in your case, you'll simply need to think about it for the market to appear in its entirety in your mind, and can browse it at your leisure without having to pay any fees. From there, you can buy anything, as long as you can pay the price, though the price is inflated just a tad, such as Seeds of Water normally costing 1 silver going for 20 instead, and something incredibly rare like a Seed of Time costing half a million gold. Incredibly powerful items made by the Gods and normally only accessible through completing quests might even be priced at billions of gold. But this cost is worth it, as there really is literally anything available: items, hints on how to advance your abilities, skills and abilities themselves in their entirety, NPCs (artificial entities created by the system) of any level, whether you want to lease them or buy them outright, information, or animals and monsters. Even things of questionable usefulness can be found here, such as the sex tapes of the Gods (\"Goddess of Breasts VS. Goddess of Beauty, Beach Edition, Interactive\"), or the abilities to always sense the time of the day and to guess how many hairs there are on a creature. And if you had, say, a decillion gold and sacrificed the population of a planet, you could even buy yourself into Godhood. The wares available in the Gold Market will include ones from both worlds you have visited in the past, and worlds you will travel to in the future, so that its slogan of offering truly anything actually holds true for you, though the same price markup still applies. It'll also accept any currency you might have on you, instead of only recognizing the gold coins used in the system. And since you're a VIP, you can even sell things to the market, though you'll only get their normal prices for them instead of the marked up ones."

In addition to several rows of plots and potted plants of all kinds, it contains four larger plots; one at each corner, suitable for one large tree apiece. Planting any kind of magical raw material, such as Re'em blood or unicorn hair, makes a tree that grows that material. Liquid materials are stored in hard, coconut-like fruits on the tree, easily broken with concerted effort but highly unlikely to spill, split, or otherwise damage the surrounding plant life no matter how volatile your reagent is. Since it's a magically expanded greenhouse with literally every species of plant life in it, it also has a bit of magic so that all you need to do is think of what you need and start walking down a row, and you'll reach it within seven paces. All plants within this greenhouse are automatically cared for and reach maturity within a maximum of one week. Plants are kept docile by the greenhouse's magic, so don't worry about the Venomous Tentacula eating one of your ears while you're not looking. Doesn't automatically update in future jumps, but you can bring new plants into it manually and incorporate them into the greenhouse by planting them in the provided pots. A must-have for aspiring Potions masters."

One interesting facet of this can be seen in how on many worlds, dug earth and other natural resources are replaced by the ambient mana over the course of a few weeks if there isn't anything like a support structure preventing it. While this is certainly convenient, you thought to yourself, I can do better. After all, many important resources can't even be found on planets, like mana gems or the insanely rare mineral osmium, which are only found on asteroids. But with the ability you created, this won't be a problem anymore, because you can just restore them anyway: simply by spending enough mana, it is possible for you to regenerate any natural resource or duplicate existing ones. You could pump mana into an asteroid to restore whatever it is that was mined there to get effectively infinite resources out of it, do the same to the extremely valuable gem lying in front of you to get multiple copies of it, or send out a massive wave of mana to cover a whole planet in a forest. The mana required scales linearly with the amount of the resource you want to work with, its complexity, and its power. So while you could easily get massive amounts of diamonds and wood even with a little mana, duplicating something like the Top 5 metals (see Notes) or similar materials would require truly insane amounts of mana."

Any animal exposed to the substance transforms into a mythical, humanoid creature similar to its origin; for instance, a fish may become a mermaid, or a bird may become a fairy, though not the normal kinds found in Neverland. Furthermore, humans exposed to it can fly and can gain artistic inspiration; however, overexposure can lead to greed and paranoia. Outside of this purchase, the substance is extremely difficult to find in the traditional Peter Pan, unless the setting was changed. Also, unlike its form in the story, the Starstuff cannot be used to destabilize the fabric of the universe."

A vast expanse of earth richly covered with grass, located in either an attachment to your warehouse, one of your other pocket dimensions or on a real world spot of your choice, this has exactly as much space as needed for its purposes. Which are twofold. Firstly, it has prime, finest-quality samples of every single herb, flower etc in existence. It doesn't matter how rare or valuable they are, you can find at least one of every one, and potentially many more. Plants breed and spread at rates proportional to their rarity and rates of breeding in the outside world. Something like the Emperor Awakening Heart Lotus, a plant normally found once in centuries or millennia, takes a full year to bloom, and others take proportionately lesser time. In future jumps the garden won't acquire any plants that are absolutely unique, like Yggdrasil in Norse Myth, but everything else is fair game, even divine or mythical plants of all types. And as for those plants, you need to find a seed and sow them here, at which point they become as any other plants. Additionally, this garden has the property of 'adapting' any plants seeded here to the local settings. That is, a fruit that provides ki or magical energy in its original world would provide Profound Energy in this one, and the equivalent in future settings. They retain the ability to provide any previous 'versions' at your will."

      "description": "Tenebrium Basics (200CP) Tenebrium is an odd mineral. It grows like a crystal, but can be melted and forged like iron. It is easily enchanted, but highly resistant to other kinds of magic. In addition, it is highly dangerous and inflicts a disease known simply as Rot upon all those who handle it in any form. Worst of all, Rot cannot be cured by simple magical spells, requiring rare and powerful artifacts to cleanse the infected. Most cannot afford such things and slowly wither over the months following handling a single chunk of crystal. But with this perk, you have come to understand how to safely handle Tenebrium without infecting yourself. Tenebrium Mine (600CP) Tenebrium is an utterly useful material, for all that it is also incredibly dangerous to handle. Still, considering all its uses, one can hardly be blamed for desiring to have a steady supply of the crystal on hand. The Tenebrium Mine attaches directly to your Cosmic Warehouse and takes the form of a traditional mining tunnel about a hundred feet deep. Inside one will find a few dozen crystals of Tenebrium growing, each large enough to produce a single ingot when smelted. Once harvested new crystals will slowly grow in their place over the course of a week. The mine is also capable of producing other metals, crystals, and even gemstones if given a sample of such material. These will form in veins along the walls of the tunnel, but grow much more slowly. Exotic metals will form at a rate of one ingot every two weeks and crystals will produce roughly the same amount. Gemstones seem to be easier and the mine will produce a collection of small stones that will fill a cupped hand in a week. Normal metals, like gold and silver, can also be produced at a rate of one ingot per week. An ingot here refers to enough material to forge a traditional longsword with."

Before you is a great golden portal in the air, within which these endless treasures constantly shift and swirl before you. It is like a Gate, one that leads to the source of so much wonder. All that you can see is now yours and it is even more valuable than you might think at first. The power you now possess is to be the Collector of all of Humanity's creations. Every invention, every making, every forging, every last creation that mankind has created, is creating or will create is found within this endless vault of space. However, this only applies to singular creations. Any mundane and magical weapon or vehicle or potion or book or armour or anything else in that vein can be found present in here. However, outright locations cannot be found. While one may find the individual buildings in a city or collective fortress, they would not find the city itself. Nor will the vault contain things that are merely slight alterations to non-human objects. A mountain that has a castle on it or a stone stuck to a stick. Mankind has created a great many things but for it to apply to our vault's contents, it must be wholly a creation of man. A metal blade might be made from natural materials but it has been shaped and altered thoroughly through human processes. A last note on the contents of the vault, is that anything retained within it will not be harmful, even if it normally should be, to the owner of the vault while within this space and that you are able to use anything within this space, regardless of the normal conditions some magical items may have for their users. You can summon the vault's portals with a few moments concentration or through the turning of one of several golden keys from within this vault that you can obtain. These portals can be made anywhere within your sight range, even should you not be looking where you form them at the moment, and are very quick to open. While you do not know the exact nature or presence of everything within the dimensional space, you can instantly call anything from the vault to your person as you wish and search within it for anything that fits any kind of specifications you have in mind. With just a thought, you can even organise the space and it's contents however you might choose. Setting it up as a great golden museum instead of the endless desert of treasure, for example. Once you have opened the portal to your vault once, you can freely continue to open them at an incredible pace within your range, even dozens at once or enormous portals through which an entire castle could pass. Through these portals, you can bring forth anything within your vault, no matter how large or how far in. You may also choose to fire out things from within the vault, with the maximum speed that you can do so rising with your magical power. Even at a base level however, you can fire the smaller objects within at the speed of sound. Anything that exits the vault can be instantly retrieved with just a thought, replacing it within the vault due to the effects of an artefact. Due to the same magical item within the vault, anything that is sourced from the vault originally will slowly repair or, if destroyed, reappear entirely within the vault over the course of a few days. Items made for single uses however will not repair or reappear. The final and perhaps most notable attribute of this quality of yours is that your vault has not ceased growing. While the space only draws from this current timeline and world, as you travel to new worlds or timelines, you will find that the space you have access to will fill itself with all the achievements of humanity from each new world and timeline at an instant."

If you're a Player it's minted with YGGDRASIL iconography and is probably what you had in your inventory when you arrived in the New World, they're sure to attract attention if you use them. If you're a local it's in local denominations, and god knows how you came across it. For 50 CP you have ten times as much gold, and you'll find that every month any gold you've spent or expended has been replaced within the pouch. The pouch itself can hold any number of gold coins, but only gold coins, inside of it. One notable fact regarding these coins, and indeed Yggdrasil Gold Coins in general, is that they can substitute for many types of incidental materials or reagents when it comes to creating magical items or artifacts. For example as long as you have a scroll to work with the gold could substitute for inks to allow you to make a magic scroll, or special oils or unguents in a bit of clockwork, and so on and so forth. Hell, you can even use the stuff to garnish food and drink at no risk to the consumer. Basically, so long as you've got the main pieces for making something you can substitute in some Yggdrasil Gold for any of the incidental bits required in the process."

      "description": "An essential tool for enchanters and mages, yet one that's only recently gained formal recognition. You have five Petty, four Common and Lesser, three Greater and Grand, and two Black soul gems all held in a tasteful keshweed fiber satchel. Each gem holds a soul of its corresponding size, color, and power. For example, a Petty gem would hold a rabbit or a small dog at most, while a Grand would hold a mammoth or a strong Daedra. These are both White souls and can be held in White gems. The rarer Black soul gems hold the souls of sapient creatures, like humans, beast folk, or elves. You can use them as arcane batteries, as focuses for spells, or just as general magic storage. You'll get a new set every month of whatever's been depleted. Remember to be careful handling the Black gems, as they can have unfortunate and potentially lethal side-effects if not contained properly."

Truly, it is the spiritual source of life in all the worlds, from which dreams, ideas, and words are granted life. Aside from granting stories and dreams to drinkers, the water has many magical uses, depending on how creatively you use the resource. This perk gives you in-depth knowledge on how to draw out and use story water from the plentiful Streams of Story. Furthermore, in later worlds you now have the ability to find and extract story water, which will always be somewhere one way or another (but without the perk, it will be impossible to find this metaphysical sea unless an equivalent already canonically exists). There are countless uses for the liquid, so feel free to experiment as you please. Just keep in mind that the state and availability of story water, just like the treatment of stories themselves, varies between worlds; be careful that you don't drink polluted water, or your dreams might take a turn for the worse. On the other hand, story water from certain magical worlds, particularly those built on stories, may be exceptionally potent."

But due to their nature, they cannot be artificially created, only forming after several years of mana condensing and purifying in a single location. This commonly happens only on asteroids, where they can be left undisturbed for long periods of time, and truly vast mana veins can form. But even as mining them can be a hassle, their value makes it worth anyone's while, as they are capable of holding and regenerating massive amounts of mana, with the exact volumes depending on the gem's size and quality. And it seems like you've hit the jackpot, as with this you'll be able to gain a steady supply of mana gems each week. You may decide on a case by case basis whether you want several dozen small and low-quality mana gems, or two to three big and high-quality ones."

Even a little bit of water in here somehow multiplies into a vast quantity of sake, though it never produces more than the gourd can hold at a time. With this treasure, you could easily ensure you never spend another moment of your life sober. The second is Douju’s Jar, a large waist-high pot full of an endless amount of edible oil with no unusual properties beyond tasting smooth and nice. Perhaps you might want to establish a deep-frying business? The third is the Hoshiguma Dish, a simple red sake dish that has the miraculous ability to raise the quality of any sake poured into it, making it taste much better and be far easier to drink. Note that the sake does not need to remain in the dish to benefit from the increased quality; pouring it into the dish and then pouring it out into another container is a perfectly valid way to amass a lot of high-quality sake. However, sake can only benefit from its blessing once. The fourth, and most potent, is the Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines, a decorated sake box that can hold two liters of liquid at a time. Should a healthy person drink alcohol from the sake box, it temporarily grants them the strength of an Oni for a day at the price of shifting their personality to be like an Oni’s (read: crude, brash, coarse, loud and belligerent) until it wears off. If a sick, injured or otherwise unhealthy person drinks from it, however, it cures all of their ailments barring incurable mutilation from powerful magical relics at the small cost of permanently transforming their body into that of an Oni – though some might say this is simply another bonus. If a lot of people were to drink from this box, you can be assured it would cause incredible amounts of chaos."

You could paint a painting of an empty room and add in a pile of silver to the painting, to sympathetically conjure a pile of silver into the real room, or you could paint a picture of the room without its door, which will magically remove the door from the wall of the real room, preventing all access.

You could also use these paints to move something out of reality and into the painting, such as valuables or a prisoner, concealing or trapping them inside it.

These plants tend to be made of metals such as tin or brass, though the will of a powerful demon can result in other substances. As the woods of Creation, these metal-woods can be set aflame, albeit only through a specific method employing a firedrill, logs from Vitalius or Hrotsvitha, and demon ichor. Other sorts of fire will not ignite metallic Malfean vegetation, and their metallic flames might melt other sorts of fuel but will not set them afire. Paper will not burn on a fire of metallic logs, and would only be heated. If smelted and cast into new form, the metals of Malfeas lose this property. Their means of cultivation also diverge greatly from those found in Creation. Malfean crops rarely require anything so simple as plowing, sowing and reaping. Instead, they might require to be grown from human finger bones planted in the ground, bear fruit only to the beating of drums, or release their harvest only at the sacrifice of a living demon. Now I will offer to you a collection of five kinds of seeds. One kind of the ivy of gray lead, one of the bloodmelon vines, one of the malice-nut tree, one of the squash vines of black porcelain, and one of the brass-stemmed roses with petals of green-black glass that grow only in rare parts of hell. All of these will grow where you will, as long as they are properly cared for, and the collection will replenish in number in case you wish to start additional gardens. And lastly, I shall offer you these three seeds of potential, harvested from Oramus' slumbering templebody. While they come in lesser number, and will not be replaced as the collection of lesser seeds will be, they are far more remarkable. For if they are pierced by a spike of metal or any other material and planted in the ground, and then regularly fed with a prayer for its growth, these will grow into the seedlings of new trees or plants incorporating the spike's materials. Of course, as a new species you'll have to discover the ways to cultivate them further yourself, and the rarer materials may give you more difficulty... but with a wise selection of ores and minerals, it may be well worth it."

Materials for low-end magical items (ie: Greater tier or below, as explained at the beginning of the item section) regularly resupply such that you could probably churn out hundreds of such items a day. Legacy tier materials would allow you to craft a few things a day. Materials for equipment at the Relic tier resupply often enough you could probably make a single relic tier item a day. This is the limit for the 300 CP option. For 600 CP however your materials now include enough for a single Legendary tier piece of equipment every two weeks or so, and the materials for a single piece of Divine Tier equipment would likely take at least two months. However, there is nothing preventing you from stockpiling the materials, as they'll keep resupplying themselves even if not used up. This may either be a warehouse attachment or attached to another property at your desire, either way it will always have enough space inside to store materials for crafting things, will always be neatly arranged, organized, and labeled, and will be perfectly capable of storing or maintaining even the most volatile or fragile of substances. Both levels of this option are discounted to those that have purchased the Crafting Class perk. Legendary Treasury (Overlord (The Series) Guild Base Supplement) (150CP) Your guild base is famous, or perhaps infamous, for the mind boggling amount of treasure it contains within. Or it would be assuming anyone knew about it. You have enough Yggdrasil gold coins within to keep your guild base going for hundreds of years, and it is littered with powerful high tier magic items of all shapes and sizes, and an even more excessive number of low and mid tier magical items. Barring truly foolish spending habits or ruinous expenses you should likely never need to worry about your treasury running out of gold to support the guild base. In future worlds it will refill with equivalent amounts of gold, and new magic items suitable for the world it finds itself in. Additionally, and finally, it is now of arbitrary internal size. There will always be more room and more space to add in any treasures or items you come across, as the treasury will expand to fit them as you add them inside. If you or a Companion also purchased the Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools item from the regular Overlord (the series) jump document then this Legendary Treasury will also be filled with copious amounts of reagents and crafting materials, of appropriate qualities and levels for whatever version of the Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools option you purchased. In future worlds it will fill up with more as appropriate to the world(s) you've been to."

      "description": "The actual origin or source of the Caloric Stone is a near total mystery. It forms only from large concentrations of the Seven Prismatic Ores, legendary divine materials that possess qualities far and away above anything else. Why this occurs, or even who first discovered the Caloric Stone, is unknown. While held the Caloric Stone grants the usual benefits of a World Item upon its bearer, providing protections against negative status, instant death, being trapped or held, scryed upon, and so forth, trumping even the effects of other World Items. However, while useful, those are far and away the least impressive aspects of the stone. The truth of the matter is quite simple; the Caloric Stone is the ultimate crafting material. No matter what you are making, no matter how mighty, no matter what other materials are included, adding the Caloric Stone will make that item or bit of craftsmanship better. Food, drink, weapons, armor, buildings, vehicles, golems, indeed anything that can be crafted can be quantifiably made superior (by an astounding degree) by the inclusion of the Caloric Stone in its creation process, as the stone expands the possibilities and power of what can be done with crafting. If you were to use particularly mighty materials in the creation of something, say ingredients on par with those usually used in the making of a Divine Tier item, the resulting piece of equipment would be truly legendary, halfway between the status of a Divine tier item and a World Item. Obviously, and unfortunately, the stone is expended when used. However, since you're paying at a premium, you are guaranteed to receive a new Caloric Stone exactly one month after using it, appearing in whatever location is most convenient for you. You may explicitly hand this to other people but you need not fear losing it. If separated from your person in a fashion you didn't intend it will appear in the closest convenient location for you a day later. However if it was used in this time frame to make something then you must still wait a month for it to respawn. The Caloric Stone is discounted for those that purchased the 600 CP option for Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools. The Caloric Stone is utterly unique, and cannot be duplicated or copied via any method whatsoever using in-jump methods."

The third and final option nets you the same as the second option, but without the side effects, this nets you a shipping container full of side effect less Chronos and the recipe to make more. Taking this improved version of Chronos will purge a person of their addiction, and can reverse some symptoms of withdrawal."

After all, how are you going to store antimatter if you have only steel at hand? Luckily, you won't ever have problems finding the materials you need. Whether you'll stumble upon them while searching through a scrapyard, or find just the right people who can get you that obscure alloy you need, nothing will stop you from building whatever you want besides your own skill. Well, if you're keeping it reasonable, at least. The chance of you finding what you're searching for decreases exponentially with the material's strength and rarity, and increases by how much you know about said material, scientifically, and how good your technology skills are. So while a regular schmuck would probably never find Adamantium, someone who could reproduce it themselves in only a few years would have much, much better chances. So if you're in a situation where it is impossible to get what you want with what you know and where you are right now? Then you'll have to get to work yourself. Good riddance then that you can eventually reproduce any material or alloy that you have seen, though for extremely advanced ones it might take an unreasonable amount of time and skill."

You could spray a Light Machine Gun, and the barrel and firing chamber would never warp or distort from overheating, for example, nor would the paint job flake off or burn up despite the fact the barrel glows red-hot from continued use. Whatever it's used on simply will not degrade or wear out so long as the spray remains in place. Its flexibility means it doesn't actually provide any increase in protection (you'll still suffer internal trauma even if your armor bounces back right after, for example), but you'll never have to worry about your equipment no longer looking the way it should - or working at less than its original effectiveness, for that matter. Should you want to make some modifications (like changing the paint job to something different), you'll also receive a spray can with the releasing agent, which will cause the Saturn Spray to harmlessly peel off and degrade into everyday chemical waste. Both cans are effectively 'bottomless' and will never run out."

Unfortunately, the things you learn while using NZT are typically not fully available to you once it wears off. For free, you receive a replenishing supply, and the formula for, a version that has a few minor, minor side effects during withdrawal or even with continued usage: memory loss, extreme paranoia, blurred vision, hearing difficulties, psychosis, missing time, skin lesions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Limp Dick Syndrome. So yeah, there is a trade-off for genius in a pill. For 200 CP (included in above cost), you can get a replenishing supply of, and the formula for, an injectable substance based on a cyclical enzyme system, partially developed by Piper Baird, that temporarily makes one immune to the side effects in case you want to control the distribution of NZT. You also have access to a version that grants permanent immunity. If you do not purchase this option, the in-jump version of this cyclical enzyme system will not work in future jumps. The enzymes are free if you have the capstone booster and Master Chemist. For 300 CP (included in above cost), you have a replenishing supply of, and the formula for, a version of NZT-48 that has no side effects. If you do not purchase this option, you will be unable to upgrade the base version to remove the side effects. This version is free for those who purchase the capstone booster. For each of these formulas, you may choose to have them work for others or not in future worlds, enabling mass production. However, if they work, others will be able to reverse engineer them so pick your poison. If you choose for them not to work for others, you'll have to oversee the production personally, but the compounds will be immune to analysis."

      "description": "-Crystals (800CP) Well these little buggers are the cause of a lot of the trouble going down on Earth, but their ability to effect evolution is definitely beyond debate. There are several different types of Crystal, and each purchase of this let's you choose one type. You'll start this Jump with your purchased crystals floating a bit right next to you, and you'll get another once a year. In Jump this will mean finding them, while afterwards they'll be added to your warehouse. Note that you can still find these in jump normally, but this will ensure a regular supply. Blue Crystal: About as simple as it gets, this little bugger acts as a gatherer and battery for evolutionary potential. Eating it will result in gaining a very large chunk of EVO, enough to fuel a series of large changes for you. Green Crystal: This crystal analyzes the path evolution has taken, and when ingested will allow you at a time of your choosing to change back to a form in your Record of Evolution, a transformation which may last for up to a month. This doesn't have to be used right away, you can eat it and bank the use until a time of your choosing, and at any one time you can store roughly three such uses. Red Crystal: Probably best described as evolutionary steroids, and the most blatant of the crystals, this one takes in evolutionary data and uses it to create a new and extremely potent evolutionary form. When ingested you can change into this form, a transformation that can last up to one month. While temporary, and despite having no control over what said form will be, this does mean that said form will be added to your Record of Evolution, which can prove very useful in conjunction with the Green Crystals or the Review of Evolution perk. Yellow Crystal: This crystals gathers and analyzes evolutionary data. Eating it results in a sudden flood of information into your mind that will inform you of all the various useful evolutionary paths you could take, giving an awareness of options you otherwise would have been completely blind to. Alternatively you can let it rest in an environment for a few days and then devour it to gain a sudden influx of data on the local biosphere and living beings. -Evolutionary Potential (0CP) You now have the ability to gather and store an energy that can only be properly described as evolutionary potential or EVO for short. This will slowly accumulate as you go about the natural process of survival. Impressive acts such as surviving a natural disaster or mortal combat will grant you larger amounts, and eating food will give you some based on the relative value of it. Namely, the higher up on the food chain (meaning it processes larger amounts of biological energy) it is, the more you'll gain per pound. You do technically have a cap on how much you can store relative to your form, but it's large enough that at full capacity you could go through a large number of relatively extreme changes before bottoming out. Actually reaching that maximum is another story. -Mysterious Time Stream Evolves You (0CP) I shouldn't have to explain why the natural process of evolution isn't really going to work for you. Thankfully you get to cheat. By expending EVO you can evolve yourself, with the cost depending on the scale and complexity of the change, along with how much is diverges from the current state of yourself and nature, as adaptation is specifically influenced by its environment. It's easier to become a large reptilian beast when the dinosaurs roam the earth for example. This only requires intent on your part, with nature handling the rest. Note that evolving leaves you with a new body in it's prime, meaning you should haven't to worry about old age. Evolving only requires several minutes to let the changes take place. Never more then five, and should you really push yourself you might be able to manage it in two, although it's advisable to take your time with the process as the end results will be much better if done with patience. -Record of Evolution (0CP) You can effectively review your evolutionary time line, including all forms you've previously had, in a sort of mental catalog. It possesses all the information you have about the form, and you can sort through it effortlessly to find what you want. While it doesn't really have any use beyond this on it's own, further perks might just let you use these stored designs in interesting way. -Instinct (0CP) For the duration of this jump odds are you're going to be changing forms on a regular basis, and you probably aren't to be exactly familiar with them. From now on regardless of the form you take you have a full and complete set of instincts that let you control and use your form with competency. This ranges all the way from basic body control to knowing that the thing you see right there is something your body would love to eat. At all times you have a complete awareness of your instincts, as clear as a voice in your head would be, instead of them just being subconscious impulses. You're also aware of why they are telling you what they do. * This seems to need the free evo perks to work, maybe we should add and merge them with this item"

With the proper handling a well versed team of scientists can do far more than a horde of idiots any day, unfortunately you may not have access to well-trained help. Taking this allows you to get around that little problem, by throwing more people at a project you can actually increase the rate at which you learn and understand things making it much easier for your research to pay off. This quickly hits a limit though and more than 200 people working on a project will probably not net you much more of an increase than 100 (which will already increase your researching skills by a large amount) Obviously quality is better than quantity but sometimes quantity has a quality all of its own."

Moreover, their use will never cause infection or injury, and the surface of the tattoo will seal over nearly instantly after it is applied. Along with the needles themselves, you will also receive a supply of many different mundane inks of exceptional quality. Though of course the needles can also be used with various other inks you might be able to acquire. They can handle anything, from the mundane ones to sorcerous inks to tattoo occult sigils, to chalcanth used to create living demon-ink tattoos, to stranger substances still, and even the moonsilver ink used to create the Moonsilver Tattoos and various tattoo artifacts. That last one in particular resonates with the Silver Needles, for when they are used with moonsilver ink, they may cause the Moonsilver Tattoos to become temporarily fluid and accept new tattoo artifacts to be inscribed upon the skin of their wearer. * For mundane and magic tattoo crafting at any level"

The cube can repair broken magical items to full functionality, though you may need to add in reagents to make up for lost mass and energy. Multiple items of the same type placed inside will be consumed to create a single slightly more potent version. Items can be transmuted into other items of a different shape yet similar nature, such as arrows into bolts. Finally, magical items can be fragmented, enchantments and power cleanly divided between each piece, a function commonly used to store dangerous items in a more manageable form. -Horadric Malus (200CP) An ancient and heavily-enchanted hammer, this tool was built to aid in forging magical items. In layman's terms it regulates and stabilizes magical energies, preventing small mishaps, foreign mana flows, short pauses in the enchanting process and other such problems from ruining an enchanter's work. While items produced with the aid of the Malus are only slightly more powerful, they are much more resistant to mystical tampering and corruption."

      "description": "-The Mixing Cauldron (100CP) Every Alchemists' trusty tool, the mixing cauldron, is basically the alchemist's work desk and research station combined into one. With this, no potion is out of reach though it isn't uncommon to find that some alchemists' will create...other things from their cauldrons, and one would be foolish to presume that a cauldron can't be improved... -Melting pot (100CP) It's not uncommon to find that certain ingredients will not mix well just as attempting to stack too many enchantments into a potion can prove disastrous. In an attempt to mitigate this, the melting pot was constructed with a higher rate of mixing. This directly translates to a higher degree of homogenization, but you'll have to understand that to maintain this level of mixing you need to have a higher energy source than just a fire under the cauldron. It does allow you to blend some ingredients that normally would not mix however, though the results may still not be as optimal as you would hope. -Spirit Pyroxene (100CP) No one quite knows where this pyroxene came from, but it has a very definitive effect on the items that it forms a component of. The mystical power inside the pyroxene seems to carry over into the items that it forms at least a portion of the power does, and the crafted items became more conductive towards spiritual magic of a large variety. -Goldberg Formula (100CP) There are times when making things overly complex can be problematic. Then there are times when making things overly complex can be outright awesome. Your cauldron really shouldn't be called a cauldron anymore. Synthesis isn't a matter of tossing in ingredients and brewing. Your cauldron is a part of a system, a large chain of components and contraptions which ultimately will create a potion likely of higher quality. But you'll likely have no clue how it works. Due to the nature of this set up, you'll find that the cauldron will follow along with you in a containment chamber of its own and though it initially resembles a cottage...should the contraption chain grow bigger (and it will!) the cottage will also increase in size. -Daisy Chain (100CP) Interested in large scale alchemy? Well, between this and a core reactor, you'll have yourself a veritable alchemy workshop. Granted, in reality this just sets up a series of mini cauldrons which will automatically adopt specific arrangements to facilitate more complex, multi-tiered synthesis reactions but it'll boost your synthesis rates immensely, and ensure that easier recipes won't fail! Of course...you could have each cauldron act autonomously but really they work best in unison with every other unit. Due to the number of cauldrons created, a large part of the containment chamber is occupied by cauldrons as they move about and get down to business. Thankfully, you can still move about and organize the cauldrons though they're a fair bit more autonomous than before. Each cauldron seems to exhibit the same effects as your original cauldron, and it isn't out of the realm of possibility to add more cauldrons though it'll be a time consuming process. -The Vortex (100CP) The amount of energy required to keep this going will be tremendous, but if you toss anything into there it will blend. Instead of functioning like a batch system, the Cauldron operates continually, and will actively remember the last effect from the last ingredient which was put in. It's also possible for it to store an effect, but this requires you to have a constant supply of the reagent necessary to provide that effect. A cauldron useful for expert alchemists, one should take care if this is combined with any other extensive modifications."

Unfortunately, The Eye is only good for things that Firewall knows about - new threats won't raise flags or have any data. In future worlds, The Eye AR windows tend to flag things in the databases or general awareness of groups with similar objectives to Firewall, but are fairly light on hard data - mostly something like \"This individual is wanted for questioning by SHIELD and is considered armed and dangerous\" or \"This carving is a sign used by Thayan spies to mark meeting spots\".

For most purposes it uses a transmitted accelerator mass spectrometer to create a snapshot of an objects components, atomic weight, and radioactivity, allowing for in-depth analysis. For biological materials, the system switches to an electrospray ionization system, so that plants or animals can be scanned without causing radiation damage. For a Jumper, you no longer need to have an AI linked to the system for it to work, though that would help. You can also take DNA scans of organisms for further study, and scan devices to help you figure out what they do, and maybe later reproduce them. Lastly, if you have a longer ranged sensor system, you could link the Scanner to that to scan further away, even if being in the Scanner's original range would get you clearer results."

Why, it can even provide mental care through the Mental Health Counseling Programs it has as part of its sub-system, helping to ensure players are happy and mentally healthy as they play through the game. Cardinal was also famed for creating content whole-cloth without any human input, scouring the internet to craft quests or enemies based off mythology; if you wanted to you could be a one-man game developer for something rivaling a AAA title in content and quality.

      "description": "Hangar (100CP) Planes are fine when they're going through the air and dealing with enemies. But leaving them to the elements and the outdoors when they're not in use? Well that just seems really crass. You need somewhere to store your vehicles and planes when you're not busy destroying anything that's not on your side, and that's what these establishments are for. It's not the most fancy thing in the world, but it'll serve its purpose and make sure your means for vehicular slaughter are in prime condition for their tasks. For an additional +50CP (Included in above cost), these hangar bays also come equipped with special clamps and harnesses to make refitting and refueling any planes, go much more quickly than they would if you were using them by hand. For sea-based bases, this also means you have docks for boats and submarines. Flight Suit (0CP) When taking off, an important requirement of being in a plane is a flight suit so that the G-forces don’t make your organs explode. It sounds silly, but you’ll be lucky you had it. So, have a nifty flight suit to help keep any pressure issues down while you're in the sky, on the house. It can come in any color you wish with a snazzy helmet to boot, ensuring that you’re the most glamorous pilot in the sky. Soundtrack (0CP) When you take to the skies, it does not always have to be on a somber note. As you fly to your mission, dogfight, or assault an enemy position you'll have the soundtrack of your choice playing in the background. Others can hear this if you wish, and you can turn this off at any time. Perfect for when you want to hype yourself up for a situation. Basic Flight Training (0CP) If you couldn't fly before, you have a basic idea of how to fly a plane now. You know how to maneuver the joystick properly, which button fires the missiles, and how to properly land a plane without creating a multi-million dollar pile of scrap. It won’t save you if you dive into a massive swarm of planes all by yourself, but you can learn. Missile Surplus (0CP) Well this is odd. Any plane you pilot seems to hold an unnatural number of missiles for its type, far more than it should. You're not sure where it's getting this many missiles, but you'll have to restock them if you run out. The same thing happens with special weapons, though you have to have a working model to attach if you want to swap it out. Comm Chatter (0CP) While an important part of war is knowing what your opponent is up to, sometimes it’s good for puffing your ego up too. For whatever reason, your radio will occasionally catch communications being broadcast from the enemy. This can range from important information to wild surprise at your antics. Not too useful, but good for knowing how you're doing."

It has no ability to fight on its own, but is capable of filtering nanomaterials from sea water (on an industrial scale) and mining heavier elements from the sea floor or beaches. Using these materials, it can manufacture missiles, gun rounds, and other expendable weaponry, as well as provide some ability to refit Fog ships (so long as the repairs don't require a dry dock). It has a non-sentient Union Core. With some modification, it could resupply and repair other types of ships besides Fog Vessels. Fog warships are advanced, more like starships than seafaring vessels. Built of nanomaterials, they can change their shape and structure when needed, though they seem to prefer the shapes of WWII-era ships. For example, their turrets instead of holding normal cannons instead house photon cannons, or their hulls open to fire their super graviton cannons. Ships comprised of nanomaterials must be controlled by a Union Core, or similarly advanced computer system. If purchased by a human, or as a second ship by Mental Models, these vessels are run by a Union Core (free) which does not currently have a Mental Model. This one seems different from the other kinds of Fog ships, focused more on supply, repair, ability to modify ships and manufacturing of ammo and nanomaterials for use. I suggest this and the Unusual Class to be left behind"

Furthermore, you can enhance the capabilities of your vehicle in several ways. First, you can get it to start moving just by hopping into it, and once you get it into motion you can ensure that it stays in motion for as long as possible instead of slowing down and stopping when it normally would. Second, you can get it to continue to move as if on a stable track even when you are not on one at all. For instance, you could have a mine cart or roller coaster car continue to move forward smoothly off its actual track. Third, you can make the vehicle move in ways that would normally be impossible for it, such as making a mine cart literally jump into the air. Fourth, the vehicle you are riding gains an enhanced degree of protection such that even an incredible volatile rocket barrel could survive at least a few separate headlong crashes into walls and other things before blowing up."

It's the most advanced piece of Space/Time technology ever created, and it... maybe he/her, who knows, is all yours! This is a completely sapient, fifteen-dimensional ship that can range anywhere from the size of a small briefcase to Jupiter on the outside, while remaining a constant size on the inside. And that constant size is 'infinite'. Yup. There is no limit to how large it can get on the inside, how many rooms, corridors, libraries or pools it can have. It's capable of massive, ridiculous manipulations of time and space, the simplest, of course, being moving through it willy-nilly. Seriously, sky's the limit here. You can go anywhen between the Big Bang and the heat death of the universe, and anywhere in or outside the universe you have coordinates for. That's mostly what it does on the outside. On the inside it can do anything and everything you can imagine regarding Time and Space. It also has fabricators capable of producing virtually anything, an instance of the Eye of Harmony powering it, massive libraries, fully functional Chameleon and Translation circuits, a state of temporal grace that prohibits weapons from being fired inside without your permission, and all the other bells and whistles you've ever seen in the other Type 40 you know about. And unlike that one, this one is in perfect working order. Honestly, who steals their new ride from a repair shop? Just about everything about this ship can change for the sake of utility and to be pleasing to you... and itself, of course. It retains all improvements, recovers flawlessly from any damage done to it in less than a second, and won't blow up the universe if the impossible happens and it gets destroyed. Also, no matter how often or with what you try and look into the Time Vortex it's simply not going to work until after you've gotten your Spark. Before then you're not getting any naughty lupines, period."

The AGE System is a data collection program that can be installed onto a Mobile Suit and acts as a unique OS. It will collect data and evolve along with its pilot, researching 'solutions' to problems, coming in the form of the Wear Parts, arm and legs designed to improve and counter situations. The Wear Parts are flown to the AGE Gundams in battle using the AMEMBO (one of which is included with this purchase) and swapped mid-battle, though with a different design you could remove the AMEMBO from the equation entirely. This is a highly advanced system, one that can collect, analyze, improve, build and conquer many situations.

For one thing, they have a very tight grip on machina technology, and it’s not something they care to relinquish to anyone, even if you happen to be within the clergy itself. Machina use needs to be strictly controlled after all. A tank like machina capable of sending out small flying units to act as reconnaissance drones – these drones serve two purposes, the collection of combat data as well as acting as the machina’s primary form of long ranged detection and observation. Initially, it comes with nine drones, definitely enough to be sent in all of the cardinal directions even while leaving one around for close range surveillance. Its primary armament is a giant magic cannon, the properties of which can change, depending on the data received from the drones. Observing enough fire elemental attacks will cause the cannon to adopt fire properties, and so forth. Unfortunately, machina is still machina at the end of the day, so its replicated capabilities aren’t as amazing as you would probably hope – essentially lesser replicas of whatever it sees. That being said, its flexibility doesn’t lie with the surveillance drones...but with the modifications available. You can add in any or all of the upgrades below:. Drone Factory – Attacker Models- The Jagd Panzer can create its surveillance “Watcher” drones by itself without any external modification on your part, but these Watcher drones do exactly what their name suggests and nothing else. However, you can configure the Jagd Panzer to create offensive drones instead – arming them with small magic cannons of their own that possess similar, but weaker capabilities to the main cannon of the Jagd Panzer. Drone Factory – Platoon Strength- If you’re going to be taking this you might as well be declaring war on the Yevon clergy folks – since that’s essentially what this modification is best for. Allowing the Panzer unit to create small machina droids that can serve different roles (long ranged attacker, short ranged harassers, patrol units and such), the only issue happens to be that the Panzer is completely immobile while churning out these units – and the speed of production isn’t the best. Still, working in coordination with the Drones, you can field an army rather effectively. The Al Bhed will be really interested in you now... Assembly Protocol S/A/Z- The Jagd Panzer’s upgrade capabilities are largely dependent on your mechanical proficiency, but that doesn’t mean you can’t fiddle around with some Al Bhed help – well, my help really but who’s keeping track? These Assembly Protocols will amplify the Jagd Panzer in one field, respectively its special attack properties (related to magic), its general attack properties (related to its standard ordinance), and defensive properties (both physical and magical). Each one of these protocols adds a substantial boost to the Panzer – a good kick to its performance levels that is also applied to any drones present. Spherimorph Capability- Never settle for barrier drones when there’s something more effective available. The Al Bhed are masters of observing and replicating natural phenomena – and the Spherimorph’s advanced elemental properties are an excellent example of how nature defends itself. Allowing the Jagd Panzer to switch between elemental properties, this significantly improves its magically oriented defences. This affects any drones that are active as well. Parallel Processing- Have other Machina about? As long as the machina’s size is not larger than the Jagd Panzer – you can rig it up with this so that the Jagd Panzer can remote control it. This goes for the other two prototypes as well...though you’ll find something a bit weird with the Machina Maw – it’s sufficiently small enough that if you already possess the options of construction on board the Panzer...it can recreate the Machina Maw much like how it creates drones. It’ll take longer of course, but the result will operate autonomously."

With box-tech you can also invent things like man-portable railgun and stealth camo."

      "source": "The Culture Minds",
      "chapter": "Domain: Vehicles",
      "description": "-Dual E-Grid Tap (0CP) Your body, if you purchased one, can tap into the Energy Grids in both ulterior and inferior hyperspace, the two boundaries above and below the skein of reality which seperate your universe from the ones above and below it. A Dual E-Grid Tap provides staggeringly vast amounts of power even by the standards of the Optmae, allowing you to hammer the normal universe with gridfire from both above and below it, as well as potentially harness this power in order to breach the energy grid itself, and transit from your universe to the one above or below it, in theory allowing true immortality by moving to younger universe before your current one suffers heat death or the Big Crunch or whatever end it would normally meet. In future jumps you may use this ability to travel between different parts of the local multiverse, though it cannot be used to move from one multiverse to the next. -CORE (0CP) Pretty much just your Mind and that's it. Also known as an AI Core, though the phrase is outdated. Regardless of your Origin, your core is an ovoid shape between 10m and 20m in length and around 2-2.5m in width. A naked mind such as this weighs around fifteen thousand tons, but only the outer envelope of your Core is truly in real space. Your mind utilizes hyperspace to perform truly astronomical calculations you could say that your core is a lot bigger than its physical dimensions indicate. It contains several field generators, backup power sources and communication systems. Should the worst come to worst, you can self-destruct either with minimum force (with a blast around one kiloton) or maximum force, with the power to crack a planet in half and toast hostile ships nearby. Your core has an internal Warp unit, which instead of being used for FTL travel generates the effects which let you use higher dimensions for processing. It can be used for FTL travel in an emergency but is short ranged and hopelessly outclassed by anything with a proper Field-Traction Engine. In a dire emergency, your core can be physically jettisoned from your Chassis, Ship, Station, or other incarnation, to flee, be rescued and hopefully later restored. -ENERGY FORM (300CP) Your body is a pattern of energy in the energy grid, providing you with vast amounts of power and the closest thing to immortality without becoming fully Sublimed. This asset allows you to use incredible control of electromagnetic fields to interact with and project an image into the physical world, though you do not actually exist within it. Extruding a part of yourself up (or down) into the material universe is an effect very similar to gridfire, a raw manifestation of incredible energy. Despite your mastery of energy, this hypergrid intrusion cannot be sustained for long. As a product of electromagnetic forces, any of your projections or manipulations of the physical world are (potentially) disruptable by forces that control or disrupt energy, while the underlying pattern in the Energy Grid (your true body) may be able to be harmed by forces which themselves can affect or manipulate this hyperspatial aspect of the universe. Requires CL 9 Perk -CL 9 (600CP) Yet the Optimae are not truly representative of the peak of civilizations. Such lofty civs do not often meddle in the affairs of the galaxy, for they would have learned long ago the secret of Sublimation, or being so long- lived tend to pass their affairs in solitude. While the Optimae may deploy gridfire, your civilization has the means to call up vast, boiling wavefronts of the energy grid that would annihilate entire fleets, erect Quiet Barriers to block hyperspatial travel around stars for light-years, and with the right technology travel between universes in the nested, expanding concentric-hypersphere of universes may become possible. The Dra'Azon and the Excession known as I are examples of civs or beings estimated to be at CL 9. Seems to need a culture ship body to work, should we merge the best ship body option into this? Gives you an alt form of a super op spaceship."

      "description": "-Fine Tuning (100CP) A good mechanic can tune AC parts for better performance in specific areas. You're skilled at customizing them even further, at the cost of worsening some other characteristic; you can do things like modify boosters to use extra power for extra speed, or reinforce armor at the expense of added weight -MT Engineering (400CP) Theoretical and practical knowledge of MT design, construction and programming. Simpler machines than ACs and much more suitable for mass production, they're the workhorse of megascale construction and the backbone of security and military forces. Your skills could earn a pretty cushy job at any of the megas. Being giant robots, these need literal tons of material and lots of labor to make. You could contract out for construction, but the simplest use for this is to design MTs for some corp instead. Also, this perk alone doesn't make you good enough to design or build really top-of-the-line MTs, the kind that might rival ACs. -AC Engineering (400CP) Like MT Engineering, but for ACs and any associated equipment, from weapons to radar systems. ACs are all built for combat. They're modular in design and thus very versatile, and their specs let an AC match a small army of average MTs in the hands of the right pilot -Core Competence (900CP) You are one of the world's best mech engineers; the corporations would literally kill to have you on payroll. High-performance MTs that compete evenly with ACs are now feasible- these are a bit cheaper and simpler to build than ACs, at the cost of far less customizability. Or, with even more work- probably most of your time in this jump- you might even come up with some sort of next-gen AC that chumps fellow ACs the way ACs chump their MT predecessors. Just don't expect to walk away from the job easily... that non-compete clause is murder. (Core Competence requires the other three perks, and is 900 CP on its own.)"
