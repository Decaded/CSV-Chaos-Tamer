      "description": "While it's rude to ask a lady's age, she has been around for a while. In fact she has personally tutored generations of pharaohs in rulership and priests or priestess in the rituals and ceremonies needed to perform magicks. Hidden within her heart she has a devious and submissive nature, despite this she still loves, cares and possesses a duty towards the people that rely on her guidance, enough that she suppresses her nature. If you asked her to join you on your jumpchain adventures she would decline. To take her as a companion you must either purchase the ‘Ancient Egypt Empire’ item, that way she can continue providing guidance and give them the added protection of the fiat backing or you can completely and utterly sexually dominate her and release her suppressed inner nature to the world to see and descend into degeneracy (or do both if you feel like it). She possesses all of the freebies and the perks ‘Beast-Kin Form (Jackal)’, ‘Still a goddess’, ‘Precious Skin and Bone’, 'Priestly Rituals’ and ‘Minor Godhood’, although her ‘Clothes’ item will include her Iconic jewellery and one of her outfits will be quite scandalous."

      "description": "Lucy is a beautiful girl of Japanese and Polish descent. When she was of a young age, she alongside a handful of others, were selected to receive training at an undisclosed Arasaka facility and become a netrunner, where she received harsh training. When their training concluded, they were sent in deep dives into the old cybernet looking for knowledge that was lost. The children were killed, one by one, by old world daemons and rogue AIs, and it didn't take long until only a few of them were left. The remaining children, including Lucy, used their netrunning skills to overwhelm the Arasaka staff and escape. While making their escape, most of the children were shot down and only Lucy managed to survive. After escaping, Lucy woke up in a junkyard, and began roaming from place to place until she ended up in Night City. That’s where she met you. You caught her trying to steal a datashard from you, and instead of getting her arrested, you instead asked her out to eat in a moment of shock, mesmerized by her beauty. You helped her settle in the city and allowed her to stop feeling like she was being chased by the megacorp. You two got to know each other better as even though she is quite an introvert, who doesn't like to talk much about her past, she felt like she could open up to you. She even told you about her dream of going to the Moon one day, a dream she kept as a closely guarded secret. While Braindancing a trip to the moon, she caught herself smiling while looking at you jumping around, and she felt... happy. This lead to an introspection where she found out she truly loves you. And now she is afraid of losing you. Even with all her confidence, she is completely inexperienced when it comes to romance and what comes with. She will take the first step the next time you two meet, and all you need to do is accept her, and she won’t let you go. And although she might look innocent, she won't hesitate to kill a person in a heartbeat if they tick her off or are threatening something dear to her. So good luck to whoever dares to threaten you, as you are what she treasures most in the world. • She comes with the Netrunner perk and the For My Dream perk."

Olga is the original Director of Chaldea, born to a father who couldn’t care less for her and betrayed by the one person she thought she could trust, thrown by Lev into CHALDEAS to suffer an infinite death (perhaps infinite violation depending on the Tone of this setting), begging to be saved while tearfully remarking that no one ever cared for her. Olga has been screwed over by just about any person in her life. Everything that happened only worsened her issues and insecurities and having to lead Chaldea through the Grand Order even as most of the staff undoubtedly hates her? It is a lot for her to bear and she can use all the help (both in staying safe and leading Chaldea) that she can get. Being rescued by you made her think she can trust you, in particular with the fact that she herself is really in need of screwing after all the stress and just wanting to feel good for once. And hey your attractive in her eyes so why not blow off steam together? Actually doing the deed would reveal her to be quite the pent up and kinky woman, who just happens to also fit your tastes. That being said she cares a lot more about you than she lets on and not just because of gratitude. If you are a Servant you can choose for Olga to be your Master. Despite her somewhat lacking affinity for it and what she may say at times she genuinely wants to be a good Master to you. She is also not a bad Magus, with high quality Magic Circuits and is skilled in the Animusphere Magecraft and Astromancy. Given how the Animusphere Magecraft works, you would find her to be a particularly powerful ally in the Lostbelts, able to use the rich mana in each of them to fuel her spells. Succeed however and Olga Marie Animusphere can join your chain as a companion. After finding out the sheer lengths that you went to for her, you can be assured of her love and gratitude and she has never been happier actually having someone who appreciates her. You also receive the Perk Protection Squad. Once per Jump you can select one individual from this Jump (that is not yourself or a companion) to benefit from this Perk. They will receive essentially a form of Plot Armor and be guaranteed to survive the events of the Jump, as well as avoiding particularly awful fates. This will not help them achieve their goals but you can rest easy that no matter what, they will survive. The person you used this on can even become an automatic companion at the end of the Jump."

      "description": "This happy mother, father, and daughter trio is the epitome of a happy and traditional elf family. After a few decades of chaste courtship they got married, and after a few more decades had their first child, a beautiful and compassionate daughter. While the elf mother dearly wished to have more children the father refused believing that one child is enough. So the mother gave up her dream to raise her daughter with love and care, while burying her own rising lust for years, and years, and years… One day, however, the daughter brought back someone unexpected, a stray human who had wandered into their village, you. While the daughter cheerfully got to know her “new best friend” the mother was more suspicious, she has heard many tales about the depraved lust of human men and she wondered if you had similar perverted plans for her family, and before she knew it she felt her womb quiver and the lust she restrained for decades coming back in full force. The moment that even the slightest hint of perversion starts to show in you, even something as minor as a quick glance at her and her daughter’s curves, is the moment she takes you aside and makes a deal. She and her husband dearly wish for their daughter to follow normal elf traditions, one of which is to remain a virgin before her marriage to another elf. However, she knows that as a human you can’t help but crave to dominate nubile elven bodies with ill intent, so in order to protect her daughter she will ‘sacrifice’ her body to satiate your lust. This is just to help her daughter, she tells herself, there is no way that she’d come to enjoy you fucking her behind her husband and daughter’s back or have her thoughts filled less and less about taking care and loving her husband and more and more about you. Her corruption will start small at first, like accidently calling you honey, or leaving her husband to spend more time with you, but will gradually accumulate until she willingly drags you into her and her husband’s marriage bed, at which she has completely fallen to you. If you hint at it, the Mother will be all too happy to integrate her beloved daughter into the new family dynamics. The daughter loves her mother dearly, but she was a bit saddened that her new human best friend seemed to be spending more time with her mother then herself. So when her mother invited the daughter to play some new ‘games’ with you two she was overjoyed. She especially likes the new game where you insert your ‘horn’ into her and thrust in and out quickly while her mother roughly gropes her chest and whispers dirty things in her ear that makes her feel hot. Her mother is even helping her get better at these games like switching her wardrobe into more revealing or form fitting outfits and teaching her new fun words to say to help make you happy. She will try her best to follow her mom’s advice because she wants to be the best daughter and friend she can be! Though she is a bit confused when ‘playing’ her mother pleads for you to give her “another daughter to train, and a granddaughter to spoil”. Of course during this whole process the Father remains in the dark about the gradual corruption of his family. He’s heard bad things about humans but seeing how happy his wife and daughter are around you obviously you are one of the good ones. You can stay at his house as long as you need, and he’ll even let you take his bed while he stays on the couch so long as you don’t mind his wife sleeping beside you. The Mother seems to take a perverse joy in having riskier and more public lewd acts around him, like ‘accidently’ dropping a utensil during dinner and then enjoying a salty desert, or having a polite conversation with her husband while you are pounding her hard just out of his sight. The Father is dense enough to never catch it on his own, but if you were to nudge events a bit for him to discover you his wife would give a lengthy speech which basically amounts to “elven men are inferior to humans” while embracing you passionately. Though oddly enough he seems to never bring this up afterwards, although you can swear that when your having sex with the Mother or Daughter that someone is watching you. Once her family is all sorted out the Mother will become very content, although she does wonder if perhaps she should help her fellow elven families experience the joy her family received from you as well…."

This unfortunate girl was one of the latter cases, her father being some human mercenary who, after she was born, got bored and left and the mother being some dark elf barmaid who took the line “I can’t live without your cock” a bit too literally and killed herself after he left. As soon as she could take care of herself the rest of her family kicked her out to fend for herself, which given that humans hate elves for arrogance and don't accept half bloods and elves despise the idea of any of their species being ‘defiled’ by a filthy human, meant a rather abusive and desperate childhood. Despite all of this trauma, the girl seems to be remarkably cheerful and positive with the ability to warm anyone’s heart and get them to drop their guard. She greatly longs for friendship and family that has been denied to her and if you show even the slightest bit of compassion for her she will immediately latch onto you as a substitute father. You’ll find that her time fending for herself has left her rather street smart, making her quick on the uptake, and a fast learner. She will try her absolute hardest to be the best daughter ever for you. Of course while she has a daddy now, she also longs for a real huge family as well, something she will try to push you into making during your travels. Maybe a couple of dozen elf mommies to spoil her and a hundred little sisters for her to play with will fill the void in her heart?"

      "description": "Living a life on a pedestal usually results in immense arrogance, but it can also potentially lead to being innocent about a lot of things. This particular girl is a rather good example of the latter. Having been essentially worshipped since young, something broke her sense of superiority and for some reason she’s latched onto you and come to believe she has to become “your maiden”, using a few weird books as reference. While she knows little of things that a housewife is expected to do, she is eager to learn and please you, although she is predictably quite embarrassed whenever you tease her about it. Surprisingly, her body is very sensitive to pleasure, and it wouldn’t be too difficult to metaphorically melt her into a puddle of bliss even if you barely know what you’re doing. She also knows how to make clones of herself, as per the Divine Clone perk. Perhaps you’ll use those clones to toy with her remotely?"

As you can see in this particular girl, while she is a genius in swordsmanship, she is quite incompetent at anything else, to the point she has largely come to depend on you for anything not related to cutting down enemies. Outside of combat she’s not the sharpest tool in the shed, and she is very innocent as you’d expect from someone who never paid much attention to anything other than sword skills from a very young age, but she does trust you quite a bit and is willing to follow your lead. Perhaps you’ll tutor her further in swordsmanship, or maybe you’ll teach her about that warm feeling in her chest whenever she’s with you?"

She is usually shy and very reserved, but can be very pushy to be with you if you’re in private. Certainly it doesn't help that she’ll resort to love poison if you don’t seem to reciprocate her feelings for too long. Being somewhat uneducated in matters not related to poison, she’s gotten some strange ideas in her head such as prioritizing using her feet for pleasing you, but perhaps you don’t mind such things?"

It does bear mentioning that they are very possessive, although not unwilling to share you if you’re honest about it.

They have a sword which possesses the soul of their mother, who looks just like them but older and hotter.

Whether those rumors are true or not this elf, possessing a mane of dark red hair and a rather startling gleam in her green eyes, is doing little to prove them wrong. She has done countless tests and trials on the bodies of many species, elves being the first among them. The results of her tests have led to a rather startling conclusion for her, the entire elf race was created by the goddess not to be the masters of the world like the rest of the elves believe, but rather to act as loyal slaves and sex relief to other species. While other elves may have been horrified by this revelation or deny it outright, this alchemist simply accepted the idea and walked calmly back to her bed so that she could masturbate furiously over the idea in peace. As an unbiased advancer of progress, she decided, it was her duty to ‘correct’ the current elf attitude and help them accept their purpose as sex toys. Over the years she has created a vast stockhouse full of potions and alchemic brews, all for the purpose of restoring the elven race to its proper form. All she needed now was a proper human stud to put her plans into motion, and when she saw you she knew it was time to start. While normally elf senses are capable of picking up on aphrodisiacs and other such contaminants put into their food and drink, the alchemist has created a potent aphrodisiac that even the most cautious of elves can’t sense until they feel their whole body alight with lust. She has also designed a potent sexual enhancer that can make her stud into an even more outrageous beast that could conquer a whole kingdom’s worth of elves in a night. It's not just aphrodisiacs she has in stock though, she has many more potions she wants to try out. A gender change potion to ensure that the elven men can join their wives and daughters in serving you, an age changing potion that can turn an elf’s physical appearance into whatever age they desire, a potion that causes a massive increase in curves, and many, many more. Unfortunately while she can make great potions and magical brews she can't cook actual food to save her life, something she is really sensitive about. Taking advantage of her alchemist prowess she seems to delight in changing her own body everyday into a new form for you to dominate, going from acting like an innocent young elf girl just helping her ‘big brother’ one day, and into a voluptuous adult whose every movement oozes sensuality, the next."

And the master of that in the clan can be none other than Leah Mean-Tail, the sadistic twin dagger wielding bounty hunter, and the one that would later be tasked to hunt down Purnima after she failed to return with the Amulet of Mus'tapaha. And for a fee of 50 CP you can choose to have her tag along as it seems something about you has invigorated that mercenary heart of hers, with her eager to see what sort of prey she can hunt by your side. She comes equipped with her two extra sharp knives and a dirty fighting style reminiscent of Purnima along with all the skills one would expect a bounty hunter to have. It's hard to pin down Leah as a person, but getting into some sadistic bounty hunts with her is a sure way to get the sparks flying."

Making a living terrorizing the people she claims to stand for, Clauria doesn’t see eye to eye with the current ruler of the shark-kin Purema, on account of still holding a grudge towards all Muh’keans after the ravaging of Kala’hai by an army of Muh’kean war golems. This was to the point that in the future she puts up a friendly face to take advantage of Namu’s heroic nature to lure her to the sunken Temple of Vihol by tasking her to retrieve a shark-kin relic. Once Namu found it Clauria tried to backstab her in order to kill the “last Muh’kean”, with the shark-kin trident relic Namu found being a side bonus she could ransom back to Kala’hai. So for a small fee of 50 CP you can take this ferocious pirate with you on your journeys, ready to sink her teeth into all kinds of new plunder and booty. Besides having various skills any pirate should have as a combatant she’s mainly a hand to hand fighter, making use of her teeth, claws/fist, and tail as weapons. She also makes use of eldritch themed dark magic shooting it out in single blasts, AOE attacks, or channeling it through her claws, all of which can drain the souls of those she hits. For an extra 50 CP, for a total of 100, you can bring along the rest of the Murderfins who number around fifty which are split across Sorceresses, Wrestlers, Great Whites, and Murderfin Great Tigers"

She spends her days in a haze, trying to get pleasure from ordinary people when her loins desperately desire the depths of pleasure that only the supernatural can give her. The only reason she’s not an Archdemoness of Corruption is because Elysium isn’t around to create the succubus rings… but even if she can still transform, she can hardly be called a “magical girl” anymore.

The goal was for him to save up enough time to go back and stop Elysium from getting free in the first place. But then he was captured, and pleasured endlessly by the demon god’s cock and tentacles, and his mind was twisted to bestow upon him the pleasure his comrades felt as their pussies were ravaged by the demon god, and he slowly fell closer and closer to corruption. When he realized this, he activated his time travel power even though he didn’t have enough time saved up, and has only barely arrived before the beginning of the end. However, he is physically in no shape to do anything to stop it. He’ll be relying on you… and to be honest, if he was given the opportunity to feel the pleasures that only a woman knows again, he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to decline, and fears that facing Ravana—or worse, Elysium—would awaken something in him."

      "description": "This is a strange world where girls can get abducted and turned into sex dolls for no reason. Many would be completely terrified by this prospect, but this high schooler here one day decided that she found the idea a dream come true. Thus, she turned to the offices and demanded with such fervor to be made into one that the workers got scared instead. Then she asked harder for it, and a few guys started crying. Yes, this girl is a natural genius at terror, a prodigy of traumatizing to the point that she can mentally break everything that can feel fear. Sadly, that doesn't help her goal of becoming the best sex doll out there, and as time passed she decided to look for a proper master that fit her criteria. That one ended up being you after crossing paths when trying to buy some soda and followed to your place. Given that you check all her boxes for a master and you aren't actually scared of her, it does seem like a somewhat acceptable agreement, even if she isn't a doll or slave, she does act like one. If you haven't caught on, besides her lewd body, pronounced curves and overly loving nature, she has the talent to scare people, regardless of their past or mental fortitude. You're immune to it, for some reason."

More specifically, they managed to find this girl - an honest to god psychic, one capable of messing with bioelectricity with great precision. Thanks to her 'cooperation' and some research on her power, the love collars were created. Afterwards they tried to put her into cryogenic sleep just in case, however she managed to control the guards assigned to her and escape. Tired, confused, hungry, and half-assedly pursued by the government, she ended up meeting you, who saved her from getting literally and figuratively fucked by the government. The princess fell for the knight that saved her. A curious, a bit amoral, loyal, bright, cheery, and surprisingly misogynistic girl, she's not only the scientific base for the love dolls, but she's also the one that had the idea in the first place. As it turns out, by trauma or natural inclinations, the girl does have an image of how an ideal world should be, and the government was just another step on her plans. Being saved by you however, threw a wrench at them and made her rethink some things - after all, compared to those politicians who had turned on her you're a much better fit to rule over the masses, and she could get some sweet revenge on the side too."

This group is filled with some tough and competent men and while they might not be as skilled as the knights, they make up for it in their numbers, containing 100 mercenaries instead of the normal 50, and their willingness to do whatever dirty deed is necessary to survive on the battlefield and even more dirty deeds outside of it.

Nearly three centuries old this Dark Elf’s figure had grown to be quite full figured and mature and she has practiced and mastered many different skills, dark magic similar to Olga’s being one of them. Choose one: -Uncorrupted: Luckily before the Kuroinu army arrived to her location to rape her to submission you showed up and helped her escape. She feels indebted to you for helping her out and as taken to following you around to repay her debt. She is a bit smug in the dark elves superiority over other races, but like Olga she keeps any of her more racist thoughts to herself. However after the capture and rape or death of a lot of her friends by the Kuroinu group, she is rather lonely. If you are kind to her, despite any racial tension to two of you might have, you will find that this temporary transactional based friendship could bloom into a true familial bond or perhaps maybe something more. She does have the habit of acting like a doting mother to her friends though and cooking, laundry, and many other household chores are things she excels at and is happy to do. -Corrupted: While the uncorrupted was only slightly smug, this version of her is downright arrogant, loudly proclaiming her superiority over a filthy human (or other beings) like you. This attitude lasted all of a few minutes until you had her cumming her brains out. Being ‘violated’ by a lower race seems to have changed her. She still retains that arrogant attitude, but you can tell from the longing looks she gives you and how she does what you ask of her regardless, that no matter how superior she thinks she is she could not beat the D. Although she’ll never admit it, at least not without being in the throes of ecstasy, she finds the idea of a lower species like you dominating your ‘betters’ to be incredibly arousing. A smug elf like her is a good start, but what really gets her going is the idea of you breaking the black queen and despoiling the goddess herself. She does have a habit of sometimes ‘flaunting’ her elven superiority (and huge breasts) over you, but by the way she laces her talk with innuendos and they way she positions her body just right, you can tell what she really wants is for you to teach this haughty elf her place"

She also quite skilled mage (there really wasn’t much to do isolated in the wilderness except practice magic). Choose one: -Uncorrupted: Unfortunately due to conflict or banditry her family has been killed leaving her with no one left until she has meet you. You comforted her about her lose and allowed her to stay with you/your group. Luckily she recovered rather well, but has become rather attached to you and your friends as a result of losing everyone she loved. She’s not going to be dead weight however as she has mastered a form of white magic allowing her to heal and enhance you and your allies. One thing to note about her personality is that as a result of her isolation she is rather.. innocent. Have a night of passion with a girl? She assumed that you two just cuddled to keep warm throughout the night. Bring up the tension between races and kingdoms and she thinks what everyone needs to do is just sit down and talk and the world could be at peace. Her heart beats loudly whenever she looks at you? She just thinks that means you two are great friends! Overtime her naivety will tone down from downright stupid good to just good hearted, she still will retain the childish curiosity about the world though. She also will grow to be quite a fan of classic story books, especially the romance ones. -Corrupted:....Well in an effort to dissuade her from leaving her parents reguilded her with stories about the (sexual) dangers of the outside world. Unfortunately for them their stories had the opposite effect from what they intended. When you first met her she loudly proclaimed that “you intended to ravage her pure elven body until she could only think about your dick”. Let’s just say that calling her a pervert with a dirty mouth is putting it mildly. Luckily as the one who took her virginity first, she believes that means you own her mind, body and soul now and thus she will keep her pervertness to you and those you tell her to. Make no mistake Jumper, although she is a pervert she has channeled her perversion into mastering a similar magic style that Keanne has, and has absolutely no hang ups on using that magic to fulfill both her and your every perverted whim."

She values honor and nobility in herself and her warriors and despises the Kuroinu group for the way they treat women and civilians. Her specialty in combat is defense, once she is told to defend a position she will do so with a fury and will that would shock those around her. Outside of combat she makes sure to go around helping her soldiers with any problems their having, drilling her soldiers so that they can keep up their edge, and making sure morale remains high. Her troops love her because she cares about them as individuals and acts motherly towards all of them both on and off the battlefield. She considers her oath of loyalty to you binding and will follow and serve you across the whole multiverse if she must. -Corrupted: Well it looks like she went against your forces and lost... really badly. A dark pleasure took a hold of her when she saw the women she had lead get violated by you/your men. By the time you got to her she was more then willing, pledging herself and all of her soldiers to whatever you want. As she was good at training others she decided (with your permission) to be the one to train her former men to love you/the D as much as she does. Much more aggressive than her uncorrupted personality with focus on aggressive attacks and raiding, her main goal is to get as many strong people as she can into your harem, she excuses this by saying that more powerful people protecting you means that you’ll be safe, but it's mainly because she takes pleasure into turning strong willed warriors into submissive servants like her.

Well these Shrine Priestesses have been corrupted in a similar way to the nuns above, but rather then taking the indirect approach to conquering the world for your D, unlike the corrupted nuns, they decided to go about converting people in a much more aggressive way, such as kidnapping travelers or raiding towns for soldiers and civilians and ‘converting’ them.

Through your own actions or the hand of fate she has decided that person would be you. Her mastery of the sword is so great that perhaps the only person who could match this woman in a contest of blades would be General Gladys herself. She is also quite skilled in protecting someone (you) from assassination or other threats to your being. In public she is rather quiet, prefering to let you take the lead, but will offer advice if she thinks it necessary. In private she is much more talkative and will use her decades of experience fighting to train you or others to be ready if you ever have to fight. She can get rather overprotective sometimes when she thinks you are in danger though. She also is an incredible beauty and has no problems with ‘guarding’ you at night in bed. All OC Companions have the perk Atomic Sized Beauty and the item Bra for free. Busty Bodyguard has the perks A True Swordswoman Can Overcome Any ‘Obstacle’, Knight Errant, Royal Guard, and Once In a Decade Talent.

      "description": "You know the demons in this world actually worship the same god that the humans do, to them the humans are the demons. On a completely unrelated note this beautiful blond haired nun is incredibly popular among the common folk, extremely charismatic, and is… a succubus? You see she wished to try to make peace between Demons and humans, rather than just continuing to hide in Giropon woods like the demons have done throughout their lives. Of course such a line of thought was not that popular and she was exiled from the woods. This of course leads her to you, as she does not want to kill anybody, but she also needs to feed to survive. Luckily as a descendent of Incubi, or some other way, she can’t kill you during sex (and in fact you probably will feed/satisfy her more then any other demon). This leads her to beg you to keep her ‘full’ so she doesn’t starve or kill someone in her hunger. Of course, once she gets a taste of you, the whole ‘so I won’t starve to death’ is just an excuse. She is a rather sweet gal though, she does her best to be kind to others and help solve their problems, which of course is part of the reason why she is so popular. She tends to hang around in churches or poorer districts so that she can be around to help others and is actually quite skilled in medical techniques and preparing food to feed the poor as a result. She dislikes using her succubus powers such as charm or invisibility, but don’t let that fool you, she is still strong enough to floor grown men with ease and has no reason to fear getting jumped. She’d rather you keep your relationship with her a secret, as nuns are suppose to be chaste, and acts incredibly tsundere to you in public. But the idea of getting caught or having others know that a maiden of god is so lustful is a real turn on for her even if she won’t admit it. She also may or may not have a kink for having sex in churches. All OC Companions have the perk Atomic Sized Beauty and the item Bra for free. Succubus Sister has the perks: Succubus, Soul of a Saint, Wilderness Survival, and Praise and Respect. She also is in possession of a supply of Split Seeds she nabbed from Giropon Woods while she was leaving (which for reasons that confuse her, seems to restock itself). Ordinarly she just uses the split seeds as a way to be in two or more places at once, but she likely can be ‘convinced’ to use it for more lewd purposes. Buying this Companion comes with the assumption that you either got Incubus Blood or possess some sort of OC way to survive having sex with her."

Her parents only saw her as a tool to expand their own power by stealing the others bloodline, and her early life was filled with nothing but people using her and manipulating her for their own gain. So she decided that she was going to manipulate everyone else instead, and slowly subverted both her parent’s agents to work for herself. Finally after the ‘mysterious’ deaths of both her parents she stands as one of the most powerful nobles in the kingdom. She has grown up to be incredibly intelligent, a bombshell of a beauty, and very apathetic to others and the world at large. Which is why it was so confusing to her when she first caught a glimpse of you and her heart started to race. You’re the only person that makes her feel anything besides the shallow emotions she’s felt throughout her life and she has become completely obsessed with you as a result. Not a yandere type of obsessed but rather she’s willing to devote her whole life to you. Want to live a life of decadence? She’ll not only empty her treasury for you, but also find a way to become even wealthier to give that money to you. Want a harem? She’ll convince, seduce, and manipulate anyone you’re attracted to and keep the harem happy and in love with you. Hopefully her interactions with you and your friends will help teach her empathy for others... or you can keep her as a loyal high functioning sociopath.

Though this doesn’t mean she can’t throw down with the best of them as is skilled in the use of her sword, shield, and ring, the latter of which was a gift from her father. The sword is able to ensnare people in goo plus increase her magic potency, the shield provides resistance against all magic, and the ring protects her squishy body from physical blows. Her studies also granted her a high level of magical ability and while this is primarily through her own unique Slime Techniques, she is perfectly capable of learning other types of magic. Her Slime Techniques includes, but is not limited to, shooting out exploding slime balls, absorbing life energy with slime tentacles to heal, launch hardened slime spike barrages, creating large slime tsunamis, infecting enemies with slime parasites, using poisoned and holy slime balls, dragging people down into slime pockets she’s placed underground, and trapping enemies in a “Ooze Dimension” bubble that weakens all of their resistances, stats, and damage. And similar to the old saying, food is the fastest way to her heart and while she loves almost every type of food, burgers are one of her favorites."

As a master thief Purnima is skilled in plenty of related areas, being a deft hand in pickpocketing, breaking and entering, acrobatics, and stealth. In the realm of combat such connotations continue as she wears no armor, and even refuses to wear pants and panties, and prefers to make use of her dagger, forearm shield, orb, and ring, all of which turns her into a dodging machine whose blade always seems to find its way into enemy weak points like a joint or their back. She has no magical knowledge and instead relies on various techniques and dirty fighting. Such a repertoire includes, but isn’t limited to; using her cat-like traits to boost her reflexes, throwing sand she stores between her tits in people’s eyes, using barrages of kunai or smoke bombs, sneaking up and cutting/ripping people’s throats, using her poison tipped claws, and, when she “level ups” enough, launching a “Ehterial Strike” through dimensions. As a note Purnima is a bit of a cheeky flirt and something like a massive bank heist would be her ideal date."

      "description": "Cloning is one of the many technologies that have been developed over the course of the modern era, used by both Ryuumon, a Chinese crime ring, and the UFS alike to ‘copy’ strong individuals to use as soldiers, with varying success. Few clones retain any of the supernatural abilities that their ‘donee’ likely possessed, and those that do tend to suffer a degradation in their abilities, with clones of Taimanin not inheriting their Ninja Art and clones of Demons having their innate abilities lessened. On the other hand though, powerless clones have another potential use, that being to act as slave prostitutes for people who were screwed over by the original, and that’s where this individual comes from. A clone of Asagi, you either bought or ‘found’ in some brothel, who possesses a copy of the original's memories up until her stay in the Chaos Arena where her memory was copied. This clone, despite not having any of the powers or strength of the normal Asagi, believes herself to be the ‘real’ Asagi who was simply temporarily depowered. Whether you inform her of this truth and comfort her in grief or leave her unaware of this fact while you take sweet liberties with her body is up to you I suppose. As one last note the crime organisation, who made this duplicate, modified her brain to produce and release Oxytocin much easier, meaning that quite simply even a brutish rapist could seduce this clone with enough ‘tender’ care and a few whispered ‘I love you’s, or maybe it's just the clone channeling Asagi’s own desire to retire from fighting with her husbando. Just watch out for the real Asagi, as she takes a rather dim view of these clones of hers. Additionally, by spending an additional 50 CP this clone was instead designed first and foremost to be a soldier, possessing superior physical capabilities and installed with powerful cybernetics allowing her to manipulate gravity. Luckily those extra capabilities are ‘turned off’ right now, and you were given, or scrounged up, the means of controlling them."

Yet the moment she saw you her eyes lit up and with a call of “My Lord” she ran over to you. A confusing conversation for both of you ensues where she insists upon your being her master and she your most loyal servant, with any mention of Fuuma being met only with disdain by her. If you’re familiar with the multi-dimensional incidents caused by creatures such as the mindflayers bringing in or leaving people from other worlds, the Tokiko you see before you is one of those hapless individuals. In the world where this version of Tokiko originated from, your other self was the head slaver for one Danjou Fuuma. Kotaro was remarkably less successful in defeating his father and rescuing his sister, which left your other self plenty of time to break and remake Tokiko into being his loyal slave. How she arrived in this world is a mystery, but she’s surprisingly unbothered by the fact you’re not ‘her’ Lord, and she has no problem immediately swearing her loyalty to you, sexually if you would prefer. Luckily your other self didn’t train Tokiko to be just another brain dead sex slave, making sure her mind is as sharp as ever. Her skill in administration she used to support Kotaro that let her keep track of the quickly growing organisation Kotaro created, can easily be repurposed as a secretary for you to handle boring logistical and letting you focus on what's important. Her ninja art, Clairvoyance, allows her to act as an incredible scout, not only letting her separate her vision from her body letting her have eyes anywhere she needs but also having her sight touch books, computers and so on, she can read the information contained within. She’s also a decently skilled fighter to boot. Interestingly while the original Tokiko tended to be a bit of a jealous sort, that trait has been trained so thoroughly out of her that it inverted and she’s become a bit of a cuckqueen, taking perverse pleasure in watching, and helping, you fuck other women. Her time as an ‘assistant’ slaver also left left her quite knowledgeable about such procedures and outright eager to give you her ‘help’ if you are not."

      "description": "An older woman, ie, she’s been on Mermaid for twenty years, who is a complete societal pariah. Not because she was abrasive, crude, or anything of that sort. Indeed, she’s a genuine sweetheart the likes of which you’ll rarely meet. She’s an outsider because she’s an absolute, garbage-tier E rank Extar. Her weapon form is a tiny, almost useless knife with little piercing power and even less cutting power. No Liberator with even an ounce of self-preservation would give her the time of day, so, she just left. She’s been getting by on her own since then, and I guarantee that if you take her with you and either make her feel appreciated or useful, she’ll think the world of you. On more pragmatic terms, living on her own for so long has made her shockingly good at survival. She has the full benefits of the Survivalist, Wanderer, and Fisher-Queen perks, along with a very extensive array of ways to cook the fish she catches so you won’t get bored. What’s that, you… ah, of course. You want to know what kind of body she’s packing. Due to being out on her own, middle-aged, and, ironically enough, considerably better fed than most, she’s quite pleasantly plump, all over. Good for you though, her standards aren’t that high."

This young Liberator has been here not that much longer than you, though her personality has seen her ejected from both the castle and village for her ‘issues.’ What are those issues? An explosive temper and an itchy trigger finger. She gets by stealing and beating what she needs out of roaming islanders, though she hasn’t killed anyone, yet. You find her in a compromising state and help her out, and she hasn’t left your side since, insisting that you need her around. She is a C rank Liberator with the first level of Marksman/woman for free. She also has an ordinary shotgun with a bottomless clip, that she just “found,” and an APC that she stole on the way out of the castle. She’s also suffering from the effects of the Drawback ‘Hair Trigger.’ Hmm, her body? Of course. Fitting with her attitude she’s quite athletic, and improbably curvy where it counts. But, you have heard the phrase ‘don’t stick your dick in crazy,’ right?"

And sometimes you get a single high school girl who talks like a samurai from 400 years ago and seems to think you're her liege lord. Hailing from the land of the rising sun, this young lady is not actually old enough to join the military, but has been training for most of her life in various arts of war, from tactics and strategy, to various guns and the sword, and of course her clan's traditional exorcism style. Yes, you heard me. It is, despite what you might be expecting, not an actual form of magic. Rather, it is a somewhat ritualized form of self hypnosis that allows the girl to convince herself that she can, in fact, swing her sword fast enough to launch a blast of wind, or to kick off the ground with such force that she can scale a building by running up its length. Naturally this wreaks havoc on her body afterwards and a single engagement where she goes all out can put her out of action for weeks - but if you really need a lot of people dead very quickly, look no further."

Maybe she thinks you have the resources to strike at the corrupt politicians that sent her and her comrades to die, or perhaps a project of yours might give her the opportunity to pull such a thing off by herself; whatever the case, her brush with death has left her obsessed with strength...both in terms of gaining it and worshiping it, and thus those stronger than her or who can give her more power."

Ultimately, she stole the better part of an entire laboratory and walked off with quite a bit of proprietary information. Naturally, the company, and the organizations they were in bed with for those projects, have been quietly trying to reclaim her before she sells it to another nation. You likely stumbled across her while she was pretending to be a back alley doctor in order to earn the money she needs to finish her magnum opus - a cure for death. Or at the very least, for as many things as she can shove into a single pill. Unsurprisingly, such a thing would put most healthcare companies out of business, hence them refusing to grant her resources to work on it. If you’ve any to spare, I’m sure she’d be quite grateful."

One such lady thus had the brilliant idea of producing a modified variant of the myxomycete for her own exclusive use...but unfortunately, while working undercover in an operation against one of her fronts she was discovered and forced to infect herself with a prototype in order to survive, and thus while she has gained an amazingly curvy body on top of almost-superhuman physical capability and reflexes that appears rather deceptive at first glance, she has to procure stabilizing drugs to keep the mold from eroding her mind while still maintaining her strain’s specific benefits. And seeing as the materials don't come cheap and she's constantly working on more efficient doses, you're often the person she calls up for...let's say, convenient test subjects. In return, she supplies her scientific expertise as she pleases, though if you prove yourself to be a worthwhile investment, perhaps even someone to call an equal, she might be interested in more...delicate matters.

That said, she doesn't see action often - she spends most of her time dealing with information breaches on projects that the CIA would rather the public not find out about. More often than not, this means convincing some rather stupid guys not to fuck around and find out what some parasite or virus will do to a bunch of teenagers if they drop it in a mall.

This particular woman, being an example of the latter, doesn't actually work for your team as she prefers to be freelance. Simply put she's a retrieval specialist - the NDS could send an entire strike team to kick in someone's door, or they could shell out a bit more to send her in to sneak past everything and do it quietly, helped along by her possessing a plethora of spy gadgets including the classic grappling gun. Oddly enough, there was one instance where they chose to do both, probably to have you kill her on her way out and take the package for yourself. Luckily for her, you ended up saving her life and she grudgingly admitted that she owed you a favor. While outwardly she seems content to give cryptic hints, intel, and the occasional important piece you need to progress, whether that be a key or perhaps some object you're tasked with recovering that she wasn't paid to, then immediately dipping for the actual job she was paid to do until your paths cross again in order to make up for it, sometimes you get the feeling she thinks she owes you a lot more given how...charged your conversations can be.

So she stayed, unconscious but not quite either dead or alive, until the mysterious event that empowered the women of the world; the surge of energy brought her fully back to life, which considering the Egyptian feelings on the sanctity of the dead, she feels quite ambivalent about. Still, she is devoted to her beliefs and her nation, and seeks to reestablish the faiths of ancient Egypt in the modern day and reestablish the nation of Egypt (as she considers the Egyptians of the modern day to be rather feckless). But she was never meant to be a true leader, only to direct others under the direction of someone else; if you were to overpower her, she would surely declare you to be her new pharaoh and serve you with the same loyalty she did in her first life. But that will be hard to do, as her time being dead has inured her to pain and damage, she wields the bandages she is still wrapped in like expert weapons, and she is well-trained in ancient Egyptian martial arts, that were so secretive that no written records existed of them."

She’s nobody right now, just a rookie, but already she shows a lot of talent for the more mercenary side of things. If she could get her hands on a steady stream of jobs, gear, and money, she might actually have what it takes to become a living legend and leave her mark on history. Or at least the city’s history. Along the way, she’ll likely end up acquiring a variety of lethal and sensual skills, depending on what her jobs (or you) push her to develop. Eventually. she might end up one of the most respected people around here. But in the meantime, she’d appreciate it if she could crash at your place. She doesn’t have a lot of other places she could spend the night. At times you might catch her talking out loud to empty air, possibly a hallucination, possibly an augmented reality thing. She does have the fancy cybereyes for the latter. You’d have to ask her about her neural chip if you wanted to get the full story."

      "description": "Considering how boring a younger elf’s life tends to be, it's no surprise that many of them strike out as adventurers. Many elf adventurers lose the disdain that usually defines their race, as they interact with others. Of course, given how this world is, the majority of the time these elves either get adicted to pleasure and turn into prostitutes, or become the sex slaves of one of their party members. This elf adventurer who seems determined to form a party with you is different however, despite this common trend she still retains the idea that “Elves are a proud and noble race, we are not lewd.” She does have the skills to back up her claim however, being a talented wizard who can easily explode monsters, and also is a good cook. Just don’t taunt her about becoming the party's cocksleeves, as you’ll never hear the end of it with her protests. Of course beneath that ‘dignified’ exterior is a secret. The reason why her magic is so strong is because she practices forbidden magic of olden times that draws on the natural lewdness of elves to manifest far greater power than a mage could normally. Of course using such power comes at a perverted cost, her lust will build up and eventually explode leaving her sex crazed for days and needing satisfaction now. After you “helped” her once on an adventure during an episode when it went out of control she seems to have calmed down a bit and actually feels a bit more loyalty to the party and affection for you. She still insists that she is not lewd, but given her ‘episodes’ she usually proves the opposite."

Luckily, they found you shortly after landing and latched on to you to be their guide on this strange new world. Though twins, their personalities are almost polar opposites: the younger is sunny and optimistic, perhaps even naive, while the elder has a more cynical and even ruthless disposition and could easily be lured into villainy. Despite their differences they’re as close as sisters can be, maybe even as close as lovers, though I’ll let you discover that for yourself. Both girls possess the Alien powerset and their powers recharge from both sexual activity and ultraviolet light, so they’re quite fond of skimpy outfits and naked sunbathing between battles. They’re also highly empathic and responsive to emotions, yours especially thanks to the close bond they’ve formed with you. Both girls occupy a single companion slot."

This dark heroine gained her phenomenal magical powers by being the daughter of a powerful demon lord, and to say she has serious daddy issues is something of an understatement. Despite being half-succubus she’s obsessed with self-control and has become highly repressed by trying to reject her demonic heritage, but this is far easier said than done and her spells occasionally backfire on her in lewd ways, like tying herself up in heavy bondage. However with the right mentor to help her get over her hangups she could become a powerful force for good (or evil)."

Extremely skilled at any form of violence you care to name and seeming to get even better when directing said violence at anyone she feels has threatened or mistreated you she makes for an excellent protector should you feel a need for one.

She loves seeing you dominate, be dominated by, and especially breed other women; the first one being a favorite alternative of hers for bitchy but hot girls who haven’t quite earned being stabbed by something sharp. She’s rather hesitant to be a mother too soon but would love to help if you bred (or got bred by) another girl, though she might be a bit less happy about it if it’s with a girl she thinks goes beyond tolerable levels of bitch. Top of her list of girls she most definitely wants to see you breed with are her mother, her sister, and the doggirl who her family took in as a pet/third daughter; they may optionally join her in joining you and are happy to get away from the forsaken spot of land the past few generations of the family has grown up on, at least one of them is most likely a futa."

Fortunately for everyone she has developed a rather large crush on you and is happy to remain at a less outrageous size for the sake of spending her time with her new crush, acting more like a shy and exceptionally obedient schoolgirl for you so long as she’s not too angry at anything. Do keep in mind that if she gets too angry at you she might just decide to express that anger by using your home as a toy at her full size which is unlikely to leave anything but a cum soaked ruin where it once was, that said the prospect of you sleeping with her at her full size would calm her from almost anything whether that means you being able to grow to match her or if you’re willing to get inside her stem/flower for a less conventional method. Wants at least five daughters who’ll each eventually be just as big and powerful as their mother and expects you to fulfill your duty as a parent for each of them, in her culture this means she intends to share you with them once they’re old enough to for that sort of thing."

She gets a bit upset when judged for how small she is but it’s pretty obvious that she also enjoys it, at least coming from somebody she likes such as you. Even after her very successful efforts to overcome the disadvantages of her height she still does fantasize of being a big strong predatory futa rather than a cute little bunny rabbit, able to easily subdue (and fuck) perps rather than using frankly absurd amounts of high effort agility to make up for her size. She’s already got some useable ideas for that but could fairly easily be domesticated as your eager sex sleeve too, or both since some of her ideas don’t have to be a permanent thing. Regardless this officer rabbit quite likes nosing into your business despite never actually arresting you for any misdeeds that she might catch you in, though she might require some distracting if you want her to stop pestering you about them. Optionally she can come with her mother(s) and large numbers of sisters and the farm they all live on, though she’ll want you to get along with the entire herd of bunny girls and likely help expand it one way or the other."

      "description": "In the Village of Beginnings there existed three children who were close friends and who would later go on to become some of the most elite Star Trainers. And one among them, named Hikari, holds the honor of being one of the ones responsible for getting Futta’s journey to being Yarimon champion started. But while this may make her seem completely selfless, in truth her relationship with Futta started with her outwardly appearing to be a bully to him. Though she does mellow out in the future, and if you’d like to spend 50 CP to take her along with you, said mellowing may come faster. As a rookie Yarimon trainer she may not have a whole lot of experience starting out, but she compensates with a lot of raw talent. Said talent is enough that by the time of the finals for the Yarimon World Tournament she had only really suffered losses to Futta and the head shrine maiden/Star Trainer Aoi, the latter of whom she managed to beat in the finals, and was among the only five people at the time to show the ability to synchronize with their ace Yarimon and grant them an EX form. Speaking of which, the Yarimon team she’ll have when you pick her up consists of the earth type Stinkeater, the light type Sparko, and her light type ace Squirretric, which all will evolve or “Soul Up” into Ripfleshia, Sparkitus, and Squrrender respectively. But, moving into her personal life, one aspect of her battling that bleeds into it is her seeming interest in learning and experiencing new things, along with a very competitive spirit. This part of her is evidenced by how when Futta first stepped foot in Wano Village he managed to see Hikari who was dressed in the uniform of a Wano kunoichi and had just finished helping an elderly woman through the Wano Mountain cave system. This also shows she has a really good heart, just with some difficulty showing it to those she likes, with it being revealed in the finals of the tournament that her “bullying” of Futta was partially done to protect him from the other kids of the village who were actually bullying him and Chikepu. Another example of this hidden heart of gold is when she, her mother Luna who was the village’s Yarimon professor, and Futta were having dinner and her mother revealed that Hikari relentlessly battling Futta was a part of a plan where after she won a hundred times she would gift him a Yarimon Enciclopedia and invite him on a Yarimon journey to commemorate it. And when you manage to butter her up and get to know her better, you’ll realize in areas of love she becomes easily flustered, especially when it comes to sex. But still retains her competitive zeal meaning she’ll do her best to outdo you, in regards to showing love, as well as anyone else who may have their eyes set on you."

      "description": "The third member of the Village of Beginnings Trio, similar to Hikari, fulfills one of the most common stereotypical archetypes that female childhood friends fall into. Her name is Leo and the archetype she plays into is that of a rough and tumble tomboy who presents herself as a boy in order to become a protagonist's best friend. And opposite to Hikari, she's always been openly supportive of Futta, especially in regards to the fact he couldn’t light up the Star Ore in a Star Disk. And if you’d like to spend 50 CP to take her, she’ll be just as willing to be your biggest cheerleader as she is to race you to the next town. Similarly to Hikari, Leo is also a rookie trainer that makes up for a lack of experience with raw talent and explosive growth. That last point especially as not only was she the first person Futta saw using an EX form for her ace, along with being ranked as a Star Trainer before Futta or Hikari, in the finals she faced off against her sister Athena who was the champion. During that battle she broke her limits and managed to go toe to toe with her sister who had been the undefeated champion for years, and while she did lose, it showed she can make great leaps and bounds in her skill and abilities as she managed to partially counter her sister’s “Hyper Intuition”. That also translates to her team which starts with a wind type Flowapuff, an earth type Rootly, and her fire type ace Liocub, all of which will evolve or “Soul Up” into Gardenia, Grandly, and Champlio respectively. Moving on to personality, while she does display the normal traits of a tomboy such as an outgoing nature and a love of physical activity, with her having a particular fondness for swimming, she also has a fondness for more nerdy things like manga. This is to the point she gave Futta his nickname due to him looking like a character in a manga she read that had that name, which is something she is going to be doing to you and those around you. She also wears her emotions on her sleeve, with her being in a buzz when happy and a bit of a moppy mess when sad, and returning her cheerleading behavior when she herself is feeling down is sure fire way to make her day. This is shown when Futta gave her a pep talk before her battle with her sister, which cleared any lingering doubts and allowed her to fight to her fullest. And as a final point, she is very physically affectionate, so prepare to be showered with hugs whenever she feels her emotions getting the better of her. Though, speaking of physical affection, another way she differs from Hikari is that she can be a bit more upfront about love and sex, at least after a small bit of hesitation in the beginning."

      "description": "While the Village of Beginnings may seem like a small quaint little place, similarly to the hometowns of plenty of pocket monster protagonists, it holds its very own research lab. The professor of that lab is the lovely Luna, who not only conducts research on Yarimon, but serves as a Star Trainer and the mother of Hikari. And as Futta interacted with her, he learned that she is similar in some ways to her daughter and drastically different in others, and by paying 50 CP you’ll be able to explore those intricacies yourself. Starting with her Yarimon battling career, it's unknown when she became a Star Trainer. The only thing that can be gleaned is that she had a friendship, and possible rivalry with the Yarimon Representative Witch/Star Trainer Vritra, with this possibly giving her the drive to reach the rank of Star Trainer. Another thing is that, like most other Star Trainers, she can exude a sort of pressure that is the representation of her soul energy, with the specific feeling her pressure gives being a sense of paralysis as a choked up feeling starts rising in one's throat. But besides all that she is utterly “average” when it comes to Star Trainers, with the only other thing of note being her team which consists of a dark type Deathsickle, a normal type Cosmosis, and her light type ace Roamoon. And as was said before, in terms of personality she shares some things with her daughter, specifically her seeming trouble with emotions. On a day to day basis she is very stoic, rarely letting how she feels show and talking in a sort of clinical manner. But when something happens that is surprising, outside her comfort zone, or related to something she is passionate about, that “mask” falls away, as was seen when she became uncharacteristically excited when she smelled what she thought were Matsutake mushrooms on Futta. And one way she differs from her daughter is that is very cognisant of the effects her actions, as well as the actions of those she is responsible for, have on others. This has led her to occasionally check in on Futta in regards to the ninety nine thousand yen he paid to Hikari during his losing streak to her, and ask whether or not Hikari paid him back and apologizing for her actions. Though there is one other way she is similar to her daughter, with that being in regards to love and sex. Specifically she also gets flustered when others would take the initiative, but where Hikari does so partially out of embarrassment, Luna does so due to not knowing how to respond and needing a second to think. But once the thinking is done she will proceed towards her desires with confidence, with her having a particular fondness for anal."

      "description": "While Futta, Leo, and Hikari may be the more obvious up and coming Yarimon Trainers, there is another among their age group that has already managed to entrench herself in the realm of Star Trainers. Her name is Maki, and she is considered a young rising Star Trainer and the crown jewel of Big City. And while she may have a bit of an abrasive bite to her, she does have a soft side that you can discover with just 50 CP. As was just mentioned, despite being around the same age as Futta, Leo, and Hikari, she is well into her career as a Yarimon and Star Trainer. This speed is due to a combination of talent and hard work, with her putting more ephesus on the latter, with this leading her to being among the few to be able to make use of an EX for for her ace Yarimon and be among the eight that made it to the finals for the Yarimon World Tournament. This hard work was also poured into her team which consists of a wind type Ladymantis, an earth type Clops, and her light type ace Mystifox. And in regards to her Star Trainer pressure, hers is a bit more generic than some of the others, with it simply projecting the weight of her soul and skill. Onto personality, she has a lot of pride in her abilities and skill to the point that she absolutely detests anyone who tries to attribute her success to just simple talent. This has led her to going off on a trainer she had beaten who insinuated that talent and being the daughter of a mega corp CEO brought her all her success, with her snapping back with the partial boast that she had been training and forging bonds with her team since she was one year old. This defense of hard work and merit also extends to other people as she defended Futta against her “fan club” after he beat her, as they were claiming his win was a fluke, and reassured him after he degraded said win due to using Chikepu’s Cheat Tackle. But this mindset shows that she gets irritated easily, which leads to a sort of cycle where she gets irritated at something, does some kind of brash and impulsive action in response, and gets further irritated with herself due to said impulsiveness. And one final aspect of her is that she is incredibly dedicated to hard work, if that wasn’t obvious, and besides her Yarimon Trainer career this comes in handy in her role of CEO of Tohsaka group, one of the top two most powerful mega corps. Also, somewhat building off that last point, it seems she shares a bit of a stereotype of powerful CEOs in that when it comes to her love and sex life she has a preference for being dominated. Specifically, being treated like a meat toilet by a “master”."

      "description": "But not every young Star Trainer can have the same hot blooded drive that Maki, and later Futta, Leo, and Hikair have. And one such Star Trainer is named Akira who fancies herself a detective, valuing that just as if not more highly than her being a Star Trainer. So by spending 50 CP you’ll be able to take her on an adventure to discover new mysteries and history, not that she cares to see a distinction between the two. Similarly to Luna, Akira’s battling history isn’t well known nor is her skill and the like particularly exciting. The main points of knowledge are with her team, which consists of a light type Electribun, a light type Alloroid, and her dark type ace Rawrbot, and her Star Trainer pressure which makes people feel like they’ve been hit by a strong gust of wind. So instead of battling, the main points of interest in regards to what she does day to day is her detective work which is a career that has been seemingly passed down from her great grandfather. In this role she does her best to both find various mysterious and unknown elements no one has heard about, such as Water Stone, as well as dive into the history of more common things like Star Disks. And in regards to how she treats the entire affair, she absolutely loves it and puts her all into every aspect of it. This has led to her being very excited when it comes to opportunities to discover and learn about new things, as when Futta revealed he had a stash of the ultra rare Water Stone, she got stars in her eyes and almost immediately declared him her beloved best friend. And that claim wasn’t just a simple joke, as after that she started to come up with a number of “clever” schemes in order to deepen the friendship she has with Futta, which also shows she can be a bit possessive over those she loves as most of the plans hinge on her getting Futta addicted to sex with her. These plans, which have her always trying to feign innocence/ignorance while having a cunning and scheming internal dialog, however usually backfire with her becoming more addicted to sex with him, like when he asked her out on a swimsuit date she decides to go with men’s swimming trunks to try and seduce him and get him addicted to anal. And such shenanigans will now become a part of your life as by taking her you are effectively granting her a near unlimited number of mysteries and histories to discover and delve into, which to her is the ultimate love letter."

      "description": "As one would assume with a whole meritocratic system of the Star Trainers, their members come from various walks of life and can hold various jobs alongside their status as some of the toughest trainers. And one Star Trainer that shows off that job aspect is Vritra who not only serves as the head of the Yarmon Witches, who in the modern day serve as researchers, but the head of the Central Church. Being a head researcher has also led to her being one of the few people to know of, or at the very least sincerely believe in, the existence of souls, and so by spending 50 CP to take her such expertise will be at your disposal. Similarly to Luna not much is known about her battling history, though it wouldn’t be crazy to say that in her youth she was as driven as the likes of Futta and Hikari, with her friendship and possible rivalry with Luna propelling her forward. It can also be safe to say that similarly to Luna a career in Yarimon research has allowed her to refine her skills and her team which consists of a fire type Partable, a water type Snowspruce, and her normal type ace Glare. Her Star Trainer pressure invokes a scene of heaviness into those that in its range, making it feel hard to move, and something she has that only seems to exist among Yarimon Witches is the ability to use “magic” though the extent of her powers and whether it is similar to the soul abilities of Flare are unknown. Going into personality, she in a broad sense gives off the air of being a deeply arrogant, haughty, and dismissive person. But in actuality while she may speak and behave very arrogantly to others, she is and is considered very kind by those around her, with her taking good care of others such as her subordinate Yarimon Witches, and is in turn spoken of in a very positive light by those around her. This is shown off when Futta mentioned that he had some understanding and knowledge on souls, with Vritra engaging in an honest discussion with him regarding hypotheticals despite thinking he is somewhat of a brat. This also shows off a bit of her inquisitive mind that she shares with Akira and another event had her on the lookout for a mysterious rainbow colored medicine so she could try and study its effects. As a final point she also has a deep love of fashion which comes across in her bold fashion sense and tastes. And despite how professional she may seem she does have a bit of a flirty side to her, such as when she jokingly offered to let Futta group her breasts after he told her some of his thoughts on the nature of souls. The incident with the rainbow medicine also showed how she wants to be made to feel youthful during sex, despite her only being thirty."

      "description": "As one would expect of a group of people who have been officially recognized by the world government for their skill, Star Trainers are a bit of a famous bunch. And the one among them that embodies that fame the most is Mizuki who, despite being serving as a waitress in a candy themed restaurant on a beach side, has managed to garner a fanbase that far eclipses that of any other Star Trainer. So if you’d like to bring such marketability with you on your adventures all you need is 50 CP. In terms of battling, she seems to have undergone a rapid awakening of her skills and abilities in a vein similar to Hikari, Futta, and Leo. Not only has this allowed her to reach the status of a Star Trainer and make it to the finals of the tournament, it allowed her to develop her own battle ability which greatly increases the effectiveness of both her and her Yarimon. This ability is heavily rhythm based as it entails her and her Yarimon getting into a battle tempo that allows the both of them to read the rhythm, breath, and intentions of their opponents to know what they are doing, with this boosting their performance to 120%. However, that rapid awakening has a downside in that it is mostly elevated her and not her team, making it so her Yarimon have difficulty keeping up with her during long and intense battles, especially if their tempo is disrupted. Speaking of her team, it consists of a normal type Pandit, a water type Sealebrity, and her water type ace Deary Mizuul which is similar to a certain electric yellow rodent mascot in that it is a Mizuul that is wearing a ponytail and bow that is similar to Mizuki’s. In regards to her personality, she comes across as a stereotypical fame hungry idol with her being very concerned with her image and will play the part of one whenever there are a lot of people with eyes on her. But in more private situations her true self comes out, which shows that the cheery face she puts on when she is working or performing is how she actually is most of the time. Though she does have her own thorny moments as she showed a bit of disdain at the “deal” her boss put up where people can pay five thousand yen to battle her in order to try and win a two hour date ticket with her, with her seeing it as a waste of money due to her status as a Star Trainer. And she can be a bit inconsiderate on occasion such as when she only offered two hundred yen more than the twenty five thousand yen buying price of the Fabulous Spray Futta bought that she wanted and when he gave it to her for free she planned to only repay him with a free glass of juice from the restaurant she works at. But this does make it oh so sweet to sexually bully her a bit, and it seems as if a bit of cosmic karma has caused situations where you can do so to be extremely common."

      "description": "Out of all the areas in the region the one that can be said to be home to the most Star Trainers has to be Wano Village. And one of the members that makes up the trio, known as the Three Beauties, that is Wano Village’s pride and joy is Mohohime, the eldest daughter of the village’s mayor and the fiery red oni to her younger sister's blue. Since she has come of age she’s been locked in battle with her younger sister for the to become heir of their father, but for 50 CP you’ll come to discover the hidden backdrop to the conflict as the strength you have seems to have drawn her to you. Starting with her battling history, she can be considered the second strongest trainer in Wano Village, with that title being shared with her sister as they both have a streak of ninety nine ties against each other. This is due to them knowing each other so well, and when they attempted to break this seemingly never ending tie by getting their own men to battle in their stead they handily beat every man in the village. But besides that another interesting aspect is that she is among the few Star Trainers to make use of a monotype team, with said team consisting of a fire type Chikenslither, Matriolf, and their ace Flamsala. Also their Star Trainer pressure causes those hit by it to feel like a scorching heat wave just hit them. In regards to her personality, she for the most part acts like a stereotypical brash and strong female fighter, with her always demanding those who speak to her to stand up straight and look her in the eye. But once you get past that, she is an incredibly caring person which can be shown by her reasoning for trying to become the next heir of Wano Village. And that is because she sees the role as incredibly limiting and restrictive and this wants to save her sister from it and allow her to live her life as she wants. Though like most strong female fighters, once you get her into more intimate situations her strength and boldness crumble into dust, with her being reduced to a shy blushing virgin. And if you manage to prove your strength by beating her in battle, then she’d practically jump at the opportunity to be your wife, though she will float the idea of taking her sister along as a concubine for you."

      "description": "Standing opposite of Mohohime in the Wano Village trio is her younger sister who also stands to potentially become the hair of the village. Her name is Kuro, and unlike her sister she is a lot more reserved, being the calm blue oni to her sister’s red. And like her sister when she came of age she put her all into battling for the right to be the heir of Wano Village and for the exact same reasons, but for 50 CP you can discover the difference she has when compared to her sister as it seems she’s taken note of your strength. But those differences don’t really manifest in regards to battling, as just like her sister she is considered the second strongest trainer in Wano Village with her sharing that with her sister. And that also comes from the streak of ninety nine ties she has had with her sister and the fact that she decimated every man in the village when searching for someone to battle her sister in her stead. But one element that is somewhat similar while still being different is her team composition as like her sister she is among the few Star Trainers to have a full monotype team, with hers consisting of a dark type Kingeist, Howlabout, and their ace Mesalassa. And where her sister's Star Trainer pressure is like a raging inferno, hers plays more into her darkness theme as it causes those who feel it to instinctively move away from her as if their bodies are reacting in fear of her power. Onto personality, she is practically the exact opposite of her sister as where her sister is loud and bold, she is more reserved and refined. One of the biggest examples of this is how she speaks, as when compared to her sister she has the vocabulary and grammar of a highly refined noble, but somewhat indicative of being the younger sister she does occasionally pepper in some modern-ish slang. And where her sister can be a bit more personable with others, she is a bit more cold with her really only being open with her father, sister, and Futta after he beat her. One of the final ways that she differs from her sister is she is a lot more open and comfortable with things like romance and sexual relations as she wasn’t all too flustered when Futta’s “Payment” ability kicked in and when the “alone” time she was having with Futta was accidently interrupted by Mohohime she proposed the idea of a threesome to her sister. And if you're interested in taking her hand in marriage all you need to do is display your strength in the same manner you would her sister, with her being more than happy to shower you with lavish cooking, and she will also float the idea of taking her sister alone as a concubine with you."

      "description": "And at the top of the Wano Village trio stands the head shrine maiden of the Central Shrine. Her name is Aoi and she is considered the absolute strongest trainer in all of Wano Village, but such lofty praise hasn’t seemed to go to her head, at least outwardly as she appears to be very unemotional. But there does exist a side to her she rarely shows to others, and by spending 50 CP you’ll be given the chance to help bring that side out of her as it seems just like Futta she’s noticed something special about you. Beginning with her battling career, as was previously mentioned she stands at the top of all trainers that come from Wano Village. This strength and skill is what allowed her to easily earn a place among the small number of trainers that made it to the finals of the Yarimon World Tournament. One tool in her arsenal that potentially aided her in reaching these highets is her ability to seemingly see the souls of people and Yarimon, an ability that only the Child of God Flare possessed, that allowed her to see the soul link Futta and “Chikepu” had. And another main tool that aided her was her team which consists of a wind type Sakimaiko, a fire type Matriolf, and her light type ace Patriolf, with her Star Trainer pressure just having the generic effect of enforcing the weight of her skill and power. Moving onto personality, Aoi has a reputation around Wano Village for being extremely silent and unsocial in most cases. This is to the point that when Futta first approached her, her starting the conversation was seen as an extremely big deal. But just because she doesn’t make what's on her mind known all too often doesn’t mean she is completely without emotion or character, just that she's not good at showing them, as one major element she has is a very competitive nature similar to Hikari who can be seen as her main rival. Whenever she loses, such as against Futta at her shrine and Hikari in the tournament finals, she becomes incredibly frustrated which she tries to alleviate by putting on a seemingly genuine smile before saying that she is still frustrated. And another is that she has confident perversion that lurks under the surface, at least when it comes to things related to you, so expect her to do things like casually comment on any occurrences of lewd luck and to use her competitive nature to rope those who may also have eyes on you into lewd competitions such as when she goaded Hikari into entering a “Best Couple” swimsuit competition as a trio with Futta in incredibly skimpy swimsuits. And now that she has you to focus her perversions on, get ready for her to shower you in as much sex as she can."

But perhaps her most eye-catching feature is her large and quite literally hypnotic cock. Previously the resident cum witch of a large coven of sand witches, she was exiled when she was discovered to be hypnotizing her sand witch sisters. In hindsight, even she admits she overreached by trying that on the coven’s Sand Mother. It wasn’t the best idea she ever had. But not to worry, she assured you she wouldn't do that to you. No, you're falling in love with her cum all on your own. After all, would someone with a cock that gorgeous lie to you? Aside from her talents in hypnosis and brainwashing, her focus lies mostly in sexualized magic and fertility enhancement. And she does have more time for research and studying now that she’s on her own. Rifling through someone’s memories, shaping bodies, and using her cum to heal are but some of the things her study of spells allows her to do. Granting a 'blessing' of superhuman fertility would be easy enough as an example, though with the way most of her magic involves cum, you’d have to get on your knees for something like that. Which, honestly, she'll likely try to convince you to do anyway. Along with wearing pretty outfits and much, much more for her. Sure, she might not be corrupted and does retain her sect’s hate of demons... but she still earned her position on account of her nymphomania, and long since got used to an entire coven of women all coming to her for sex and breeding. On that note, she only seems more eager if you happen to be male, relishing the novelty and already imagining a possible transformation."

Oh, she did manage to make a lot of damage by sending them into frenzied lust or making them living sex toys, but she does it out of a strange sense of duty, considering that this is what true life and love is all about."

      "description": "Purpled haired and voluptuous, this half elf was abandoned by her mage father and high elf mother when she was a young child, rasing herself alone, subjected to hatred and discrimination by the elves of her home country, and as a result has come up with a rather perverted revenge plan. She decided the best way to fix life for other half elves was to increase their numbers and start up their own nation. To that end she created a new form of magic, hypnosis and brainwashing, to allow her to easily ‘convince’ the stuck up elves that looked down on her to donate their bodies to this endeavor. And if she finds personal enjoyment in seeing them fucked silly by a human that they so looked down upon before… well that’s just a happy coincidence. All she needs now is a human stud to put her plans into action, a stud she found in you. She will provide as many elf fucktoys as you desire, and all she asks in return is for you to impregnate as many of them as possible to give birth to a new generation of half elves. A proactive force in increasing your harem, her hypnosis magic is a bit in the early stages right now, being restricted to only affecting one person per cast and only partially being able to control them through modifying their common sense. She hopes, however, to gain enough experience through rigorous ‘tests’ on other elves to eventually be able to project a large wave that can brainwash a whole kingdom of elves, from the greatest high elves to the lowest elven housewife, into instantly becoming your loyal slaves. As you can guess she is quite enthusiastic about degrading the full elves into being sex slaves, but is also very empathtic to to other half elves like herself or other victims of prejuidice."

They’re unfortunately pretty dumb and not useful for a whole lot besides maybe selling their fluids for a profit. They are, however, either an incredible fuck for those of the Hunter and Police backgrounds or downright willing to catch a bullet to help you get laid if an Alien. The normal small ones have the 100CP and 200CP Alien perks while the large Subspecies has the full perk set. They can also actually breed past their original group size and spread their race around but any Arisughy past the original amount are only Followers and come with nothing but their stock race. You can buy this companion multiple times for more groups."

She is rather talkative despite her archaic speech, easy to talk to in spite of her regal demeanor, and quite accepting of the situation, as she affirms your ritual was actually a marriage one. She accepted it since you were to her preference and she was curious about love. She will quickly grow fonder and fonder of you.

While she can only exert her full power in her true form, she’s still quite strong and versatile when looking younger, often staying literally inside your shadow in case you need her help. While she doesn’t mind you having some ‘affairs’ she’s prone to jealousy when you’re too close to a female she doesn’t like or approve of.

      "description": "\"That's so uncouth, degenerate, brutish, I... Fuuuck~ get that thing inside me.\" Temptation can claim even the most prudish of people, and this lusty kitty is no different. This tall and curvaceous Black Panther is a rather well off politician, who had made her opinion on the debauchery of this island quite clear. She despised it, and wished to pass legislation that would damage and eventually shut down High Tail Hall and all places similar to it. However, as she had never been to the island, she decided to visit, in the certainty that all of her suspicions and biases could be proven. Of course, she wasn't visiting this island completely on a whim. She had a plan, a long game she intended to continue playing even after she passes away. The other board members were surprised by her extremely unorthadox plan, but trusted her judgement. What was her plan you may ask? Well it's simple. Nobody lives forever, and one woman cannot change the minds of entire countries all on her own, especially not when she's up against something as prolific as High Tail Hall. So, what better way to spread her ideals than to get knocked up and spread her agenda through generations? Of course, this plan did meet some backlash from her fellow moral guardians, and yet she was undeterred. She needed a suitable candidate to get her gravid however, and while she despised that little resort she knew it'd be the best place to find somebody with good genes to add to her bloodline. It'd be almost poetic, wouldn't it? The very fruits of that degenerate little island, resulting in its inevitable downfall at the paws of her very own offspring. The very thought of it warmed her heart. All she had to do was go in, find a suitable horny idiot, get knocked up, and the rest would solve itself with her oh so subtle guidance. She certainly had enough control over her urges to not fall into the utter depravity that was High Tail Hall, back straight and nose turned up high. She almost took pleasure in turning down the over eager islanders. Then she met you. What was once a condescending, up-tight politician who preached that rampant lewdness was a danger to society, had her icy exterior melt away to reveal the lusty whore beneath the surface after one evening with you. At first she’d barely even look at you past that upturned snout of hers, now she can’t keep her hands off you if she tried. A dry wit once used to admonish and degrade those she considered degenerate was now turned to getting your pants off as fast as possible, her charisma enough to build an entire political party used to turn those who once followed her prudish ways into open-minded and lustful people. No longer the repressed and prudish, she'll start to wear less and less, showing off more and more fur with an almost voracious freedom in her willingness to embrace her body. Her tall, curvaceous form that was once hidden behind those stuffy suits that covered far too much is that of a true bombshell finally exploding out of her shell. Where once she was ashamed of her big fat kitty titties, now she can't imagine not feeling the wind against the fur of her breasts."

      "description": "\"Ya know, the Gym's always more fun with a friend. How 'bout I spot for ya?\" Oh yeah, it's the man of the hour, six foot four, packed with lean muscle, and an oh so dazzling smile. Known around the globe as one of the greatest heels in wrestling history, suave, witty, and merciless on the mic, and sure as hell able to throw down with the best of the best in the ring. Everyone loves to hate him, men want to be him, women(and quite a few men) want him, this grey wolf is a natural threat in the ring. Egos and bodies leave bruised, battered, and humiliated if he gets his way, and maybe he'll steal their girlfriend in the process. A true star in the ring, pure charisma in every inch of his body. So, you may ask, \"why the hell is he being so nice to me?\" Well you see, that stuff is all kayfabe. He plays a convincing heel, really convincing in fact, but outside of the ring you'd barely even recognize him! He's polite, exciteable, and naturally just seems to enjoy hanging out with people in the gym, laughing and having a good time. Matter of fact, he spends most of his time in the gym, not just working out for himself but helping others on their journey to the body they truly want. Despite being both in body and mind a bit of a Himbo, he's extremely knowledgeable about the body, what it can and can't handle, what does and does not encourage the gains a person wants, and what diet is best for an individual. He's a savant when it comes to anything involving improving the body, and should you follow his directions you'll get the body you want, guaranteed. However, what's most important is why he even comes to High Tail Hall. For him, it's a place where he can be himself, the happy and upbeat wolf you see around the resort is in stark contrast to the bad boy you see in the ring. In the ring he has to be mean, ruthless, fearless, the big bad wolf that takes what he wants when he wants, but in the bubble of High Tail Hall he doesn't need to play up a character. Don't get it twisted however, he LOVES his job, it was his biggest dream since he was a kid to be one of the greatest wrestlers to ever grace the ring. In fact he might just let out a little bit of a brag here and there about just how good he is in the ring, ya know, to get you interested. Did I mention he likes you? He really likes you, like a lot. Something about you just draws him in and he can't get enough. He might just try and seduce you, but since playing up a character is something he saves for the ring, he's gonna try it the natural way. Besides, why would he want you to love the character rather than the man behind it? That isn't to say he wouldn't enjoy playing up a character in the bedroom. Should you ask, he would be oh so ready to bring out the big bad wolf for a tasty little morsel like yourself. He's got thirteen inches of dick to sling around and he's definitely not shy about showing it off, and if ass is more your style he can wring you dry with that perfectly sculpted musclebound bubble butt he's got back there. Oh, and if you show any interest in actually becoming a wrestler yourself, oh boy, you better prepare yourself. This big boy is an exciteable puppy when it comes to his dream job, and for somebody he likes, dare I say loves, to take an interest in joining him in his favorite thing ever is like injecting caffeine into a squirrel. He'll go out of his way to teach you everything, from how to sell a hit, building up that charisma on the mic, and even how to build your own style from the ground up, something that is completely unique to you! You have no idea how happy he'd be for you to be the baby face to his heel. If you're really serious about it, he'll go to every show you're at. Every indie wrestling promotion, every side hustle, he'll be there to cheer YOU on, because he can see your potential, and even if it ain't much he can drag potential you didn't even know you had out of you. Once you reach the big leagues, the ring with the eyes of the whole world on you, he's not gonna hold back on you, he'll give you everything he's got, every verbal jab on the mic, every badass crowd pleasing move, all of the star power he can muster, because he knows you can handle it. And once it's over, the crowd goes home, and the cameras turn off? Oh man, the after show sex is gonna be fucking amazing."

He's a total pushover, he does what he's told, when he's told, never voicing a single complaint nor moving to stop anything anybody does to him. You could shove your fingers in his holes in public and he'll do nothing but try and stifle his moans, not even attempting to stop you in the slightest. Call him a whore, spank his ass, drop ten pounds of musky cock on his face, he won't stop you. In fact, he loves it. He's a college student, and it wouldn't be too far off to say he only enrolled to get fucked silly at parties, and besides, why else would he spend his break at High Tail Hall? It's not like he doesn't ask for it, with how he's practically hypnotized by the sight of a heavy, thick, flaccid cock swaying back and forth in front of his eyes, or how his back instinctively arches when your hand touches his lower back. He could spend days just shoving his sensitive nose into a big hunky male's nutsack and huff it all day, everyday. As far as he's concerned, he belongs to you now, The meaner you are to him, the more it gets him off. Treat him like a cumrag, sit on his face, call him as many raunchy insults as you can while you make drink a dog bowl filled with cum for dinner, he'll cum hands free from the sheer powerlessness he feels, unless you order him not to cum that is. He also loves your scent, and can't get enough of it. Work out for an hour or so and let him sniff you, his tail will be wagging so fast it'll look like he's about to start flying. Of course that doesn't mean he won't dislike it if you show him a bit of love and affection from time to time of course. Give him some genuinely loving aftercare after you completely and utterly ruin him and he will without a doubt be your bitch, period. He will worship the ground you walk on, beg for you to step on him and call him your useless little fucktoy, whereas before he'd simply just let you do that, now he's fucking begging for it. He'll fuck who you tell him to, he'll cum when he's allowed to. He's your bitch, do whatever you want with him."

His parents gave him damn near everything he ever wanted, expensive clothes, expensive jewelry, a cute car, his mom even got him that buttplug he wanted when he was old enough for it. The little brat has practically never heard somebody say the word \"No\" to him in his entire life. At about 5'3\", he's not the tallest otter around, but he makes up for it with his slender form, beautiful curves, and plush perky rear. He's no slouch up front either, with a rather hefty cock of about ten inches, his preference for the tiniest booty shorts really showing off his beauty front and back. His midriff exposed at nearly all times, a pink lollipop held softly between even softer lips, a sultry glint in his eye and a smug lustful grin upon his face. He's flexible, fuckable, and ready for you to ravage him on the way to the mall with your credit card in his purse. The boy is a slutty little brat, plain and simple. He hates not getting what he wants, almost never says please, and thinks if he shakes his rump around just enough he can get a guy to buy him those cute little panties that say \"Fuck Toy\" on them. The worst part is he's pretty much always right about this, getting almost everything he could ever want with a kiss, a lapdance, maybe a sucked cock here or there. It's no wonder the spoiled slut is so, well, spoiled. Or at least he was, until he met you. Something popped in that little brain of his the second you told him \"No.\" It was as if he had a factory reset in his little mind at the mere idea that somebody would dare tell his bratty little ass no, to not demand, but command respect from him. Not only did this just not compute in his cute little head, it also seemed to make him insanely horny for you. For the first time in many years, he didn't want to fuck for an ulterior tangible motive, he just wanted to be held, to be dominated, to be told what to do. Of course, this doesn't make him less bratty, in fact he may be even more of a brat now just to get you to put him in his place. He's going to pretend he doesn't like being your little bitch, but the second you've got him on his back his words will go from \"Fuck you\" to \"Fuck me daddy!\""

The perfect sub, the cutest rabbit, the most loving and innocent looking lagomorph you ever did see. All of these accolades are well earned by this little bunny. His fluffy white fur and innocent sparkling blue eyes brought him many admirers back home in the city, where he is most often seen wearing a cute little sundress that rides up just high enough to give you a perfect view of that cute little powderpuff tail while he's watering his lovely little flowers. Speaking of flowers, he runs a tiny yet beautiful little flower shop on the corner, just as radiant and inviting as himself. With a voice as soft as the flower petals he nurtures, the femboi bunny would do his best to make you feel at home, bringing you tea and some pleasant conversation. His legs crossed, accentuating his slender legs, curvy hips, and cute pink little panties. His cute little giggles and soft gaze, that soft, round, pinchable bottom right below that twitchy exciteable powderpuff tail as he reaches down to get that piping hot apple pie out of the oven. Such wholesome perfection right before your eyes, just begging to be taken. Which makes one wonder, how does such a person get involved with High Tail Hall of all places? Well it's surprisingly simple. He's a total buttslut. This soft little bunny will do anything to get his cheeks groped and his hole filled, and he's scarily good at getting those he sets his eyes on to indulge his desire for some good old fashioned butt rutting. It's almost hypnotic the way he works his way into someone's pants, there's no aggression, no demands, or even begging. It starts with him innocently talking to you, then complimenting you, asking for permission to simply touch your muscles or give you a nuzzle for good luck, and before you know it he's in your lap snuggling into your chest, cute little bunny butt perched right on your crotch. Once you're at this point all you've got to do is take him, he's yours already, anything you want, he wants. From that point on he'll practically drown you in what some affectionately call sexy cuteness. His cock and balls might as well be vestigial, and he knows it, being less than an inch in length and with balls that could be compared to tiny marbles. He'll shower you in cute lovey-dovey pet names, lovingly encouraging you to glaze his \"Bunny Buns\" with your \"Honey.\" He'll worship your body, he'll wiggle his cute little butt on you until you ravage him and make him yours. He'll cum if you spank him, grope him, kiss him, his cheeks are beyond sensitive, and he loves nothing more than letting somebody just use his stretchy little bunny hole. Taking him with you of course brings his little Flower Shop with him, and he'd be absolutely overjoyed if you took an interest in gardening with him, and if you by any chance decided to propose marriage to this little ray of sunshine, well, let's just say you probably won't be wearing clothes for a while."

A true party girl, this shapely lass has charisma, connections, and a libido that just won’t quit, and she’s putting everything she’s got into getting you all types of laid. Whether it’s guys, gals, or futas, she’ll have them buying YOU drinks all night long. Now, this doesn’t mean she has no interest in you, quite the opposite in fact. If you show any type of interest in getting her into bed she’ll be diving into your crotch like a rocket. That hourglass figure isn’t just for show, and she sure as hell has the skill and the eagerness to keep you coming back for seconds. A wild night is a guarantee with her, especially if you let her drag you to clubs she’s been to in the past. Don’t be surprised if she knows the owner of a brothel and gets you the VIP treatment, or gets you going on a night of adventure that begins with you fucking a friend of hers. Trust me, when it comes to getting you laid, that smug smirk of hers can work wonders. It's a learned skill too, considering her past running with gangs and such. The gang she grew up with were a bunch of hellions, partying, vandalism, all of that mess. They weren't doing anything too bad, never hurt anybody too bad or killed a person, but they were the rowdiest motherfuckers in their city. If you see graffiti somewhere there's a chance her or one of her flings in the gang put it there. She was also the best out of all of them when it came to talking to people, even being able to butter up a cop enough to let her go when she got caught. Almost every connection her gang had was because of her, and the more you hang out with her the more you'll start to run into people who know her. Sure, she's not doing much of that anymore, hell, most of the old gang has gone on to do bigger and better things, like run clubs or bars. Still, that rowdiness of hers never left, it's just put towards more... reproductive uses. Every day is an adventure with her, and she's dying to bring you on each and every one of them. Oh, and fuck you in the back room of a club with about ten of her friends and the owner's wife of course, gotta love that group sex."

      "description": "“Don’t be shy, come give mama a kiss.” Some women were built for motherhood, and none embody this more than this lady right here. This woman is built thick, with breasts that’d look small on a cow, the curviest hips, and an ass so round and bouncy that it’s almost hypnotizing when she walks. She’s a single mother who is currently living in a nice beautiful neighborhood with her three twenty year old daughters, all of whom inherited her midnight black fur and striking blue eyes, while also having some ever so slightly more exaggerated aspects of their mother’s figure. This kind, soft spoken, and motherly woman is well off, with a nice car for each of her daughters and herself, numerous quite revealing designer clothes, and a three story house with the nicest furniture you ever did see. Though don’t be fooled by her soft blue eyes and kind stare, she came to this resort for a reason, and she’s not shy about making it known. She came here to get fucked, bred, knocked the fuck up. Before she set foot on this island, there was always a sense of nymphomania being held back just beneath the service, a horny lonely woman just one step away from snapping. When she finally got off the boat, the whole island could probably hear that last tiny bit of restraint in her shatter. This hooved momma is horny and she wants fuckin meat, and when she found you you looked like a damn fine slab of fuck. She’s unrepentantly horny but no less motherly, and she’s gonna fuckin smother you in her love. She will insist on having you call her mommy during sex, hell even when you’re not fucking she gets off hard on hearing you call her that. If her utter lack of filter when it comes to speaking wasn’t enough, handsy doesn’t even begin to describe horny pent up milf. She can barely keep her hands off you, completely unafraid to just straight up put your head between her massive, sensitive breasts and fondle you at a moment’s notice. She’ll entice you to suck on her tits anytime you look thirsty, and boy oh boy does she make a lot of milk. If you have balls she’ll drain them with a religious fervor, if you have a pussy she’ll eat you out like you’re her last meal. When she met you she wanted you bad, and she wasn’t in the mood to be coy about it like she used to. Now you may ask, what about her three daughters? Well, let’s just say mama’s nymphomania runs in the family. While they aren’t as filled out as their mother, they certainly take after her in many ways. As far as they’re concerned, in the bedroom you’re their new daddy/mommy, and trust me, you better be prepared to hear that name all the time. Oh, did I mention they’re just as baby crazy as their mother?"

      "description": "“You’ve been a bad boy… D-did I say that right?” Some people find that their passions in life don’t exactly line up with their current skill set, and this mouse right here is a prime example of this fact. This mousey little lady has some incredibly wide hips, a modest chest, and the cutest chubby cheeks you ever did see. It’s a wonder how she even got in here, what with her big round glasses, freckled features, jumpy demeanor, and the fact that her room in the resort is FILLED with action figures, mostly from animated series designed to sell toys of giant robots, and commissioned posters of all of her favorite characters. Though, the strangest part about her is that, as far as everybody else knows, she’s a dominatrix, and her outfit certainly matches the description. It’s such a shame that she has no idea how to actually dominate anyone. See, while her family may be a rich conglomerate with enough fingers in everyone’s pies to pretty much never run out of money, and of course that certainly helped, that’s not the reason she managed to become a VIP in High Tail Hall. She managed to get in because she advertised herself as a sultry Dominatrix on the internet in an attempt to get laid, as she had never actually had sex before and wasn’t particularly confident enough to just tell people she was a nerd with social anxiety who wanted somebody to hold at night. In a seriously unlucky series of events, or lucky depending on who you ask, word of her existence spread at High Tail Hall, and it seems like quite a few popular regulars wanted a taste of this “Mysterious Mouse Dominatrix” from the interwebs. Of course, she panicked. She was neither brave enough to tell them she lied, nor was she brave enough to just decline the invitation. With all the work her father’s connections put into making her look good from a PR standpoint, though they didn’t have to do much to make her look good physically, there was no way out of this for her. She’d have to fake it till she makes it, and it turns out no amount of reading could turn a virgin who’d never even kissed someone in her life into the masterful dominatrix she invented on the internet. Luckily, she met you before really talking to anyone else, as there’s only so much acting aloof can do before someone would call her bluff. You easily figured her out, and the fact that you didn’t immediately write her off gave her hope, and a hell of a crush as well. In her eyes, you had everything figured out. You could talk to people, understand people, and had a confidence that she could only dream of, the perfect dominant, at least to her. It was no surprise that she begged you to teach her how to be a proper dom, so that she wouldn’t make herself look like a fool in front of everyone. Normally, just from looking at her you wouldn’t be blamed for writing her off as a lost cause, but if you do decide to help her, she is an incredibly fast learner, and the simple act of giving her the time of day once you learned the truth made her your biggest fan for life. With earnest guidance and some patience, you could have her become the legendary Short-Stack dom she pretended to be, and a loyal friend/lover. Oh, also don’t be surprised if some of her latest commissioned lewd posters look suspiciously like you, I’m sure it’s just a coincidence."

I walked in the front door silly!” This squirrel, holy fuck where do I begin? She’s got big perky tits like two gravity defying balloons, long slender legs to wrap around your waist, a tiny waist, wide hips, and perfectly round bouncy ass built to be fucking plowed. Her fur is nice and shiny, her makeup is perfect and really brings out the slut in her eyes, nails painted pink, pouty lips with cute pink lipstick, and for some reason is wearing pretty platform heels and the sluttiest yet prettiest little outfits you can imagine. Now, you may be wondering “How the hell is she getting makeup out here in Sauria?” or “Where did she get lipstick out here?” or “How did she manage to survive out here when she has one brain cell, and no survival skills whatsoever?” or even “Why does she have a new outfit damn near every time I turn around, and how are they getting sluttier!?” All of these are amazing questions, and the answer is simple! We don’t fucking know! This little piece of fuck-candy is an anomaly, plain and simple. Her luck is utterly ridiculous, able to wander through a Galdon’s den, and either leave unharmed or covered in cum and possibly with a new shirt that says “Cum Dump” on it, there is no middle ground with this girl. Not only that, she’s weirdly capable of getting into places she’s not supposed to be in, without anybody knowing how, or even when she got there. Her weird luck aside, let me tell you about who she was before she got here. She was a stripper, born in a well off family on a space station, who’s only real desire in life was getting fucked. Sucking, fucking, riding, spreading, she’d do it all for the joy of doing it. However, she was obsessed with one thing, getting a sugar daddy of her own. Granted, she didn’t really understand what sugar daddy meant, because she mostly thought it was just “getting a hunk to fuck whenever she wants” and nothing more. Turns out, you’re that Sugar Daddy now. Or Mommy, whichever one you prefer, she can switch it up. Good luck dealing with this, uh, damn she’s pretty much impossible to explain. She doesn’t even know where she gets the lipstick, or the makeup, or countless heels and clothes, one of which probably says “Fuck Doll” in glittery letters. Have fun I guess?"

This foxy lady is a reporter from Corneria, sent on a trip through the stars to report on what’s going on out in the galaxy in corners unknown! Of course, she didn’t expect that to be a part of her job either, as she readily states that she’d rather be reporting on the weather, or anything that didn’t involve getting flung around space in a tin can. Of course, unexpected happenings seem to be a constant in her life, from accidentally stumbling into becoming an underwear model in college, to trying to sign up for a simple tabloid journalism job only to end up doing up close and personal front lines journalism in the farthest reaches of space! You’d think she’d be used to that by now, but she also never enjoyed surprises. Nobody is ready for their engine to make a CLUNK sound and suddenly end up landing in Dinosaur Central! Stuck in a cave for a while with her camera crew, a short and busty Cocker Spaniel who’s bright and perky attitude kept them sane since they crashed, and a grumpy flat-chested tomboy purple feline who’s almost always the one actually holding the camera, our unlucky red vixen at least had some company while she waited til she could call in for pickup. Unfortunately, her boss answered, and lo and behold, his nose caught the scent of opportunity. Instead of sending any real help, he instead told her this would be her next big scoop! A planet filled with Dinosaurs and natives to meet? Why he could already smell the money! Crushed by her boss’s complete disregard for her or her camera crew’s safety, they focused on surviving for now. Around this time was also when she met you, in which we now witness yet another one of her unexpected happenings. You see, she wouldn’t consider herself to be the most, sexually experienced vulpine out there, nor would she consider herself much of a promiscuous lady. Well, turns out she just needed to meet the right person, because one night with you flipped her switch from off to nympho. A day ago she barely even knew what she’d do with a lover if she had one, and with how much of a bombshell she is you’d be surprised how little she knew about sex until you came along, and maybe a little help from her friends, if you let them join you of course. With her perfect hourglass shape, bouncy ass, and bouncier tits, she has a lot for you to play with. She’s inexperienced, and somewhat clumsy when it comes to making love, but she’s more than willing to learn, and you’d be hard pressed to find a more enthusiastic partner. Oh, and don’t be surprised if she asks if she can record your sessions together. If her boss plans to leave her stranded to line his pockets, she’s gonna show everyone what it’s like to get down and dirty in the wild, on her boss’s dime and on live TV!"

A whisper in the ear and their dicks practically override their brains, any and all pride thrown aside just to get a taste of that sweet, juicy cunt between her legs. This Sharpclaw waitress is all that and more, a temptress with legs for miles and a body built for your pleasure. Notice I said “your” pleasure, because while she has all the makings of a dominant temptress, any perceived dominance couldn’t be anything more than a complete fabrication. This long legged Sharpclaw lass is the very definition of submission. You’d be hard pressed to find a woman so pliable to your whims and worshipful of your entire being anywhere else. This slender seductress is usually found either serving tables in the tavern or putting on a salacious show in the local hot springs, bent over and willing, beckoning you with her every breath into her lustful suffocating embrace. Her alluring dark green scales shimmering in the darkness, begging for her ass to be groped, and tits kneaded. Her complete and utter submission is not an act, though one would be wise to think it so, she has all the makings of a true femme fatal after all. No, her ability to wrap a male in her web of lustful heat is simply for getting them to dump load after sticky load of cum into her ready and waiting womb, eyes glazed over as she rocks her hips to a lustful beat only she can hear. Your pleasure is her pleasure, mouth waiting and willing to suck the life from you, your moans making her moan louder, eyes rolled back as she lets her all consuming lust for cock take her away to dream land."

Now, come drain my balls.” The Sharpclaw Warriors, while strong, do have a need for tools like any other civilized species, and this scaly behemoth of a male is his tribe’s main supplier. Weapons, armor, tools, if there is a need he can easily provide them in spades. This somewhat reclusive Sharpclaw is simply known as Papa to his tribe, and for many that’s not just a nickname. With a cock longer than his arm and with balls fatter than watermelons, this bitchbreaker right here is responsible for fathering a hell of a lot of the tribe. Oh, and don’t let his gut fool you, he’s strong as a Galdon and fucks like one too! While he is known for being a damn good breeder, what he’s mostly known for is his strange wisdom. It’s not too uncommon for you to see a Sharpclaw warrior or maiden come to his hut asking for advice or a shoulder to lean on, and he always provides. Some guards might tell you he taught them how to use a staff, or consoled them when their crops died and they couldn’t figure out why, or maybe even offered a helping claw when they were horny and everyone was busy. However, let it not be said that he may not ask for something in return. The old bag of scales has two even bigger bags of scales underneath him that are never lacking in seed. He gets blue balled easily, and with such virile balls the price some gladly pay is to help drain that sack until he’s completely satisfied, and you’re likely to be bathing in cum by the time he’s even close to that point. Don’t be surprised to see a Sharpclaw maiden or a slave or two sucking him off while he’s working at the forge, and should you impress him enough you might just end up being his personal cum receptacle. He’d certainly love it if you took an interest in his work in-between getting him off, and will certainly offer great wisdom to you in exchange, though that wisdom is certainly going to be hidden beneath innuendo and sex I’m sure. The Wack On, Wack Off technique might sound completely stupid, but surprisingly it might help you against a rampaging beast one of these days."

Or at least this spunky young Sharpclaw is. A Hunter for his tribe that takes to every hunt with a cocky grin and undeniable skill with his spear(in more ways than one) he’s the future of his tribe, or so he says. You’ll always find him celebrating a hunt in the tavern, telling the tale of how he brought a beast down with his wit and guile, while possibly fucking the nearest willing and wet hole he can find. Of course, these conversations always tend to end up drifting to his dream of seeing the stars, fucking one of those “Sky People” he’s heard so much about. This is usually met with exasperated sighs and laughter, as nobody takes his dreams seriously, at all. They let him talk about it though, even if they’d rather he shut up and get back to fucking the waitress. If you’re a crash survivor, you’re gonna find this out first hand. When he approaches you, you might expect the slim yet muscular young man to just fuck you where you stand, with that massive throbbing pillar of a cock that is actually longer than his Spear, but you’d be wrong. He actually just wants you to show him your ship, and tell him all about what space is like. It’s adorable the way this big mass of pure male will practically beg you to tell him how ships work, or what your home is like, and the pure glee in his eyes when you say the word space station. I speak no falsehoods when I say he will fuck you anyway you want if you promise to tell him about space travel. He’ll even suck you off if you’re male, though even in a submissive position a Sharpclaw male tends to end up the dominant partner. He’s a young hopeful guy with a heart of gold and a big dream to see the stars, maybe you can help him with that?"

She’s seen and done things even the most wild of mavericks wouldn’t believe, and if you ask she’s got a hell of a lot of war stories to tell about her time in the pilot seat, some funny, some downright traumatic. Despite her colorful military past she’s got the look of a kindly older woman with a bouncy rear, a jiggly bust you could use as a table, and a kind expression that’d make an angel look like a devil in comparison. Of course a gal as skilled with an Arwing as her wouldn’t be caught dead crashing in the middle of nowhere. In fact, she didn’t crash at all! Turns out she heard about the planet in passing, and being the adventurous little bunny she is she decided to pay it a little visit. Oh, and don’t think she’s clueless about what really goes on out here, she knew exactly what she was signing up for by coming to this planet, and boy is she not leaving until she gets exactly what was promised to her. See, she’s getting up there in years, and as far as she’s concerned she’s done waiting around for Mr. Right to show up. She’s got a body built for breeding and she swears on her life she’s gonna pop out ten burrow’s worth of little hares before she hits the age of sixty dammit. So when she heard that there’s a planet full of virile studs just waiting to knock up any fertile female they can get their hands on, she had already hopped into her Arwing and took off."

Sadly, these \"champions\" are more like sacrifices sold out by the village elders. Whenever they are sent through, unarmed and unarmored, a demon will already be waiting to pick them up. This year, however, the village elders chose poorly. Disoriented by the portal’s lustful energies, and drugged with lust draft, this latest champion managed to resist and pummel the imp that had been waiting for them into fleeing. Instead of a sacrificial lamb, a wolf has been sent through the portal this year. And then they met you. Fresh from the portal into Mareth, they know nothing of this world beyond the danger the demons could pose to their own village. Underequipped and with little prior training, they’ll have to work their way up to pose any credible threat to the demons. It’s up to you whether you want to help them with that or just want to corrupt them yourself. Either way, they do have one advantage over other human youths. They’re just bursting at the seams with potential, learning and adapting at a ridiculous rate. Given the chance, they could become a warrior powerful enough to tear down the demons’ strongholds before the next champion is even sent through. Or take to other pursuits with similar ease, particularly if you decided to train them into a perfect pet for your own purposes… They might even end up providing the key to allow demons to have children other than imps, if taken by one? If you’d prefer a bit more focus to their unbound talent, you could purchase perks and items for them with a standard budget of 600cp. While they won’t start with these, their talent will be focused on whatever you picked for them. This guarantees they’ll pick those purchases up pretty quickly and means they’ll have an even easier time developing along similar lines, at the cost of somewhat lowering their affinity for any other paths."

And if you happen to be fully female or even neuter? Don't worry, she has potions for that! And to increase virility, stamina, libido, and fertility. That's not even getting into the variety of aphrodisiacs she can make, all so you can spawn a sea of green shortstacks together. Pretty please? She'll teach her daughters (and she will have her daughters) to love you unconditionally too, wanting to give you lots of beautiful sluts to fuck. But if you’d prefer not to, she’ll be willing to help coach them in accepting you don’t want to breed them as well. It might be a somewhat hard sell, considering goblin instincts. Either way, she will take on her daughters as assistant alchemists and get a big operation running once their numbers start getting large enough. They could potentially even start making alchemical concoctions not specifically geared to help you put more babies into her, if you really wanted them to do so (and maybe if you bribed her by knocking her up again in return). She actually is a rather brilliant alchemist, aside from the goblin fixation on pregnancy, and her daughters inherit enough of that talent to greatly speed production, if not devise new concoctions themselves. All her daughters will count as followers, coming with their mother's companion slot. They don’t gain any perks from their mother being imported, but do gain the benefits of hereditary abilities if she gains any from an import."

She’s at least part cow, with upraised horns and a long flicking tail, as well as obviously mountainous and egregiously supple breasts, which leak milk when she wishes them to. Aside from her brute strength, she received the training of an amazon princess before she ever entered Mareth, in exile for reasons she never deigns to clarify. Whatever her reasons may be, she has since put her skill to good use by cutting down her opponents with a massive, deadly-looking axe too heavy and too large for most people to wield properly. Largely eschewing armor in favor of more mobile barbarian-like outfits or a variety of golden accessories and jewelry, she’s still incredibly durable on her own. A trait that seems to be carried in her milk as well, since drinking it restores wounds taken, though it does leave one somewhat aroused and more vulnerable to seduction. The latter might be intentional on her part, if it isn’t simply a byproduct of the transformatives she took to gain her cow-like traits. She does, after all, also have a fondness for golden, honey-based lipstick similar to that used by the harpies of the high mountains. Then again, perhaps the aphrodisiac drug-laced lipstick is merely one part of ploy to dominate the minotaurs she’s declared herself queen over. The minotaurs themselves value strength and, left to her own devices, she might actually manage to unite some tribes into her own makeshift kingdom. For the moment though, she's just looking to join up with a fellow dimensional traveller. Maybe if you proved your strength she'd be interested in creating a powerful new race together."

As all hellhounds, he’s comfortable both walking on two legs for normal life, and running on all fours when out hunting. While hellhounds are most known for their ability to breath corrupt red hellfires that arouse instead of burn their prey, they also possess the ability to link their minds to powerful corrupted beings, most notably the hellhound master responsible for the creation of these creatures. Without this connection, hellhounds are little more than feral beasts, but with it they can draw on their master’s mind to think and often gain the power to speak. This hound’s mental connection latched onto your mind instead, allowing you to guide his thoughts and control his consciousness to a degree. Calling him to you from a considerable distance and speaking with him telepathically are the least of the powers this link grants, with speech granted to him being a close second, and the other abilities he, and you, might gain from this symbiosis being determined by the sharpness of your own mind. Still, even beyond the absolute obedience enforced by this bond, he is eager to be helpful to you in gratitude for helping clear his head. Primarily by hunting for you or helping you hunt, to be fair, but drawing on your mind does mean that he’s likely to pick up some of your own peculiarities and tastes over time. Though he’s still more likely to beg you to go on a walk through the mountains than to join you in arcane research. Even so, sharing some of your own skills with him through your connection certainly isn’t out of the question, allowing him to join you in your tasks with similar expertise when needed."

She is intended to serve as your personal attendant, but the state of this land means she could be either corrupted or pure. Starting as a leafy green shoot springing up from the soil near whatever home you have here, she will grow quickly to become a beautiful flower, then a small tree, and finally a mighty ancient-looking tree as the top half of a humanoid form emerges to greet you. Should she be corrupted, the leaves of her tree will have their undersides covered in pulsing purple veins, tentacles will hide within the foliage, and her flower will look obscene and serve as a pussy. Her humanoid form will have gnarled, branch-like horns and black sclera to go with her pale jade skin and dark green hair, resembling a succubus in green. If she is still pure despite the corrupted soil she sprang forth from, every one of her leaves will instead be particularly vibrant, bright green with life and color. The flowers growing from her will be similarly vibrant, filling the air around with sweet, fresh scents as she very slowly beats back the corruption surrounding her tree. Her dryad form will be lither, lacking the horns, and her eyes will be radiant with intelligence, compassion, and warmth. Almost the spitting image of her mother, excepting their colorations. Either way, she is a powerful, direct offshoot of Marae, with bark as strong as any armor and magic empowered by the very land itself. There are still limits to her power though, as her plant-based magic is not nearly as mighty as her mother’s and she won’t be able to leave her tree for the first few years. Despite this, her status as a demigoddess means she might be a little prideful, especially if she's corrupted. But surely you can deal with that?"

Certainly, a lot of demons immediately lost themselves in the ensuing debauchery, but not everyone focused entirely on sex. A savant of black magic, the loss of this bespectacled omnibus’ soul seemingly changed little more than her now gorgeous body. Still as reclusive and focused on the art of black magic as she was before her eager dive into corruption, she’s kept herself secluded from demonic society ever since the fall of their kingdom. The heightened libido and arcane power of her demonic body has only fueled her drive towards self-improvement, ever trying to make herself better, stronger, faster. Normally she’d have told you to get off her lawn like the demons who tried, but she took an interest in you. And if her libido might be calling the shots on that decision a bit more than she pretends, well, that just means more emotion to fuel her spellcraft with, no? Nevermind that she has decades of sexual frustration just waiting to burst free. She’d never do something as undignified as asking her fellow demons for help with that, and hasn't had the time to find herself a fucktoy otherwise. Besides, even with the loss of her conscience, the idea of capturing a slave and forcing them into it seemed… unappealing. It’s not nearly as fun if they don’t want to be there, after all. But if you decide to put on that collar she conspicuously leaves laying around her workshop… Well, that’s another matter. She’d be happier than an incubus at a convent, and you'd quickly find that her talent for domination is perhaps even greater than that for the arcane arts. But if you’re not interested in indulging her craving, she’d also be willing to aid you with her impressive array of magic in return for the chance to examine you or otherwise further her research."

The fact that you were the first friendly person he met after fleeing from a demonic horde might explain why he’s so protective of you, worrying about your safety whenever you leave whatever home you’ve got. His time wandering and fighting demons alone has taught him much, hardening him against the rigors of this world. His wiry, mousey body might not be a match for a Minotaur in a straight fight, no matter how well-trained, but he's sturdier than you'd expect and has mastered some tricks of white magic to even the playing field. One of those tricks is the ability to shield someone with his magic, taking any damage they would suffer in their place. Something he insists on protecting you with whenever the two of you end up in a fight. Even outside of battle, he tends to fuss over you, making sure you’re comfortable and well-protected at all times. Whether that’s making sure you’re dressed appropriately for the (non-existent) weather, keeping your armor in good condition, or even insisting on putting his skills to work cooking a healthy dinner for you when you get back. If you need anything, he’s there for you. And if you’re going out into the wastes, he’ll insist he should come along, even if you can clearly handle yourself. He just wants you to stay safe. Partly out of perhaps justified paranoia and protectivess, and partly because of an incredibly poorly-hidden crush. It would be incredibly easy to tease him with that, the mouse already gets flustered when the mere idea of romance comes up, but at the same time he’d like nothing more than to have his affection reciprocated."

You might also note small horns peeking out. Aside from their talent at shapeshifting and imitation, they’re actually pretty powerful, though the infatuation with you means they’re bending all their demonic magic to the purpose of imitating your own abilities and even gear. Depending on the specifics and how much this taxes her, these mirrored approximations might be more or less accurate. Needless to say, their fascination is not just limited to your look, and they'll even try to style their actions and personality after yourself. Their soulless lack of a conscience is not much of an obstacle to that, the drive to resemble you taking its place. On the other hand, the admiration for you is itself a bigger problem. They’ll often end up breaking character in their excitement to cheer you on or squeal at something you did or said. No matter how much they try to copy you, they’re still just overly excited to follow your lead and fangirl all over you. Another thing to consider is that your double is not as used to your body as you are, which leaves them incredibly easy for you to take advantage of. A benefit of knowing all their sensitive spots better than they do, and a consequence of them never quite growing used to the foreign senses copied from you. Maybe also a bit of that fangirl devotion."

      "description": "One of the big benefits of demonhood is the magical power gained from the transformation, and the ability to gain further power by consuming lethicite. Even such puny and weak creatures as imps naturally have an affinity for the use of black magic. Yet for many of the surviving mortal mages, increased power isn't worth going through mind breaking ecstacy and losing their soul. Despite this though, there might be another way for you to access the arcane power of demons, without joining them yourself. The key lies with this particular demon, by all appearances a puny and unremarkable creature. A short, little ball of unrestrained lust and ego, primarily distinguished by the ease with which you captured it. Perhaps an imp spawned by a greater demon, or bratty little succubus that might’ve once been a goblin or some such. If they ever had a soul, they definitely weren’t able to keep a hold of their lethicite. Still, they have relatively strong magic compared to most mortals and could conceivably grow in power… if you allowed it. An enchanted leather collar with an one-way snap mechanism worn around their neck both signifies their new station as your personal (sex?) slave, and simultaneously acts as a conduit for you to siphon from their magical ability and direct it into your own spells. There are of course some side effects to this process. If you were to continually draw on this to maintain a large, constant ward for example, it would drain your new familiar’s energy and vitality until you stopped doing so. On a more interesting (for them) note, drawing on their magic for black magic is almost guaranteed to backfire as it interrupts the flow of power in their body. While it certainly doesn’t prevent you from casting such spells, it does mean they will end up flooding with magical arousal with every black magic spell you cast."

After you build one, it disappeared the next day, leaving nothing but jolly laughter and jingling bells in the distance… and a pale blue shape right where it used to stand. Mostly humanoid and matching the gender of the snowman you build, with literally snow-white hair, glittering skin covered in frost, and either coal black or shining, vibrant purple eyes. As they excitedly explain, they’re an ice spirit, explaining the cold of their body and their ability to call forth small flurries of fresh snow. When winter rolls around, and snow falls, they get sent out to random people around the world. It’s their duty to help out in any way... especially sexually. This being their first time out, you’re now their first master or mistress. Not native to Mareth itself, they come from a hidden realm of icy cliffs, perpetual cold, and an immense factory making toys. They will be forced to return there when the weather heats back up again, their frosty body melting away as the winter season ends. Luckily, your personal ice spirit enjoys their time with you enough to request for them to be sent back to you each year. Perhaps in a colder climate, or if you had some other way of keeping them cool, they could stay with you for longer than a few months each year."

Nowadays she’s mostly displeased at the loss of strength accompanying her changed body. It’s hard to punch someone while your arms are quite literally goop, and it makes fighting or adventuring effectively very difficult. She finally got a lucky break when she ran into you, suggesting you team up as an adventuring duo. Not just fighting together, but wearing her (and her plate) as armor, keeping you snug and safe within her wet and squishy embrace. Being squashed flat against the inside of her armor doesn’t bother her a bit and this way any bits of you not protected by the armor, mostly your joints, are securely clad in squishy goo. The goo’s even got healing properties, which can be taken full advantage of with the close contact involved in this arrangement. Further, with the way she’s encased your loins, she would also be able to provide mid-battle… relief, if necessary. She does survive on such fluids now. If you think you’ve got something better than a suit of heavy plate mail, you can also bring in a suit of your own for her to occupy. Even if there’s no gaps where she would shield parts of you in whatever you bring in, having a goo-girl to serve as a squishy undersuit beneath the armor still helps a lot with absorbing the blunt force of any blows you take."

As her mate, you also share a mental connection allowing both of you to pass thoughts and memories between each other. Giving you a rudimentary (at best) awareness of each other most of the time, this link can be intensified to its full potential with a kiss in very intimate situations or when under extreme stress, most notably during sex. A very similar kind of bond naturally connects her with her children, allowing her to direct the workers and allowing them to send specific feelings back to her when they encounter unusual situations. Because her race only ever produces a few female eggs, the vast majority of these children will be male warriors and workers helping to mine deeper into the ground, with any eventual daughters destined to one day depart and start their own colonies.

As a human then somewhere in the past you established a deep bond with Claudia, replacing Alexis as the person she developed a huge crush on. Assuming you can save her from Geldro’s clutches she’d gladly go on a multiversal journey with you. A strong and noble defender of the weak, she believes it's her mission to protect the innocents of the multiverse against the monsters that seek to harm them. Of course she’s still from a hentai world, so you’ll find that if you ever bed her she is very vulnerable to pleasure, so have fun with that. Of course, as an orc the Claudia you receive is a bit...different. Rather than the noble knightess it seems that you have been ‘bonded’ with a Claudia from another world, one in which an alternative version of you thoroughly broke her until she became your loyal and adoring slave. Now preferring the name Erona, she has tracked the ‘you’ of this world down. How she ended up in this world is a mystery, even to her, but that doesn’t change the fact that her deepest desire is to be your loyal slutty pig. Luckily, she has fought and killed plenty of knights who sought to kill her and her beloved, so her skills have mostly remained undegraded despite her extreme focus on sex."

No, she won’t tell you which one- but it’s probably not the one you’re thinking of. She’s become quite jaded over the years, dealing with all sorts of fucked up stuff even when monsters and aliens aren’t involved, and she’s quite good at hiding her emotions under a stony facade as a result. Although, that’s just given her a reputation for being a hard-ass. Something that, in turn, has made it hard for her to form genuine connections- even with her fellow agents. Her increasing desperation for physical intimacy has led her down some very strange rabbit-holes over the years, though she claims these encounters to be ‘classified’. Her blood may well be made entirely of coffee at this point. Agent Neon has the Operative Origin.

And he doesn’t want her picking up his bad habits, so he’s starting to think about abandoning this whole “pirate” business."

Mecha designers responded by making a smaller mech—and then making it a girl, for some reason. A biomechanical being that’s honestly more of a robotic suit of mobile armor than a mecha, she has little experience with life or emotions in general. She is capable of snap reactions in combat, but a lack of understanding of social cues makes her come off as slow when interacting with others, although her test scores in academics are excellent. Her body can open up to accept a “pilot”—and incredibly intimate experience for her—but the pilot can’t actually do much, because her understanding of her own systems, physical abilities, and instant reflexes all put her far beyond what a human can accomplish, making it a pretty useless feature… for combat, at least"

So in order to make sure you do whatever you end up doing during your time in NSola 7 they decided to send help in the form of a special protector with one primary objective programmed deeply into its code: SERVE AND PROTECT THE JUMPER. And luckily, they find you right around when your “journey” starts, with them appearing in front of you via a sphere of visible Aether and electricity that carved out its surroundings and leaving them red-hot.

This skill set goes well with her special and unique construction as her body is a lot tougher, with even her skin behaving like Kevlar with no loss of softness or flexibility, along with having the strength to dent metal, pry open doors, and easily beat Creepers to death. And to round all this out, she comes equipped with the pistol, magnum, and SMG from Haydee 1 along with a night vision visor, respirator, and vest that protects against bullets, stabs, and slashes."

Thus she trained extremely hard and barely got accepted into the club to make ends meet. Making her a very kind and outgoing girl with a bright smile and a shoulder to lend to anyone feeling down. Or at least she tries. Despite her attitude, she has basically zero friends and is low key looked down upon, even with the other club members, mostly because she's a parentless peasant with no tits and a fat ass, has next to no spiritual power, her hair is too blonde, also they can see her desperation to feel useful by making others happy. She's actually a pretty good cook and decent at playing the drums. Most likely to fall in love with her rapist just because it makes her feel wanted and useful."

After being kicked out of the exorcism club because of her lack of spiritual power and shoddy swordsmanship that would have her defeated by a literal normal dude with no weapons or fight experience, she became quite jaded and scornful. A woman that rebels on envy, spite and hate... mostly used to fuel her extraordinary talent at chemistry. Drugs? She can make spiritual drugs that make exorcist girls into frenzied bimbos that crave dick like air. Need more spiritual power? She can make simple drinks that increase it several times over, although with side effects if she doesn't like the one purchasing them. As a backup she's invaluable and only offset by her jealous, spiteful, and obsessive nature. If you need someone to make junk into useful concoctions, she's your girl."

Instead of letting loose the screeches and wails of the damned and tortured, they will moan and groan in pleasure as your ‘army’ quickly turns into an orgy. Let’s see a Belmont fight through that without at least getting an erection. Sadly, the problem with ghosts is their lack of physical form, and so this also comes with a lesser succubus as their commanding officer of sorts, in case you want someone you can actually enjoy the new ambiance with."

However instead of being adopted by Claudius and eventually fated to go down that path that lead to her death, this version of Nero never became in control of Rome. Instead she had run away from an early age, fighting for her life on the streets. Still she managed to make a great mark as an artist, becoming under a false name one of the greatest Rome would ever see. A life that she herself was happy to lead. The path to get this fame and applause and the opportunities for such was paved with prostitution, a practice she wasn't willing to give up even when she sold out arenas with her songs.

A pretty ridiculous claim, except for her super strength, power to fly, and the lasers she can shoot from her eyes, along with a whole host of other abilities. Those powers only get stronger the more sunlight touches her skin, she says…but it seems like the true source of her power is the lustful thoughts that others have towards her, whether it be the civilians she protects or the villains she fights against, an inverted form of Power of Lust that she takes full advantage of."

While she doesn’t have any true showing of her own personal strength it's safe to assume that similarly to Maht’ava she’s a user of dark and fire magic, though to a much higher degree due to being allowed to draw upon larger amounts of the Undying King’s energy. And similarly to Maht’ava she has her own monstrous form to transform into, which grants her a scream loud enough to deal damage and a regenerative ability which heals her along with increasing her defenses against both physical and magical damage. Another similarity is that the form also follows the same rule of needing to be able to feed her undying/necromancy energy so she can turn into it more often. With her by your side be prepared for her to shower you with praise and worshipful adoration, as well as trying to get those that follow you to do the same."

But maybe something special about you has stirred the gods and, with a small fee of 100 CP, they’ll decide to assign her as your personal bodyguard. While her time spent guarding the Temple of Light hasn't allowed her to show off her combat abilities, being a direct creation of the gods along with her own assertion if and when the Undying King was imprisoned, she should be able to stand a chance against the Undying King. This mainly comes from her increased physical capabilities and the powerful light magic she can cast and infuse into her strikes. Though that time stuck in the temple also hasn’t allowed her to develop her own personality separate from her duties so be a dear and help her “loosen” up a bit and get her to enjoy life."

After fleeing her doomed homeland as a baby and being raised by her adoptive human parents, she set out on what seemed like a normal adventure at the city of Kaupun'ki. But that all quickly escalated, with her ending up besting the Undying King and being crowned as a world wide hero. And with a small fee of 100 CP she can come and join you on your future adventures, ready to apply her heroics to those who need them. As Paccsu’s would be savior Namu is a jack of all trades with a number of skills under her belt, but the one thing she excels at is fighting which is due in part to her father who used to be a famous hero. To that end she is skilled in the use of both swords and daggers along with various different kinds of shields both large and small with her also having some general purpose and sword based techniques in the form of using her ass as a stunning strike, launching a million cuts in a second, and convening with mother nature to boost her resistance to elemental magic. But the true element that makes Namu special, and what helped her take down the Undying King, is the infusion of power done to her as a baby as the result of a last ditch effort of the Muh’kean people to stop the Undying King, granting her two major boons. The first, is that she is a master at using magic, being able to easily learn and use even the most complicated spells along with a deep reserve of magical energy. And the second, is that she somehow has a dragon elemental inside of her which grants her increased physical capabilities as well as access to various abilities such as magical elemental slashes, a buff to restore the health and magic of allies, and a four strike combo that channels an ancient dragon. While it can be hard to pin down her exact personality, Namu is an empathetic and good person at heart and while the sheer amount of raviging she goes through may say otherwise, she enjoys sex and being lewd, just on her own terms."

Formerly a human who was one of the countless slain and then raised by the Undying King’s hordes, she is one of the only ones to who managed to break free from his control through the use of “nefarious” magic. This was more than likely Chaos magic as her undying energy head shares the same hue as the magic used by the undead bandits near the city who’ve been enhanced with Chaos magic. Besides severing the Undying King’s control and keeping her skin a shade of brown rather than green, it may have contributed to her increase in power as when she became champion her swordsmanship was said to be unmatched. And with a fee of 100 CP such a powerful combatant will follow you on your journey, eager to cut her teeth on new enemies. As a gladiator she has experience fighting hundreds of different types of opponents, with her trusty sword that causes heavy bleeding by her side, which has elevated her swordsmanship to master levels. But besides that, along with being able to instantly purge all poisons/disease from her body and stop all bleeding, she makes use of five different magic infused sword techniques. These are are: Horrorslash which can inflict poison as well as the Undying Curse which lowers all of someone’s “stats”, Mindslay which drains away someone’s mind, Soulrend which drains away someone’s souls, Scorched Earth which inflicts heavy burns, and finally her ultimate move Darkflame Slash which is a three strike combo that, similar to Scorched Earth, burns her enemies though at a much higher level which necessitates a cool down period. And while one would assume she is all serious business all the time, she does have a bit of a hammy side when she gets into the zone during a match."

Her reaction time is better too, and her senses are more perceptive. This allows her to feel more pleasure, which is helped by the general modifications to her biology, such as having a tighter pussy and improving her sexual functions. All in all, she is capable of giving 13 times as much pleasure to their partner as a normal girl could."

All of the V-Ko line has internal miniaturized manufacturing for drugs. Your model has an unlocked database, allowing it to produce any drug you need, and can analyze drugs or liquids by consuming them orally for further production. It also has the ability to create and dispense a wide variety of milks from the lactating breasts. The V-Ko IVs have a multi-purpose tail called a JoyCord that also lets them recharge, dispense dermal-penetrating aerosol blasts, and equip a wide variety of equipment on the end, including their own vaginas, a penis model, and other medical equipment. The tail has the ability to drain the internal battery in order to emit an electrical blast. In addition to dispensing drugs from the tail, they can also be applied via the lips or hands of the unit, or liquid forms dispensed via lactation. Physically, the IVs have synthetically lubricating vaginas that can be removed and used externally of the unit, and assholes. They can inflate or deflate their chest or ass regions as needed. This particular unit has the ability to store semen in their liquid storage tanks, and convert it to a safe, nutrient-rich sludge. Personality wise, this VI is intended to be sensual, and this particular model has been equipped with a non-standard pleasure-reward program that lets it feel the digital approximation of orgasm in organics."

      "description": "Black haired and wearing some fetishized nun outfit that she fills out very well, this elf is…odd. Originally a pious priestess of the goddess like most high elves, while sequestered away in prayer one day she received a powerful prophetic vision. It was her, in the throes of passion leading a congregation of similarly ecstatic elves as a divine figure moved between each one bestowing his ‘blessing’ upon them. Young elf or old, full blooded or half, commoner or noble, none of that mattered as elves were all united under the pleasure this divine figure brought. Even long after the vision passed she remained obsessed with making it a reality, so when she met you and sensed the same ‘divine’ light she felt so ecstatic she immediately threw herself at your feet in submission begging you to take her just like how you did in the vision. Ever since she has followed you around loyally, attempting to draw as many other elves as she can into her ‘congregation’. Her sermons seem to revolve around propping you up as some grand sexual figure and encouraging other elves to be the best devotees (slaves) they can be for you, which is surprisingly effective in drawing in elf converts. Though given how sexually repressed elves tend to be and her knack for spinning a story from existing religions and goddess worship into messages about the need for elves to submit to you, perhaps it's not that surprising. The innate sense of sacredness that other elves instinctually attribute to High Elves making even her more perverted monologues seem deeply profound, doesn’t hurt either. The oddest thing about this elf, is that somehow her faith in you has installed in her the ability to grant perversions of the blessings and powers that the goddess bestows on her followers, despite not drawing energy from the goddess anymore (or you if you don’t have any perks to bestow power upon followers). Some of her ‘holy’ powers include shooting ropes of light that restrain and tease captured elves in lewd ways, blessing elven women with improved fertility and safe births (and increased sex drives), and even granting church followers divine ‘revelations’ like her own (really just lewd dreams that increase their obsession with you). She also has crafted a ritual, which basically consists of the three of you participating in a kinky night of sex where the elf swears her soul to you, where she ascends a particularly faithful elf into a priestess like her as well. After the ritual the elf will receive the ability to use holy magic similar to the priestesses’ own, although their strength in it depends on their faith towards you. Now if only they could wipe the ahegaos off their faces when using it... As a side, she also is a quite skilled tailor able to make all sorts of outfits with a precision and pace that others would envy. She is very happy making outfits for others, and even happier when you defile them in these outfits too."

Now in the kind of debt to you that a dragon would have a hard time paying off, she revealed that she was a “mighty wizard” and promised that if you gave back her clothes and other gear, she would work for you until all accounts were paid in full, and to her credit she appears to be bound and determined to do just that. The problem is that calling her luck merely bad doesn't begin to do it justice, and so far through accidental breakages and even more extremely inadvisable bets made with you, her bill has only continued to multiply exponentially over time. So it looks like her fate is permanent servitude to you. At least she honestly seems to enjoy your company. And her loss is your gain, for while “mighty wizard” may have been a bit of a stretch, she does have many uses besides housework. For one thing, she really is a magical genius of a sort. She has a knack for cutting corners in her spellwork, meaning that she can cast them faster, for less, and even use spells that should be way too complex for her, all for the price of a few mostly harmless mishaps. For example, her favorite spell to spam “Tricky Teleport” works like a charm to blink all over the place, but sometimes it leaves ALL her stuff behind, or her Hypno Hex that occasionally makes her more suggestible instead. Also, you always seem to benefit from her bad luck, like the universe is trying to balance itself. Besides just getting to enjoy the view when she accidentally burns the clothes off herself and every other nearby cutie, and somehow ending up under the lot of them when they trip trying to chase her, just having her nearby nudges all the odds slightly in your favor.

What emerged from the newly formed hole in the ground looked like a little girl, whose brilliantly white feathered wings and angelically cute appearance might have inspired awe, if it wasn't for her extremely disgruntled expression and the complete dearth of grace shown while trying to clamber out of her crater. Upon spotting you she immediately introduced herself in quite possibly the smuggest tone of voice you ever heard “Rejoice! The goddess of justice and youth blesses you with her divine presence!”. Of course it quickly became apparent that she was lacking much of anything in the way of godly might. Practically crying from frustration after the realization, she started whining that she really is a goddess who was sent here from another world, and that it must be the fact that she doesn't have any worshipers, or influence in this realm that's stripping her of her real power. She then (without ever asking for your opinion on the matter) declared you to be her new Chosen One, and hasn't left you alone since. Pretty much useless at the moment, unless you want to make someone feel mocked by her smug aura, she actually will gain more and more divine power (and smugness) if you spread her ideals and/or gain her new devotees. She says she's a goddess of youth and justice, but her teachings mostly boil down to “little girls are the most beautiful and perfect of beings, so loving them is true justice” and “those cow like old hags are overrated”. Her domains will mostly let her do stuff like blessing, healing, and smiting with holy light, but she'll also be able to reduce the age of women and make them cuter if she grows strong enough. And as her Chosen One, you will be able to channel her miracles and are always first in line to receive her help. The downside is that she's a rather obsessively clingy and jealous deity, at least whenever it involves you, and will grow wrathful if you don't spend enough time with her. Fortunately her wrath consists mainly of withholding her power, pouting, crying, and kicking you in the shins. And she's also a merciful goddess, who will show forgiveness if you act contrite, and maybe buy her some sweets to make up for being a meanie."

One is nobility from the Hidden Forrest, pale of skin with golden hair, she has mastered the art of combining her swift swordplay with the elemental spirit magic of her people to make her a powerful foe to any who would face her. And the other is member of the hated dark elves, brown skinned and white of hair, grueling training in both personal combat and assassination has left her a deadly fighter and a potent asset in any covert mission. The light elf first met you during a battle against a band of savage monsters and insisted on following you afterward, claiming that it's just because “you obviously need all the help you can get”, but it'd sure be nice if she'd stop getting all huffy every time she saw you talking to another female. Meanwhile, the dark elf was originally sent to kill you, but after a quick battle ended up deciding that she wished to enter your service instead, and now seems obsessed with devotedly serving as your trusted right hand elf. So what's the problem with having two such useful allies? They absolutely DESPISE each other. In fact the risk of your anger is probably the only thing stopping them from fighting to the death. As it is recurring headaches from their constant bickering, petty one-upmanship, and all the vying for your attention, shall be your fate for the foreseeable future. Enjoy."

Despite being one of the most lethal pure human combatants in the solar system, this spy has been effectively trapped on earth for quite some time. Why? Because obviously the best spy is also the best bodyguard, and clearly the CEOs need one of those on account of them trying to assassinate each other. Unfortunately, her last contract was with a guy who tried to achieve immortality via cloning and had the mind transfer go a little… wonky. She shot him in the head before he could start committing genocide, don’t worry. Still, that leaves her with no job and on the run from a very powerful corporation. Honestly, it’s the most fun she’s had in years. Still, if you want to try and throw in a bid for her services she might just accept in order to have something new to do. Requires Machina Mutation. While she might have been the strongest pure human, by complete coincidence she also had an absurd RM compatibility - enough to make A rank easily, perhaps even something beyond that. Unfortunately, without the support network, she tried to enhance herself with them and flubbed it slightly. She is now the Machina’s newest queen, Mantis, a horrifically dangerous combatant who is only held back by the fact that her new allies and fuckbuddies are more interested in converting and uplifting humans than murdering them. Mind you, that doesn’t stop her from walking up to entire battlegroups and challenging them, just to get some moderate exercise. Maybe you should spend some time with her, get her mind off combat and onto other things. I bet you she’d make a wonderful breeder."

However, Taiga would be the exception to that assumption as she stands as the physically strongest Star Trainer which is something she has worked hard towards. And for a simple 50 CP, or a 100 CP if you’d like her to be a bit more magical like her other “world line” counterpart, she seems to have noticed a deep well of strength within you and wants to get a taste for herself. In regards to battling she can be considered among the top of the Star Trainers as when Futta was going to be disqualified she was going to be the person that replaced him. But besides that implication of her battling ability, the only thing she has that stands out from the other Star Trainers is her physical strength, which is to the point that when she was venting after losing to Futta she started to crack the concrete of the ocean pier they were on. And in regards to her team it consists of a water type Camowhale, earth type Kazuraon, and her earth type ace Crystalon, with her Star Trainer pressure making people feel like they’ve been smacked by her. Though, if you paid the 100 CP needed for her magical side, she also comes with a magical girl transformation that changes her into an older form with a magical girl outfit, increases her physical capabilities, and grants her nondescript magical powers. But she also has the ability to create Mystic Barriers that can hold spirits or demons in an area for about 10 minutes, teleport short distances, and use a life burn ability where she can trade her life for a ultra powerful attack. In regards to how she is when not battling, she gives off the air of being a strong female fighter of the loud and boisterous type, but with the added touch of behaving like a friendly gym bro. She’ll never turn down invitation for a Yarimon battle or any other kind of physical competition, and if she wins she’ll always praises those she manages to beat as shown by her being one of the people who gives Futta a pep talk when he degrades his use of Cheat Tackle, saying that it is a part of his strength. And if she notices the potential that is inside of someone she’ll try her best to bring that out of the person by encouraging them and trying to get them to make use of it. And a final special thing about her is that she has a very deep love of cooking which has translated to her having divine level skill in it, as well as other housewife related chores. Her signature dishes seem to be Omelet and Sausages followed by Steak slathered in her own homemade steak sauce on top of rice with grilled vegetables on the side Though if you’d like to seduce and romance her, a word of warning. She can and will use her superior strength and stamina to fuck you into the ground."

Unfortunately Aya is the sole expectation to this as possibly before Futta even started his journey she had been snagged by the Guru using his hypnosis pendant, becoming one of his strongest slaves. But for a simple 50 CP, or a 100 CP if you want her to inherit the abilities of her counterpart from another “world line”, you’ll be able to save her a bit earlier than Futta would and break the mind control the Guru has over her without it being a threat to her humanity. When talking about her battle experience, practically nothing is known outside the generic assumption that her being a Star Trainer puts her among the top of all trainers along with the fact that she is an old acquaintance of Taiga. The only real bit of info on her battling is her team which consists of just two Yarimon, a dark type Platilem and her dark type ace Ghast. But similarly to Taiga if you paid the 100 CP needed, then she gains the exact same things as Taiga such as the magical girl transformation without the age change, a boost to her physical ability, and nondescript magical powers along with the few defined ones, though all in all she will be slightly weaker than Taiga. In terms of her personality, again not much is known as the Guru’s hypnosis basically sandblasted any defining characteristics off of her. But taking a peek at the other her in the “world line” where she is a magical girl you can get a feel of who she was before the Guru got his mitts on her. That being a rough and tumble, dark and somewhat brooding guttersnipe that has some well ingrained street smarts. But while the Guru’s control over her is broken, expect to deal with some leftover programmed pervertedness that will linger in her mind."

But there exists two people who’ve managed to make it to the modern day, one of which is Teresa, or T-03 Type Mark 3 Robot Maid as she was first known as. And by spending 100 CP you can have this robot in disguise accompany you as well as aid you as she is the Commander of Central meaning she basically rules the world. In terms of battleting she doesn’t make use of any Yarimon, which makes her one of two people who don’t do so when they need to fight for something. Instead she seems highly skilled in sword play as evidenced by the katana she constantly carries around and the fact that during the final battle between Futta, Flare, herself, and the Cristia soul amalgamation, she was able to be a major player in helping the soul amalgamation fight Flare with nothing more than her sword. This somewhat implies that she spent a whole lot of time studying the blade during the 2,000 years since the Rays of Human Euthenasia event. Another combat element she has is her soul, which she gained from seemingly constantly interacting with Flare in the past, with it granting her the ability to cause her soul to burn brightly, letting her stay in a fight a whole lot longer despite any injuries or exhaustion she may have. Moving on to her personality, she at first comes off as very stiff when it comes to social interactions, keeping things to the point and rarely if ever showing much emotion. But that is just how she acts with those she isn’t close with as she can be very emotive and a bit awkward with those she comes to trust and open up with, with that number being on the small side. All of this is due entirely to the soul she managed to grow with the interactions she had with Flare as in the past she was nothing more than a highly skilled robot maid assigned to Flare with her acting very robotic and without humor or emotions, but as her soul grew she became more and more human. And while she may currently be on the side of the omnicidal soul amalgamation, in truth it's only because she’s not aware that Flare’s soul was ejected out of her body with the amalgamation taking its place. So it would mean the most to her if you manage to reunite her with the real Flare to the point she’ll happily, if with a bit of embarrassment, try to make it up to you with copious amounts of sex by making use of the PerVader sex robot upgrade package."

With the biggest example of this being the Star Trainer Quem, who alongside her trusty partner Vice make up the team Ruins Seeker, has made a job out of tracking down and exploring all manner of ruins which has led to them even getting their own porn game based on their adventures. So by spending 100 CP you’ll not only gain the capable Quem to help you in exploring things, but her partner Vice as well. When it comes to her battling ability it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that before Futta meteoric rise to the top she was considered second only to the Champion Athena. Besides being very talented she seems to have a close relationship with Athena, with the both of them considering each other rivals, and with the win/loss ratio between them being about even if you consider unofficial Yarimon battles. Another factor to this strength, beside being one of the few to unlock an EX form for her ace, is her special Yarimon battling ability known as “Super Dynamic Vision” that allows her to keep track of and react to the high speed anime like environment high level Yarimon battles can become, which when coupled with her high degree of analytic prediction allows her to predict her opponents moves and develop counters for them. This also comes in handy for personal combat as she is also skilled in the use of various weapons from swords, axes, to even knives and daggers as well as in various physical activities conducive to exploring ruins like running and jumping. In regards to her team it consists of a earth type Colrokksus, a fire type Soliche, and her dark type ace Howlabout with her Star Trainer pressure causing people to feel like they are being crushed and stung. Moving on to personality, she is very energetic and impulsive, always ready and willing to leave more intricate matters to her partner Vice. She also has a deep giddy love for adventure, danger, and discovering new things, such as when she put a heavy sing-song tone in her voice when discovered and relayed info back to Vice about the proto Yarimon found in Central Tower. But she does have her serious moments as similarly to Maki she detests those who, knowingly or not, don’t acknowledge the hard work she puts in, especially in regards to training her ace Howlabout to keep up with her “Super Dynamic Vision”. And somewhat similarly to Akira, taking her with you can be seen as the ultimate letter of love in her eyes as you basically grant her unlimited ruins and the like to discover and explore."

      "description": "The one who stood above all trainers in the region as champion, at least before Futta beat her, can easily be considered a veritable monster when it comes to Yarimon battling. Her name is Athena and for the past 3 or 4 years she has defended her title from all who would attempt to claim it, taking great glee in trying to find anyone who could give it a good shot. And by spending 100 CP, it seems she has noticed something special inside of you that’s got her excited and plans to try and bring it out of you. As one would expect her battling ability is top notch, but unlike practically all of the other Star Trainers she didn’t have any supreme level of talent to aid in bringing her to the top of Yarimon battling. Instead all she had was average talent and good intuition, and so she decided to sharpen that intuition of hers to a razor fine point, which also led to her unlocking an EX form for her ace, until it evolved into her “Hyper Intuition” allowing her to subconsciously chose the absolute best course of action, even when she is off the battlefield, and predict the next move of her opponent. She then coupled that with another ability of hers “Super Endurance” which not only makes her extremely tough as hell, to the point she held of a massive horde of proto Yarimon by herself, fell into a coma due to injuries and blood loss, and got back up in only two days, but similarly to Quem she taught it to her ace Yarimona. Speaking of an ace, her team consists of a wind type Bonbon, a light type Moostar, and her fire type ace Searundeth. In regards to her personality, the biggest defining factor about her is that she is the textbook definition of a blood knight battle junkie. She is always on the lookout for promising up and coming Yarimon trainers to test herself against, and she has a habit of flashing a mad slasher-like grin and unleashing her Star Trianer pressure, which is of the more generic sort, just before a battle or when a promising candidate is near her. But outside of battling her personality does a bit of a 180, with her being very sociable and nice when interacting with others and becoming very bubbly, energetic, and sweet if you were to do something like ask her out on a date. When compared to how she normally is when it comes to battling this juxtaposition makes her extremely cute, which is something she isn’t used to being called due to her intimidating battle hunger, so being called such will make her extremely happy, especially if you do so during sex. And similarly to the female master of the Shin’ei sword style, her appreciation of strength has led her to have a strong desire to be impregnated by a strong individual."

But this entity known as Abyss, or Tama-Chan to those she befriends, isn’t purely malevolent and can even be downright friendly. So by spending 100 CP you’ll become the first person to greet her entry into this world, which will come as you saving her from something. As a being from a different “world line”, specifically a supposed legendary class demon, Tama-Chan doesn’t make use of Yarimon when it comes to having to fight. Instead when she is ready for battle, which is signified by her manifesting a black halo behind her “inner body” fully turning black, she primarily makes use of nondescript magical energy attacks and whipping tendrils that come from the inside of her “cloak”. While this may not seem like much, her strength in these two basic abilities allowed her to basically out class her “world line’s” magical girl versions of Taiga and Aya at the same time. And if she needs more power she can also manifest copies of her own head from the inside of her “clock” with each increasing the amount of tendials she can make and she can make use of some kind of special final move known as a Koutestu which is heralded by her black halo turing red and a crystal like ring appearing behind her. She can also exude a sort of pressure in a manner similar to a Star Trainer which can cause spirits/demons weaker than her to basically pop, and can potentially be hazards to people. The only real way to defeat her is to do enough damage in order to first expose her core and then destroy it. Onto personality, Tama-chan is a very nervous and shy individual when it comes to interacting with those she likes or is not hostile towards, with such situations being marked by her normally red highlights turning blue, more than likely from living a solitary life being hunted by magical girls. Due to this, as well as not having 100% present familiarity with human languages, she has a few verbal quirks such as repeating the last one to three words of any sentence she says with this also applying to her internal thoughts. She also has a sort of cackling laughter she occasionally does, especially if she’s nervous or stressed, which is referred to as “The Laughter of Death” which more than likely means she has a habit of laughing before killing something. Also she can take on a more humanoid form with one version keeping her sack-like head and the other giving her a more human-like face. And since you are her savior, she’ll dedicate her life to making it up to you by becoming your sex slave, showering you with as much sex as you can handle all the while calling and treating you like a lord.

Her name was Flare and she was born with a whole host of supernatural soul related abilities which earned her the moniker the “Child of God”. And by spending 100 CP you’ll not only gain her as a partner, but be enacting a bit of a change of history that results in you becoming the main protagonist. Due to Flare effectively being a human soul in a Yarimon’s body she doesn’t make use of Yarimon when she needs to fight someone or something. Instead she’ll make use of a wide variety of moves that Yarimon normally makes use of and due to her special status of being the “Child of God” she has access to moves from every single type from earth, to dark. She also has access to the ability to manipulate raw soul energy to form protective barriers and heal herself as well as her special “Cheat Tackle” which is a one-shot move that allows her to always move before her enemies and instantly knock them out by temporarily cutting the flow of their soul energy, even if they don’t have a soul. She also has the mind of a well seasoned combatant as when she had her soul inhabit the body of Chikepu, she was able to not only do battle with the Cristia soul amalgamation and her army of proto Yarimon, but defeat them with only a few days to acclimate to her new body. Though when you first meet her she will be in her first stage which is the leftmost image, but as you adventure together she will evolve or “Soul Up” into stronger forms, culminating with her final form called Chikeflare where her original personality and memories will fully come back. In regards to personality Flare can be considered a truly kind person. The only reason she practically handed herself over to Central Corp was because she truly believed in the CEO’s stated goal for the Cristia device and since she had the powers to help humanity she saw it as her duty to make the world a better place. This also gets shown off by her adopting Chikepu as since it was considered a failure in regards to the New Lifeform project and it needed someone to willingly link their soul to it for it to survive it was going to be abandoned to die. But all of this nicety doesn’t mean she lacks bite to her as you can make the assumption that the battle hungry and arrogant personality she had while her soul was healing was simply a small facet of her original one that’s been magnified a bit. She also is a bit of a cheeky snarky trickster as shown by her convincing Terese to fuck the Protag as an apology for aiding Cristia. All in all you couldn’t ask for a better partner, though your adventures together may end up with you corrupting her and turning her into a pervert.

Due to an extremely unlikely series of events, a young woman from another world has made her way to the world of Pokemon. Registering as a Fire/Dark type Pokemon despite being visually indistinguishable from humans, she very quickly adapted to the Afri-Khan culture - after all, in her world, black men had already conquered hell in order to lay claim to more bitches. She’s beautiful to the point even black men will simp for her, and even a simple walk through town will result in a legion of pale white minions ready to do everything she asks. You’d think she was mind controlling them, but no, she’s really just that fucking hot. She’s also taken a liking to you, though whether that’s because she wants to be your slave or bully you to death is anyone's guess."

Of course, you may not want that. Inefficient, but understandable. Perhaps you would prefer a slime that eats corpses and shapes itself into any missing parts?

Or could it be that you’d prefer to play into their desires? Although they always talk about raping others, it seems what they really want is to be raped themselves.

If you want to get ahead, you grind other people’s faces into the dirt. Veronica’s real good at grinding too. Veronica Violence, a name she chose herself, is fully devoted to having fun in the many sick ways she prefers. She’s one of those rare girls that fits into the Predator origin in fact and seems to see you as a partner in crime, wanting to drag you into all sorts of crime times with that smug little smirk she has. Unlike most of her kind, she’s pretty good at recovering from a big loss, and before long she’ll be back on the streets looking for someone to fuck up real bad. She’s even managed to nab 1000 points to spend on Predator/General perks or items for herself. Victoria Violence Veronica’s twin really doesn’t live up to her last name. Victoria says she wants to help everone around her, especially the ones others think are lost causes. Victoria believes the best of people, even the ones that just got done thumping the back of her skull, and she’ll do her best to rehabilitate them. She definitely doesn’t use this as an excuse to seek out ultra-violent masochistic fantasy situations. Beneath her cover, she’s as much a Victim as any girl and she loves it. She’d love to drag you down with her too, if you let her, whether you’re a Predator to latch onto or a fellow Victim to corrupt. Victoria herself has 1000 points to spend on Victim/General perks and items for herself."

They’re also as strong as someone with the Certified Badass perk. If you instead purchase this for the price of 200 CP, you get a small gang of Riders, four in total.

It’s not enough to get her out of working retail though, especially because she needs to keep replacing uniforms. They keep ripping from her serious case of gigantic tits and ass."

He keeps himself well groomed, is a patron of the arts, and has strong hands. He’s got strong everything but his hands are noticeable since they’re often used for such gentle tasks. Some of his more notable hobbies include making well sculpted pottery, tending to his herb garden, and wrestling any bear that attempts to get into said garden into complete submission.

However, in the distant past an ancestor of yours chose to seal away a set of weak demons, and they have since been turned into familiars for your family. There are a few options, the most common of which would be a small handful of Kudagitsune, but the usage of these creatures remains the same. In exchange for directly feeding them some of your spiritual energy, they will fight alongside you to kill your foes. They aren't particularly intelligent, but they are decently well trained and have very sharp instincts - if there’s an enemy they cower from, consider running instead of punishing them for not following your commands. In addition to this, and only if you wish, your familiars will be slightly more powerful than before, or there might be an extra one. The cause of this however, will have been the death of one of the ancestors that attempted to train them into being loyal familiars. They might not be smart, but they are clever and they know they’ve been enslaved. You’ll need to watch them carefully and treat them to the exacting terms of how to ensure their obedience. If you don’t, they’ll turn on you in a heartbeat - and like all yokai, they have some kind of magical onahole ability to go with their combat prowess. Requires Exorcist | JK Body"

She’s also a rising star of the track and field team despite the fact she is missing both legs below the knee. Emi is an exceptionally stubborn individual, capable of pushing herself and others too hard. She can also be quite rude when she feels like others are pitying her or attempting to “rescue” her. Be prepared to be yelled at more than once if you want to get closer to this little fireball of energy and determination. She comes with the Sporty and Energetic perks. By purchasing this option, you will find your life entangled with Emi’s in some way. Perhaps you’re interested in track and field. Perhaps the Head Nurse instructs you to get some exercise and she volunteers to help you out. Or maybe you just happen to be in the same class.

Which never comes. A few whispered, stammered words leak for her mouth, but get easily lost in the din of the busy room. When asked to repeat her order, the girl does so, but only marginally louder. It’s barely loud enough for you, standing practically at her back, to hear her. Deciding to be helpful, you speak up for her and repeat her order clearly. The girl with long, dark purple hair doesn’t turn around to thank you, instead keeping her head down and taking her food by feel. Then she abruptly dashes off with the speed of a person fleeing certain death. Hanako Ikezawa is an extremely shy individual who can easily panic over the most basic form of social contact. While her past may make this understandable, she rarely shares that information with others. The bullying she had received in the past over her injuries only made things worse. She has disfiguring burn scars running down the entirety of her right side. Which she attempts to hide by growing her hair long on that side of her face and using her hands whenever possible. She comes with the Shy and Cute perks. By purchasing this option, you will find your life entangled with Hanako’s in some way. Perhaps you share the same therapist and happen across each other in the waiting room. Maybe you come across her in the library and slowly become reading buddies after a rocky start. Or perhaps you meet her through her friend Lily and engage her in games of chess. It is unlikely that Hanako will be willing to come along as a Companion, even with this purchase. But, it affords you the opportunity and initial connection. Perhaps, if you are patient and understanding, you can repair some of the scars on her soul."

The others in front of you have long since given up getting the person to move and are simply walking around her. She, for despite the male uniform and short auburn hair the figure is indeed feminine, is staring at the bread with an unfocused look of concentration. How someone can look both focused and distracted at one time is beyond you. However, her lack of arms may be part of the reason she has not taken anything yet. Before you can do more than take in the scene, the girl abruptly launches herself over the short counter and buries her face in the pile of breads. Her legs kick in the air as she bobs into the stack. Everyone, including the women behind the counter, just stop to watch this strangeness happen. After a moment, the girl slips backwards, holding a packaged bread in her mouth and looking like a satisfied cat after catching a mouse. She walks off, ignoring the stares she garners. You can’t help but wonder how she plans to open the package. Rin Tezuka is… unique. It is literally the only word people can come up with to describe her that isn’t rude. She’s also an artist, using her feet to create surreal works of art. She is incredibly adept at using her feet for everything others would normally use hands for and is wildly flexible. However, she isn’t the greatest conversationalist. She tends to skip between topics and make jokes that often only make sense to her. Additionally, she has a hard time expressing herself and her emotions the way she would like, except through her art. She comes with the Strange and Focused perks. By purchasing this option, you will find Rin has “collected” you. Perhaps it is because of your expressive face or disability. Or perhaps you join the art club and she believes this momentous enough to warrant further investigation. Whatever her motives, you will find that Rin, in her own way, encourages you and seeks to hang out around you. Understanding her will not be an easy task and failing to do so is a sure way to cause her to become more isolated and depressed. Should you manage to navigate the strange, roundabout path that is Rin, she will be surprisingly open to joining you as a Companion."

You politely make the change for the girls and receive a slightly less loud thank you before they hurry off. Shizune Hakamichi is, or soon will be, heavily involved involved with the Student Council and has a strong willed and forceful personality.

Shizune will show a special interest in you, attempting to push you towards finding a path in life and goals to strive for.

Either way, the item should typically be no larger than a truck in size. Generally, the item receives, in addition to the standard abilities of Mamono, enhancements to assist in its original “purpose” (for instance, a lantern could convert her energy into a flame that lights/heats up her body, and an umbrella, reflecting her original purpose of protecting her owner, could now repel rain, swords, and even magic that makes contact against her canopy). The Tsukumogami can switch between her Mamono and standard item forms, and her powers are shared between her forms; this means that special enhancements in the original item can be used by the Mamono in her humanoid form, and her new monstrous powers like producing demon energy carry over to when she is pretending to be a normal item again. Your Tsukumogami is considered an item and therefore does not normally count against companion imports unless specifically made into a companion."

Most importantly, it is programmed to constantly improve its ability to protect and benefit the user. As such, it will develop and learn from situations encountered by the wearer. It can study and imitate technology, do the same to biology, and if shown examples of how something can be done, can also learn and imitate phenomena. However, if an ability or capability requires an external energy source for the original user/inspiration, then the GGS can only imitate what it has interacted with, and not the energy source it hasn’t.

As well as anything in between these two extremes. You could even have its looks modeled to be identical to someone else, android or human. Additionally, these androids come with fully functional genitals and can include equivalents of most of the sexual cyberware (just generally less complex, since the android’s parts don’t have to work around an organic core), giving you wide latitude in designing your perfect sex toy. Aside from the body customization, you can also customize its AI so it actually is perfect for your needs. You can select whatever personality traits you want, add in skills for things like cooking, cleaning, or massages (sexual skill is hardwired in for free), and even choose how smart the android is, from a dumb drone to a fair bit smarter than the average person. If you like, instead of a standard android this could be a cloned body controlled by a cybernetic \"brain\". On the upside, this means it's lighter and has actual internal organs. On the downside, it's going to need to eat, breathe, and maintain its body shape like a real person. Plus, you'd need a doctor instead of a repair if it gets damaged."

You're not the owner of any such ring of smugglers anymore, you're a preferred customer to several of them. They probably mistook you as a corpo that they could fleece, and as such walked right into the lion's den. To be clear, the profits from the operation are irrelevant - what matters is that you can now kick it over whenever and wherever you please and are guaranteed to get away cleanly. This means that if one of these groups steals something you want, you can take it - and them - for yourself, to do with as you please. Or you could simply let them sell you more and more slaves to turn into Machina. Normally they have to fight their way through the blockade, but if you can just pay for them to be brought to you, why not do so?"

While her enormous size and strength are absolutely advantages, she is a leatherback sea turtle and is therefore lacking anything in the way of claws or a hard shell, and the trauma from her injury has made her fearful of conflict. Support this turtle in her heroic dreams anyway and who knows, this shy girl might open her heart to you."

      "description": "A shipgirl named HMS Compass from the Royal Isles. Or so she claims, at any rate. You highly doubt it’s the truth, since no matter how you look, there appears to be no record of any such shipgirl having ever existed, never mind being active. This busty light cruiser has knee length hair as dark as night and purple eyes that seem to glitter in the dark, but refuses to wear anything besides an extremely skimpy and fetishized maid outfit she ‘found.’ She is highly loyal to you, and madly in love, putting up with anything you do to her and then asking for more. Somehow, she always seems to know more about the situation than anyone else knows, even the sort of information that should be so confidential it doesn’t exist anymore, but she has a bad habit of being very cryptic about what she tells you. While she will tell you more if you coerce it out of her, a process she very much enjoys, it will still never be everything, but don’t worry, she will always act on information that would put you in life-threatening danger, often before you even knew you were under risk. While she should be useless in combat given how inexperienced she clearly is, she almost always seems to come out of a fight entirely unscathed, not from skill or anything, just pure dumb luck. How odd. She makes for a great maid, having a boosted version of Luxury Brothel, just don’t ask how she knows your favourite dishes and drinks, she won’t tell. Is there something more to her…? No. Clearly not, this is nothing to worry over."

Worse still is the fact that only bringing a few with you won’t be of much use in future engagements. So this option allows you to pick ten of your favorite Canon Shipgirls and bring them along. You will not decide which ten at the moment you purchase this option, but can instead do so after your time in this world is completed. So you have a chance to experiment and get to know them before you choose. Additionally, these ten Shipgirls will only occupy a single Companion slot. If imported into other worlds, all Perks they receive will be split in power between all ten of them as evenly as possible. If it is not possible to split a Perk for whatever reason, you may choose one to gain the ability instead. But it must be split if at all possible."

Heck, she used her authority as First Lady to straight up give herself most of the Prisma Trio’s skillset when she was kicking them around back in the Causeway. She even looks like Illya these days, though she acts more like Chloe. Her sense of fashion is similarly ‘worse’, with her usually wearing a darker and sluttier version of Ruby’s magical girl outfit, and everything else she would consider putting on would turn even Chloe into a blushing mess. She also bounces back and forth between being willing to put out or not, teasing you endlessly without relief and without the chance of release, or shaking her hips long after you’ve run out of energy and have begun to regret trying to match her own thirsts."

Fortunately, the lamp automatically collects mana from its natural surroundings, so don’t worry about draining the lamp and genie dry. Also, your genie is mischievous and independent to a degree, so she will try to stop you from making wishes she disagrees with.

Of course the more powerful the magic you need the higher the price she’ll charge for it, but Cotera is ancient and powerful and can accomplish all sorts of things with her magic that nobody else in Hyrule can do, though she does have sharp limits when it comes to other powerful entities like Ganon. Fairy Companion It’s dangerous to go alone, so make sure you take this fairy partner with you on your adventure. She’s a cheerful little thing and doesn’t hesitate to offer advice when she has it but the best way she can help you is by being your own personal healslut. Fairies are tiny bundles of fertility magic and if you’re ever injured she can heal your wounds by generating large bursts of healing magic. Once per jump she can even burn out her powers for a short while to act as an extra life, reviving you or one of your allies from fatal injuries. Of course the best way for her to recharge her magic is to get her life essence straight from the tap. Don’t worry about how she makes it fit, she’s a very flexible little cocksleeve."

      "description": "A long time ago, an infamous elven archmage betrayed her species, working with a long forgotten human noble to destroy the magical defenses that kept humans out, and leave countless elves vulnerable to their perversions. Even now, the vast majority of elven slaves in human territory are either a product or a result of this one archmage’s actions (and many are descendants of the noble himself who gleefully took to the ‘spoils’ of war). Eventually however the elven archmage was struck down by an elven heroine, and the Goddess, once she received her soul, punished her personally by trapping her in a magic mirror, one that deprives all sensation to those trapped within it, a horrible fate for one who was so enthralled with the pleasure of the flesh. Thus she served as a lesson taught to all elves about embracing pleasure and betraying the goddess. As for the mirror itself, it was stashed away in some hidden place never to see the light of day again. Well that is until you stumbled on it while exploring some old elven ruins. Rather overjoyed at finally having someone to interact with after being isolated for years, she immediately went into her pitch. Yes she is, unfortunately, trapped in this mirror with her magic sealed away and unable to interact with the world at large. She still, however, is one of the greatest mages in the world and if you help her out with her little situation she’ll ‘help’ you too. The archmage possesses a large amount of lewd spells whose variety and intensity is matched only by her own perversions. Everything from simple spells that can multiply an elf’s sexual sensitivity, to spells that allow you to temporarily clone yourself to indulge in gangbangs, to even creating large ritual areas that inflame the lust of all elves within it. While you may not possess magic yourself, she knows a host of rituals that will allow you to sap magic energy from either nature or other ‘willing’ elves. Although she has spent so long creating lewd spells she kind of only knows a few weak magics that can actually be used for combat, which probably explains how she was killed in the first place. In return for allowing you to use her grand magical knowledge, all she asks for is your help in getting her freedom. You see in her captivity she has devised a spell which she believes can allow her to temporarily escape the mirror, all she needs is for you to capture another elf and use her body as a vessel for the archmage's soul. The elf’s own soul will then take her place in the mirror and can do nothing but watch as her body is used for whatever perverted whims the archmage has. The swap lasts for a few weeks before the mirror switches her back forcibly, but the archmage has many ‘ideas’ about how to put that time to good use. She always wanted to act as a innocent elven wife gleefully cheating on her husband with a human’s dick, or a loyal elven handmaiden that turns her noble master into a cocksleeve, or a wise queen who gleefully betrays her people by letting someone have free reign over her body in public, or…. Well you get the idea. Of course, after she had her ‘fun’ and when they are switched back the original elf is now stuck in the body that has been lewdly trained by the archmage and yourself, with who knows how many ‘fun’ spells attached to ensure they sink right back into depravity. She’s actually a decent enough actor that most elves don’t pick up on that their ‘friends’ body is being possessed. Although she does have a habit of using illusion magic to hide the mirror and letting the trapped elf get a full view of whatever degrading acts the archmage is having her body do. Unfortunately if the mirror ever gets destroyed the arch mage's souls will go up along with it, so I’d advise you to be really careful when handling it."

These drones are nearly mindless, yet at the same time ‘elite’ members of your species that follow your commands, fighting with incredible ferocity, skill, and power while having just enough autonomy so that fucking them isn’t a completely one-sided affair. How much power do they have? Well, that depends on how many you decide you want. To make sure that they’re useful, their overall ‘power’ matches yours—only, it’s split among them. In other words, if you have four guards, then they’ll each have 1/4 of your power, while 1000 Praetorians would have 1/1000 of your total power. As for how they’re ‘made’… that process is up to you to determine."

That being said Artoria was not able to avoid battle entirely, instead becoming one of Morgans most trusted Knights. When Vortigern fell he imbued what he could of Britains curse into Morgans sister, hoping for her to end Morgans age.

You can assign them whatever tasks you want, but their primary purpose activates whenever you sleep or even just rest. For as long as you rest or sleep, your guardians will faithfully protect you so that nothing disturbs you. However long your rest takes, they will not stray from their sacred duty for even a moment. (This will be especially handy if you are using the Long Rest perk.) Wise and powerful, they will not only drive off threats by force but also develop creative defenses to confound intruders. In addition, they are skilled at comforting you in your slumber – such as with lullabies, massages, incenses, and even serving you in the bed if that is your command – all for the purpose of ensuring you have the best sleep possible; they will give you privacy if ordered, but you will find that they are masterful servants of discretion, able to remain present and even fight off intruders without being the slightest nuisance to your relaxation. If they have but one flaw, it is that they consider it a grave taboo to disturb your rest prematurely. You can tell them that they can wake you up (or allow others to do so) under specific conditions – after a certain amount of time has passed, if you are having a bad dream, if you are in lethal danger, etc. – but they will require specifics each time you go to rest; otherwise, they will faithfully protect your rest, and provide aid if you are troubled while resting, but they will never wake you up, and will actively stop anyone attempting to do so. With this purchase, you gain seven monster girl servants, whom by default consist of one Sphinx as the leader and six Anubis subordinates; you may choose to swap them out for other kinds of desert-based mamono if you wish (Mummy, Khepri, Girtablilu, Basilisk, etc.). You can buy more sets of guardians (Kingdom of the Sun buyers only get a discount once), each time receiving 7 more guardians. However, you can only buy up to six sets (including the first one), for a grand total of 42 guardians."

It can be a bimbo beach bunny one day, or a tentacle-wielding centaur, or a slime intent on invading your holes. But it’s truly impressive capabilities lie in its personality simulation protocols. If you connect it to records or media containing information on a person, real or fictional, it will collect all available information to create an accurate personality replica of that person, and will shapeshift to match. It can’t replicate any extraordinary abilities, but if it’s a physical change, then the SexBot can do it. Perfect for when you want to lewd your husbando or waifu, but don’t want to leave the house. Or, you know, the minor inconvenience of them being fictional, but who cares about that. It can create and store as many personalities as you like, and can run a personality for as long as you desire. It can even cause a long-running personality to “grow” and “learn” and “develop” to incorporate you into that personality’s history, etc. Your waifu could think she’s married to you and cooks meals for you while wearing just an apron. Be careful though, personality accuracy can bite you if you aren’t paying attention. Don’t trust the cooking skills of someone famous for their ability to burn water, or worse. Regardless of personality, the bot will always be loyal to you, and will always be in full readiness and cleanliness, unless you choose otherwise.

In Maraviolantes’s forces he serves the role of an invasion ship, unleashing his cargo on an unsuspecting Tokyo. You possess a monster identical to this one in your army, as well as all of the lesser youma stored within him. Yer-Anus and his invasion force are all loyal to you and can be unleashed at will on your enemies, respawning any losses suffered between battles so long as the mothership is kept well-fed. The minions are all mook-tier combat youma but sheer numbers make them a force to be reckoned with, and Yer-Anus itself is strong enough to throw down with kaiju-sized monsters if needed. The mothership is also capable of shrinking down to the size of a hair accessory for easy carrying, and in addition to unleashing its army it can create hurricane-force winds to suck enemies into its stomach. Any foes who become trapped within Yer-Anus are at the mercy of his army unless they’re strong enough to blast their way out of him."

      "description": "Of course, not all heroes are summoned; some are directly reincarnated into this new world, some are transmigrated, and some stumble upon a magic doorway. Sometimes this is an intentional act by another being, sometimes due to a mystical system of soul migration, and sometimes due to interdimensional accident. But you? You have discovered the secret of calling forth a hero from another world. This summoning is quite varied in its approach; sometimes it calls forth people who were just living their lives, and sometimes it only summons people who were just about to die in their original world—or even reincarnates those who have been freshly killed in new, grown bodies. But they always come forth from a different world. These are always “new” heroes; not people with experience as a hero, but people with vast degrees of potential, certainly enough to take them to the peak of whatever world you summoned them into. If the world you’re in has a special magic system of some sort, then at your discretion they may have potential at using this system, be it magic, psychic powers, cultivation, or what have you. These heroes all benefit from the Class System perk, and during the summoning, you are able to imbue each a summoned hero with a special “Cheat Ability”— which is just a fancy term for the ability to duplicate a single one of your perks and gift it to the person you just summoned. You can only summon one hero per jump… however, for each 600 CP worth of perks you sacrifice (their original price, not their discounted price), you can make an additional summon that jump. The perks you sacrificed become unavailable to you for the rest of that jump (including for gifting them as “Cheat Abilities”), and will only return once you leave that setting. If you gave up enough perks, you could probably summon an entire schoolroom of potential heroes at once. It is up to you, when you summon multiple heroes, whether they come from the same world or different ones; if from the same world, you can choose to have them have some sort of connection to each other, such as being friends, being classmates, or simply being nearby to one another when they are summoned. When you summon a hero, you can control what sex and gender are summoned forth, and can likewise determine whether or not they are in a pre-existing romantic relationship. If you do multiple summons at once, you could summon both of the lovers at the same time. Class System A classic in isekai is for there to be some sort of supernatural “system”, a way to level up via earning exp, allowing you to become stronger, gain skills, and take levels in a class of some sort, such as Warrior, Priest, Mage, Thief, Brawler, Archer, Playboy, that sort of thing. You have a pretty generic system, which you can design or which can be based off of an isekai setting of your choice; killing things, completing “quests”, accomplishing great deeds, or just training, all serve to increase your exp (although to understandably different extents). The point is, this version doesn’t have a maximum level limit, allowing you to keep growing stronger forever."

Instead, Sara herself will appear before you. Seduce her, pleasure her, earn her favor, and the power of the whip will rise.

Either way, you’re going to be that one in charge of a large gang that has several thousand members and control over a solid chunk of a city. Assuming you’re based in the urban sprawl and not some group of nomads, in which case you might just control a whole bunch of vehicles instead. Apart from being able to order them around as you please as the (possibly new) boss, you have wide freedom in determining the whole gang’s makeup, theme, and goals.

Hell, you could even get them all to look like the same person through plastic surgery if you really want, the clone look can be good. Though while you can set what cyberware they all want, or are pressured into getting, the really expensive stuff will probably be out of reach for your common grunts. You could set them up like an extensive mafia family, cyberware-happy hackers, or a rugged group of nomads operating out of a caravan of vehicles, or anything you'd like. One thing does remain constant, in that all your members seem to have remarkably high libidos even by this world’s standards. Depending on your preferences, that might get channelled into acting mostly benevolent to the people they’re dedicated to protecting (and seducing) or they might just be out for their own amusement and a craving for sexual violence."

In the bottom of that laboratory is a hilariously powerful Agent, something you might call A+ rank, or perhaps even S rank.

In future jumps, you will find yourself in possession of a similar location, perfectly ordinary but with hidden secrets, and a - most likely too stupid to realize how traumatized she ought to be - super-prototype hidden in the basement. Requires Machina Mutation. As a Machina, the item has mutated. The girl is still trapped in the basement, but she’s even more deadly now. Exposure to the RM her body generates will warp the minds and bodies of anyone and everyone who comes near her. This process will permanently raise the RM compatibility of those exposed, potentially grow their cock and breasts, and very slowly hardwire their brain to become incredibly aroused just from thinking about her. Actually sleeping with her will make all of these things worse - or better, depending on your perspective. Only the fact that she thinks kissing makes babies prevents her from effectively enslaving everyone nearby. In short, the girl has most of the benefits of being a Machina Queen without having made the proper transition.

Through rituals and secret rites forgotten to all in this modern day, they reached beyond the material and into the metaphysical-into the Realm of Souls, unshaped and chaotic. From the Realm of Souls they called forth a being of power, shaped by the summoner and bound by the elements: a djinn, a being of pure soul and elemental essence who could warp the world in truly mystical ways. This djinn was bound to a contract: to grant a single wish to the holder of the lamp that was their home. And she granted their wishes, indeed. That civilization is naught but dust and sand now, and the djinni still lingers in forgotten tombs. -The world knows of only one djinn that was summoned, but somehow you have found another; in your hands is a simple oil lamp, and within that oil lamp is a djinn from the Realm of Souls, bound to you by contract. Beautiful and curvaceous, it seems that the summoner of this djinn held a much more playful and benign mindset than the previous one; this djinn does not delight in ironically twisting wishes against the wisher so that they suer, but instead delights in bending wishes so as to bring about events that result in cute girls being stued full of food and gaining weight. Seems she’s got something of a fetish for it, and if you play into that fetish she’s more than happy to play ball with her wishgranting. If not, you’re going to need truly monstrous legal skills to get her to actually not twist wishes into some strange weight-gain shenanigans. That said, she is still limited to one wish per soul-though this refreshes with each new jump. -The powers of the djinn are not well known and are definitively weaker than those of demons, but there are some things that are known. This djinn is a master of crafting illusions, teleportations, temporary transformations, and commands one classical or mythological element; water, fire, earth, air, lightning, sea moss-as long as a civilization believed it to be an element of the world by myth alone, you may choose freely what she commands. She is also composed of that element and that element is both her strongest tool and her greatest weakness; no mortal blade may touch her, but if a Water Djinn is struck with water she will uncontrollably absorb it. That said-she may only grant one wish per soul, but doing you favors and helping out if she likes you isn’t really wishgranting is it? Just remember-she’s gonna want some pay for her assistance, like loads of tasty food or a chance to stu a cute girl silly."

      "description": "A dog whistle, when you blow it, the nearest flat twometer by five-meter space will begin to glow gold before manifesting a small market stall before your eyes, with the Queen of Sheba smiling smugly at you from within. She has three separate inventories you can purchase from, one is a fixed inventory where you may buy staples like groceries, clothing and even things like furniture. She will sell anything you can imagine in this category, so long as it’s mundane. The second inventory is randomized every day, and is composed of single use items like magical potions or reagents, Broken Noble Phantasms you can activate for free, talismans, and more. Her third inventory is composed of Saint Graph patterns. She will sell you the pattern for the Saint Graph of whoever you want in your respective universe. If you are skilled enough, you can modify or fuse these before patterns before summoning them. You just need to break the crystal they are contained within to activate the summoning spell, but an energy source is not included. Of course, this being Sheba, her prices are exorbitant, so don’t be afraid to simply bully her into giving you what you want for free. As much as she blushes in ‘indignation’ from whatever abuse you give her, she always answers your call the next day, with the same smug smile on her lips, even if you left her comatose the day before. She even gives you massive discounts in ‘fear’ when you go far enough, but you can only get four free items from her every 24 hours, so choose wisely. If you want to bring her along in a more permanent manner, you can hire her as your Servant, and she will be able to trade at any time, but will consume a Servant slot. Who knows, if you are convincing enough, you may even get her to pay you for the privilege of having fun with her."

      "description": "Brynhildr A sacred treasure and cursed blade once guarded by the hero clan, Brynhildr is an immensely powerful blade forged from the soul of a legendary valkyrie. Superior to almost any other spirit blade possessed by the hero clan, only very special heroes such as yourself are worthy of wielding Brynhildr at all, much less unlocking her true power. Like any spirit blade Brynhildr can be summoned and dismissed by her wielder at will but she can also consume the souls of those she slays, sealing them within herself. With training you may learn to wield any unique powers those souls possessed as though they were your own. If even this much power proves insufficient to defeat your enemies, Brynhildr is also able to revive you from fatal wounds once per jump, healing your injuries but driving you into an uncontrollable berserk rage to defeat whatever enemies threaten her wielder. A Cursed Blade Brynhildr was once a legendary valkyrie who served the gods as a hunter of evil spirits before they sealed her soul into the form of a sword. Proud and haughty, she never allowed herself to be wielded by anyone until you laid hands on her. Now she serves only you, her one true master, but if you think she’s just going to be another slave in your harem then think again. Brynhildr has sky-high expectations and will train you relentlessly to meet her lofty standards. She’s an excellent teacher, peerless in swordplay and skilled with any powers that have ever been sealed within her sword form, and she’s able to manifest a spiritual body to aid your training, becoming a nordic beauty with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a voluptuous figure. Once you’re able to meet her expectations you’ll find her strict attitude relaxes and she’ll acknowledge you as a worthy master, serving you just as proudly and loyally as she once served the gods, if not moreso. Unlike the other entries in this section Brynhildr is a follower rather than a companion, and her existence is anchored to her sword form rather than one of your companion slots. You can choose to import her as a companion in future jumps if you wish."

      "description": "A Taihou that fell out of a glitching portal near where you arrived, she appeared heavily wounded, leaving you the perfect chance to mindbreak her without resistance. Her breasts seem to be four cup sizes larger than the original Taihou’s, resulting in a truly prodigious amount of lactation. So, you are probably wondering why this slut is so expensive. Let me tell you, it’s a damn good reason. This is Taihou from a timeline where all the factions banded together to combat the Sirens, and lost. Taihou, being the last surviving shipgirl, was given every possible resource to enhance her, in a last, desperate attempt at survival. Including an experimental procedure to swap her cube and soul to an entirely new hull. Her new hull, based off a Yamato class battleship before being massively sized up, was packed full of Iron Blood technology, so it not only retains its carrier capabilities, it also has six main turrets, each equal to Musashi’s, resulting in a final weight of 138,000 tonnes. The Sakura Empire provided the power plant, in the shape of a purified Watatsumi Stone, giving her Divinity and enough spiritual power to outpace a major faction’s fleet put together, to top it off, they gathered every spell and ritual they had into an archive within the hull. The Royal Isles provided every metal they could find for her armour, resulting in an alloy twice as strong as the usual armour such a battleship would have, on top of it already being three times as thick, as well as ensuring she was mounted with the best spotting equipment out there. The Eagle Union gave their best point defence blueprints, giving her proximity fuses and turrets which could track targets moving at supersonic speeds, they also upgraded all her aircraft to fighter jets with early age guided missiles, and even managed to produce six nuclear warheads for her. The minor factions provided the labour and soul of the ship, working millions of men to exhaustion to produce it within a single year, as well as sacrificing the spent wisdom cubes they had managed to recover from every battlefield, giving Taihou enough spiritual power regeneration to recover within an hour. In the end, when she was deployed, she tore through everything the Sirens could throw at her with ease, fighting for an entire month without rest until Observer had enough and faced her with her main terminal, and all the power that represented. The resulting fight took a week to conclude before Taihou finally succumbed to her injuries, but she managed to wound Observer to a startling degree as well. Just when the Siren was going to finish her off, the Watatsumi Stone spent itself to send Taihou to safety. Or well, to you. Even now, in her crippled state, she has every perk from the shipgirl origin scaled up as if they had been bought twice, save for The Future is Now! and Sugar and Sipce, which she doesn’t have. Most are inaccesible, since she can’t summon her hull or rigging, but even so, she could fight Bismarck to a standstill. She also Mona Lisa, Grit and Cool as a Cucumber; her fairies come equipped with assault rifles and AT equipment. You will need to provide active wisdom cubes for Taihou to eat if you want to heal her, but if you do, nothing in this world save for another main Siren terminal would be able to stop her. It would take about 100 to fully heal her, but that would get her the perk War Machine for free. In fact, now that she has adapted to the wisdom cube metaphysics of this world, her bond and submission to you would make a rematch with Observer a very different battle. It would probably still result in a loss, but Observer would be left in a state similar to the one you first found Taihou in, and if you Redlined her? Taihou might just survive the encounter as well. You can buy her as an imported companion so she may buy things from this jump, for 900 total CP, she will get the mentioned stipends as well."

Realizing just where she is, who you are and what kind of wars are on the horizon, the Demon King is practically salivating at all that is to come. And if there is one thing you can be sure of than it is that she will cum as well. Winning battles has its way of making her horny you see and you'd do your favorite General a solid wont you?

As do the Machine Gods you inevitably had to triumph over to get to this point. Even Thanatos will grudgingly admit your victory. Now as you should remember, Vatlantis is an all-female population. And while they have only a population of roughly seven million, they are a nation deeply steeped in techno-magic directly because of their short-sighted efforts to build their magical strength. They are also incredibly used to the rule of an autocratic dictator, so you taking over as Emperor/Empress will not cause a fuss at all. Secondarily, and I know this will be a critically important point to some, despite being from a parallel dimension, Vatlanteans are for all intents and purposes human, and fully, biologically compatible. And, Vatlantean dress is extremely skimpy from the top of society all the way to the bottom. In fact the higher in the pecking order they are, the less clothes a Vatlantean typically wears. Genesis Pillar Well, I guess if you really want it… Ahem, this piece of Vatlantean magitech is responsible for the exclusively female population, specifically by allowing women to become pregnant through a blood offering, bearing exclusively other women, without the involvement of a man. Naturally, because men have lower inherent magical potential (in this setting) than women, the men of Vatlantis were steadily bred out of existence. If you wanted to make a pure matriarchy work, this is the tool to use. Technically speaking, if you wanted to gift this to Vatlantis, you might be able to cancel the war."

Not only do you get a copy of this planet as a warehouse attachment, with no people but all the infrastructure intact, you will get the main draw in this Jump. Every single shipgirl in Azur Lane will receive all the shipgirl perks and items for free, as well as Divinity, while the research ships from your own faction will receive an upgrade to become equal to the main goddesses, you can upgrade all research ships to this tier with enough materials, and normal shipgirls as well, although that will take some research. You will be able to take every single shipgirl out there as companions, even if they died during the war. The main goddesses of every faction will be gathered into a single companion slot, and every shipgirl will be separated into nations. A nation only takes a single companion slot to carry all the shipgirls within it. All the collab girls will count as a single nation, and thus take up only a single companion slot as well. The Sirens will also choose to follow you as well, having become enamoured with the impossibility you represent, they all take up a single companion slot, and will receive fairies armed with twenty first century weapons. Finally, not only will the tankgirls come along, alongside a fleet of support shipgirls meant to help them all conduct an invasion, you also get an entire copy of the research used to turn ship wisdom cubes into tank wisdom cubes and thus the ability to produce more of them whenever you so desire. In order to be applicable for a tank class wisdom cube, a vehicle must have armour capable of stopping the local equivalent of small arms fire without issue and a main gun capable of piercing its own side armour, it will also need to weigh at least 120 tons. Whether it has two tracks, four tracks, or floats above the ground with a repulsor lift is irrelevant. APC’s and other ground support vehicles can also count towards this, if they meet the above requirements. Every girl already counts as bonded to you, for loyalty purposes.

      "description": "If you accepted the main challenge, and through either wits or sheer power managed to defeat all nine challenges for Vitch to bind as her tails, then she will be overcome with bliss at you doing what she believed to be impossible, and will give you both of the rewards mentioned above, while evolving into a new Beast form, before swiftly declaring herself your mate and most devoted Servant, revealing to you her true name, Koyanskaya. Rewards: -Weaving a bracelet out of the hair from one of her tails that will resurrect you once every ten years. -Personally craft a cute winged bunny familiar for you. This bunny will be strong enough to stall a Servant like Cu for up to half an hour, if he doesn’t use Gae Bolg, and won’t consume magical energy to maintain. As a Beast, Koyanskaya will see a massive improvement in her stats, with EX rank in Mana and NP, A+ in Luck, A rank in Agility, Endurance and Strength. Her nature is that of a rival and mirror to Tiamat. If Tiamat is the mother to all things that exist in the World, then this Koyanskaya could be said to be the mother of all things that should not exist in this World, but do so regardless. As a Beast, her magical energy and aura are both intense and massive enough to constantly corrode the space around her, but she has limited this to merely the EX rank in order for you to safely embrace her. Even limited like this however, she has more than enough magical energy to outperform even a Grand Servant. For Personal Skills, she will get: Nega-Order A: Giving her the ability to instantly identify any systems that have an ‘order’ to them, and deny this order, collapsing the system if it doesn’t have enough magical energy to resist her influence. This Skill is the reason she can exist as a Servant, giving her the ability to resist the order of the Counter Force. Golden White Reflection A: A Skill granted by her imitating the nature of the Golden White Face, Koyanskaya can expand her Spirit Origin to corrupt and consume everything that exists within the World, rendering it her own. While this Skill can be used on anything considered Land, it is at its most powerful when affecting the living, since it will warp their minds into doing Koyanskaya’s will even without her inupt. She can designate specific targets or areas for this. This Skill represents authority over the Stars, as opposed to the Sun. Gate of the Stars EX: A Skill that can’t truthfully be comprehended by a human, this allows Koyanskaya to open a gate to a place that isn’t real, where all things exist but at the same time nothing truly does. By using this Gate, Koyanskaya can instantly traverse incredible distances, create hallucinations, and most importantly, summon massive dark purple tentacles covered in eyes that appear blind. These tentacles are immune to any attacks below A rank, and are capable of freezing anything the eyes look at in time and space. Being frozen like this constantly consumes magical energy, and should the target run out, their existence will begin to degrade and dissipate, until they cease to be real. In terms of Class Skills, she will gain: Authority of the Beast A: Gives her a massive damage boost against anything that rightfully exists in the current order of the World. Independent Manifestation A: Gives her the ability to survive with nothing more than scraps of magical energy, as well as immunity to instant death and time or erasure based attacks, another aspect of this Skill is the power to ‘break through the World’, giving Koyanskaya the ability to access nearby timelines or alternate realities while carrying up to four other people with her safely. Self-Modification E: This Skill rank is so low because Koyanskaya cannot use it to modify herself, as a creature anchored to the World by you, but she can use it to modify her ‘children’ while they are still part of her by being in her womb. This Skill can only be used to change the parameters and abilities of demonic beasts birthed or created by her. After evolving into a Beast, Koyanskaya will unlock her real Noble Phantasms, which are the following: Tunguska Recreation A: An Anti-Country Noble Phantasm granted to display her authority as a Beast, this pair of demon-like horns emerging from the back of Koyanskaya’s head, curving around the sides of it, before finally ending in matched points in front of her forehead, glow with intricate patterns, that remind those who look upon them of an organic mural depicting evolution. While these horns already act as magical energy amplifiers, corroding away any magic Koyanskaya doesn’t allow near her person, their true power lies in their ability to channel her magic, creating a beam of light that strikes with the might of a falling star, and is capable of melting through even a mountain in a single strike. It takes a few minutes to recharge. Embrace of the Star Veil A+: This Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm represents Koyanskaya’s nature as a ‘Mother’ and is represented by her nine fluffy tails. Capable of granting any target she desires the ‘safe embrace of their mother’, a bounded field capable of negating attacks by ensuring that they must first target Koyanskaya, instead of the being granted her protection. This NP unlocks its second form as an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm when Koyanskaya gives up protection and instead chooses to embody the wrath of a mother, warping from fluffy, inviting tails, to fanged, leathery monstrosities with far too many mouths and eyes, each becoming capable of firing hundreds of bolts of light with each twist of the tails, every bolt is capable of piercing a castle wall. The Womb Beyond the Gate EX: Koyanskaya’s personal Texture, this Noble Phantasm can be used in several ways; the first, and most basic, is Koyanskaya’s ability to split her shadow into nine demonic beasts, each symbolizing one that you defeated, these beasts will be just as strong as they were when you first faced them. As a second use of this ability, Koyanskaya can use essence from you, either in the form of blood or a far more fun method, to become pregnant with eldritch monstrosities, each one takes about one day to be birthed, and they are strong enough to defeat most average Servants in a one on one encounter. As a third form, this NP can be deployed like a Reality Marble, creating a massive set of yawning, twisting caverns obscured by a thick fog, at the center of this space is a main cavern, kilometres wide and always taller than what the eye can see, regardless of how high you attempt to fly, within this massive space lies a throne. Your throne. Symbolizing your place as the owner and king of her very soul, this indestructible stone construct will place you into stasis if you are ever wounded, allowing you to safely heal over long periods of time. Within the twisting hallways that defy reason, and the angles that don’t exist, hidden in the maddening fog, crawl an innumerable amount of creatures, each as strong as the challenges you faced to evolve Koyanskaya. Any enemies brought into this reality marble will need to fight an eternally growing horde of enemies to reach your throne. The fog itself acts as an acid to all forms of Mystery not approved by Koyanskaya, degrading and eroding them, while driving creatures that enter it mad, reducing them to slobbering beasts delighted to do Koyanskaya’s will. As a final form of this Noble Phantasm, the fog that exists within Koyanskaya’s soul can be allowed to leak into the real World, engulfing it as her own territory. Any territory claimed this way counts as being within her Reality Marble for all beneficial purposes, including the endless horde of horrors ready to tear into your enemies. While they cannot leave the fog, any who enter it are just as unlikely to leave. Be careful utilizing this last aspect within this Jump, the Counter Force would be extremely unhappy with its existence, should you attempt it.

      "description": "Even as a Beast, Medusa, now Gorgon, will keep her previous attitude to you, being completely docile and almost reverent towards you, despite her now immense power. Thanks to being a Beast, Gorgon’s stats will change, with EX in NP and Mana, A+ in Strength and A in every other stat. Her magical energy is immense enough to warp the space around her, and would usually cause your immediate death, but she has restrained it so that you can freely interact with her. As the Mother of all life on Earth Gorgon holds a supreme level of authority over creatures descended or created on Earth, and with absolute understanding of life comes understanding of death. Thanks to this, Gorgon lacks the concept of Death entirely while her ‘children’ still exist. Her Personal Skills are as follows: Nega-Law B-: A Skill representing Gorgon’s Authority over the current logic of the World, this Skill allows her to insert herself as the core, ruling component of any kind of Order created by beings from planet Earth. Since the ultimate fate of a Mother is to watch her children grow beyond their care however, this Skill is ranked down, taking much more magical energy to use. Nevertheless, this is enough to exist within the Throne of Heroes as the core component of “Gorgon” a fake entity created to permit her existence as your Servant. Sea of Life EX: A Skill representing Gorgon’s nature as the Sea from which all life was created from, this Skill generates a dark, churning ocean beneath her feet, rippling with crimson veins. This ocean recreates the conditions from the Genesis of the Earth, thus creating an unlimited supply of True Ether for her to use while she is within its domain. Any creature caught in this ocean will be remade into Gorgon’s child, being imposed with a cellular-level Geis rendering them obedient to her. This contract can even warp Divine Spirits, in time. Monstrous Strength EX: By shaping the mud of the Sea of Life, Gorgon can attain enough strength to overpower even a Titan. Normally this Skill would require a corresponding sacrifice, however Gorgon can use this skill freely when certain conditions are met due to her Noble Phantasm. Her Class Skills will change to being Beast class Skills, being the following: Authority of the Beast A: This Skill grants a massive damage bonus against “All that which was born from the Mother’s Womb.” Since, after inheriting Tiamat’s power Gorgon would now be considered the Mother of all life on Earth, this damage bonus applies to anything classified as being alive. This Skill is inherited to a lesser extent by any future beasts she may birth. Independent Manifestation A-: A Skill born both out of Tiamat’s Authority and the journey Gorgon underwent to become a Beast, this grants immunity to time, instant death and erasure based attacks, as well as the ability to survive on an extremely slim amount of magical energy. Since Gorgon is now tied down as the Mother of Earth, she can only manifest on places considered part of Earth’s territory. Self-Modification D-EX: While normally this Skill would receive a massive rank down due to Gorgon’s nature as your Servant tying her down to the current World, the existence of the Sea of Life within her permits her to act as her own ‘Mother’ and thus use this authority to modify herself. She can either consume the mud created in that Sea to expand her form to that of a massive dragon, granting her immunity to attacks below A++ in power, or alternatively, with enough patience it may be possible to attain this defence without increasing in size by compressing the ‘Life’ it comes from within her womb. When it comes to Noble Phantasms, she will gain the following: Composite Deity Gorgon A+: Primarily an Anti-Unit (Self) Noble Phantasm, this allows gorgon to instantly assume a gigantic form representing not just the monster Gorgon, but also the Goddess Gorgon, and the Goddess Tiamat as well. In this form, she gains two pairs of wings, and her legs transform into a massive snake tail, over one hundred meters in length. While this NP is active, the Skill Monstrous Strength EX can be used with no consequences. The main asset of this Noble Phantasm is Deity Gorgon’s ability to constantly transform the World around her into her ‘temple’ while in this form. Within her temple, all life that she dislikes is instantly liquefied and assimilated into the Sea of Life. It would take either Divinity or Magic Resistance at rank A to survive within this area if Gorgon desires a target dead. While in this state, Gorgon can summon the armour of Athena, originally worn by her Saber class form, and a mixed form of Harpe and Chrysaor, a purple scythe decorated with golden patterns that deals wounds that can never heal. Crown of Life A: A Noble Phantasm representing Gorgon’s Authority as a Beast, it is a crown of golden horns glowing in red patterns. By channelling magical energy into her horns, Gorgon can warp the space around her to become beneficial to life beloved by her. Within an area of five kilometres around Gorgon, any allies gain one rank up to all parameters, while allied magic increases in rank and potency by two ranks. Echidna’s Cradle EX: The ever expanding Primordial Sea from where all life came from, this is a personal Texture, and the source of Gorgon’s Authority. This Noble Phantasm has several uses; by touching a human being, even with just her magical energy, Gorgon can instantly warp them into a demonic beast under her control. While weak enough that it would take hundreds to overwhelm a Servant, there is an alternate method to creating them, by spilling her blood onto the ground, she can spawn dozens of these monsters from the resulting puddle. Second, Gorgon can take in essence from you to lay demon beast eggs, it will take her about one day to lay up to two dozen eggs at once, the beasts born from these eggs are not strong enough to match a Servant on their lonesome, but a few working together would overwhelm one with relative ease. A third form of this Noble Phantasm is its ability to be used much like a Reality Marble, creating an endless sea of dark, rippling water with veins visible just beneath it. The sky is a light red, and the sun is black. Swimming under the pitch black depths of this ocean lay an innumerable amount of demonic beasts Gorgon can call upon, should the need for them exist. All creatures within this space count as being within Gorgon’s temple and in range of her Crown of Life, but the effects here are strengthened. Gorgon can control the ocean in this Reality Marble with a thought, and is capable of crushing anything with an effectively infinite amount of the Primordial Sea of Life. At the centre of this ocean lies a platform, just barely submerged under the water by an inch, atop this platform lay several broken stone columns reaching hundreds of meters into the sky, with dark chains dangling from them. Beings Gorgon can’t, or doesn’t want to kill, can be bound in these chains restricting them from using their power so long as they aren’t stronger than her. There are twelve of these pillars atop the stone platform, surrounding a throne of stone where you are meant to sit. As a final form of this Noble Phantasm, by touching the ocean within the real World, Gorgon can superimpose the Sea of Life with it, spreading her domain into the current texture of reality, while her control and the areas the demonic beasts can survive in are only the parts currently taken over, given enough time this could merge with all the oceans on Earth, and it will still apply the aminoGeis. Be careful when ordering her to use this last aspect, the Counter Force would not be too happy with it. Requires Command Seals | Primary Servant | Tantric Transferer."

      "description": "The Whore will drink this mud, and you will see patterns in the shape of glowing crimson veins slowly cover her body, forming intricate tattoos, the more Grails she drinks from, the more intricate these will be, until they coalesce in a third eye on her forehead. On the seventh Grail this eye will open, and she will evolve into Draco, the Beast of Sodom. Draco will rush forward and embrace you, beginning to madly kiss you. In between the bouts of feverish kissing, she will shower you with praise, and declare you her king. The King of the Seven Sins. After the two of you finally get all the exhilaration out of your systems, she will explain exactly what she can do as a Beast now Aside from an incredible, nearly infinite amount of magical energy, all her stats will raise to A, with the exception of Mana and NP, which will be EX. Usually the taint in her magical energy, as well as the sheer amount of it, would be enough to incinerate any normal human who got close to her, and even if you could survive, you would be driven into madness from the presence of such incredibly concentrated sin, but as Draco’s King, not only are you always safe from this, she has restrained her aura to the point that she can exist in a way that is safe for other creatures, to not cause you trouble. In terms of Personal Skills, she has: Festering Sin C-: A Skill that gives Draco the ability to instantly drive someone into maddening sin simply by existing, since she not only had humanity choose to embrace sin voluntarily, but also sealed her own aura, this skill receives a massive rank down, and can be resisted with enough willpower. Hell’s Envoy A+: An ability that symbolizes Draco’s nature as “One who is like Satan.” This skill allows for the birth and creation of demons, both imaginary and real that carry within them a fragment of Draco’s sin, as well as the ability to consume ‘that which belongs to Heaven.’ Since Draco has chosen to only create winged demons as a further mockery to the divine, this limits her domain to the sky, and this Skill receives a rank down. The First Judge A+: An ability granted to Draco by her third eye, when open she can instantly judge what sin a being is most suited towards, and if they have committed this sin, instantly rip away their vitality scaling with how much they have sinned. A truly great sinner could have their soul consumed with just a single glance. Since this skill consumes vitality through a targets sin, it bypasses normal Magic Resistance. Her Class Skills are the following: Nega-Heaven EX: As one who got humanity to deny their chance at Heaven and Salvation voluntarily, Draco can deny the existence of ‘Heaven’ itself, as well as any Miracles derived from it. In essence, this negates any Skills or abilities born from faith or purity, while also denying the existence of the afterlife. Thanks to this, Draco can deny the hold the Counter Force would have on her Servant container and exist for you. Authority of the Beast B: A relatively low level Skill because of its exclusivity, this grants Draco a scaling damage bonus depending on how much her target has sinned, with greater sinners taking more damage. Independent Manifestation C: A Skill that grants immunity to instant death, erasure and time based attacks, this also allows Draco to exist on very small amounts of magical energy. This Skill is ranked so low, because Draco can only manifest in locations where the concentration of sin is high enough. For Noble Phantasms, Draco has the following three: Seven Pointed Crown A+: A Noble Phantasm representing the seven crimson horns atop her head, her Beast’s Crown, when activated, they create a field around Draco that cripples all enemies if they can resonate with one of the horns, and each horn represents one of the seven sins. The more types of sin you have committed; the more horns you will resonate with. A single horn would see enemies becoming fatigued at a blistering pace, while resonating with four horns would give them a rank down to all their Stats. Resonating with all seven horns gives Draco instant and complete Authority over the targets soul. Draco can select targets to render them immune to the effects of this NP. Brimstone Gold B-A+: Draco’s golden claws, when inactive they act as a B ranked Anti-Unit NP that poisons anything they touch with All Mankind’s Evils. If she decides to circulate magical energy, the gold will begin to show cracks, which emit crimson and black fire. This fire, which can be manipulated and shaped by Draco, has a massive Anti-Magic and Anti-Divinity effect. Actually making contact with the claws in this state could turn weaker Divine Spirits to ash in an instant. The fire will only harm targets Draco wants harmed. Aurea Poculum: World of Depravity EX: Draco’s inner World manifesting as a personal Texture and Authority, this represents her existence as “the Beast from Hell; Satan.” It could be said that in truth, Draco is the realm of Hell herself. This Noble Phantasm can be used in several ways. The first allows Draco to summon and mentally manipulate constructs of cursed gold, the gold shines with a black light, and any targets struck by it will become obsessed with it, no longer fighting in order to gather as many of these constructs as they can. After being struck several times, depending on the targets willpower, they will begin to beg Draco to impale and kill them with this gold, so their ‘wealth’ will never leave them. The second is Draco’s ability to create Dragons, which can be created in two ways, Dragons shaped from mud will only last for one hour, and won’t be as strong as they could be. Dragons birthed by Draco herself will take one week to hatch, but will be children of Satan, not only are they strong enough to sweep aside most Servants, their very presence brings forth a part of Draco’s inner Hell into the World around them, making the air toxic and acidic where ever they fly. Third is Draco’s ability to swap this Texture with the current one, utilizing it like a reality Marble; this space is full of small islands of barren stone, crackling with flames, floating over an endless sky filled with crimson clouds. Dancing between the clouds are glimmers of red scales, and you can hear the deafening roar of countless Dragons until a quick glare from Draco drops the place into absolute silence. Should an enemy end up in this space, they will find the ground becoming superheated wherever they try to stand, until it begins to burn them alive, and even the sky is not safe, since cursed gold weapons will rain endlessly from the clouds, with no regards to gravity. At the centre of this endless world of clouds lies a massive island, that can only be reached by Draco personally leading you there, surrounded by a circle of flames lies a throne of what looks to be flowing blood, Draco is quite insistent you help her break it in when she first shows you this place. As a final use, Draco can expand this realm into the sky of the real World, slowly taking it over, converting ‘Heaven’ to Hell itself. Be careful if you order Draco to do this, the Counter Force would very much prefer you didn’t. You can choose if Draco will have her wolf aesthetic or her dragon aesthetic for free.

She spent a long time as a prisoner inside of a dungeon while her sister made the country born with rage and the desire to bring her back. As an Assassin Servant she is not very different from her male counterpart, still quite capable in the arts of war if inferior compared to Nobunaga. However she also is surprisingly good at motivating others, especially if it is to protect her.

After figuring out some context clues it seems to be about a different Chaldean Master from another timeline who got fed up with them and a powerful Magus who was sympathetic to their plight? Whatever Astolfo used to do it appears she feels genuine remorse for it nowadays and doesnt seek to have it be lifted as some form of penance. In fact she has started to enjoy being a woman, as one might expect from how Astolfo deals with a sudden shift like this. Her lust seems unquenched as ever but she is unable to even act on it without her Masters explicit permission.

Getting to know her would eventually reveal the truth. Despite stalling for 1001 Nights she was murdered by the King only for the passing God Anansi, African God of Stories, to be outraged and grant her some of his Authority to escape and take the Throne by force. She embodies the Arabian Nights themselves now and is determined to do her part in bringing about Happy Endings."

      "description": "A little history lesson for you. The Gods of South America have a little more complicated origin than most other divinities. The Meteor that killed the dinosaurs brought with itself a set of microorganisms. Eventually dubbed the Divine Filament, they empowered the land and lifeforms before finally running out of energy and entrusting humanity with their wish to return to the stars. A small fraction of these microorganisms seem to have survived however, like a miniscule amount of bacteria can survive disinfectant. Taking the shape and name of two of the most renowned Goddesses they helped bring forth, Quetzalcoatl and Kukulkan, they are a dual Servant of the Moon Cancer class of all things. Dressed in Swimsuits they simply enjoy traveling the lands of humanity, occasionally using their Authorities to test them and see if they can return to the stars. They are not as strong as two Goddesses however. The proper Quetzalcoatl of PHH is very much their superior given how much they run on fumes and they seem to require perfect synergy to use their Authorities. Perhaps this represents some sort of symbiosis?"

So it may come as a surprise that this Kriemhild never even heard of Siegfried. Instead, somehow, she was the one who wielded Balmung against a Dragon and went around the lands, adventuring to have a change of pace from her life as a Princess. She too bathed in his blood, though a leaf covered the spot right above her heart and gained some draconic traits. She continued to travel the world to find purpose and died ultimately alone but happy with her adventures. Now as a Saber Servant she sees an opportunity to have some of that domestic bliss she never got to have. She is quite attached to you and wants to have a happy life with her Master. ...Do not hurt her heart. Do not get yourself killed. This is still Kriemhild and the fallout of denying her love and affection so cruelly would be cataclysmic."

However this exact set of abilities is why the Beast Kama used them for her Ooku. This dual Servant consisting of the two of them must have been involved in a similar situation. Though... it certainly must have gone differently. Maybe Lady Kasuga fused in part with the both of them and there was a dispute between them and Kama over who had more control over the Ooku? In any case Kama seems gone and instead... these two lovely women are here. You'd be hard pressed to find ladies who are more enchanting just by their appearance and their magical reserves are vast. The Ooku itself can be created by them as well, in the form of a Reality Marble that offers all kinds of worldly delights and is difficult to traverse without losing oneself completely. They have an incredibly close bond as a result of sharing two halves of Kasuga and their shared experiences, that seems more than platonic and would be happy to name you their Tokugawa."

      "description": "Not every timeline in the Nasuverse leads to Chaldea. And in these timelines Ritsuka Fujimaru never does end up as the Last Master of Humanity. Perhaps some of them simply continue living a normal life. This Ritsuka is not one of them. Her world is quite drastically different from most, something out of a Mecha Anime like Evangelion where humanity had to band together to fight foreign invaders. She was one of the Pilots, the Mecha she commanded based on the Aletheia body of the God Ares, most likely being the War Gods shell repurposed and upgraded by human Mages and Scientists. She became as good a Pilot as she was a Master in a different timeline, leading the final charge against the alien lifeforms. In fact, she won, though at the cost of her own life. Her heroism was not forgotten by the Throne as she became summonable in Chaldea. She is very confused about finding any other versions of herself but doesnt let that keep her down. Having some of the iconic Type-Moon Main Character charm, endless willpower and a kind heart, makes this Ruler a force to be reckoned with. She is weak physically, no Gun God or Lostbelt King in terms of power and on the level of a normal human. Her Noble Phantasm however, the very Mecha with which she battled threats to humanity with, allows her to stand up to a lot and have a good chance of winning. You might be amused to hear that the Team that built it named her Mech 'Galahad'."

      "description": "The last Pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty, Nitocris committed her life to avenge her brothers. Drowning the treacherous man who tried to besmirch the status of a Pharaoh and have her become nothing but a puppet, it is said she killed herself without making any preparations to join her brothers in eternal paradise. This Rider Class Servant version of Nitocris isnt entirely sharing that story however. She achieved her revenge but someone still loyal to the divine right of the Pharaoh's refused to deny her the mummification ceremony, doing it on her and laying her to rest so she may do her final journey. Something that Nitocris even in death was entirely unwilling to do. Instead her Saint Graph continued to shift till the name Nitocris became synonymous with 'an existence that endlessly traverses the underworld'. She has all the powers of her Caster Self and commands the Solar Barque Mesektet, much like Ozymandias. Her own version does not represent Ra as much as it embodies his journey through the underworld every night and Authorities and Techniques of the Egyptian Underworld have become tightly interwoven with her, on top of her connection to Horus. On and around the Barque, filled with potent weaponry, it is like being within the Underworld. It is Manned by the enslaved spirits of the traitors she killed, eternally punished to truly serve her. Nitocris sees this power she has as a Servant, rivaling that of Ozymandias and some Underworld Gods, but does not think herself worthy of it. She still thinks of herself as unworthy of paradise, stuck wearing the bandages that are supposed to grant her mortal shell rest. Perhaps with her new 'allied partner' she can find some peace?"

Kama was incinerated and the flames would never stop burning her for they were the destruction meant to end the universe. It gave Kama understandably a lot of grief when it concerns her fellow Gods and a lot of hatred for them. This Kama however seemed to have gotten some sort of closure about the whole thing. How? Simple. She killed Shiva. The flames that burned her listen to her completely as she absorbed the authority that commanded them. There was quite a bit of Chaos in the Indian Pantheon after that... but it eventually ended with one thing: Kama as the acknowledged Goddess of Destruction and Love, rather content being one of the unquestionable supreme Gods. Now she was summoned as a Servant and incineration of humanity? Bleaching of Earth? Have you considered burning them to death? It worked for her. You probably wouldn't expect a Ruler to be this outspoken in favour of bloody revenge but her it genuinely gave peace and she is without a wish now. She presents herself as a lovely, encouraging and seductive Goddess and seems very interested in fostering your growth. Or perhaps ‘creating’ it. Seems her new authority gave her some new perspectives."

The Lostbelt itself will follow you on your chain as a pocket dimension separate from the Jump, though certainly insertable into any future Jumps. In fact due to your actions it is no mere fantasy anymore, having the same validity and weight as Proper Human History and being a Lost World like Fairy Britain. This also means that the inhabitants of the Lost World can leave your world. Your Lost World, if inserted, can also ‘devour’ territory and make it a part of itself by spreading its influence and roots, allowing you to take the territory with you as well. Doing so to a fellow Lostbelt would still require you to take down the Tree of Fantasy however. Your Lost World also will not need to be Pruned by Chaldea to restore humanity, as you can simply take it with you. Of course its Lostbelt King also comes with you, no doubt grateful for all your help and happy to have you as their ‘partner’."
