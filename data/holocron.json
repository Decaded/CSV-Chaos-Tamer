Jedi are also able to experience years of traumatic missions, and while they are still affected by these traumas, most are able to move on and maintain a healthy mental state. You have internalized these aspects of the Jedi and possess crystal clear memory and instantaneous recall. Even better, you are guaranteed to recover from any mental traumas you receive. This might take a few weeks for some of the more disturbing things you encounter on your missions and a few months for failing to save a loved one. But even encountering something beyond reality would only break you for a couple of years at most and each time you recover from such trauma you will find yourself a little more resistant to similar traumas afterwards.",

This perk also allows you to work out how any materials could be incorporated into your lightsaber such as knowing how best to use Katchin in the lightsabers frame or how to process Taydenite into a lightsaber focusing crystal.",

Second, you can re-experience any of the space battles you have fought in the past, taking on the role you took then. These recreations are mostly accurate, but are limited by your own understanding of what transpired. Finally, you can take part in ‘random’ battles between the Empire and the New Republic, occurring in various locations and with different fleet compositions. In this last type, many pilots may take part at the same time, each with their own starfighter. In these simulations, you can choose to use any of the ten starfighters available to the player in Star Wars: Squadrons: X-wing, Y-wing, A-wing, U-wing, B-wing, TIE fighter, TIE bomber, TIE interceptor, TIE reaper, and TIE defender. These ships can come with any loadout present in Star Wars: Squadrons. If a participant owns their own starship, then they can alternatively choose to use that starship instead. True death or chain failure does not occur during these simulations; being killed or having your starship destroyed will instead safely eject a person from the simulation. Likewise, owned starships used here are not permanently damaged.

      "description": "There’s no denying it, you are one of the best pilots the galaxy has to offer. Whether it’s an all around starfighter, interceptor, bomber, or support craft, you can pilot it to an incredible standard. Off course, the truly successful pilot has something more than raw skill on their side. While piloting a starfighter, you have what Wedge would refer to as “Skywalker luck”. Allies show up to assist at opportune times, exploding debris or environmental dangers will miss when they normally wouldn’t, you’ll manage to escape exploding ships or stations you have blown up from the inside, and things in general just tend to go your way",

      "description": "Somewhere out in space is this large starship manufacturing facility. On par with the New Republic’s Nadiri Dockyards, it is capable of producing anything from starfighters to capital ships as large as a Starhawk. In order to produce these ships, you will need to provide the necessary materials. If you lack them, you can offer up currency to have the dockyards source them for you, even in non-Star Wars settings. The cost of materials sourced in this way is substantially marked up from their base value. Only materials used in the construction of the starships appearing in Star Wars: Squadrons can be sourced in this way. Once you have the materials, the dockyards will need to know how to build the desired ship in question. To begin with, the dockyards are capable of building either all of the New Republic starships shown in Star Wars: Squadrons (minus Starhawk-class battleships), or all of the Imperial starships shown in Star Wars: Squadrons. If you can provide sufficient blueprints, or teach the dockyard crew in some other manner, then the construction of other kinds of ships will be possible as well. Beyond these two conditions, there are also the practical concerns of production time and space within the dockyards, which limit how many ships the dockyards can churn out at a time. The dockyards are outfitted with various defences, and possesses a number of hangars from which a small force of starfighters could be kept. They come with a sufficient crew to run and maintain them, which count as followers but cannot leave the dockyards.",

Those cynics would no doubt say that such instances of honest statesmanship are the exception to the trend, but then they haven’t met you. A cunning linguist, master debater and historic orator; your voice cuts through the din of debate and dismissal like a lightsaber through the air, as your words have a deepened impact on the minds of others and invariably force them to think on what you have said. Even when you speak as an otherwise uninvested party, your words have a strong influence beyond that of most of those involved but it is when you have a stake in the subject that your speeches become truly profound. When those you represent or a cause you’ve long championed is the focus of plight or policy, then you alone can stop previously certain acts and set whole new precedents in galactic politics.",

Above the Valley of Kings, greatest of the Sith of old, sits the Korriban Academy. This school has played host to some of the greatest Sith to ever cut through the Galaxy. Currently under the control of Lord Qordis, the school serves to shape the young Sith into powerful and precise weapons of the Brotherhood’s will. With this purchase you will be made headmaster of this most illustrious school. When training under its roof you’ll find the rate of advancement for your seemingly supernatural talents will rise immensely. A little difficult to quantify, you’ll find yourself progressing faster than one would think possible.

The weapon rapidly disables mechanical targets, stopping troop transports and armoured vehicles in one or two shots. It also completely atomises organic targets, leaving no trace of them for others to find. Unlike the TC-17, you will never have to reload this particular rifle.

This monster is an absolute terror to face and represents the pinnacle of Imperial Naval technology; armed with five hundred and fifty heavy laser cannons and another five hundred turbolasers this ship is capable of easily smashing almost any other Star Wars ship in a straight slugfest. What it can’t beat in such a fight can easily be annihilated with its axial superlaser which is strong enough to crack planetary shields and slag continents and hit moving targets in battle. The ship is also equipped with ten gravity well generators to ensure opponents can’t make a run for it and a compliment of 600 TIE Interceptors and 96 TIE Bombers for fighter purposes. The warship comes crewed with droids and a standard crew.",

While these men and women are nowhere near as numerous as the armies of the Galactic Empire and only number about 500,000 they are still well trained and battle hardened veterans of the Clone Wars. They also come equipped with mid-tier weaponry and a small fleet of Clone Wars era warships.",
