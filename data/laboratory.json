This individual is a Sororitas Canoness who wields a powerful set of Paragon Wargear. This is one of the most valuable and venerable pieces of equipment used by the Sororitas. This woman has a close relationship with you and cares for you a great deal. She could even tolerate you performing acts of heresy without trying to kill you. In addition to this she has a small group of followers made up of six Celestian Sisters. These women are her so-called daughters. They will do anything in their power to protect their Canoness and due to your relationship with her you as well. You may design the personality, appearance, and your exact relationship with each of these women as you wish.",

That is why you need someone to protect your back. This soldier is a grizzled veteran of many battles. She has skill in wielding most of the weapons of the Imperial Guard and even when push comes to shove, she can also handle non-Imperial weaponry due to a rare pass from the inquisition combined with more combat experience than any normal human should ever have to have. How could she get this amount of influence? Nobody knows. She tends to act like the mother of the squad, always caring for everyone, but especially for you. She will notice, when you are tired and guard you, when you are at your weakest. If you fall asleep at your job, she will give you a lap pillow. Hanging around her for some time will peel more information about her previous work. She used to work for inquisition as one of the personal kill teams of one of the Inquisitors with huge reach in this part of the space. Which explains why she gets access to more weirder weapons in her arsenal. Her youthful appearance is also a result of rejuvenat treatments as her service to Inquisition was long one.

Like much of the Primaris’ armory, the Redemptor is a versatile machine, and may be armed with several weapons. The primary armament of a Redemptor, mounted on the right arm, is either an anti-infantry Heavy Onslaught Gatling Cannon for cutting down lightly armored foes in a hail of shells or a heavy Macro Plasma Incinerator, for destroying heavier armored targets with concentrated bolts of plasma. Mounted under the power fist on the other arm is either a Heavy Flamer or a lighter Onslaught Gatling Cannon, while the torso is fitted with either dual Fragstorm Grenade Launchers or paired Storm Bolters. An anti-air Icarus Missile System finishes off the Redemptor’s armaments, with all of this powered by an extremely potent plasma reactor. Of course, while the Redemptor does pack heavy firepower and is unusually responsive to its crippled occupant, there is a small flaw to the machine: The improved performance also puts increased strain on its occupant, causing those of weaker will to be ‘burned out’ by the demands put on their damaged bodies. Still, in these dark times, one thing the Imperium does not lack is more dying heroes... When purchased, you may choose to either have an ‘empty’ Dreadnought chassis for use by a critically wounded companion, or you may choose to have it already filled by a fallen Primaris Astartes who can serve as a Companion",

Shackled around your forearm, this device is a miniature force field generator, one that produces a conversion field on par with that of a Rosarius. Unlike a Rosarius however, the field’s primary purpose is not to deflect incoming blows, even if it does the task very well. Instead, the field absorbs the energy of anything that strikes it and redirects it towards an array of containment devices by the shield around your wrist. Once redirected, you can focus this energy into the shield’s firing chamber and send it straight back at the source in a blinding blast of heat and light.",

Its properties aid concealment during covert operations. Unlike the standard variant used by various forces in the Imperium, this cloak provides a limited radiation resistance and exceptional insulation against electrical attacks, halving their strength. This CP backed cloak has mesh underlay that provides better protection to its wearer than a Flak Armour.",

It functions by targeting the Kaylon’s synchronization matrix, allowing the safe destruction of the Kaylon with a sufficient power source. A large quantum reactor can enable the device to destroy all Kaylon’s in a 1,000 light year range. However, this device is even more peculiar because it allows the total destruction of any mechanical entity. Do you want to destroy the T-1000s and Skynet from Terminator? No problem, hook the device up to a powerful energy source and fire it up. It can also selectively target different machine entities, such as destroying the Borg, but leaving the Androids like Data unharmed. It can even differentiate between mechanical individuals that you want to selectively destroy, such as the Borg Queen, although you will require detailed scans of the Borg Queen to destroy her only and vice versa. With this device you, a mere meat bag, holds the sword of Damocles over all the races of machine nature. Furthermore, it will return to you if lost or destroyed in one month, and you have blueprints to create more.",

Unfortunately for them you possess another one of these mega-scale war achines, waiting in a strange dimensional space for you to call it into reality at your will. Its mechanisms also allow you to transport yourself and any forces with you into it at a thought, and it otherwise acts as an entire mobile Tomb World fit to lay siege to entire systems and potentially bring entire sectors to heel with its power. Should it be destroyed you may call it forth once more every ten years or after you have entered a new jump, and it will retain any changes you make that you wish it to. It comes with the schematics and designs for you to potentially engineer more should you have the means.",

Despite all this it is not a warship – by Lantean standards – as it has all the facilities necessary to support half a million Lanteans in luxury.

And, even worse, was as much a glorified art installation as it was an actual vessel. Bluntly, it is a massive target, obscenely expensive, lacks much in the way of agility, and is Perhaps the most poorly designed combat vessel in the Citadel Fleet. That doesn’t mean it can’t gut a dreadnought in a single shot, destroy individual Reapers in one on one combat, and probably crush entire fleets of conventional ships if it’s prepared.Just be ready to shell out every time you wanna so much as turn the lights on.",

It has the ability to use hyperspace to travel, but it’s incredibly slow in comparison to a fleet or a ship. It doesn’t need to move too close to destroy its targets. As long as it’s not more than halfway across the Galaxy, it will hit. After draining the dark energy, or quintessence of a Star to power itself, the Starkiller can fire five beams capable of destroying a planet each. Takes a day to recharge, but much less if just for one target. If bought with the Mega-Flagship, you can have it docked on the base, and everything about the staff and future Jump interactions on that ship apply here as well even if you didn’t buy it. You can also choose to be on the base as your starting location, somewhere in the same system as your rolled one.",

When taken by a non-Speedster it grants them brief access to the Speed Force, allowing them to run at 100mph but they're unable to pull off Speed Tricks as a true Speedster. Comes with six vials and the formula to make more.",

These creatures might not be the size of the Fenrisian Wolves of myth, but they are still huge, having more in common with a Terran rhinoceros than a canine in size.

Devised by the brilliant but twisted mind of Faber, the Master Builder, this ten thousand kilometer wide ring world releases a powerful burst of cross-phased supermassive neutrinos that are capable of destroying all life in an entire star system. Properly tuned and powered, they could do more than that: they could kill all neurologically complex life in 25,000 light years around them. Not even the neuro-physical structures left by the Precursors are spared. Due to the nature of the energy released, which ignores space and time, the pulse sweeps through their target region near instantly. Halo isn’t just a sledgehammer weapon though. It can be wielded with precision: Its pulse can be concentrated into a beam to avoid uninvolved casualties. Its energy can be tuned to target specific species as well. What this weapon has in power, though, it lacks in defense. Four forerunner cruisers could destroy one of these rings together in one shot. Alternatively you could use this ring in the way the Librarian had hoped: As a habitat and research center for lifeforms. A safe haven.",

Through mechu-deru, mechanical structures could be bound to the will of the user and imbued with the power of the Force itself. Belia Darzu took it to an extreme in her creation of Technobeasts, Part machine, part organic alchemical constructs, these monsters infect living organisms with the nanogene spore, a technovirus that slowly lobotomises victims as they transition into loyal weaponised cyborgs. All of Darzu’s workings are detailed in these notes; with extensive study you may produce plagues beyond even her galaxy shaking abomination.",

You may also use your gene-lab to grow subjects from the ground up, should you desire it. A truly, spectacularly, ridiculously overpowered Gellar field is built into the lab’s center. It is inscribed with two words: NUNQUAM ITERUM. The field covers the entirety of the lab, and is guarenteed to never fail. Even should every god and daemon to ever exsist join forces in an attempt to breach it, it will hold.",

It will manage itself and churn out research into various mundane technologies on its own, though you can direct it to specific purposes, and will manage its own staffing, though you can hire or fire staff as you please (within limits, don’t expect to hire an entire sept to work for this lab). But moreover, this laboratory has some unique properties. Firstly, no research you perform will result in catastrophic destruction, by accident or by sabotage. No nanobots you research here will result in a Grey Goo scenario, no virus will mutate into a global pandemic, no dinosaurs will be unleashed on the public as a staffer flees with their DNA. If such research would normally result in such an issue, your staff will find that their research just stalls, failing to progress at all but not resulting in harm. And secondly, if you deign to perform research in this laboratory personally, then you, and your staff, will find your research accelerated by an order of magnitude as research cycles blaze by and prototype units roll out of machine shops far more quickly than possible, so long as you personally spend at least 40 man-hours a week performing research of some kind, with lesser boosts available if you spend less time contributing to the labs productivity.",

It’s not a patch on what the average Space Marine wields in battle, but it could be useful, yes? The crate is refilled once a month when nobody's looking. Curious.",

Everything in here will be somewhat useful to you, but you get to decide if it’s use is as a source of resources, or if something is worth fixing. The doorway takes the appearance of an expandable hula hoop that opens a portal to the pocket universe. The pocket universe will refill with junk as you travel, or as the local area around you generates junk that will be siphoned off.",

However, some of those drives require specialized fuels to either power the drive as no reactor has the power density to break the speed of light or the FTL drive requires a unique property of that fuel to operate, such as Tylium. The UDF or Universal Dysonium Fuel has you covered then, as this is a universal fuel that allows it to substitute all other possible fuels for every single FTL type drive or device. Dysonium is a transuranic element that can be naturally mined or artificially created either way, when you refine Dysonium into fuel every possible FTL drive will operate regardless of any other requirements. Your Battlestar ran out of Tylium? No problem, just use UDF, which only requires the energy of the Quantum Reactor equipped on the Orville or another equivalent to artificially produce it in bulk quantities. Also comes, with an ingredients list detailing how to produce this refined Dysonium fuel so that your allies or companions or NPCs can create it by themselves, so long as they have a power source equal to that of the reactor on the Orville. Additionally, there is another set of instructions to make solid Dysonium crystals, which can be used to create material specific FTL drives. So if your Jump Drive cannot operate without Handwavium or something else that is fictional, just replace it with solid Dysonium.",

An Arvus Lighter is a small, general-purpose cargo hauler. Nicknamed “the Hog”, “the Little Pig”, and “the Onager” for reasons lost to time, this shuttle is a personal favorite of the Imperial Navy. Equipped with two powerful engines, this little vessel is void-capable and capable of carrying a few tons of cargo with every trip, along with a dozen passengers, a lot more if you’re willing to squeeze them in. Unfortunately, the Arvus Lighter is bereft of weapons, unless you count the Chaff Launchers. It may be durable but try not to stay on the battlefield too long.",

These bolts of plasma are capable of punching through over a quarter of a meter of case-hardened steel.

Even a near miss is deadly, capable of inflicting 3rd degree burns and any splash damage from it is about as dangerous as a traditional grenade. As for ammunition, you’ll never need to worry about that. This thing has unlimited ammunition.
