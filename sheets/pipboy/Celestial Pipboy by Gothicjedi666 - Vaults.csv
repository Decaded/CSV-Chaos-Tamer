0 CP,Dog House ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Despite its name, it doesn't have to house a dog, but rather any pet that isn't big enough to be ridden.

It's also filled with numerous toys and food bowls that are refilled each day and self cleans."
0 CP,Exhaustive Pantry ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"There are two things that humans desperately need. Water, and food. Thankfully, it seems as though your base won't run out of the latter.

0 CP,Terminal Access,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Well, it looks like you believe in PC superiority, or couldn't go without computers for very long.

400 CP,Vault-Tec Certified,Fallout: The Resource Wars,"As a company, Vault-Tec is known for a wide variety of things, but one of the most obvious is the sheer durability and shelf life of their products, regardless of what they are.

You now own a perfect copy of the planet Earth in all its glory, one that is completely untouched by human hands.
