0 CP,The Mechanist,Fallout: Automatrons,"A girl with a talent for machinery and an earnest desire to help people, she was inspired by a comic she came across to don the mantle of The Mechanist, a superhero who saved others through his robotic creations. She’s very skilled when it comes to building and repairing robots, and could probably build a protectron with her eyes closed."
0 CP,Edge Runner ,Fallout: Automatrons,"A young man who underwent cybernetic enhancements, he made a life for himself as a mercenary. In addition to his skill with firearms and can greatly enhance his speed, his tolerance for cybernetics is insane, with very few of the downsides ever appearing. Though he doesn’t have a dream of his own, perhaps he could help you accomplish yours?"
0 CP,Eyebot Duraframe Subject-E ,Fallout: Automatrons,"An eyebot made by the Enclave in an experiment to make a more combat-focused model.

0 CP,Mr. Handy,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Developed by General Atomics International before the Great War and refined in collaboration with RobCo Industries, the Mr. Handy model is the best household helper on the market. It can whip up delicious meals, clean your home, walk the dog, cut your hair, and defend the family from home invaders. It’ll even talk with a British accent to solidify the butler aesthetic. This one in particular recognizes you as its master. Comes with a spiffy bowler hat."
0 CP,Patriotic Robot,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"A customized Mister Gutsy model, created by General Atomics for mobile attacks prior to the Great War, and scavenged from parts by

Though, it isn’t very good at mimicking emotions, and its Austrian accent makes it stand out even more."
100 CP,Iron Assassin ,Fallout: Automatrons,"A modified assaultron with a rust-red coat of paint, this misanthropic robot was programmed to be a deadly assassin. It’s a master of dozens of weapons, its movements are muffled, it houses an invisibility unit, and is always eager to go out and kill more meatbags. It must also obey all of your commands and cannot harm you, rules that it will inevitably complain about."
100 CP,Sentry Bot,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Of all the robots found in the Wasteland, the Sentry Bot is one of the most feared. Armored in thick steel and equipped with a gatling laser and rocket launcher, you'd need a lot of firepower to bring it down, if you can even survive more than a few minutes with it firing at you. This one recognizes you as its master and will follow your orders to the letter. It certainly helps that this one has infinite ammo."
100 CP,Interface ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Terminals are machines. You are a machine. Ergo, there is some overlap between the two of you, enough for a connection to form. You are capable of interfacing and interacting directly with any technology you run into, needing only a touch before you can start bending cyberspace to your whims."
100 CP,Eyebot,Fallout: Automatrons,"A hovering ball that looks more like a radio than a robot, many think that the eyebots are only good for target practice. While they may not be the most durable or devastating bots around, they're still faster and more maneuverable than most, and can play some snazzy tunes whenever you like."
100 CP,Protectron,Fallout: Automatrons,"The sturdy protectron model of robot was created before the Great War, and served as a security automaton in both the private and business sectors. Though many may make fun of them for their slow speed and low maneuverability, many forget that there's a reason a protectron could be found in nearly every place of business."

Still, they are big and bulky, as well as boasting an impressive amount of firepower."
100 CP,Assaultron ,Fallout: Automatrons,"The Assaultron was constructed by RobCo Industries and sold to the United States military as a frontline wartime combatant as early as 2072, and did very well, as it is fast and deadly at close range and employs a devastating laser at a distance, with some units even employing stealth technology. They are quick, nimble and customizable, with a variety of weaponry such as lasers and razor-sharp claws."
100 CP,Sentry Bot,Fallout: Automatrons,"One of the most dangerous robots found in the Wasteland, there's a reason why so many dread going against the sentry bot. They're big, durable, and have a hell of a lot of firepower to throw around. Unfortunately, their large size makes it difficult to get into certain areas, or make use of stealth in general,"
100 CP,Snip Snip ,Fallout TV Show Jump,"Originally a General Atomics Mister Handy assigned to a clinic, this robot has since been reprogrammed to serve you however you see fit. It’s been programmed to work the clinic, and as such has knowledge of the most modern medical practices. Given the post-apocalyptic flavor of the world, some of these practices may not be what you’d expect to see in a certified hospital. The robot’s chassis is armed with a rotary saw for short range and a tranquilizer launcher for long range. If you are so inclined, the sedatives in the tranq darts can be replaced with bleach for a more deadly outcome."
100 CP,General Repairs,Fallout TV Show Jump,"In a world where manufacturing is a thing of the past and almost everything originates in scavenged goods, the ability to effect some repairs is a must.

200 CP,Optimal Leader ,Fallout: Automatrons,"Liberty Prime was the greatest feat of American robotics, one that many would have mimicked, should it have been completed before the bombs fell. This was the only functioning prototype, a forty foot tall red and blue titan of steel, with the personality core of a valiant and caring leader installed in order to better inspire troops on the field. Equipped with an energy cannon on one arm and an axe in the other, few threats are capable of taking him down."
200 CP,Heroic AI ,Fallout: Automatrons,"Created in secret by a great programmer from Annexed Canada, he was inspired by comics in order to create a hero that could inspire the world to be better.

This one never seems to run out of power and cannot be hacked or subverted."
400 CP,Robotics Expert,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Robots are so much easier to deal with than humans, much less complex. You have an instinctive understanding of robots, finding it easier to predict their movements or next actions. This also helps with building, repairing, or deactivating them, as you know just what they need to be in top form and beyond, or rendering them completely harmless. Hell, you could even build an entire Protectron blindfolded, that's how good you are."
500 CP,Robot Workbench,Fallout Series (Imaged),"For those of you who wish to create your own army of automatons, then this is the best friend you'll ever have. This complex device is a matter transformation device, able to turn any raw materials you insert into the car-sized locker on the side into robots! And not only does it create robots, it can also improve them with a variety of upgrades. You can build and upgrade any common robots found in the American Wasteland, but the terminal that you use to manage all of this can also have schematics of robots from future worlds inserted, allowing you to create and upgrade them as well. Any robots created with this are of a higher quality than they otherwise would be."

In addition to all of that, your organs have also been given a tune up, allowing them to be more efficient than before."
600 CP,General Atomics,Fallout: Automatrons,"Many know of General Atomics, the company that brought you the iconic Mister Handy and Miss Nanny models of domestic robot servants, and now you seem to own one of their branches, or at the very least one of the factories. This facility is made for the express purpose of building robots, any kind that you desire. While it will net you a steady stream of revenue, that’s less important than the automatrons it pumps out in a steady stream, without any resources consumed. You can change what kind of robots are made by this company, if you’ve got the schematics, but it will change the rate of production. You can get one Mister Handy a day, but something on par with Liberty Prime would take a month."
