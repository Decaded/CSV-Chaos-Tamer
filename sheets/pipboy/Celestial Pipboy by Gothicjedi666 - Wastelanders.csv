0 CP,Old World Radio ,Fallout: Automatrons,"Just because there are long, empty stretches of Wasteland doesn't mean that it has to be silent, too. From any radio you can access this radio station, which plays music primarily from the 1930's to the 1950's. This is managed by a radio host, who is Three Dog by default, and they will comment on your actions, broadcast local news, and do a number of helpful ""Public Service Announcements"" for your current setting."
0 CP,Traveling Merchant ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"When you find yourself running low on supplies, whether that be medicine or ammo, they will appear like a knight in shining armor. This merchant, who is Moira Brown by default, comes by with a brahman cart filled with seemingly everything you need, and what they don't have they can locate for when you next meet. They can repair any of your gear and take unwanted possessions off your hands. They'll even show up in future worlds, with the appropriate wares. Of course, you'll still need to pay for their services. Can't exactly run a charity, you know."
0 CP,Man’s Best Friend ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Even if you lack any human friends, at least you'll have man's best friend by your side. This dog of any breed is friendly, well trained, and is extremely loyal to you. But it's also deadly to any enemies you may have, as they can bite through hardened leather and can survive taking a full clip from an assault rifle. They can be any breed of dog you want. They can even be a mutant dog or cyberhound."
0 CP,Irradiated Beauty,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Beauty is a very rare thing in this ruined, bleak world.

0 CP,Crazy Lover,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"A slave from Paradise Falls, Clover is as deadly with a blade as she is crazy. Crazy in a fight, crazy in the sack, crazy every which way but
loose! But most of all, she's crazy in love with whoever's holding her leash. As her new owner, she would devote her everything to you, even at the cost of her own life."
100 CP,The Storyteller,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Across the Wasteland, there are tales of an armored figure with a love of history and traveling with a special Eyebot.

He always seems to know the local history to a great degree, even in future worlds, and is always willing to give you a history lesson."
100 CP,Thief,Fallout Series (Imaged),"So many people, so many pockets, so many shinies. Whether you figured it out on its own or was taught it, you are quite the skilled pickpocket. Whether it's a sack of caps or a sidearm, you're confident you can take it so long as you're sneaky enough."
100 CP,Friend of the Night,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Many look at the night in fear of what it could be hiding underneath its blanket of shadows, but not you. You have perfect night vision, able to see in the darkest environments as if they were decently lit. This also protects you against sudden changes in light, so no need to worry about any flash bangs!"
100 CP,Cap Collector,Fallout Series (Imaged),"There was once an Old World expression. Money makes the world go around. While you aren't exactly sure if that's truly the case, money certainly does make things easier. You seem to gain more currency than you otherwise would have, be it in a trade deal or in someone's
locked safe."
100 CP,Scrapper,Fallout Series (Imaged),"There’s not a lot of new things being manufactured nowadays, so it's up to people like you to fix that as best you can. You can quickly and easily strip and tear apart practically anything into their base components. Doesn't matter if it's a sentry bot from a military base or a ramshackle shack out in the middle of nowhere, you are sure to find something valuable. Now it's just a matter of finding a use for them."
100 CP,Future Generations,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Humanity has lasted this long partly because when given no societal inhibitions, they just cannot keep it in their pants. But the little squirts that come around because of this need someone to help raise them and show them the right way to live. Thankfully, you’re the most qualified person around, being a great parent figure that can raise any child to being an emotionally healthy adult, regardless of the environment they were raised in."
100 CP,Entomologist ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"It is a serious crime against humanity that bugs have grown to be as large as they are. They were bad enough then they were smaller than your pinky nail, but now that some of them are bigger than cars? No thank you! How lucky we are to have you, then. You deal three times more damage to all arthropods, no matter how big or small."
100 CP,Begin Again ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"The past can be a dangerous thing, as it can hold us back from what we might be able to do in the future. Past regrets have no hold over you, nor do any other negative feelings, as you can shed them off and look to the future with the hope that everything will be just fine. Past flames won't stop you from finding new love, and harmful obsessions can be cast to the side where they have no hold over you. Let go and begin again."
100 CP,Scoundrel,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"You may not have been the most well behaved kid growing up, but the skills you've learned are certain to be useful. You're pretty stealthy, and you're a good pickpocket. You could probably sneak a live grenade onto someone and they wouldn't realize until it was too late."
100 CP,Rad Resistance ,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"Radiation is an insidious enemy, as its invisible fires mutate and twist as much as it does kill. You should consider yourself lucky, as you are now fifty percent resistant to the effects of radiation, and can flush it out of your system more easily than before."
200 CP,Hot Rod,Fallout: Automatrons,"As mankind advanced, so did their modes of transportations. From horses to planes, there were few as widespread before the bombs fell as cars, and no car was as reliable as the Highwayman. You now own your very own Chryslus Highwayman, a nine seater sports car that’s been fully upgraded with expanded storage space and grav plates that greatly increase the speed. Yours will never need refueling."
200 CP,Toughness,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Okay, there's tough, there's military tough, and then there's you. Your skin is as durable as armor made from toughened leather, so while it might not stop most high caliber bullets, it's a lot better than nothing. Your organs are similarly resilient, as it would take much more physical trauma than normal before they start getting damaged. In addition to all of this, any bruises you may receive fade away much faster than normal, but we've already acknowledged that you aren't."
200 CP,Iron Fist ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"It takes a brave man to go charging into a gun fight with just his fists. Not a smart man, mind you, but a brave one nonetheless. But if you're going to do it, then you might as do it right. Your fists are now harder than steel, which is definitely useful for bashing in someone's face. In fact, anytime you fight unarmed, be it barehanded or with a power fist, you seem to dish out more damage than anyone was expecting."
200 CP,Locksmith ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Picking a lock might be a useful skill, sure, but it can get pretty hard when you don't have the correct tools or skills. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore, as when you encounter a locked anything but don't have the key to it, you can just pull out a bobby pin and screwdriver in order to play a little mini game in order to get it open! You need to attempt to find the correct position for the pin, which is checked by turning the screwdriver as if it were a key. The further the screwdriver turns the lock, the closer the pin is to the correct position. Once the screwdriver can turn the lock a full 90 degrees, the lock will open!"
200 CP,Light Step ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"People often leave traps lying about in order to catch those who think themselves undetectable, as stealth is meaningless in the face of a land mine. Well, not for you, anyway. You never set off any floor traps, be they mines, bear traps, pressure plates, or anything else like that."
200 CP,Kama Sutra Master,Fallout Series (Imaged),"There are few things as physically pleasurable as sex, especially when you know what you're doing. You are a master of the art, able to perform in bed so well that you will leave even the most depraved and experienced hedonists satisfied. Oh, and you deal an extra 10% of damage to those that find you sexually attractive, but who cares about that?"
200 CP,Child at Heart ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Dealing with children can be refreshingly simple at times, at least when compared to adults. You find it easy to get along with children, no matter their background. They get the sense that you're a trustworthy and fun person to be around, so I hope you don't take advantage of that."
200 CP,HUD,Fallout Series (Imaged),"There are so many things happening during a fight that it's hard for most to keep track of most of it. This should mitigate that somewhat, as you now have an HUD that accurately lets you know how injured you are, and if you are currently afflicted by something, such as through poison or gear. While it doesn't take up much space in your vision, it can be turned off at will, should you wish it."
200 CP,Friendly Foe,Fallout Series (Imaged),"For someone fresh from the relatively safe Vaults, combat in the Wasteland can be a messy, confusing, and chaotic affair, and more than once have allies hurt one another by accident. Not you, though, as you cannot directly harm your Companions or allies, regardless of what abilities or weapons you use."
200 CP,Compass,Fallout Series (Imaged),"The Wasteland can be a big, empty place at times, and it's easy to get lost within such a barren world. From endless desserts to claustrophobic cities of iron and steel, it would be handy if you had a way of navigating. That is no longer your problem, as you now have a compass in your vision that not only tells you what direction you're facing, but any notable locations or landmarks, whether they were visited or not, and shows how many enemies are in the direction you are facing. This can be toggled on and off."
200 CP,Mental Block ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Though the actual population of psykers is small, it is not zero, and as such your mind could one day be targeted.

200 CP,Steam Boat,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"Though she ain't as pretty as she used to be, there's little better to help you travel across the waves.

You won't even need to worry about taking care of her engine, seeing as it won't need any fuel to keep her paddles going."
200 CP,Pyromaniac,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"Fire is such a fun tool, one that pushed mankind progress forward at such a rapid rate that we ended up burning ourselves.

All of your fire based effects, be it weapons or abilities, will find themselves twice as powerful as before."
200 CP,Rope Tricks,Fallout TV Show,"Are you a cowboy reborn into the wasteland? You have a skill with lassos and their ilk that borders on the supernatural. And the term ‘lasso’ can be extended rather heavily. Roping cattle maybe what you trained for, but you find people, even those in power armor, to be equally susceptible to your abilities."
400 CP,Adamantium Skeleton,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Your bones are a very important part of your body, acting as a support system and protecting many of your squishier organs. As such, it only makes sense that you'd want your bones to be as durable as possible, right? While your bones won't be as strong and enduring as that mythical metal, they might as well be made of a gold-titanium alloy for how tough they are. Good luck trying to break those and pray for anyone you decide to headbutt."
400 CP,Night Person,Fallout Series (Imaged),"For those who make stealth and subterfuge their career, you will find no better ally than the night itself. After all, what better to have on your side than the largest shadow possible? When the sun sets, you will find yourself more agile and flexible than before. You will also find your mental faculties clearer during this time, even while under the influence of narcotics, letting you react better to unexpected complications when stealth fails."
400 CP,Inspirational,Fallout Series (Imaged),"It may take a decent man to train his forces, but it takes a great man to motivate them, to stoke the fire within their beating hearts. Your presence on the battlefield is invigorating to your companions and allies alike, allowing them to better deal and resist damage. You've also got a knack for writing moving and thought-provoking speeches, capable of enchanting even entire nations with your words alone."
400 CP,Animal Friend,Fallout Series (Imaged),"What can be said about animals that has not already been said before? That they're cute, loyal, dangerous, and much easier to deal with than actual people. Your innate empathy with animals lets you easily befriend and train any animal you run across. Wild animals will never fight you, and they shall even come to your aid in battle if they get to you fast enough. Remind people that there are consequences to pissing off Mother Nature."
400 CP,V.A.T.S.,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Aiming can be a tough thing at times, especially during the heat of combat. So if you want a little assistance in those stressful moments, the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System is there for you, allowing you to slow down how you perceive time in order to line up deathly accurate shots. There is a short recharging period after using this ability a few times in a row, but that shouldn't be a problem."
400 CP,Nerves of Steel ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Why is it that the hero of the Wastes often ends up being some kid who crawled out of the Vault, inexperienced and naive to all of its difficulties and horrors? Perhaps those Vaults were nurturing something within them, something that allowed them to face the Wasteland and not break. You must have been one of those few, incapable of hesitating or wavering, both in character and in your aim. As an added bonus, you have a superb poker face, making you almost unreadable."
400 CP,Teamwork ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"The greatest advantage that humanity ever had, even from their origins in the Stone Age, was their ability to work together with each other, something you have recognized and learned to exemplify. When you work together with a team, you truly bring out the best in them all. The team synergy that you bring out is amazing, emphasizing each individual's strengths while covering for their weaknesses. If only the governments of the Old World had learned to work together."
500 CP,Sniper,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Professionals have standards. Be efficient, be polite, and have a plan to kill everyone you meet. While you might not abide by those standards, you are certainly one of the best snipers around. When attacking from long range, all damage you deal is five times more effective, but that's not the best part. Oh no, you see, any projectiles you fire no longer have an arc to them, more are they affected by things like wind or the like. This means that when you fire a gun, the only way it's stopping is if it hits something, preferably your enemies."
500 CP,Slayer,Fallout Series (Imaged),"What is best in life? For you, it is to crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women. You are an absolute monster in close range, dealing five times the damage you otherwise would have while close enough to see the whites of their eyes. Additionally, you will always instinctively know the most vulnerable places to hit your target, making good use of your extra damage."
500 CP,Local Leader ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"If civilization has any hope of rising from the ashes, then it will need people willing to step up and take charge. People like you. You are a very charismatic person, and find it easier to convince large crowds than singular individuals. But charisma is only part of the role. You can accurately tell what those under you need to help survive and thrive, as well as a general overview of what they want that isn't necessary. This can range from simply needing more water available, or wanting their borders patrolled by machines rather than people."
600 CP,Fancy Tower,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"Much of the Capital Wasteland is so... dirty. You cannot, in good conscience, allow yourself to continue living in such an environment. And now you don't have to, as this refurbished Pre-War hotel on par with Tenpenny Tower is perfect for a Jumper like you. Clean water, great food, actual plumbing and water heating, and enough space to house hundreds of people comfortably. The penthouse is all yours, and is the peak of Old World Luxury."
