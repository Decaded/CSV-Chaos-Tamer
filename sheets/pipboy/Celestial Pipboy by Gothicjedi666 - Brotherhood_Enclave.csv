0 CP,Star Paladin ,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"One of the highest ranking members of the Eastern Brotherhood of Steel, Star Paladin Cross has been technologically enhanced so that
she no longer needs to eat or sleep. She is, in fact, a cyborg. Beyond that, she is skilled with any laser weaponry, but prefers to use her super sledge to fight her enemies."
100 CP,Laser Rifle,Out of Context: Fallout Supplement,This high-tech weapon emits a concentrated beam of coherent light to do considerable damage. It comes with 25 microfusion cells battery packs that power the weapon and restock after 24 hours.
100 CP,Institute Rifle ,Fallout: Automatrons,"A variant of the standard AER12 laser rifle, manufactured and used primarily by the forces of the Institute. It is more damaging, more energy efficient, and more easily modified than most other laser rifles. The beam is a nice blue, further separating it from the more widespread variants."
100 CP,Laser Pistol,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Intended to replace the N99 pistol as the standard sidearm for military forces, the AEP7 laser pistol is a good choice to have at your sides. This energy weapon runs off of small energy cells in order to make a deadly light show where the finale is your enemies' death."
100 CP,Daddy’s Little Scientist,Fallout Series (Imaged),"A laboratory or workshop can be a dangerous place, especially when all the equipment is either salvaged or made from scrap. No labels either. This isn't exactly a problem for you, as you seem to know your way around even the most hazardous and haphazard labs or workshops, able to use all the crappy equipment safely as though you've been using them since you were old enough to walk."
100 CP,Boot Camp,Fallout TV Show Jump,"Unlike the vast majority of people on the surface, the Brotherhood of Steel puts its trainees through actual legitimate military training. While the effectiveness of this training may be questionable in some fields, it does make them one of the few organizations with physical fitness as an attribute. You’ve had to run miles, lift weights, and perform exercises, but the results show. You have the muscle mass and fitness to show for it, putting you at the peak of what might be considered ‘standard human.’"
100 CP,Initiate Training,Fallout TV Show Jump,"Your training began when you were young, and focussed upon the singular purpose of aiding a Brotherhood Knight in the field. You learned basic combat skills necessary, of course, but more than that you learned to identify technology, to repair your Knight’s equipment, and to tote it all around like a glorified pack mule. Were the Brotherhood looking to assign squires, you’d make the top of the list."
100 CP,Humvee,Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel Jump,"A staple of Brotherhood forces, the Hummer is a light, four-wheel drive vehicle that seats six and runs on a small nuclear engine. Unarmed but
you can always change that yourself."
200 CP,Power Armor Frame ,Out of Context: Fallout Supplement,The West Tek internalized servo system is the standard chassis for all power armor series. This suit is powered by and comes with a standard fusion core interface that restocks after 24 hours. Any combination of power armor parts can be equipped on a power armor frame and any power armor segments attached to the frame are considered weightless.
200 CP,Power Armor,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Unveiled to the world in 2067, power armor of any make and model represents the pinnacle of personal defensive technology, combining excellent protection from small arms with the ability to carry heavy weapons into combat with ease, turning anyone into a person-sized tank. While they could normally last hundreds of years without recharging, you might as well never need to worry about it. This set can be of any model you desire. The classic T-45, the iconic T-51, the advanced T-60, or the rare X-01."
200 CP,Hacker ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Computers are wonderful things, are they not? It runs off of strict rules and consists entirely of ones and zeroes, allowing those clever enough to take advantage of its many uses and flaws. You are naturally skilled in coding and hacking, able to crack through most codes, as well as programming with fewer bugs or exploits than there should be."
200 CP,Chemist ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"The art of chemistry is as complicated as it is valuable, as it takes a knowledgeable mind indeed to create all sorts and varieties of drugs with little more than simple household products. Yes, you are skilled in making all kinds of drugs, both beneficial and recreational, but those created by yours truly shall be twice as potent as before and the drawbacks normally accompanied by such things will be lessened."
200 CP,T-60 Power Armor,Fallout TV Show Jump,"The Armor of a Brotherhood of Steel Knight. Originally a Pre-War design, this Power Armor greatly enhances the strength of the wearer. This allows the wearer to make use of equipment otherwise too heavy to carry, or to take part in melee combat with far greater effectiveness than a standard human. The ‘armor’ aspect is nothing to sneer at either.  This will protect you from many small arms, though there are some weaknesses. Though fortunately this set has been modified to no longer possess the flaw in the welding just below the chest plate. This armor is also capable of small feats of flight."
200 CP,Power Armor Training,Fallout TV Show Jump,"What defines the Brotherhood? Is it their mission? Their ideals? The sense of brotherhood that is their namesake? Arguably it is none of these, but their other namesake: Steel. Or in other words, Power Armor. You’ve been trained in the use of Power Armor to the level of the most elite of Brotherhood Knights, and know how to move in your Power Armor like its a second skin. In a fight, you know just how to cover your armor’s vulnerabilities. Your foes will find it difficult to catch you off guard."
200 CP,Armored Personnel Carrier,Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel Jump,The armored personnel carrier is an original design from the Brotherhood of Steel and is a heavily armored personnel transport. Twin tracks carry the vehicle over most terrain and also provide for a very small turning circle. It is slow so once it's caught out in the open it's a bit of a sitting duck for heavy artillery. Seats 12 in the back and 3 in the front.
400 CP,Tesla Rifle,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Quite the unique weapon, at least compared to everything else in the Wasteland. Cobbled together from a robot's arm-mounted weapon, the Tesla Rifle fires off deadly arcs of electricity that jump from enemy to enemy, injuring anyone caught in the chain. It can fry a man within a few seconds and leaves the nerves of anyone who survived fried and incapable of movement for a time."
400 CP,Super Sledge,Fallout Series (Imaged),"This type of sledgehammer was created with the return of trench warfare, necessitating the creation of a tool superior to regular large hammers for engineering work and breaching concrete fortifications.

It's not unheard of to install small rockets to the back of the head in order to further increase its power."
400 CP,Vertibird,Fallout: Automatrons,"Not too many enemies will have the benefit of air superiority, so you've already got a massive advantage. The Vertibird is a VTOL vehicle that became the primary gunship and transport aircraft for the US military. It's got durable armor and can be outfitted with a number of weapons, though this one is equipped with gatling lasers. It has enough room inside to fit an entire squad wearing power armor and their pilot. Best part is, you'll never have to worry about refueling."
400 CP,Gauss Rifle ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Perhaps known as one of the greatest energy weapons in the Wasteland, there are few weapons as good as the gauss rifle. Utilizing an electromagnetic accelerator, it fires off 2mm slugs of steel at such extreme speeds that it is capable of piercing through even power armor at extreme ranges. This one has an effective range of a mile, with the scope needed to make full use of this reach."
400 CP,Stealth Boy 3001,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Developed in response to the stealth suits the Chinese employ, the Stealth Boy is a special wrist-mounted device that generates a modulating field that transmits the reflected light from one side of an object to another, allowing for near invisibility. Though there aren't any side-effects for humans, prolonged use by Super Mutants tends to cause schizophrenia, though it is unknown why. Yours won't have that problem and will recharge in between uses."
400 CP,Jingwei’s Shocksword,Fallout Series (Imaged),"This Chinese officer's sword was the personal weapon of General Jingwei, the military commander of the Chinese forces in Anchorage. By flicking a switch on the handle, the blade becomes enveloped by a field of electricity. Beyond the obvious use of electrocuting enemies, there is always the chance that you could vaporize your enemies, leaving only a pile of ash in your wake."
400 CP,Cryolator,Fallout Series (Imaged),"The antithesis to the flamer, this very rare weapon is sure to cool off some hotheads. As it propels super-chilled nitrogen, it freezes your enemies solid and stops them in their tracks. Of course, if you don't want a constant spray, then there is an option to fire off ice pellets. Just as effective as actual bullets, and containing the same freezing effect, but requiring more precision in its use."
400 CP,Meltdown,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Don't you just love the smell of lasers and plasma in the morning? What am I saying, of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't have purchased this. Not only will you deal more damage using energy weapons, but every time you kill a target using such weapons, they will explode in a corona of energy, damaging anyone and anything nearby."
400 CP,Knight Support Squad,Fallout TV Show Jump,"If the Wastes become too much for you, you may require backup. Fortunately you can call for backup from this portable radio. On making the call, a Vertibird will arrive at your location within thirty seconds to deploy two Knights in power armor plus their squires to support you for twenty four hours. The Knights wield massive machine guns with which they can lay down shocking amounts of covering fire, and the squires are in possession of pistols. If killed, the Knight’s power armor is rendered unusable, and regardless of survival the vertibird returns at the end of the twenty-four hour period to collect either survivors or bodies."
400 CP,Vertibird Pilot,Fallout TV Show Jump,"Their armor and military training may make the Brotherhood a threat to anyone in the wasteland, but it's their air power that truly sets them apart from even the best equipped of the wastelanders. And they won’t get anywhere without you. You’ve trained in the flight of various flying vehicles, but it is in the Vertibird that you excel. Your skill isn’t limited to pick ups and drop offs, either. In your hands, the vertibird finds itself put through its paces. Complex aerial maneuvers come naturally, as does formation flying. And if the enemy should have anti-air defenses, you know how to dodge, confuse, and avoid those weapons practically indefinitely."
500 CP,Protonic Inversal Axe,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Though it resembles a futuristic war axe from a science fiction feature, this is possibly one of the best melee weapons you could get your hands on. Made from an ally known as saturnite, its frame and handle are stupidly durable, while the blade is made from electrical energy itself. Not only can it cut through steel with ease, but it is especially effective against robots, power armor, and various other forms of technology in general."
500 CP,Power Armored,Fallout Series (Imaged),"There are few things that can make you feel invincible as being clad in power armor. And while walking around in a human-sized tank is great, it could be better. By purchasing this perk, any and all armor you wear is now five times as effective in protecting you and doesn't hinder your movement at all, allowing you to swim just fine even while wearing the humanoid equivalent of a small car. And while that would be well and good on its own, any armor you wear will now fully repair itself within the day. The more complex the armor and the more extensive the damage, the longer it will take to be repaired but it will be repaired all the same."
500 CP,Sentinel,Fallout TV Show Jump,"The rank of Sentinel is one rarely given to any within the Brotherhood of Steel, and those who hold it only do so after having proved themselves time and time again. A Sentinel has the authority to act on their own cognizance without orders, with Elders and those of similar rank able to only give standing, high-level orders. You only gain this level of trust by being among the most capable warriors in the Brotherhood’s ranks, and that is certainly the case for you now. In combat skill, you are to the Brotherhood Knight what they are to a random wastelander."
600 CP,Medic Power Armor ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Scavenged from a set of armor found in the Capital Wasteland as well as other advanced technology, this modified set of T-60 power armor is not only fully upgraded, but it possesses a life support system that would put all others to shame. It offers potent protection from radiation, it’s water tight and has a small supply of clean oxygen, and inner cooling. The most important part is that it will automatically inject the wearer with Stimpaks and Med-X when needed, ensuring that they are always at full combat readiness."
600 CP,Airship,Fallout TV Show Jump,"40,000 tons of airship held aloft by armored hydrogen gasbags and a fusion reactor, the Prydwen is a marvel of Brotherhood engineering. She’s capable of fielding an entire Chapter with Vertibird support, and beyond practical uses she’s a symbol of the Brotherhood’s presence which is hard to miss. And you now possess a sister ship. While you may have to provide your own Knights and your own Vertibirds, you gain the airship and a crew capable of keeping her afloat indefinitely. This is a true sign of your value to the Brotherhood of Steel, otherwise they would not hand over such an asset. You can expect that they have some kind of mission in mind for you if they’ve dispatched you with this. If they didn’t dispatch you with it... expect trouble when the Brotherhood finds out they're not the only ones with a mobile air base."
