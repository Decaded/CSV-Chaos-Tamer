0 CP,Net Runner,Fallout: Mutants,"A young woman who was once part of an Enclave experiment, one meant to artificially induce psyker abilities into people. She possesses a potent ability, that of technopathy, allowing her to mentally link to and manipulate technology. She dreams of one day traveling to the moon. Will you make her dream a reality?"
0 CP,Psychic Nullifier,Fallout: Mutants,"A strange headpiece with a chin strap to hold it in place. When wearing this, you will find your psychic abilities weakened or nullified, depending on what you need at the moment. It’s quite useful for those who have difficulty with controlling their abilities."
0 CP,Expanded Mind,Fallout: Mutants,"Radiation has unlocked something within you, opened your mind to the cosmic energies of the universe. You are now a psyker, someone who possesses psychic powers. Among your new abilities, you are capable of seeing a person's psychic aura, or their soul, should you be more of the spiritual kind. This perk is also helpful in that it will allow you to improve your psychic abilities through training and constant use."
0 CP,Mutated Vitality,Fallout: Mutants,"Radiation is more likely to slowly kill you in a mess of tumors than it is to actually heal you, though the possibility of such a thing is never zero. Much like ghouls, at least as far as anyone knows, at least, you are biologically immortal, never aging past your prime. Though it may seem like a gracious gift, do not overestimate it, as a stray bullet is still just as likely to be your end as it was before."
100 CP,Aqua Boy ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"A strange ability, this one. Sure, the vast majority of the water you find will probably be irradiated to hell and back, but that doesn't mean there aren't treasures under the waves for you to find. That's right, you can now breathe underwater as easily as if you were on land. In order to make this a bit more useful, you can see underwater perfectly, and are immune to the crushing pressure of being down in the depths."
100 CP,Mutated,Fallout TV Show Jump,"Given the radiation, it's really no surprise that some folks received some mutations, and that’s before we get into the FEV and mad scientists running about. You are one such person, having received a minor mutation which serves as an advantage. This could be something as simple as the ability to see in the dark, or as complicated as a third arm. The visibility of said mutation is also up to you, though be aware that some communities might discriminate against the visibility mutated."
100 CP,Psychic Master ,Fallout: Mutants,"A beautiful woman who wouldn’t be too out of place on one of those Old World holovids, she is by far one of the most potent and versatile psykers around. Not only can she lift Super Mutants into the air with ease, but her telepathy allows her to read the minds of anyone nearby. Her most useful power, though, is her ability to teleport within line of sight, offering her unparalleled mobility."
100 CP,Forced Immunity,Fallout: Mutants,"When the FEV changed you, all the way down to your DNA, it ensured that it would be the very last virus that would ever affect you. Your immune system is exceptional, making you, well, immune to all forms of diseases, illnesses, and viruses that you may come across. It doesn’t matter if it’s some biological weapon that was just recently created or an eldritch curse, it won’t mean anything to you."
100 CP,Forecast,Fallout: Mutants,"One of the more common abilities that Psykers possess, should such a term be used for them, is that known as the Sight. With this, you are capable of getting glimpses into the future, often in vague yet helpful forms. You could improve this for a time through the use of chems, but then you'd run the risk of addiction. Still, that would be but a small price to pay to gaze upon the currents of time."
100 CP,Rad Regeneration ,Fallout: Mutants,"It is a strange duality, one where those twisted by radiation can also be healed by it. A curious ability, one that you now share with many others. You are capable of regenerating when in the presence of radiation, an effect that gets more powerful the more radiation you absorb, being used up in order to keep you on your feet long after you should have bit the dust."
100 CP,Deathclaw Egg,"Fallout New Vegas JumpChain
",Currently unhatched but will eventually grow into a Deathclaw so large and monstrous as to become a legend. Extremely fast and agile with 12 inch long razor sharp claws that go through power armour much as they go through everything else. Thinks you’re it’s mama so will follow your directions as best it can. 
100 CP,Snakeater,Fallout 4 CYOA,"War might never change, but at least your resistance to poison and toxins has gone up- in fact, your resistance is so solid, you could probably drink liquid snake venom with multiple wounds in your mouth and stomach without punishing your body too much. Your blood is now much darker than usual."
100 CP,Night Vision,Fallout 4 CYOA,"You have the eyes of a cat- well, not literally, but you can at least see like one. Your night vision is greatly enhanced, to the point that you can see as well in the dark as you can normally. Your irises are now much brighter than before, which is a little off putting"
200 CP,Alien Blaster,Out of Context: Fallout Supplement,This silver extraterrestrial gun disintegrates any enemy killed with it. The weapon uses an alien power cell which comes with 25 power cells that restock after 24 hours.
200 CP,FEV-Enhanced Alpha Deathclaw,Fallout Series (Imaged),"There is a beast that is almost universally feared, such that even mere rumors or sightings of the beasts are enough to induce terror amongst even the most hardened of survivors. The Deathclaw. And yet what stands beside you now is no ordinary Deathclaw. This one has been truly enhanced with FEV and it has been made all the better for it. As it is now, it is larger than any ordinary Deathclaw and yet it is no less swift. With talons longer than a man’s forearms and horns that can gorge a Behemoth, this is deadliest creature in the Wasteland. And thanks to the FEV, it shall only grow larger in time, until it stands even above a Behemoth. But that will take years, decades even. Nevertheless, while the mystery of how you tamed this beast is intriguing, it will always be loyal to you. Hail to the King."
200 CP,Extraterrestrial ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"How long have your people been orbiting the Earth below, how long hiding from the apes from among the stars? Regardless, you have been made for long term survival in space. You don’t suffer any long-term damage from extended periods in zero-g, you don’t require as much air or sustenance, and don’t leave much waste."
200 CP,Abomination Maker ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"When humanity was busy banging rocks together or discovering metal, your people were playing around with biology like it was silly putty. You are a biologist and geneticist beyond compare. Creating a functional hybrid between a mammal and a reptile would be a simple matter for someone like you."
200 CP,Directed Evolution,Fallout Series (Imaged),"It was radiation that gave birth to you and yours, radiation that had twisted your DNA like a cat with yarn. Now, now you possess some sort of control. By absorbing radiation, you can use such energy in order to develop or even empower any mutations you possess, with no physical changes from such developments."
200 CP,Mutagenic Serum,Fallout: Mutants,"Held within these ten vials are a useful concoction, meant to grant minor mutations to those who inject it within them. From improved eyes and improved regeneration, they each have their own benefits and downsides. Not only do they replenish weekly, but you will also have the notes on how to make more."
200 CP,Healing Factor ,Fallout: Mutants,"Well now, it seems as though your natural regeneration has become something a bit more useful, beyond just longevity. You will quickly heal from most injuries, such as bullet holes closing before your eyes or slashes across your gut mending itself while you’re still fighting. This does not mean that you can regrow limbs, however, and enough damage to your brain or heart is still capable of killing you, but it’s still going to be harder to do than before."
200 CP,Adrenal Reaction,Fallout: Mutants,"It is when faced with the prospect of death that people reveal their true colors, and yours seems to be someone that will fight all the harder. Whenever you are injured, all of your attacks hit harder than before, no matter if they are from firearms, melee weapons, energy weapons or even just your own fists. Your foes will all rue the day they even thought that defeating you was possible."
200 CP,Pyromaniac,Fallout: Mutants,"You may be crazy about fire, or maybe just plain crazy in general, but that won’t change what you’re capable of now, will it? You posses the ability of pyrokinesis, capable of conjuring and controlling flames to burn your enemies on par with a military-grade flamethrower. You could dial this back, making just enough fire to light a cigarette, but where’s the fun in that?"
200 CP,Empath ,Fallout: Mutants,"Should you care at all for those you consider friends, then this is probably essential for you. Not only are you capable of ‘seeing’ what emotions a person is feeling, but when you are surrounded by your allies, friends, and Companions, you reduce all damage they take by a quarter. It may not seem like much, but every little bit helps when trying to survive"
300 CP,Drone Cannon Ex-C,Fallout: Automatrons,"An upgraded version of the weapon used by the drones found in the ships of aliens from beyond the stars, one that can be fitted to your chassis with relative ease, or used by a normal person. When fired, it will unleash a blast of otherworldly energy that can disintegrate almost any flesh it touches, and can punch through armor more easily. The factor that makes this unique, though, is that the energy homes in on your intended target, changing its direction midair until it strikes something."
400 CP,Satellite Array,Fallout Series (Imaged),"What you now have in your hand may look like a toy gun, but it is, in actuality, one of the deadliest weapons on the planet. All because of what it's connected to, an energy-based artillery satellite. By pulling the trigger, you can summon down a rain of deadly light, capable of obliterating even something along the scale of a mobile carrier with contemptuous ease. The only downside is that it can only be fired once per day, but will you really need more than that?"
400 CP,Alien Recon Craft ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"This is one ride that's out of this world. Though it may look a bit small, and can only fit four people, this spacecraft is well worth it. It requires no refueling, it can fly faster and is more agile than any vertibird and comes equipped with a set of energy weapons that can fire out the front. It even comes with an air purifier and is vacuum sealed, allowing you to fly through the empty vastness of space."
400 CP,Xenotech Expert,Fallout Series (Imaged),"If there is one thing the primitives of Earth are envious of, it would be your mastery of alien technology. From the biogel capable of healing most wounds, whether they be that of your kind or something else’s, to the spacecraft that soar beyond the stars to the deadly weaponry, there is no facet of alien technology that you haven't mastered."
400 CP,What Doesn’t Kill You,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Only makes you stronger. It is not the strongest or fastest that is best able to survive, but those that adapt most quickly to their surroundings. You seem to have taken this to a totally different level, the invisible fires of radiation having forged you into something else. You now have a sort of adaptive regeneration, growing stronger and more resistant to whatever harms you. Of course, you will also gain quite a rapid healing factor, capable of healing most wounds in hours or even minutes."
400 CP,Chameleon ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Your ancestors were originally a breed of chameleons, most famous for changing their pigmentations. Through some means, it seems as though a similar, if more useful, ability has emerged. Simply put, you are now capable of turning yourself invisible. Curiously, this will also affect any clothing or items that are on your person at the time, though it’s unclear as to how."
400 CP,The Krivbeknih,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"An ancient, evil book that no god-fearing man should own. Upon its many pages are rituals, ones invoking eldritch entities for untold purposes. Most interestingly, there is a very specific ritual within, opening the mind to the otherworldly energies of the cosmos, and transforming someone into a powerful psyker."
400 CP,Lorenzo's Crown,Fallout: Mutants,"An artifact that may possess otherworldly origins, it was uncovered by Lorenzo Cabot in the Rub’ al Khali desert in 1894, and has kept him alive all the way until 2287. This piece of headwear will not only halt your aging, making you effectively immortal, but it will also focus and empower any psychic powers you may possess. Even when worn by someone who isn’t a psyker, it will give them a minor telekinetic ability."
400 CP,Mental Block,Fallout: Mutants,"There is always the threat of enemy telepaths taking a look within your mind, no matter how rare such opponents are. You prepare for every inevitability, and as such have come to transform your mind like a fortress. Your mental defenses are unbreakable, rendering you immune to any telepathic or mind controlling abilities, as well as eldritch influence, no matter what their origin may have actually been. This will also grant you a resistance to all psychic effects, though nowhere near the same extent as your mind."
400 CP,Life Giver,Fallout: Mutants,"In case you haven’t noticed, it is quite difficult for nearly any form of plantlife to grow in the Wasteland, the poisonous radiation having long since ruined any nutrients within the ground. You are sure to change that, though, and you are now capable of conjuring and controlling plantlife, ones that are sure to survive even here. Creating a mighty oak tree is certainly within your capabilities, but restoring life to one of the burnt-out husks that dot the wastes is probably going to be a bit easier on you."
400 CP,Electrifying,Fallout: Mutants,"Well, this is certainly a shocking turn of events, finding out you are capable of this. You are now capable of conjuring and controlling electricity, allowing you to fire off lightning bolts at anyone who gets in your way. Not only is this useful for fighting enemies or charging whatever machine you’re working on, but you can also release an electromagnetic pulse, one that is especially harmful to robotic enemies and those wearing power armor."
500 CP,Psyker,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Nuclear radiation has caused many strange mutations to appear in humanity, but none are as strange, or as fantastic, as Psykers, people who display some sort of psychic ability. With a wide variety of powers to choose from, ranging from telekinesis to telepathy to pyrokinesis to divination to anything in between, you now possess a single psychic ability that will continuously grow in power the more you practice with it."
600 CP,Master of Genetics ,Fallout: Mutants,"When it comes to messing around with DNA, there’s no one better skilled or more knowledgeable than you. Not only do you understand how to create something like the FEV, something capable of turning an ordinary chameleon into one of the deadliest creatures to ever walk the Wastes, but also how to modify most forms of life, even improve upon it. With enough time and testing, you may be able to create a strain that doesn’t create mostly stupid Super Mutants. It isn’t perfect, few things are in this bleak world of ours, but with your creations, we’re just another step closer."
600 CP,Psy-Tech,Fallout: Mutants,"It is only to be expected that when mankind learned of the existence of psychic powers, that they would turn to technology to study it, and then enhance it. You are one of the very few people who are capable of creating tech meant to enhance and mimic psychic powers. From headwear that can nullify or improve their potency, to guns using telekinetic energy to lift and move heavy objects. You could also use this to upgrade or create a variant of power armor that links with the brain itself, allowing for more fluid movement and better control. When the supernatural and science work in tandem, the possibilities are endless."
600 CP,Invisible Hand,Fallout: Mutants,"When one thinks of psychic powers, they will inevitably turn towards moving objects without even touching them. This is for many reasons, such as how obvious a psychic display it is, but it is also due to just how versatile telekinesis really is. Though you could lift a person into the air and crush them with relative ease, you could also use it for many other tasks, such as picking a lock without any bobby pins or repositioning your weapons in the air in order to get a better angle of attack. With practice and experience, there are many options open to you when you possess this power."
600 CP,Hive Mind,Fallout: Mutants,"Have you ever looked at someone and wondered, ‘what is going on inside their head?’ Well wonder no more, as you are a very potent telepath, capable of reading minds and communicating with others through your thoughts alone. You can use this to sense the minds of anyone nearby, eliminating stealth from biological opponents, but the most important ability offered by this is being able to create telepathic links. When you forge these links, it will allow you to communicate as though they are right next to you no matter how far away."
800 CP,Alien Mothership,Fallout: Automatrons,"A vessel from beyond the stars, one that is the size of an old-world city. You now find yourself in ownership of an alien spaceship, filled with all manner of technology more advanced than almost anything else found on Earth. With a dedicated cargo hold, engineering core, biological, cryogenics, and weapons lab, robot assembly, and so much more, but most devastating is the death laser on par with a nuclear bomb that can be fired once per minute. With this under your command, you’re sure to reach the stars and even further beyond."
