100 CP,Combat Armor ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"This set of armor is standard issue across the US military, and for good reason. It offers decent protection without limiting the range of movement. This can come in any color you want, or it can be winterized, letting you be comfortable in cold environments."

100 CP,Gun Nut,Fallout Series (Imaged),"If there's one companion that you can unequivocally trust, it's a gun. Big guns, small guns, shotguns, miniguns, there's so many kinds out there that it's hard to choose. It doesn't really matter to you, as any guns you use will hit harder, fly farther, and punch through targets easier than before."
100 CP,Demolition Expert,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Like a real American, there's almost nothing better in your eyes than blowing things the fuck up! And this eagerness for explosives actually manifests physically, as any explosives you use will be bigger, better, and more blow-y up-y than before! They will have their explosive radius slightly expanded, as well as do more damage overall than they should."
100 CP,Big Leagues,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Ah, baseball, America's favorite pastime. A game about hitting balls with big sticks and running away. I know that there's more to it than that, but you must have really focused on the hitting things part. Any damage you do with a melee weapon will be more severe than it otherwise should be."

","Whether the Black Armor of the NCR’s most elite rangers, the elite riot gear of the pre-war 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment or the armor of the now assimilated Desert Rangers it has a gas mask, a trench coat and the best armor in the Mojave short of the powered stuff. This one causes awe and a considerable boost in morale for allied military personnel who have seen you in it and is deeply intimidating. It seems to scream “don’t tread on me”."
100 CP,Machete Gladius,"Fallout New Vegas JumpChain
","An unbreakable, unbendable and uniquely sharp machete. It swings fast, cuts deep and seems to ignore a significant degree of
the armor your enemies hide behind. This effect is most pronounced against profligates and degenerates who use advanced technology so will cut through duraframe like butter."
200 CP,Riot Gear,Fallout Series (Imaged),"An advanced design fielded in limited quantities before the Great War, this was a specialized model of combat armor used by the United States Marine Corps, Army units in the American West, and select law enforcement agencies. While not the most protective of armors, it certainly makes up for it in a number of ways. The helmet is equipped with a built-in radio, night vision, infra-red, and air filters. It has a kevlar vest protecting the torso, and a black duster covering it all up. So not only does it protect you, you’ll also look cool and isn’t that the most important thing?"
200 CP,Shishkebab,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Of all the things to be created after the world ended, should you really be surprised that there are flaming swords? Crafted from a number of items that would be considered junk, with a flick of a switch the blade comes alight in fire, burning your enemies as you slice them up. This never seems to require refueling either, no matter how often you use it."
200 CP,Chinese Assault Rifle ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"The Type 93 Chinese assault rifle was designed and manufactured by a Chinese industrial conglomerate for the People's Liberation Army during the Great War, for the purpose of equipping the Chinese infiltrators and American fifth columnists.

You do need to be strong in order to handle the recoil, but at least you never need to reload it."
200 CP,Zhu-Rong ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"A variant of the standard Chinese pistol carried by nearly all of their soldiers, this one pistol in particular has been modified by LOB Enterprises. What makes this one unique is that in addition to being a decent firearm on par with a 10mm handgun, it tends to set your targets on fire, even though it only fires normal bullets."
200 CP,Pulse Grenades ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Everyone can agree that some of the worst things to fight in the Wasteland are robots, seeing as they don’t have any preservation instinct. Well, this purchase should help with those problems, as these twenty grenades discharge an EMP that is especially effective against both robots and those wearing power armor. Like many other items here, these pulse grenades will be replenished daily."
200 CP,Vault-Tec Security Armor ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Only those part of the Vault Security Department are authorized to wear these, though I doubt they really care.

While wearing this, you'll find your skills with pistols and melee weapons slightly improved."
200 CP,Steady Aim,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Sometimes in a fight, you won't exactly have a good place to take cover, forcing you to dodge and weave in order to not get peppered by bullets.

200 CP,Gunsmith ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Any idiot with hands can pick up a gun and fire it, but it takes a certain kind of someone to make it better than it was before. Someone like you. You are a master of creating and applying weapon modifications. This is especially useful for weapons bought using CP, as any modifications you do to them will become fiat backed."

as their skill with firearms increased."
200 CP,Railway Rifle,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"Though it may look like it was made from a scrap heap, this rifle will fire off railway spikes at such a high velocity, you'd more than likely pin whoever you shot to a wall. This one deals more damage to limbs than one would expect."
200 CP,Weapon Schematics,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"Since there are no longer any factories mass producing new guns, the people of the Wasteland have had to get a bit creative.

","A big, powerful automatic gun with a dog brain in it, floppy metal ears and a curious sensor. Really enjoys being fired by you and
causes bullets to strike more accurately by slightly altering the trajectory of bullets when needed. Has remarkably long range sensors that are almost impossible to fool and it will growls when it senses unnoticed enemies approaching to alert you."
200 CP,Pulse Gun,"Fallout New Vegas JumpChain
","A gun that fries electronics causing massive damage to vehicles, people in power armor and anyone else unlucky enough to be relying on electrical items when you shoot them with this.

Comes with attachments and scope to convert into a rifle form."
200 CP,B-29 Super Fortress,"Fallout New Vegas JumpChain
","Well they certainly don’t make these anymore. A plane containing 12 .50 calibre M2 guns between its four turrets, a 20mm cannon
in the tail gun and an extensive amount of bombs. May have lake water pooling here and there but it all works as well as it should,
has an endless fuel supply and the payload regenerates for  massive destruction."
400 CP,Mechanist Armor ,Fallout: Automatrons,"This armor was crafted and worn by the eponymous self-proclaimed superhero, the Mechanist! The Master of Machines constructed their armor to offer potent defenses, both from ballistic weapons as well as energy weapons.

While wearing this armor, you will find the quality of any machines you create or repair greatly improved. As an added bonus, it can alter the wearer's voice."
400 CP,Anti-Material Rifle,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Utilizing an ergonomic, metallic skeleton design with a free-floating barrel, the .50 Hécate II is a bolt-action, high caliber precision weapon intended for use against materiel and hard targets. It was designed to be used at long and extreme distances with extreme accuracy.

But who cares about that when you could kill practically anything with just one shot from half a mile away?"
400 CP,Heavy Gunner ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"You know, when they say 'bigger is better,' I don't think they meant it literally. No matter what the original intention of such a phrase was, you've applied it to weapons. You can wield any weapon you can physically carry as easily as you would a small pistol, which includes how you deal with recoil. Additionally, the bigger the gun, the more extra damage you do. A normal pistol would be the same, a sniper rifle will see a small, but noticeable increase in power, while a minigun will see an easier time cutting through enemies."
400 CP,Robo-Thor Armor,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"A modified version of the Enclave's Tesla Armor found by a group of tribals, offering just as much protection as a T-45, while also electrocuting anything stupid enough to get close to you. This electrical field can be disabled when it isn't needed. Strangely, it seems as though you will deal more damage with melee weapons than before."
500 CP,Nuka-nuke Launcher ,Fallout Series (Imaged),"There aren't many hand-held weapons out there with the destructive capabilities of the Fat Man, and this unique variant certainly proves that. Instead of firing normal mini nukes, this instead utilizes a specially modified mini nuke utilizing Nuka-Cola Quantum in order to increase their explosive capabilities. This makes it half again as powerful as normal and has quite the neat side effect of turning the explosions a nice neon blue."
600 CP,Missile Silo ,Fallout: Automatrons,"Will you be the next one to repeat the Old World's mistakes, or learn new lessons from them? I guess it hardly matters when you own this facility.

It will also poison any who touch it, so long as they don’t have your permission to do so."
600 CP,Aeternus,Fallout Series (Imaged),"When people think of firepower, they think of the gatling laser. It's a very cost-efficient heavy weapon, and fires numerous lasers faster than you could blink, each as devastating as a normal laser rifle. And even amongst them, this weapon is unique. How so? Aeternus simply does not run out of ammo, nor does it overheat. This means that you could fire this bad boy indefinitely, vaporizing anyone stupid enough to get on your bad side."
600 CP,Chinese Stealth Armor,Fallout Series (Imaged),"Developed by the Chinese to counter the American's brute force with subterfuge and deception, the Hēi Gui stealth armor is the ultimate expression of China’s mastery over stealth technology. This suit contains a portable device that generates a modulating field that transmits the reflected light from one side of an object to another. The end result is near-perfect active camouflage, one close to total invisibility. This stealth field can be activated whenever you want. And despite its focus on stealth, it's still adept at protecting its wearer from enemy fire."
600 CP,Military Outpost ,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"Due to the heavy military focus of late America, it is not surprising in the least that there are innumerable military stations and outposts dotting the Wasteland. This one is now yours to command, and is filled with all manner of firearms and weapons. It can house a hundred men, and its design is optimized for defense. It would take a mighty force indeed to overrun this facility, especially if you have enough people actually guarding it."
600 CP,Fat Man,Fallout 3 - Updated ,"One of the most devastating weapons out there, this big gun can fire off miniature nukes at a target, ensuring that everything around them ends up as nuclear paste. You could even kill a Behemoth with one shot, if aimed at the face."
