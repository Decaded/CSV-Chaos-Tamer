Not only that, but you possess the clear beautiful voice of your people to a greater degree. The beauty of your voice singing in Elven-tongues is practically enchanting, like a clear jewel of blended word and melody. You also possess natural talent for playing the harp, your sweet and wonderful music making others feel as though they are in some fair dream, or even to sweep them away to far away lands under unknown stars. Lastly, you are fair even for an elf, though clearly not the match of Lúthien, you might still have songs written about you."

100 CP,Elf Soil Bag,Of Elves and Dwarves -- A Twilight of the North Supplement,"Plain and unadorned, but well made, this bag contains a supply of soil, grey in color, like dust both fine and soft. Though seemingly without practical use, this soil, even a couple grains, can enrich even the most barren of dirt to allow it to reap a rich bounty, or grow mighty trees in harsh terrain. This bag contains enough dust to enrich a mile of farmland, and will refill itself once every month."
100 CP,Elven Cloak ,Of Elves and Dwarves -- A Twilight of the North Supplement,"An Elven-cloak is a fair garment.

100 CP,Elvish Agility ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"If you are outnumbered and your opponents are vastly stronger than you, being somewhat more agile than most might be the difference between life and death. With this Perk, you’d become as fleet footed as a particularly athletic elf. While someone empowered by unnatural forces might be able to run circles around you with their enhanced bursts of speed, you will leave Orcs, Men and Dwarves in the dust.

100 CP,Enhanced Senses,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"Your eyesight, hearing, and reflexes far surpass that of a normal human. If nothing obstructs your view, you can see things clearly at distances of twenty miles or more, you can hear breathing at 300 paces.

Though the greatest mariners have been Men, the greatest ship-builders are the Elves, with them being the only ones able to build ships capable of sailing the Straight Road to Valinor. Now you possess the knowledge of long years, though not nearly the equal of someone such as Círdan, you have skill and knowledge great enough to design and build a ship on your lonesome and even in the lands of Men your skills will command a high price and many who will wish to make use of your services. With minimal resources you could, within a year, build a strong warship able to run with the speed of a brisk wind, and endure long grueling battles. Perhaps with time and a lot of talent you might rival the Shipwright himself."
200 CP, Lembas Bread,"Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition
","You have a replenishing supply of the nutritious food created by Elves for sustenance on long journeys.

300 CP,Elessar,Of Elves and Dwarves -- A Twilight of the North Supplement,"The first Elessar was made by the master jewelsmith Celebrimbor in the First Age, and trapped the light of the sun within its green facets. It was said that in looking through it the old seemed young and the withered seemed fresh, and the bearer of the stone could heal ills with but a touch. That stone went with Eärendil across the sea to the Undying Lands, however, and did not return to Middle-earth. A new stone of the same name (if with little of the same brilliance) was
forged also by Celebrimbor, in the Second Age, and set in a silver brooch in the likeness of an eagle with outstretched wings. Though the gem you possess now is akin to the second Elessar in appearance, it possesses the power of that first Elessar as well as the second.

They made the Rings of Power as well as the enchantments on the West-gate of Moria. Many wonders they wrought in their settlement of Ost-in-Edhil, capital of the elven realm of Eregion, and you are the inheritor to their secrets, from the making of Rings and enchantments, to weapons and armor fit for elven kings. In works of masonry and the working of steel your knowledge and talent are second only to the greatest of the dwarves."
400 CP,Elven Gardens ,Of Elves and Dwarves -- A Twilight of the North Supplement,"When Telperion and Laurelin grew upon the mound of Ezellohar in Valinor, their burgeoning lights flowed throughout the city; but twice a day, as the light of one Tree waxed and the other waned, there came a time when their lights were softly mingled. These gardens are but an imitation of that ancient display, but a more otherworldly sight in Middle-earth one is not likely to find. Carefully designed with varying shades of silver and gold, these gardens boast an astonishing variety of colors and plant life, many of which were tenderly borne here from far-flung Elven lands. Even the sickest of hearts is likely to be cheered and enriched after spending an afternoon sampling the visual wonders here. As long as such visions of Valinor remain on this side of the Sea, the Elves may find places of refreshment and peace. Indeed, you shall find that elves from all kindreds will come to visit these gardens, and some may choose to stay to tend them or live near to them, inhabiting your cities or even forming their own small settlements that will come with you to future jumps, and in those future jumps native elves will find themselves drawn to visit your gardens and settle your lands should you desire it."
400 CP,Last Thing They Never See,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You don’t have the brawn of an Orc, the reinforcements of Gondorians, or handy self-resurrection. What you specialise in is stealth, remaining hidden and striking from the shadows. If you are already fast, now you know how to move almost silently. You can mask your scent, hide your trail, and have a knack for avoiding sentries and remaining hidden even in enemy territory. Even those with unnatural senses will find it more difficult to detect you. While they will notice your presence if they’re still alive after you attack, something far more likely to occur with powerful opponents you cannot fell with a single blow, you also have some skill in escaping angered opponents and hiding once more. You’ve also got rather good aim with a bow and arrow, should you have one, and even if your eyes are not elven you have keen eyesight that can identify the best places to shoot."
400 CP,Mithril Hammer ,"Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition
","Perhaps this is Turánn, the smithing hammer Celebrimbor used to forge the Rings of Power, or it is another with the same capabilities. As well as being used in the creation and enhancement of weapons and armour, you will find that it also acts as a reusable throwing weapon. You can channel power through it to increase the impact of the weapon, making it capable of destroying less durable structures such as monuments with a single blow or unleashing a blast of energy around the impact point. While you might be able to find such a weapon here normally, buying this Item will grant you smithing skill equal to Celebrimbor themselves while you use it, and it will automatically return to you once
thrown."
500 CP,Finwion/Finwiel,Of Elves and Dwarves -- A Twilight of the North Supplement,"Whether you bear the dark hair and grey eyes of most of the Noldor, or the golden hair that some of the line of Indis possess, or even the red hair of some few of those related to the children of Nerdanel, you are a royal among the Noldor and descended of the House of Finwë, First King of the Noldor and father to Fëanor, mightiest and proudest of the Eldar. The Noldor are the most powerful of all Elves in Middle-earth, and some might say of all Elves period, famed warriors who excel in learning and in craft. Regardless, you are mightier than nearly any elf alive though still not the equal of Glorfindel, Elrond or Galadriel. As a craftsman your natural talent (though not your knowledge or skill at present) surpasses any elves living, and in the making of weapons and armor you are greater than any save perhaps the dwarves themselves in these days."
600 CP,Light Of Galadriel ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"An artefact formed of Elven craftsmanship, taking the form of a bracer that wraps around the four fingers of the left hand as well as on a ring placed upon the middle finger, with a rune centred upon the palm. You can use this to enchant your
attacks with light magic, something capable of temporarily blinding enemies with enough exposure, or heal yourself. You will find any runes you apply to it will enhance and alter any inherent light-based abilities you have, such as adding effects like fire, poison, frost, or enhancing this Item’s inherent connection to light. You can potentially disintegrate weaker enemies with this the light from this artefact, particularly those which are vulnerable to light in some way."

Middle-Earth. As this boat is yours, there isn’t an issue with bringing others like Men or Dwarves, or even Orcs if they genuinely wanted to go there for a more peaceful existence. In future Jumps where Valinor doesn’t exist, this vessel will act as a particularly effective normal boat which storms seem to avoid but can also transport those using it to an afterlife of their choice or similarly difficult to reach realm. Just bear in mind the trip might be one-way in some cases."
600 CP,Preservation,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"​You have the power of preservation. You cannot die from old age, nor will you become visibly older over time. All of the accumulated abilities and knowledge you've gained over the years will not degrade or be forgotten no matter how infrequently you use them.

seep into the lands you inhabit, protecting them from decay and corruption."
