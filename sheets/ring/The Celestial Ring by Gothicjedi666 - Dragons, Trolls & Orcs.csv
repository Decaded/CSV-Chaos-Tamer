0 CP,Forthog Orc-Slayer ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This unusual figure will occasionally show up out of nowhere to help you out, give you some advice and perhaps a motivational word or two, before disappearing again just as mysteriously. Armed with a weapon that seems to be a cross between a guitar, a spiked club and an axe, they are a very skilled fighter. They’ll occasionally provide you some support and encouragement on your long journey."
100 CP,Troll’s Might,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"From the hot lands of the Far South there come huge men, oft likened to half-trolls in appearance, with white eyes and red tongues. Traditionally they wield large weapons that even the strongest of men would struggle to wield, let alone swing them with such ferocity as do these men of Harad. To kill them takes no few number of wounds, and even then they are likely to slay more than a few men before they are brought down. You are one of these men, and whether you have their troll-like appearance is up to you. As well, you are resistant to poisons and venom."
100 CP,The Black Speech,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This Perk does cover certain secret languages you might encounter, in this case being the Black Speech of Mordor. Not all Orcs know it, with some thinking it’s just gibberish. Speaking, reading, writing and understanding these sorts of languages is instinctual for you, and you won’t suffer from any side effects or negative aspects of knowing or using various dark and eldritch languages, nor do those around you. You can toggle that safety feature off if you really want."
100 CP,"Mordor, Born And Razed",Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This may not be a misspelling, considering the Orcish culture. You have been born or created in a harsh environment and you can certainly survive in it. Raw meat, freezing blizzards, scorching volcanic environments, disease and hardship... well, it really isn’t that hard for you to live in it. You might not be comfortable in it, but you’ll survive the environment. Just need to keep an eye out for the inhabitants that are just as well adjusted as you are."
100 CP,Grog Drinker,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Better for you than milk, if you’re an Orc. Really, Orcs here seem to use Grog as an alcohol and a medicine, and since you bought this Perk you can benefit from the same thing. You can stomach any form of alcohol in any quantity, choose whether to appreciate or negate the taste regardless of its contents, and rapidly heal yourself of any maladies by drinking it. Just bear in mind that you might still be affected by poison slipped into it, or explosions caused by it."
100 CP,The Dragon Spell,Silmarillion Jumpchain,Dragons are famous for their cunning dragon spell. It is a form of hypnosis that can overpower many beings by gaze and word alone. At your baseline skill you are able to hypnotize the weak willed or despairing and give them simple commands. As you practice and grow in age you might one day be able to rewrite the memories of a man with a simple gaze and a few spoken words.
100 CP,Brutal Weapon,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This might take on the form of an enormous stone club, or a jagged sword, or perhaps a serrated dagger. It will be an effective weapon, if not particularly elegant, and noticeably intimidate your enemies."
100 CP,Chief’s Armour ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"A set of armour suitable for you. Even if it doesn’t cover your entire body or looks crude, it is incredibly durable and protective. Particularly the back of it, something that might come in handy considering the propensity for backstabbing around here. Even uncovered areas of your body seem to share the durability this armour provides."
100 CP,Warg Mount,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"A creature of war, you now possess a warg mount which is absolutely loyal to you even unto death. It is a lethal mount and will fearlessly bear you into battle against anyone or anything without hesitation. Counts as an item and does not take up a companion"
100 CP,Caragor,Shadow of Mordor Jumpchain,"A particularly large and ferocious caragor (armoured, spiky, bulky, hairless sabre-toothed tigers) that loves you, is happy to let you ride it and will do as you instruct."
100 CP,Serpentine Blade,Shadow of Mordor Jumpchain,"An asymmetrical, wavy dagger of orcish origin. Has mystical armour-piercing qualities when used to attack somebody from behind."
100 CP,Iron Shackles,Shadow of Mordor Jumpchain,"Prisoner's leg irons with a brutal history. Have the strange quality of sapping the mental strength and
will to resist those forced into them."
100 CP,A Lair ,Silmarillion Jumpchain,"Whether a cave or some abandoned underground ruin, you have a private lair of your own. Place your hoard here if you have one. This is a safe place that is very hard for outsiders to find but has nothing in it that you don’t bring or purchase."
100 CP,Thick-Skinned,Silmarillion JumpChain 1.0,"Your people were made to suffer under the whips and lashes of Melkor, but even those fierce scourges don’t retain their power forever. Your skin is literally thickened, tough and leathery and hard to pierce; it’s not as good as armour, but it’s something. You are inured to much pain, able to endure even great agonies and tortures without breaking. Your body has been strengthened, too, giving you great endurance and not-inconsiderable might. Perhaps most vital of your gifts, however, is the ability to retreat into yourself to outlast even the worst of torments. When another dominates your will, or you are placed in unendurable circumstances, you will not be entirely broken. Instead, your own will and selfhood will retreat deep inside you, hidden from all but the most piercing examinations of your thought. Though your body may toil at the behest of another, and go on without hope or happiness, still some vestige of your former spirit is sheltered inside, ready to emerge once again if you should escape such dire circumstances."
200 CP,"Bright Lord, Dark Lord, Same Thing Really",Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"With various forces that can’t really be killed by conventional head-popping zooming around Mordor these days, sometimes it’s better to bend the knee. If you do, you’ll find yourself accepted by whoever has defeated you regardless of who and what you are or your previous actions, and you’ll be appropriately rewarded for whatever aid you are able to provide. You help your new boss conquer a fortress and throw your hat into the ring for position of owning it, they’ll be far more likely to give you the position than any of their other allies."
200 CP,"Et Tu, Brûz?",Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"They never saw your betrayal coming. Even if it should have been somewhat obvious, but they should have just treated you better, really. You have the skills, timing and will be lucky with opportunities to betray those you serve under and take everything for yourself – or just leave defences open for your allies, whatever works for you. Even the most paranoid of employers or well-armoured of Warchiefs won’t notice you sharpening the knife or be suspicious if you’re approaching them as they’re standing on a very high point. Just... make sure once you pull it off, they won’t be able to come after you in revenge."
200 CP,Cruel Crossbow ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Rather than a fancy bow, you have decided to arm yourself with a cruder looking but perfectly functional crossbow. This is designed for more rapid fire than a normal bow and causing the maximum amount of damage to opponents they hit at the expense of extreme accuracy or range. The barbed bolts fired from this weapon tend to stick into opponents and wound them beyond the initial impact does. You have a rapidly regenerating supply of this ammunition. It even has spikes on it, and is durable enough to act as a more direct weapon in a pinch."
200 CP,The Fixer,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This masked figure approached you, pointing out they were worth more to you alive. See, they provide solutions. Most problems in Mordor can be solved with the swing of a blade. But when the situation at hand is more complex, for example when you need to not only kill one enemy but also make it appear that a second was responsible, this figure is the one to call. They can make difficult problems go away and can draw on a vast network of manipulations and owed favours to make it happen. They are valued as much for their results as for their discretion, a quality virtually unknown in Mordor. Should they need to accompany you in person, you will find they are just as fleet as foot and subtle as you are."
200 CP,The Lookout,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"While you’re keeping watch, it might be helpful to have someone to watch your back. You get along well with this figure. You might be long- lost siblings, or perhaps they are someone related to an important official. You can leave them to look after things in your absence, as they’re quite a good leader and administrator in their own right, but they are equally capable of accompanying you into the field of battle."
200 CP,The Bodyguard ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"As brutal as life in Mordor might seem to outsiders, it is entirely possible for strong bonds to form between some of its inhabitants. You’ve forged one with this figure, a find addition to your army. From here on out, they will be your shadow. No one gets to you without their say so. They will do what they can to protect you and your territory, and have the unusual ability fill in roles in combat opposite to your own. For example, if you are a huge and durable figure using a giant but slow weapon, they will be a smaller but much more agile figure. If you specialise in ranged attacks, they will focus on close combat. Your bond is so great that should any harm befall one of you, the other will immediately be aware of the danger and the cause."
200 CP,Cavern Lake,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"​The sun can be a bitter foe for creatures of darkness, so for that, you have this place. It is a vast cavern lake filled with juicy fishes just waiting to be caught and eaten raw and wriggling. No sunlight can penetrate this domain, and all creatures of darkness find it strangely homey and comforting. Can be dropped into other jumps or added as a warehouse attachment."
200 CP,Hatred,Shadow of Mordor Jumpchain,"Uruks tend to fight harder against things they hate. You however have it in you to hate everything. This surge of hatred makes you significantly stronger, more resistant to damage and (somehow) heal faster than you should be able to."
400 CP,Necromancy ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Feel like raising an army using other means? There’s no shortage of the dead in these conditions. This ability will grow over time, starting with animating one or two weak corpses using energy gleaned from killing enough. In time you could learn to summon up corporeal ghosts of the dead as an army, create totems that repeatedly revive nearby corpses under your control as long as the totem remains intact, or even perform rituals to bind wraiths into living or near-dead beings for a variety of purposes. Those killed by undead are far easier to call back, sentient or otherwise, than those killed by the living."
400 CP,Brutal Cunning ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You wouldn’t exactly be a Warchief for too long amongst the forces of Mordor if you weren’t good at fighting. Those that rely too much on their bodyguards might end up being backstabbed by them. You have a combination of instinct, training, and the right body type for an approach to combat you prefer. Maybe you’re a sneakier fellow using traps and bombs, so you’ll have a more agile and dextrous frame. Stay at range, you’ll develop much better eyesight and aim for your powerful crossbow. Maybe you go for the direct approach, and as a result you’ll have a towering and muscle-bound body capable of lifting up a Caragor and breaking it in half. Uruk, Olog or Goblin, whatever species or sub-species you’ve become, you are amongst the best at your particular style of combat."
400 CP,Cunningly Brutal,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Some might think you have two heads, on account of you being so smart. In this case probably smart for an Orc, but if you were some other species you’d be among what passes for the more intelligent amongst them. Perhaps you’re not necessarily incredibly intelligent, you just know exactly how the rest of your kind thinks and how to exploit it. You’d certainly be able to lead your own people into an ambush at least twice before they caught on, which might be enough if they didn’t have some outside help. Either way, you’re good at tactics, ambushes and fooling your own species."
400 CP,Beasts Of Mordor,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You have bonded with examples of various dangerous creatures that live in these lands. When you call upon them, they shall come, skuttling, fluttering, leaping and lumbering forth to aid you. They are trained and consider you an ally, and the weaker they are the greater in number they can be, while the stronger or more specialised creatures may only come in a pair. You could summon a swarm of hungry Ungol Spiders or Mordor Rats, unleash a nest of stinging Morgai Flies, call forth a flock of Hell-Hawks, or muster up a group of vicious Ghûls to feast on your enemies or a pack of Caragors to ride upon. If you are in need of something more powerful but less numerous, you could instead bring forth a pair of towering Graugs to smash your opponents into greasy smears, or fiery Drakes to take flight and burn your foes to ashes. Once you use this Perk there is a waiting period before you can use it again in the same area. While you can keep this limited to the creatures from Mordor, you can also update it to equivalent beasts you encounter in future Jumps. When pack animals that can be ridden are called upon, they will include a strongpack-leader for your personal use, such as a Dire Caragor. If there is a variety of a specific type of creature, such as the Flame, Frost or Poison Graugs, you can decide which ones you want to come to your aid."
400 CP,Hoard,Silmarillion Jumpchain,"Every Dragon worth anything needs a hoard. Gathered up from your enemies over the years and collected in a safe place of your choosing is the amazing wealth of your hoard. Countless pieces of gold, gems, hundreds of precious stones, and armories worth of weapons and armor are scattered in grand mounds. This hoard can either be located in a safe place of your choosing or as an attachment to the warehouse from jump to jump. Good luck ever spending it all, even if you wanted to do anything other than nap on it."
400 CP,Warchief,Shadow of Mordor Jumpchain,You have a reputation that even amongst Sauron's forces is considered intensely scary. Through sheer menace you are capable of keeping thousands of members of a duplicitous and quarrelsome species in check and obedient.
600 CP,Iron Will ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Being called stubborn is one thing, but anyone trying to modify your mind against your will might find it easier to get through your thick skull with metal rather than relying on a magical ring. You’re essentially immune to mind control, mental alteration intended to make you more pliable, or other such puppetry. You will not be bent, and the best they might manage to do is be forced to break you entirely. Even then, you could bounce back given time."
600 CP,Goblin King,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"​Some kings rule through love, benevolence, and justice. You are not such a king. You inspire loyalty through fear, and because of that, it doesn't matter how badly you treat your people, they will always accept your brutality without question. Those under your command are unlikely to betray you, too frightened of the potential consequences to even consider it."
