0 CP,Pipeweed Pouch,Shadow of MordorJumpchain,"A refilling pouch of dried, extremely high quality pipe weed. Chills out even the most megalomaniacal of wizards."
100 CP, Your Mark ,"Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition
","You might want to make it clear you are active within a given area, either to give others somewhere to find to interact with you or to try to ward off intruders. This could be a symbol that you can place within a location, or even something like a strong feeling of your presence to those who enter the area."
100 CP,I Deal Only In Truth ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"When you’re telling the truth people know, you can also tell when people are lying to you. You might not necessarily be nice and certainly not setting a shining example to others with other things you might be up to, but at least you are notably honest."
100 CP,Ungol Egg,Shadow of Mordor Jumpchain,"An unhatched child of the great spider Shelob. When it hatches, it will think whoever it sees first is mommy and will do whatever they say. Buy two, and you can start a nest... but why would you want to?"
200 CP, Wraith Bow ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Whether this is Azkar or another bow depends on whether or not the Wraith inhabiting you is Celebrimbor or not. Rather than using arrows of conventional physical materials, this instead conjures insubstantial glowing blue arrows of Wraith-magic. While you may be able to find more of these Wraith-magic arrows throughout the battlefields of Mordor, purchasing this will ensure your supply steadily regenerates by itself. Inscription: Narvi had me made for the ring-smith and for his loyal service. His arrows truly may they hit their mark."
200 CP,Brood,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Creatures that serve you, perhaps ones you gave birth to, or created or altered using your abilities. Whatever it is, they will match your particular type of being. If you are a spider the size of a cart, perhaps these will be spiders up to the size of a large dog. If you are a creature of wood and leaf, perhaps some manner of woodland animal. If you are a creature of fire and shadow, perhaps they will be smaller beings of a similar nature. Whatever they are, they are significantly smaller and weaker than you, though potentially great in number. You may direct them as you will."
200 CP,Elemental Manipulation,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Pick one non-manufactured feature of the world, such as ‘plants’, ‘shadows’, or ‘fire’. You are able to wield it as a weapon if you wished, such as creating a whip of fire, hide within it, or create and control facsimiles of another creature. The original must be weaker than you, and your duplicate will obviously be composed of whatever ‘element’ you chose, but it will have similar abilities to the original if it would not be antithetical to whatever the ‘element’ is. If this is the case, their abilities will change in form but not potency. As a drake made of plants would easily combust if it used fire, yours would instead breathe ice."
200 CP,Great And Terrible,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You are not of the race of Men, but you’re not an Orc, an Elf or a Wraith either. While you can certainly have a passably human form, you gain a ‘true’ form of some manner of immense creature and great affinity for others of its kind. While this defaults to a thing in a spider-like form that could very well be a descendent of Ungoliant like Shelob, you could instead choose to be a vast serpent, centipede, or raven. Or you could choose to be a towering tree-like being. Alternatively, you could be a looming monster of smoke and flame. Either way, you are very powerful physically, unnaturally durable, essentially ageless, and get more powerful as you grow older."
200 CP,Last Gasp ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"As long as you are not killed instantly by something, you have a chance of escaping death for just a little longer. Should you be battered and beaten to the point you would and may actually fall to your knees, you have a short grace period. If nobody finishes you off, you will be able to get back up and fight once more. If somebody does try to finish you off, you will have a small but noticeable opportunity to counter the final blow and force yourself back into the fight. If you time it right you could even take out your attempted executioner with the same counter, but if you get it wrong..."
200 CP,Morgul Blade,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"Made from iron ingots found in the Dark Land, these blades are sharp and strong, but that is not their true purpose. Their purpose is to inflict wounds that will not heal by normal means, and if used properly even turn the victim into a wraith under the control of the one who wounded them. A worthy weapon for a sorcerer, this longsword will not crumble upon use nor will it fade with the light of dawn after being used. As well, it is able to withstand strikes from even the finest of Dwarf-wrought weapons. It is cold to the touch, the edge will never dull and nor will the blade rust."
200 CP,The Guardian,"Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition
","It seems you have earned the favour of something old and powerful. Rather than forcing you to carry out their orders, they seem to be more inclined to guide and aid you, as your unusual nature has caught their interest. To see something new after so long intrigues them, and to ensure their mere presence does not harm you, they have granted you significant resistance to their nature."
200 CP,Treasure ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You might not have much need for worldly possessions, but you might have accumulated things over time. This is a hidden stash of wealth that you have acquired over the years, or perhaps found in some forgotten place. It will mostly be simple material goods like gold, jewels and perhaps some artefacts of minor historical interest, but in each Jump you will be able to find one particularly notable artefact in your collection. Not necessarily powerful, but perhaps famous in some way."
200 CP,Wizard Staff,"The Hobbit Jumpchain
","Somehow you came into possession of a wizard’s staff. It acts as a focus for those with magical talent, providing a moderate boost in the potency of their spells. Comes with a free pointy hat!"
300 CP,Dol Guldur,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"Dol Guldur, also known as the Hill of Dark Sorcery, was Sauron's stronghold and base of operations when he worked his sorcery in the wood under the name of The Necromancer. You now have a copy of this dark fortress, filled with dark creatures ready to do your bidding. It can be dropped into a jump or added as a warehouse attachment."
400 CP, Spirit ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You are not alone anymore. A long-dead being has been bound to you, and though they will not have any power except that which you allow them to have, they can guide you in the use of the abilities of a Wraith if you have the Perk. They can separate themselves from your body as a ghostly apparition that cannot be seen by others unless they are perceptive to such things or overlay your own to give yourself a ghostly visage. This can be partial, projecting their spirit over your flesh such as having half of your body take on their appearance, or you can choose to visually replace yourself with their ghostly form."
400 CP,Hunting Ground,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Powerful you might be, but you didn’t last this long by not taking every advantage you could. You might not survive much longer if you don’t continue to do so. That might be why you decided to purchase this. It seems to be an environment that was almost designed to give you advantages in combat based on your abilities and weaknesses, which your enemies find difficult to navigate. If you could walk on any surface, it could be a series of caverns and tunnels that allow you to exploit this ability to attack at unexpected angles. If you were made of plants, it could be a forested area you can easily blend into and damp enough to make starting fires difficult. If you were of a fiery nature, it might be a chamber filled with lava and scorching air that you can comfortably inhabit while your  enemies must endure the terrible heat. It can either be a location by itself, or you can assign its properties to a building or territory you already own."
400 CP,Palantir ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"A magical artefact also known as a Seeing Stone. This one is separate from the others here and enemy forces cannot use it to see or affect you. This Item allows whoever possesses it to see any item, person or location they wish in real time, though it is possible for powerful forces akin to Sauron to conceal what you are trying to view in shadow if they are trying to specifically hide it. This comes with a stand, should you not wish to carry this treasure around with you."
400 CP,Secret Ways,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You may have walked this world for a long time, and in your wandering you have discovered or created paths that others do not dare to venture on, or perhaps know nothing about. This is a wide network of old and unknown ways that you and your allies could use to get around unnoticed, like underground tunnels and overlooked paths that others do not use. These ways are hidden from others, allowing you to travel across the breadth of Mordor without being spotted by even the most watchful and piercing of eyes. In future Jumps, you can give a territory this collection of hidden pathways, and even link it to any properties you own to allow unseen travel between them. It isn’t any faster than other routes but being subtle can have advantages over speed."
400 CP,Spider’s Web ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You and what you can control are more than mere matter. You can capture and contain even insubstantial things such as bodiless wraiths, if they are sufficiently weakened or distracted, either to finish them off, use them as a hostage, or keep them around for other purposes. The exact method will depend upon your other capabilities, such as ensnaring them in roots, trapping them within a cage of fire, or weaving a shadowy cloud around them."
400 CP,The Cycle Is Unbroken,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"A being that exists for aeons may still need to rest and recuperate after battling with similarly powerful beings. You might even want to take a long nap and just sleep through the current problem if you have no interest in it. You can bind yourself to a location that embodies your chosen element, such as a forest for nature, a magma flow for fire, or a network of caverns for darkness, and not only gain awareness of what goes on within it but use it to recuperate. Even if you have been grievously wounded or exhausted in battle with a being that is your antithesis, you can come here to recuperate. Be warned, binding yourself to such a place can also bring about a vulnerability in your weakened state. If you were the embodiment of a forest and retreated to its heart, your enemies could potentially kill you should they find a way to burn down your resting place."
400 CP,Wraith,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"It seems you are more than mortal, possessing abilities that the living normally do not have in Middle-Earth. You can fall from great heights without harm, perform incredible leaps, run at great speed, even conjure up phantasmal weapons. Ranged equivalents may need you to locate some form of ammunition or give you time to recharge as unlike others this involves your ghostly energy permanently leaving your body as the projectiles. You can let yourself partially slip into a shadowy netherworld, remaining physically within the living world but able to perceive other beings within either even through solid surfaces. Given time and experimentation, you could develop other abilities such as a second leap off of thin air, unleashing blasts of ice or fire or poison, teleporting yourself or others to you by expending the same energy you would use for projectiles, or fight in multiple places simultaneously as your wraith acts under your mental command. With just this Perk, this power is entirely yours and unshared with any other being,"
400 CP,Angainor ,Silmarillion Jumpchain,"You now have a copy of the great chains Aule crafted to bind the great Valar Melkor before throwing him into the Timeless Void. These powerful chains can bind an enemy of any size and easily hold any being below those of God-like might, if you can capture them."
500 CP,Morgul-Lore,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"You are deep in sorcery and possess knowledge surpassing any save perhaps the Witch-king himself. With but a gesture and a word you can make a sword crumble in the hands of a man, a door seal shut against any but those with might greater than your own, enchant siege weapons with dark spells to blast asunder great gates, and enspell daggers with enchantments akin to those of the morgul blades. You can stir up a storm on a cloudy day, and in winter make the cold more deadly. You can brew disease and plague. You can bind the spirits of the dead and command them. Send them into tombs to inhabit the long deceased. Create illusions and phantasms. Make flame and lightning. Force orcs and trolls into your service with a few words or even merely a hard look. Extend your life. Speak with the crows and wolves and other evil creatures. With time and effort, you may even approach the might of the Witch-king himself, should you acquire even a lesser Ring."
600 CP,Cult,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Sometimes it’s nice to be appreciated, and this group certainly likes you.They’re rather fanatical about it really, outright worshipping you if that’s what you want. Or they could just quietly guard a location with their lives and do their best to prevent anyone from disturbing you if you would prefer an existence of solitude. While they are not an army and would not fare will against the more powerful figures of Middle-Earth or other worlds, should you somehow be imprisoned or killed they have an uncanny capability to succeed in releasing or reviving you. The latter only works once a Jump or every decade, as it requires quite a lot of effort and sacrifice on their part. They will most likely decorate themselves or where they are staying with affectations to your own appearance and nature, unless you tell them otherwise."
600 CP,Forge ,"Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition
","Do you intend to create a Ring of Power for yourself? That is certainly possible here, should you have enough time, skill and potency of your own. This Item takes the form of an appropriately equipped forge with an appearance of your choice and a source of materials for whatever it is you intend to make. If you intend to forge something like a Ring of Power, you will find yourself with something akin to Mount Doom. If you only need to fix a normal suit of armour or create something mundane like new horseshoes you will be presented with a more modest and discrete workshop. You can decide what you will be working on when you come to place this Item in the Jump, which can be in any territory you own. It can also be imported into any building you have, or into the Warehouse."
600 CP,Haedir Towers ,"Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition
","These might be called dark imitations of the Palantir by some, but they can grant sight once they have been claimed. Interacting with the fiery stone in the chamber atop them allows you to perceive through an eye-like blue flame above the tower. They allow you to locate lost secrets and memories of their environment’s past, with points of interest found through the eye being automatically marked on any map you are using if desired. While you will find these towers in the various regions of Mordor even without this purchase that you can purify and claim for yourself, paying for it here allows similar towers to be established within any territory you claim within the future. For one final advantage you can utilise to guard territory you have managed to claim, they allow you to instantly transport yourself between them so long as you are not in danger."
600 CP,Ring of Power,Of Elves and Dwarves -- A Twilight of the North Supplement,"The Rings of Power were forged in Eregion by the great smiths of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain during the Second Age. All of the Great Rings save the One had a single gem, and not one design was repeated. Every ring was imbued with a power that came from the combined skill of the great Noldor craftsmen that wrought them and the knowledge brought by Sauron in the guise of Annatar. Your Ring of Power, greater than any of the Nine, possessing to at least some degree the powers of the Three, and to a minor extent even carries some form of the power of the One, is untouched by the corruption of the Ruling Ring, independent in power, and wholly yours. In material it is mithril or a mithril-gold alloy depending on your taste in color, it has an inscription of your choice in Quenya or Khuzdul using the Tengwar, and a unique jewel set into it. This Ring cannot be seen by any save for another who wears a Ring of Power, or Sauron himself. In potency, your Ring is lesser than the One, but greater than any others, occupying a halfway point."
600 CP,The New Ring ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"It is up to you if this is the most recent ring crafted by Celebrimbor, or you have your own independent one, depending on whether you have taken another’s place in this story in the Bright Lord Scenario. Either way, this one is loyal to you. Your own strength has been used in its creation, rendering it free of others influence, yet you are not diminished or limited for it. Should you allow it to be taken from you, something that is not possible against your will, you can cause its influence to wear away at the minds and souls of those who foolishly dared to lay claim to your treasure. Or you could lend it as a gift, knowing its wielders cannot use the might it grants them against you. Made with the intent of rivalling Sauron’s own One Ring, it bestows upon its wearers the power of Domination, allowing users to force their will upon other life forms susceptible to its immense magical power. This effect is not absolute, as sufficiently powerful beings can potentially resist its power and break free of it. The mentally weak and broken are more prone to its influence, whilst those with a will of iron have a chance of denying it altogether. If you already have this ability through purchasing The Power Of Domination Perk, you will find it easier and more intuitive to use, able to seize control of even the most powerful beasts such as Graugs and Drakes if you can weaken their resolve or somehow make them more vulnerable. You can also sacrifice your own followers, causing their heads to explode in an attempt to intimidate your enemies, or provide aid by healing those within close range at the expense of your own health. Additionally, you can restore your own wellbeing by draining others of theirs. As it was made to combat Sauron’s own One Ring and the other Rings Of Power, you will find it is capable of breaking Sauron’s hold over his Ringwraiths, either dominating them or releasing them from undeath. In future Jumps, you will find this power can be used to free others from mental control and contamination, as well as releasing those bound to undeath and letting those forced to remain lingering amongst the living to pass on. Like other Rings of Power, it grants augmentative effects to those who wear it, enhancing their existing abilities to new heights."
600 CP,The Power of Domination ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You are capable of essentially enslaving the minds of others, bending them to your will. It is faster if you can physically contact their head, but can also be done from a short distance, though still only one at a time. This can be done to any living creature, and some undead, that possess something akin to a functional mind. Those with more power or stronger wills may need to be broken in first by seriously harming them, but average grunts will fall to you within a few uninterrupted seconds. With some practice, beasts can be rapidly dominated without needing to harm them. You can use this ability tolook within the minds of others as well. Bear in mind, however, that some beings are protected against this sort of mental interference through some means. They might not serve you with just this power at your disposal, so you will have to find other means to remove them as an enemy, or perhaps find ways to weaken them to the point they are vulnerable. It won’t work on mindless puppet corpses or the equivalent, but you have a chance of dominating anything that actually has some sort of mind. Perhaps even creatures like Ringwraiths, or stranger things, should they lack a way to stop you seizing control."
600 CP,Seedlings of Trees,Silmarillion Jumpchain,"Telperion and Laurelin were the greatest trees to exist. The only source of light in the world after
the destruction of the lamps and before the creation of the Sun and Moon. With leaves of gold
upon the one and leaves of silver upon the other, they shined with a beautiful light that the Sun
and Moon are but pale imitations of. Ungoliant destroyed these trees, draining their light and
increasing her might. Somehow, two seedlings of the trees have survived and ended up in your
hands. These seedlings, when planted will sprout and over the course of a few years grow into
new trees with same light. These are hallowed and sacred things. Bring light back to this
enshadowed realm, or perhaps hoard it for yourself and see what you can gain from exploiting
such great lights. The trees can either be placed in a garden-like attachment to your warehouse
or planted in a spot of your choosing from jump to jump."
