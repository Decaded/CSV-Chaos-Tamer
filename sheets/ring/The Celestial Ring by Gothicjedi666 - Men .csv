0 CP,Trained in Weapons,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"You are a gifted fighter, trained to proficiency in most types of weapons, and given a basic education in holding formation with others. While not close to being a master, you have been trained well enough to hold your own against the average soldier. Better, in fact! You are above average as a warrior. And with time you can become much better."
100 CP,Guard’s Sword,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"A sharp and sturdy blade. There is not a lot special about the weapon itself, but it does symbolise your position as one who protects others. Your allies and those under your protection will feel safer and reassured should they see you with it."
100 CP,Historian,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Protecting the present is all well and good, but perhaps we should try to protect the past as well? Those who fail to learn from it, and all that. You not only have a great deal of expertise and luck at preserving, locating and safeguarding historical artefacts, you also have a great deal of knowledge for any given culture within the world as long as they are known to have existed. You are good enough to identify important artefacts on sight, even if it looks like a chipped metal plate to someone else you could clearly make out its origin, use, and what it implies about the culture based on all available evidence. In a more peaceful time, you could quite easily become a very well-regarded archaeologist, as your explanations of such matters are accurate and interesting for practically any audience."
100 CP,Horsemanship,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"You are a skilled rider of horses, and cavalryman. Skilled in wielding a lance on horseback, and in getting the most out of your mount. You’ll never fall from your saddle, and with more exotic mounts such as camels you seem to pick up the basics in a matter of days at most. And can tame them quickly."
100 CP,"One Wall, One Ranger ",Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You have at least two decades of training and practical experience at being an expert Ranger, capable of navigating the harshest environments of the world to keep the more peaceful areas safe from the things lurking beyond the light of civilisation. You can easily climb up any surface with handholds, balance on ropes and have no fear of heights or dizziness from acrobatics. You’re more than capable of defending yourself with blades, as well as a bow and arrow, and have impressive stamina and resilience. You have all sorts of knowledge pertaining to wildlife, natural hazards, herbology, and you know how to use all of it to your advantage. You don’t seem to need to sleep very often, and in combat with more humanoid figures it isn’t too difficult to evade clumsy strikes and even leap over them as long as they aren’t towering over you – and if they are, you could likely slip between their legs to strike them from behind. You seem to avoid all the bumps, scrapes and scratches this sort of activity would cause. Must be all that fresh air."
100 CP,Ranger’s Armour ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"The same outfit that the Rangers of The Black Gate wear. While the protection it gives you against harm is limited, it does protect you from the weather remarkably well, and the cloak can greatly aid any attempts to camouflage yourself and remain hidden. There are a variety of pockets and straps for any equipment, allowing you to store and retrieve things easily."
100 CP,Sons of Eärendil ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"The Dúnedain have long been skilled mariners, in a tradition going all the way back to Eärendil whose legendary voyages are still told to the children of those who trace their ancestry back to Númenor. But even more than that, the Guild of Venturers was first founded by Tar-Aldarion, sixth King of Númenor, to be a society for the most adventurous young ship-captains of that fair Isle. His legacy has been entwined with the culture of the Dúnedain for millennia. As the great shipyards of Gondor or the Black Númenoreans might show. Indeed, the Dúnedain have produced many brave and bold captains or explorers. You might now join their ranks, with your natural talent and skills in all facets of the sea. You are a strong swimmer, a skilled navigator, a shipwright of fair skill, a talented captain, and all around a mariner who could one day be counted among the truly great. You could take a ship meant for calm seas and not only survive, but navigate the treacherous waters of the open ocean and stay alive in a storm."
100 CP,Black Arrows,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"Every dragon slayer needs a weapon to take down their terrible foe, and these black arrows are just what you need. Not only do they have an unusually good chance of hitting their target, they do a disproportionately large amount of damage compared to a normal arrow, and the arrows always find their way back to you shortly. These arrows come in bow and wind lance sized varieties."
100 CP ,Ranger’s Cloak,Shadow of Mordor Jumpchain,"A camouflaged brown cloak was clasped with the symbol of the Rangers of the Black Gate. The cloak itself
makes you significantly more difficult to notice when worn with the hood up."
200 CP,Blade of Westernesse ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"The blades of Westernesse are enchanted with many words of hatred to the dark and ancient foes of Númenor. Wrought of a metal light and strong, these blades rival the finest Elf-made weapons and cast a similar fear onto one's foes. These swords possess the traits not only of not rusting, nor losing their edge... but also harming the Unseen or the Dead. Ghosts and wights are harmed especially, and this weapon could even render the Witch-king susceptible to killing. But this sword is even better, it will resist sorcery and attempts at destroying it by anything short of the Dark Lord’s hand. If you choose, you can instead have an existing weapon take on these qualities."
200 CP,Gerhild ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"Standing at 5’9” with golden hair in a braid and pale-green eyes seemingly always looking for adventure, Gerhild dresses fairly unremarkably in green clothing. A daughter of a soldier and a fairly wealthy merchant, she’s left her home seeking glory and wealth like she’s imagined in the stories she heard of shield-maidens as a child, and you seem to have caught her eye and gained her friendship. She is great with horses, both breeding them and riding them, and is fairly skilled with a spear and lance."
200 CP,Glider,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"A primitive but effective parachute that can deploy should you find yourself falling a great distance and lets you cover a considerable amount of ground. You seem to have a lot of luck finding updrafts to keep you airborne when you need them, though some skill will be required to make the best use of them."
200 CP,Management ,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"You might not be the best at fighting battles yourself, but you are great at all the things outside of the battlefield. Finances, troop movements, training, logistics, even running the various processes involved in the function of entire cities. You can even sort out how to delegate things to the right people so you don’t have to micromanage everything yourself. As long as you are around, you can keep civilisation running relatively smoothly as long as it survives, and in worse cases have a knack at restarting the process."
200 CP,Numenorian Climbing Device,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This is essentially an ancient and still fully functional wrist-based grappling hook, looking rather like a bracer, which can also extend into a durable shield for defence or a bashing weapon. It has a rather powerful built in crossbow, which automatically reloads itself with any ammunition for it you have. You might be able to load it with something more exotic than steel bolts if you have the right sort of technical skill or know someone who could tinker with it."
200 CP,Ranger’s Blade,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This might be Urafel if you have replaced Talion, or a sword of another name if not. Either way, you will find this weapon is receptive to any upgrades or alterations you make to it. It will also change to match your personality and actions, taking on a glorious silver shine if you are a champion of the downtrodden, or perhaps becoming a more malevolent looking and ornate bronze blade should you be a merciless tyrant. By default, it bears this inscription: A beacon of light to the unled. Blazing like fire with justice in lands stained with foulness. One stands alone in the light."
200 CP,Ranger’s Dagger,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This may be Acharn, forged from the shattered sword of Talion’s son, or another blade if you have not taken their place. Either way, this dagger is a silent implement intended to enact vengeance upon Sauron’s armies, and if an opponent is unaware of your presence and you are capable of killing them, this can be used to do so silently. You can channel your own powers through it, such as being capable of turning those felled by it into revenants if you have the power of necromancy. It will change to match your personality and actions, such as becoming more sinister looking with a barbed edge if you are a tyrant. By default, it bears this inscription: A dagger secret in the night. Terrifying evildoers who must give back with blood. Swallows pain and red becomes black."
200 CP,Temair,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"The twenty-five year old daughter to the brother of a clan chief among the Hill-men of Rhudaur, Temair is everything that her father could have wanted in a son. Standing at 5’8”, fairly muscled and with the dark hair and eyes and the swarthy complexion of her mother’s kin, she is strong and skilled. Bold and fearless. And wishes for her people to be free of the Witch-king. She possesses a talent for speaking with crows, and even commanding some to do her bidding. She dresses in wool pants and a long fur jacket, as well as leather boots in order to help keep out the chill of the recent years. Respecting your strength, she has decided to follow you, and will keep doing so unless you harm her people or treat her unfairly."
200 CP,Weapon of Renown,Of Elves and Dwarves -- A Twilight of the North Supplement,"Narsil, Aeglos, Durin’s Axe, Orcrist. Many are the famous weapons of Middle-earth, wielded by mighty kings, valiant princes, and stalwart chiefs, and others not so heroic. Regardless, each has a history and power all their own, and now you possess an exact duplicate of one of these famous weapons. Choose any named weapon, and you shall receive a copy of it, and if lost it shall return to you within a month. If broken, it will need to be repaired like any other
weapon, though it seems unlikely at best that any of the weapons you might choose will be broken save for if the Dark Lord were to bring his strength against them."
200 CP,White Tree ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"The White Tree of Gondor comes with its own plaza in front of a great Hall fit for kings and there is a white-paved place where a sweet fountain is playing. About it is a sward of bright green, but in the midst above the pool the White Tree stands proudly, proclaiming the health of you and yours. Once you have chosen where to place this wonder, it shall reflect the state of the realm you are a part of, and so long as the tree itself remains healthy so too shall your line."
200 CP,Isilmë ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"A distant cousin to her kin of the ruling line of Arthedain, Isilmë nonetheless is clearly of the House of Isildur. Thirty years of age, and standing just shy of six-feet tall, her hair is jet-black and waist length, normally braided, and her eyes a bright grey. Beautiful, and with fair skin, she is fairly athletic. In terms of clothing she prefers to dress in dark blues, with either silver or white for trim. She is an eager learner and educated in the ways of healing as well as her knowledge of history and lore, surpassing all but the most wizened sages with her talent and skill. In addition, her looks belie a natural determination and grit that will carry her through a wight-infested barrow or worse should you choose to lead her through. You have gained her interest through one way or another, and now she would like to follow you in your adventures."
200 CP,The Master,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"It doesn't matter how greedy, slimy, or self-serving you might be, you find it unusually easy to gain and keep political office. Along with a minor boost in charisma and political tact, you gain widespread public tolerance that can only be broken if someone truly compelling appears to challenge your position."
300 CP,Breeder of Horses ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"You are well-versed in not only knowing the physical health of your horses, but being able to pick the best to breed and to always ensure the most advantageous traits are bred. You can take a poor draft horse, and in a few generations their line will produce warhorses as fine as any with a thousand-year pedigree. This goes as well for other domesticated creatures."
300 CP,Lore of the Lost Homeland ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"Though in these days much has been lost of the lore of Númenor, even from the days of Elendil, you now possess such knowledge as was available during the days of the ending of the Second Age and as such can be considered one of the most learned in those subjects of any living Man. Indeed, such lore as the waybread and drinks used on the march and held in need-wallets that are like to the elven lembas and miruvor but less potent. The knowledge used in the making of the Othram, the great outer wall of Minas Anor, its outward face hard and dark and smooth, wrought of the same black stone used to construct the tower of Orthanc. Unbreakable by any means available to Men. The lore used in the making of such weapons as the barrow blades, or the fine armor of the Númenorean lords. Even the knowledge of ship-lore and building. The various architectural and engineering wonders of the early years of Arnor and Gondor are yours to know."
300 CP,Laketown,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"What is a King without a Kingdom? You gain a replica of Laketown and the Long Lake. You can drop it into a jump, it will quickly populate with appropriate locals who will be loyal to you or you can keep it as a warehouse attachment."
400 CP,Numenorian Schematics,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"This fallen empire possessed wisdom far superior to most of Middle-Earth today. The soldiers of this ancient empire wielded the mightiest blades, the most powerful bows... but, as with most things, they weren’t satisfied there. They devised clever tools to deal with their enemies. You now have some of their work, designs for mechanical additions to your equipment that could grant properties not dependent on magic or superhuman capabilities. This record includes a variety of schematics, ranging from an addition to a shield that sets it on fire during a charge, to a spiked chain weapon, to a system that stores energy from blows against a shield and can violently release it against opponents. In future Jumps, this collection will update with other useful designs of technology from ancient or lost cultures."
500 CP,Blood of Númenor ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"By some chance the blood of Númenor runs true in you, nearly as much as it does among the royals of Gondor and Arthedain. You are one of the Dúnedain or Men of Westernesse. Tall, dark-haired and grey-eyed, and more noble in spirit and body than other Men despite the fading of your kind. You possess the gift of foresight to some degree, though it is not infallible nor predictable. You are stronger in body than any among Men save the Troll-men of Far Harad, and in lifespan you can expect to live two centuries or more. You inspire those around you by your mere presence, and can ward off the effects of fear on your men. You have some innate talent for the healing of wound and hurt. There is an innate air of authority to you, like the Kings themselves, and even those who have never met you will at least recognize it. In future Jumps, humans will recognize this in you, and view you as something above human even if they cannot put their finger on it."
500 CP,King of Men,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"You are descended from royalty of some sort in the lands you start off in. You are stronger than those around you, and have an air that seems to lend you greater authority. Even to those in power over you. You live slightly longer, and you are more adept at learning new skills and improving your existing ones. Where others might take a lifetime to become master warriors, you’ll take only a few years. Where others might need years to gain truly strong bonds with friends, you have a natural charisma to befriend people in a much shorter time. You’re just... better!"
500 CP,Vidugavia’s Legacy ,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"Vidugavia, the King of Rhovanion, and once mightiest of all the Northmen. He managed to unite many princes under one banner and his grandson went on to be Eldacar, the King of Gondor. Like him, you possess a knack for leadership and diplomacy with other nations. And as the epitome of  orthmen, you are one of the finest riders the world has seen, a sublime warrior-prince like figure able to fight as well as any knight or king. As well, you have a way about you that draws even mightier kingdoms to look upon you more as an equal partner."
600 CP,Mercenaries,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"These might be the Vanishing Sons, or a rival group. They certainly consider themselves to be amongst the finest warriors of Middle-Earth. That’s questionable, but you can’t fault their enthusiasm. They aren’t heroes, being a collection of killers and thieves, and rather good at it. You can hire them out for a cut of the profit. Ordinarily, these are not soldiers, their loyalty is bought and when they stop getting paid their blades are no longer under their employers control, but you paid the CP for them so they will be loyal to you over all others. They see a bright future ahead of them. They see coin. Fortune. And enough danger to make it fun. You can establish this group in future Jumps, and they’ll have adapted with the local resources. As mercenaries generally get hired by whoever is willing to pay, you will find this group are capable of extending their services to anyone who would plausibly hire them in any location. This could ensure you and your mercenaries have a steady supply of money or used to place your own people within factions that you intend to sabotage or subvert. You can conceal your ownership of this group from these employers, who will believe that ‘their’ mercenaries are loyal to them, while in truth at any time your mercenaries are willing to turn on their true targets when you give the order."
600 CP,City of Renown,Twilight of the North - A Jumpchain CYOA,"Fornost, Tharbad, Pelargir, Minas Anor, Osgiliath, Minas Ithil, Umbar... The renowned cities of Middle-earth are truly awe-inspiring works filled with people and mighty walls. Even the least of them are well made and defensible. Now you can have one of them for your own! Filled with a generic population fit for the culture of the city, and lacking the artifacts within the originals... but the city itself will be at its full splendor and connected to your warehouse or accessed by pocket dimension with a special key you are given. In future Jumps you can choose to have this city placed inside the world you are Jumping to, in an appropriate place as close as possible to the geography of its original location."
