0 CP,Home,LOTR Jumpchain,"You don't want to always live on the road, do you? You have a small, but comfortable, home in whatever town or city you choose (this may be different from your starting location)."
0 CP,Basic Camping Supplies,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there is no telling where you might be swept off to. Sometimes, those roads don't have modern conveniences like beds and roofs, but now you have a large backpack with high quality camping gear. It's oddly light and easy to pack up, and the gear never seems to wear out."
100 CP,Burglar,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"You're really sneaky. You can find good hiding spots anywhere, including plain sight, and most people will not be able to spot you until you purposefully reveal yourself. All of your allies and enemies could be in the middle of a brawl, and you could slip away unnoticed with only the barest effort."
100 CP,Might,LOTR Jumpchain,"You are exceptionally strong and tough. You can lift far more than the average human, can walk or run for hours on end without tiring, and are unlikely to get sick."
100 CP,Sneakiness,LOTR Jumpchain,"You are very good at not being seen when you don’t want to be. You have talents in the realm of
camouflage, and are generally unobtrusive. You might make an excellent burglar."
100 CP,Shepherds of the Olvar,Silmarillion JumpChain 1.0,"As creatures of Yavanna, the Ents are the closest of all speaking peoples to the olvar, the plants. You share in this, having the ability to understand plants on an incredible level. You are able to quickly intuit a plant’s current state and what it needs, and with a little longer you can quickly learn its properties, and even learn what they have experienced in their vicinity - though given a plant’s senses, mundane plants will likely not be able to tell you more this way than when the last rains came or similar. By the same token, you can communicate your wishes to the plants as well, both by normal means and in a subtle, more spiritual manner, such that they will tend to grow in the way you want. In short, you have the green thumb to end all green thumbs, bordering on a magical understanding of plant-life in general - and this is a skill which can be taught to others, albeit only with great patience on their part. It'll be much quicker to teach a more mundane level of the skill, like how to be a good gardener or farmer. This understanding extends beyond mundane plants, however, and into beings which have a plant-like nature. If you should encounter forest elementals, animate plants, grain-spirits, dryads or even plant-based macroorganisms on your travels, you will be able to understand and communicate with them in a peaceful manner, and will find it relatively easy to convince them you mean no harm, or to befriend you and regard you as an ally."
200 CP,Riddles in the Dark,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"You are naturally talented with games of intellect and puzzles. Whether it's playing riddles in the dark against a sinister creature or coming up with clever ways to avoid telling a dragon who you are, you can match their wits and come up with ingenious answers to even the trickiest games."
200 CP,Loyal Hunter,LOTR Jumpchain,"A loyal hunting assistant follows you. It is probably a Hound of the Woodsman or Rangers, able and dutiful, but it may instead be a savage Warg. In any case, it is far more intelligent than your average dog (though not truly sentient) and will aid you throughout your journey."
200 CP,Among the Leaves ,Silmarillion JumpChain 1.0,"Despite being over four metres tall on average, the ents are rarely seen. You share this skill of hiding, able to conceal yourself via camouflage to the point that you become almost invisible; so long as you look similar to your surroundings (wearing sand-colours in a desert, or just being a tree-like being in a forest) and you move (or don’t move) with their motions, you can blend into the background to the point that only careful examination from the keenest-eyed, or help from magic or technology has a chance of picking you out - and even then it will be hard. This concealment extends to your spiritual aspects as well; if you were disguised amidst a forest, even those who can see souls would perceive your spirit only as that of a tree. Additionally, your patience has become that of the trees themselves; you could wait still long enough for a forest to grow before your eyes if need be, though doing nothing at all for such long stretches risks becoming more treeish than entish."
300 CP,Mearas,LOTR Jumpchain,"You have been blessed to ride one of the descendants of Felof, Lords of Horses. Your horse is more intelligent than the average human, can understand English, and can run at up to 50 MPH for days upon end."
400 CP,Incorruptible,The Hobbit Jumpchain,​Evil and corruption can find no hold on your soul. Even entities of great power and malice find you incredibly resistant to their influence. You could hold onto a ring of pure evil for 60 years and still be able to let it go in the end through simple willpower
400 CP,Skin Changer,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"Skin Changers are a rare, nearly extinct race. But now there is one more in Middle Earth. You now have the ability to transform into a great and powerful animal of your choice. This form has enhanced strength, durability, and speed relative to the animal that it is modeled after, and you can maintain your human mind while transformed."
400 CP,Tree-Herds ,Silmarillion JumpChain 1.0,"The ents are named ‘shepherds of the trees’, and you more than live up to that name. In a process half-magic, half-gardening, you can shape lands and ecosystems, working wood and water, stick and stone to create new landscapes. Given an empty plain and long enough, you could grow a forest as dense and strong as Fangorn, or enrich the earth to make it as bountiful as the Shire. This expertise extends from growing living things into transforming the landscape; redirecting rivers, moving hills and other such grand projects. Or, if you are roused to anger, the use of the environment in war: Directing rivers to wash away cities, preparing cliffs for rock-falls and similar. If you are an ent, your great strength will be very useful in such grand projects, but even if you are not, you still maintain the skill to direct many people together to accomplish similar results. More than these mundane aspects, however, you also know the secrets of brewing ent-draughts; concentrating the spiritual power of growing things deep in the earth into blessed waters with potent virtues of growth and flourishing. Brewing such draughts requires that you shape landscapes to purpose, it takes time for the power to gather, and it can only be done in intensely verdant lands. Once the labour is complete, though, there will come forth springs of these potent waters, able to give especial strength, vitality, growth and endurance to those who drink them, and to sustain people even without ordinary food."
400 CP,Beast Master,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"You are skilled at riding animals, including somewhat intelligent animals like wargs. You can stay on even under duress, guiding them by force and threat rather than kindness and trust."
600 CP,Luck,The Hobbit Jumpchain,"​You have an absurd amount of luck. You can be lost in a cave and manage to stumble across the most powerful object on the planet. Or maybe your escape just so happens to be planned on the one night when everyone is too drunk to care why the 'empty' barrels are so heavy. If you put in any effort, everything just seems to go your way."
600 CP,The Wakeful Woods,Silmarillion JumpChain 1.0,"When you tend a verdant landscape which is at least somewhat wild, you may at your will begin to quicken a transformation in the plants therein. Over time, and to a degree according to the plant’s own strength, age and general power, they begin to awaken, gaining greater awareness of the world around them, and a greater ability to affect it. They become, essentially, ensouled; thinking beings in their own right, though their thoughts are strange and quite different to those of humans. Lands filled with such awakened plants gain a certain degree of spiritual potency; they are in a subtle way, enchanted, and strange things may occur there. Most such ensouled plants are capable of little but sensing the world around them, communicating with one another, projecting a sense of their emotions to those around in a vague, difficult-to-define manner (so a forest full of watchful, suspicious trees would create a feeling of unwelcomeness and being watched), and moving to a limited degree. This movement doesn’t tend to happen when anyone’s looking; rather a person might bend down to look at something, then find the path back to have vanished. Older and more powerful plants gain greater power in their turn, able to move in a more deliberate manner (such as opening caves beneath their roots to trap unwelcome travellers) and project their will with such force as to induce drowsiness or perhaps hallucinations. Furthermore, as something akin to leaders amongst their kind, they can direct other ensouled plants and use them as channels for their own will, so as to act at a distance or collectively create labyrinths to bewilder intruders. Perhaps most importantly, by tending to such ensouled plant-life, watering them with ent-draughts and the like, you may transform them into Huorns; trees not only aware and animate, but able to move long distances and make faster movements, capable of true attacks. With enough time, you might even find a way to cultivate true ents in this way. Creatures you awaken via this perk are by default well-disposed towards you and will obey you so long as you treat and tend them well."
600 CP,Were-Wyrm,Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War – The Reddit Edition,"Usually found in desert areas, you have somehow acquired one of these enormous subterranean and very carnivorous creatures that can travel beneath the ground and emerge to devour unfortunate figures. You also managed to accomplish something considered impossible and tamed this normally aggressive predator. They tend to respond to sound, and you know a signal to make them start and stop hunting within the local area. Bear in mind they go for anything walking around on the ground and cannot go through solid rock, though they have learnt how to recognise and avoid attacking yourself and your allies. Given enough time, this pet of yours can grow to be larger than most buildings, though this might limit where they can go if there isn’t enough room. Still, they would be very potent siege weapons at that point. You might not need to bother assembling an army to take a fortress if your pet can just devour or sink the whole thing."
800 CP,Vision of Primordial Spring ,Silmarillion JumpChain 1.0,"It is said that in the spring of Arda, when the world was lit as it were a changeless day by the lamps Illuin and Ormal, Yavanna first brought forth the fruits of her thought. There were trees in those days which grew like living mountains, cloud-crowned with their feet deep in a green twilight of their own making. Those days are vanished and gone - but in you there lives a memory which can be brought forth once more. At your will, lands you cultivate grow strong and swiftly, plants bursting forth eagerly from the soil at twice the rate elsewhere, with no greater need for nutrients or water. This is but the least of your gifts, however. Under your care, plants of all kinds evoke a memorial of those early days in the spring of Arda, growing five or more times their normal size. This growth is more than physical, though. Lands you cause to flourish in this manner grow strong in spirit as well; they are greatly more resilient to corruption and desecration of all kinds, while animal denizens grow larger, stronger and wiser as well. Herbs and plants are more potent, fruits and crops more fulfilling, and any magical crafts which take advantage of them find their results increased as well. Finally, though, there is the change in you yourself. These bountiful lands nourish you as much as you nourish them. While within these lands, your resilience to injury, disease, poisons and other harms is greatly increased, your stamina and endurance becomes to all intents and purposes infinite, and your strength is magnified twice over. These benefits linger to an extent while outside of these lands, but fade over time; within a week or so the benefits will be lost until you return, whereupon they return at approximately twice the rate."
0 CP,Song And Dance ,The Lord of the Rings,"This world was made in song, and if you compare it to the one you came from, this can be rather evident. After all, everyone, even the wretched, likes to sing and occasionally even dance. Poetry and song are rather pervasive aspects of culture in this world. And you wouldn’t want to be left out, would you? So for free, you gain a respectable level of skill at song and dance, and you will also learn many songs and small tales to entertain yourself and others with. Lastly, you’ll have a gift for translating your own experiences into songs and poetry, to be sung when you return home and tell others of your exploits and the things you’ve seen. Perhaps you’ll get your hands on an instrument to supplement your singing?"
100 CP,Blessing Of Light Journeys,The Lord of the Rings,"While adventuring sounds quite good on paper, there are many little mundanities that can be rather annoying in the moment. Thankfully you won’t have to worry about it, perhaps due to some magic spell laid on you? You’ll find that pests such as insects generally keep their distance from you, and that any clothing you wear will never chafe at you or be uncomfortable to wear even after days of running. Lastly, you’ll find that equipping and unequipping armor and the like will be a quick and smooth affair, despite how it might normally be. Long journeys won’t be quite as difficult anymore, but do remember to still bring some food with you."
