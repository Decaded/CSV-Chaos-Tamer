0 CP,Birth Sign ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Everyone in Tamriel is born under one sign or another and now so are you, even if you’re a drop in, well not actually but still. You’re free to choose any single one of the standing stones in Skyrim and receive the bonuses it gives, whether that be the increased magical learning of the Mage or poisonous ability of the Serpent. Though the game blessings are merely a guide, feel free to fanwank something that fits the stone’s theme and is within reason."
100 CP,Amulet of Akatosh,TES: Imperial Cult,"An amulet that represents one of the Nine Divines, and is dedicated to the Dragon-God of Time, Akatosh. While wearing this amulet, your magicka will replenish itself faster than before."
100 CP,Amulet of Mara,TES: Imperial Cult,"An amulet that represents one of the Nine Divines, and is dedicated to the God of Love and Compassion, Mara. While wearing this amulet, you will find that all restoration spells you cast will cost less magicka than before."
100 CP,Holy Healer,TES: Imperial Cult,"When one finds themselves injured or ill, it's not uncommon for them to turn to their local priests for aid, and for good reason. A number of holy men and women are trained in the School of Restoration, capable of healing wounds and purging the body of diseases and poisons. You are a trained expert in this school of magic, and can cast such spells with less magicka than is standard."
100 CP,Man and Rulership,TES: Imperial Cult,"One may say that despite how short the reign of the Septim Empire was when compared to others, it was perhaps the greatest of all, in no small part due to men and women like you. Your very presence draws people towards you, making you seem more than you were before, all the while your charisma and choice words bring them further to your side."
100 CP,Mercy and Justice,TES: Imperial Cult,"There is no bigger fool than those who believe that justice is blind, for how can justice properly judge those in front of it without understanding them. When you gaze upon someone, you are able to judge them along two different axes; Good vs Evil, and Lawful vs Chaotic. You can tell exactly where along these axes, as well as where you yourself align."
100 CP,Septim Ring,TES: Imperial Cult,"A golden ring with a ruby embedded upon it, carved in the shape ofthe dragon symbol of the Third Empire. These are typically given to members of the Imperial Cult that prefer to travel across Tamriel rather than spend all their time in a temple. While wearing this ring, you will find all damage you deal has been increased, regardless of if you use weapons or magic. You will also find your skills with speechcraft improved, because not every problem can be solved with violence."
100 CP,Vigilant ,TES: Daedra,"Many daedric entities simply do not understand the minds of mortals, their thoughts strange and alien, their morality on a scale of blue and orange. With such differences, it's no wonder that many harass and torment mortals, for they could not do otherwise. Well, not under your watch, as you now deal three times more damage against daedra and similarly demonic entities."
100 CP,Winds and Nature ,TES: Imperial Cult,"The domain of Kynareth is not the paved streets or stone houses of civilization, but the untamed wilds, amongst the beasts and plants of Nirn. As an adherent of the Goddess of Nature, it would only make sense that you are fully capable of surviving in such wilderness on your own for as long as you desire. As an added benefit, you can also go completely barefoot with no problem, them being as durable as hardened leather and resistant to damage."
100 CP,Work and Commerce,TES: Imperial Cult,"Zenithar is the god of the working man, and many of his worshippers are those who, rather than fight on the battlefield or go out on grand adventurers, would much rather stay home at their farmstead or work a forge. You are skilled in three professions of your choice, ranging from smithing or farming or tailoring or any other mundane career."
1000 CP,Eye of Magnus,TES: Magic,"I don't know how you were able to get a hold of this, but frankly I don't want to. Believed to be Aedric in origin, this massive orb is tied directly to the Realm of Aetherius, and radiates a truly monstrous amount of magicka per second. Through a specialized ritual, you can tie your very being to this object, and draw magical power from it directly. Although, if having enough magical power to destroy an entire island with ease isn't enough for you, then you could hook it up to some machine as an infinite power generator. But no matter what, be wise in its use, for the Eye has the power to unmake the world, if used incorrectly."
1000 CP,White-Gold Tower,TES: Alessian Rebellion,"A replica of the oldest known structure on the continent, the Adamantine Tower, one whose story grants it just as important a role in the Mundus. This Spoke in the Wheel of Creation may be created from white stone and other arcane materials, but the various enchantments woven into the structure and its metaphysical weight offer great power to its master. For you see, not only does it act as an indestructible and luxurious palace, capable of being seen for miles upon miles in any direction, but using it will allow you to alter the climate and landscape on a country-wide level, allowing you to turn a land of humid jungle into temperate grassland and forests. You will also receive the city that surrounds it, and the island it all rests upon."
200 CP,Akatosh's Ring,TES: Imperial Cult,"A golden ring with a diamond embedded upon it, carved in the shape of an hourglass. Made long ago by an adherent of Akatosh, this ring has been handed down to faithful worshippers for centuries, untouched by the ravages of time. While wearing it, you will find all of your spells are more potent than before, with no increase in magicka cost."
200 CP,Artifact Desecrator ,TES: Daedra,"To gain footholds and followers, the Princes of Oblivion will often tempt mortals with power in the form of powerful artifacts. And though they may hate you for it, you can remove such temptations utterly. You know of a potent ritual that will allow you to completely and irrevocably destroy Daedric Artifacts, as well as similarly powerful and indestructible objects."
200 CP,Book of Instructions ,TES: Imperial Cult,"A holy book written by a Sybil of Dibella long ago, one that has been read by all of her adherents at least once. It provides instructions for how to fulfill all of your desires within the bedroom, containing all manner of positions and contraceptive measures that will always work, as well as avoiding any nasty diseases that may be spread from the loins. Following the teachings within will ensure that everyone involved, even the most jaded of hedonists, will have a splendid time."
200 CP,Brush of Truepaint ,TES: Daedra,"One of the incredibly rare Aedric Artifacts, this paintbrush is said to have been fashioned from Dibella's own hair. The brush allows the wielder to enter a painting canvas and create things within simply by painting them, even living creatures like trolls."
200 CP,Hermetic Orders ,TES: Imperial Cult,"In the frozen lands of Atmora, magic was not the exacting sciences of the elves, but rather a force of the universe that influences all. This more philosophical view of magic may not be as popular in modern times, but perhaps the Atmorans were on to something. Through meditation, you will find yourself gaining a better understanding of magic, as well as how to better utilize it yourself."
200 CP,Love Eternal,TES: Imperial Cult,"It is a sad day when love withers and dies, the knots tying their hearts no longer as strong as they once were. Yet there is hope, for you now bear an amazing gift, that of fixing relationships. You seem to know exactly what to do in order to strengthen the relationships of both yourself and others, turning those weak saplings into mighty oaks that cannot be worn down by time or negligence, such that not even in death will they part. Any relationships you have are especially mighty, unable to degrade without active participation on your end."
200 CP,Spirit of Nature ,TES: Imperial Cult,"All the beasts of Nirn know that they are ruled over by Kynareth, owing to her their home and existence. And such is your connection to her that all animals feel her touch on you, and will never show you any unprovoked aggression, being just as calm around you as a trusted and beloved pet. You will also find the beasts and animals around you aiding you in combat, so long as they are close enough to do so in time."
200 CP,Standing Stones,TES: Imperial Cult,"For longer than recorded history, the mortal races have turned to the stars in fascination and wonderment, and few examples better reflect this than your newest purchase. Thirteen runic monoliths, each one with a different constellation carved into it. By attuning yourself to one of these stones, you will find yourself blessed with an ability relating to a specific constellation. You may only benefit from one blessing at a time."
200 CP,Vampiric Bane ,TES: Imperial Cult,"It is an affront to all good men and mer that the scourge of undeath even exists, let alone being left alone. No longer, for you are not one who can just sit idly by when the bodies and souls of the fallen are corrupted and puppeteered. No matter what method you use, be it weapons or magic, you deal much more damage to the undead than you otherwise would have, be they skeletons, zombies, ghost, vampires, or anything else."
200 CP,Wayshrines,TES: Imperial Cult,"In the days of the Snow Elves, before the Nords drove them from the lands of Skyrim and the Dwemer blinded their descendents, they had magical constructs known as Wayshrines that allowed for quick transportation between their northern kingdom. You now possess five of those Wayshrines, which can be placed wherever you desire, as well as instructions on how to create and alter them. In time, you may be able to create a network that allows you to travel from one end of Tamriel to the other in a single day."
200 CP,Lamp of Satakalaam ,TES: The Warrior Waves,"A sacred ornament from Yokuda, representing the spirit. Crafted from grey stone, bearing carvings of the great serpent Satakal, the Far Shores, and the great cycle of the universe. This lamp burns with divine azure flames, its light purifying all malicious energy from those nearby, from arcane curses to maladies of the mind."
400 CP,Ancestor Glade,TES: Imperial Cult,"An ancient glade filled with a number of canticle trees and ancestor moths, brimming with the feel of magic. While standing within this glade, you will find all of your prophetic abilities enhanced, able to see the future with much more clarity and ease than you would have before. The moths will also help you read any Elder Scrolls you may have, lessening the drawbacks of reading one as well as squeezing out just a bit more information from those fragments of creation."
400 CP,Blood of the Dragon ,TES: Imperial Cult,"Sometimes, there are those who are simply more, those with grand destinies chosen by the gods. You may very well be one of them, for your soul is a shard of Akatosh itself, becoming a Dragonborn. Though the abilities granted with such a soul do not offer much without a certain stimulus, it does mean that fate seems to bend in your favor, granting you fortune and power in all its forms, so long as you reach out and take what is rightfully yours."
400 CP,Burial Rights,TES: Imperial Cult,"Many are the necromancer and monster who look to the bodies of the fallen and see not the remains of a person, once filled with hopes and dreams, feelings and ambitions. No, they see tools to be used, potential undead soldiers to fight for them. No longer, for your mere presence is anathema to the undead, weakening them heavily. You also know of a short ritual that makes it so that a target cannot be resurrected or summoned from the afterlife without their express permission."
400 CP,Divine Voice,TES: Imperial Cult,"Words have power, even when they are completely separated from magic. After all, one sentence is all it takes to either make their day or break it utterly, as you will no doubt soon find out. Your natural charisma and skill with speechcraft is nearly supernatural, to such an extent that, if you feel it is justified, you could realistically talk a mentally healthy person into killing themselves with just a few conversations. Your talent as a wordsmith is not something to scoff at either, as making pure heartfelt poetry everytime you open your mouth is well within your purview."
400 CP,Gaze Upon Creation ,TES: Imperial Cult,"Few truly understand the Elder Scrolls, those fragments of creation that possess archives of the past and auguries of the infinite possible futures, and fewer could ever gaze upon them without going blind or mad, sometimes both. You, though, are special, for your eyes see more than any other mortal. You are a powerful seer, getting flashes of the possible futures when you so desire, though such visions are often open to interpretation no matter how correct they turn out to be. Of course, such a sight is useful for gazing upon the Elder Scrolls, able to extricate their knowledge with no drawbacks or negative effects."
400 CP,Heart of the World ,TES: Imperial Cult,"His was the heart of the world, unable to be destroyed so long as the world existed, for one was made to satisfy the other. Like the Doom Drum, or at least similarly, you can tie your life force, your very soul, onto something. This could be an object, a person, or even an entire realm. So long as your chosen tether exists, you cannot be killed, returning again and again without end. Should they think to directly attack your soul, they will find that similarly useless, as it would take the full effort of a Prince in order to affect it, unless you were to give consent."
400 CP,House of Art ,TES: Imperial Cult,"A grand temple dedicated to the truest expressions of Dibella, being a combination of art school and brothel. Those who study and perform here will find their skills rapidly improving to such a degree that a complete novice would become an undisputed master within just a few years, possibly even shorter if they really work towards it. Those that sleep and lay with others within these walls will also find their beauty increasing until they themselves are comparable to the art found within."
400 CP,Mantle of the Aedra,TES: Imperial Cult,"The Fourth of the Walking Ways to godhood, where you must Walk Like Them until You Become Them, or They Become You. You are no mere adherent of one of the Divines, but instead one who seeks to supplant them, to take on their role in creation and become a god. For now, you are but a mere avatar of your chosen Divine, greatly increasing both your physical and magical power, as well as giving you greater power over the domains of the god you have chosen to follow. Though, should you choose to undergo great trials, you may be able to truly take their mantle of godhood..."
400 CP,Red Legions ,TES: Imperial Cult,"The Red Legions of the Empire are known as some of the greatest armies in the known world, having earned countless victories across numerous battlefields. Though these victories can be attributed to the skilled and disciplined soldiers who make up the majority of the armies, they could also be attributed to the men and women like you, the generals who direct the armies of the Empire. Your skills with tactics and strategies are among the greatest in the history of the Empire, sure to bring victory to any battlefield you find yourself upon."
500 CP,Dovahkiin,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Perhaps the Last Dragonborn isn’t really the last anymore, perhaps Akatosh has decided to be generous, or maybe your benefactor just snapped their fingers, regardless one way or another you’re now a Dragonborn. As a Dragonborn you gain an innate understanding of the Thu’um and similar languages with the ability to learn them by pure instinct like a dragon, allowing you in time to create new shouts. Alongside this whenever you slay a dragon you may choose to devour it’s soul, gaining all the knowledge it possessed in life, in essence you’re taking everything it was into yourself. These souls empower you whenever devoured and give you a considerable boost to your mystical and physical abilities. As one final boon, being that your nature is so intertwined with prophecy you’ll find that fate will assist you at times, and make the impossible quite possible should you work at it, such as a mere human warrior being able to bring down the Dragon god of Destruction. One last note, the other man or woman will still be around should you not take the scenario below."
500 CP,Righteous Vengeance,TES: Imperial Cult,"It is within you that Stendarr has found the perfect instrument to carry out his will, to fight for those unable to defend themselves and right all the wrongs in this flawed world of ours. You are a peerless warrior, reading the flow of combat as easily as one may a tome on cooking, and using your weapons with just as much ease. But most amazingly is your ability to coat yourself and your weapons in a divine light, one whose very presence is anathema to the Daedra of Oblivion as well as similarly demonic entities, such that it's excruciatingly painful for them to even be close to you. Go forth, great champion, slay them all."
600 CP,All Life Must End ,TES: Imperial Cult,"So all things have a beginning, so all things have an ending. Death is an unfortunate part of mortality, something that all men must one day face. Though there are those who believe themselves untouchable by death, and you exist to prove them wrong. You can imbue anything with the very concept of death, be it a blade or spell, or applying it to a person directly. Such an action will immediately kill most things, but for those who are truly immortal, or ordinarily separate from the concept of death, it simply makes killing them a far more likely outcome than before."
600 CP,Amulet of Kings,TES: Imperial Cult,"Also known as the Chim-el-Adabal, this is commonly worn by Cyrodillic emperors who possess the dragonblood, anyone else will find it slipping off the neck. Yours won't have that problem, as it can only be worn by you and those you allow. Not only can it be used as proof of claim to practically any throne or position, but it can reinforce boundaries of the world when worn, making it even more difficult for Daedra and the like to enter the world en masse. Additionally, you can use it to draw upon the memories and skills of past emperors who have worn it."
600 CP,Auriel's Bow ,TES: Warriors,"The very bow of the sun itself, used by the Chief of the Gods to launch the Heart of Lorkhan across Tamriel. It is an aedric artifact infused with the holy light of Aetherius, burning all foes, though it is especially effective against the undead. Should you fire it into the sun using Sunhallowed Arrows, of which you will receive a replenishing stock of one hundred each day, it will cause the sun to undergo a directed explosion, beams of blazing sunlight raining down on all enemies around you."
600 CP,Elder Scroll ,TES: Imperial Cult,"They have no known origin or author, and upon their divine parchment one may find archives of the past as well as auguries of the future. They are believed to be fragments of creation that are said to exist outside of time and space, extricated from the limits of the mortal realm. Upon reading this, the reader receives a portion of a fraction of its knowledge in return for temporary blindness, but it may be possible to utilize its unique nature for other ends, should you be daring or foolhardy enough to try."
600 CP,Gift of Magicka ,TES: Imperial Cult,"It is only natural that those who practice magic would revere a god of wisdom and logic, in order to better control the grand force they try to control. You are one of these mages, and an exceptionally powerful one at that. Your stores of magic are immense, as is your mastery over one of the Schools of Magic of your choice. Additionally, you are quite creative when it comes to the creation and alteration of spells, finding new methods to both improve and utilize them."
600 CP,Heir to the Ruby Throne ,TES: Imperial Cult,"White-Gold Tower, from the days of the Slave-Queen Alessia to the current Emperor, Titus Mede II, and yet few could claim to be your equal when it comes to rulership. You are supernaturally talented when it comes to the logistics needed to run a continent spanning empire all by yourself, creating fair and comprehensive laws with as few loopholes as possible, and the quick and decisive decision making needed when it comes to ongoing crises, helping you steer your empire towards a brighter tomorrow."
600 CP,Lord's Mail ,TES: Imperial Cult,"The Lord's Mail, sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus or the gift of Kynareth, is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the wearer power to regenerate lost health, resist the effects of spells, and makes the wearer immune to disease and poisons, both mundane and magical. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one."
600 CP,Master Trader,TES: Imperial Cult,"Well you must certainly have been blessed by Zenithar, because when it comes to turning a profit, there are few who could ever come close to you. Even in the worst possible outcome, you will end up breaking even in profits. When things are going well, you’re liable to make more money in a month than entire provinces make in a year, if you’re feeling particularly ambitious and personally managing everything in your businesses."
600 CP,Prisoner ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"The Eternal Champion, the Nerevarine, the Hero of Kvatch. All of these are names that stand above all others as legends that helped shape the world. Each of them, despite all their potential differences, had one thing in common: they were mortals blessed with a special fate and the ability to rule their own destiny. As heroes of prophecy, also referred to as prisoners, they were closely related to the prophecies contained in the Elder Scrolls, yet they were not bound to them, and they possessed a superhuman ability to grow and improve in order to rise up to the challenges they were supposedly fated to encounter. Like them you are also blessed with the special fate of a prisoner and all that comes with it. You are naturally drawn by instinct to grand journeys and epic quests, yet you are no slave to destiny and this instinct is easy to distinguish and even more easily ignored if you are so inclined. Your special relationship to fate sees you protected from common dangers and mundane threats. And, so long as you are working towards a great goal or engaging in some form of grand adventure, you will find yourself capable of growing in power, ability and skill at a speed that beggars belief."
600 CP,Relics of the Crusader,TES: Warriors,"The weapons and armor of Pelinal Whitestrake, the Star-Made Knight and Champion of the Slave-Queen Alessia. Donning this divine set of armor will make the wearer more personable and skilled in the Restoration school of magic. It is much more durable and resistant to unenchanted weapons than any other armor, and grants the wearer immunity to disease. The shield will reflect any spells it blocks back at the caster. The sword burns with a holy fire that also damages their pool of magicka, while the mace burns with holy fire that is highly potent against the undead."
600 CP,Staff of Cycles,TES: Imperial Cult,"An oak staff with the wreath of Arkay at the head, made from intertwined black and white metals. When you channel magicka through it, this staff will unleash powerful spells of ice and fire, freezing and incinerating all but the strongest of foes. Even holding it on your person is a great boon, as you will receive the benefits of a potent shield spell that lasts as long as you hold onto the staff."
600 CP,Staff of Magnus,TES: Magic,"The weapon of the Father of Magic himself, Magnus' staff is a potent weapon. In addition to greatly enhancing the potency of any spells you cast, it can drain vast quantities of magicka from people and magical objects in seconds, storing them until its user calls upon it to power whatever spell they are using. Should your target run out of magicka to drain, it will instead drain their lifeforce before converting it into magicka."
600 CP,Stendarr's Hammer,TES: Warriors,"This ancient weapon is rumored to have once been wielded by Stendarr, the God of Justice. One of his other titles, the God of Righteous Might, is fitting as the hammer is very heavy. Though most men would struggle to even lift it, for you it is as light as a standard warhammer. Those struck by this mighty hammer will have their vitality and stamina drained from them, restoring those of the wielder. It also erodes at the armor of those struck, making them weaker and weaker until the hammer is capable of shattering them entirely."
600 CP,Storm Voice ,TES: Imperial Cult,"Long before the Age of Man, Kyne taught men to Shout, to speak the tongue of the Dovah, to match them with the power of their Voice. You are a practitioner of this ancient and most revered magical discipline, able to force the world around you to bend to the power of your Thu'um. Be it waves of force, blasts of fire, detecting life forces, ripping out another’s soul, summoning destructive storms, or something else entirely, it would be foolish for your enemies to even say a single Word of Power, lest you Shout them apart."
600 CP,Flesh of Ebonarm ,TES: Main Races ,"Whether this is truly the armor of the God of War or a mere imitation is irrelevant, for this set of ebony armor with rose-like filigree is an artifact of great power. While wearing this, you will find all of your physical attributes greatly increased, allowing an ordinary man to take on a giant and handily succeed, but that is not all. Your resistance to magic and all of the classical destructive elements will be boosted, too. Most curiously, wherever you walk, blood red flowers will grow."
600 CP,Chrysamere,TES: Main Races ,"The Paladin’s Blade, the Blade of Blades, the Sword of Heroes, this ancient claymore is made of the rare metal known as adamantium and possesses offensive capabilities surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects most spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, though strangely in you it has found its ideal champion, and will return to your side whenever the two of you are separated for too long."
