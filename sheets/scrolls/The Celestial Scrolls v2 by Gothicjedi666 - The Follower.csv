Currently they know a decent bit about Destruction magic, have some weak summon spells, and through errors in casting those spells have come to understand the value of their singular strong self-healing spell.

Ultimately they are not very experienced in the ways of the world. But they’ll carry your weapons, shine your boots, and offer backrubs when the mood strikes. For some, this level of adoration could get a bit grating. It wouldn’t be out of character to hear, “You're the best! I'm going to follow you and watch you and worship the ground you walk on!” They are actually pretty dedicated to performing all the tasks they offer well though."
200 CP,Star Beast,TES: The Warrior Waves,"Not all creatures of the firmament are affectionate or benign, some being more than capable of destruction as the beings of Oblivion.

You gain the ever-lasting servitude of ten of these soldiers, all of whom are unfailingly loyal to you and will serve your every command without question. Furthermore, as Daedra, death is merely a temporary setback to them, and not even suicidal orders will cause them to hesitate.

This can even be as much as just being a group of people who congregate together due to a shared love of adventure, the point is that the sky’s the limit with this. The average member is just that, average, however there are a number of higher ranking members who are notably stronger and more capable to make up for this. Fortunately the group is also in a solid position to expand and grow should you wish that as well."
600 CP,The Five Hundred Companions,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"There’s just something about you, a certain aura about your person that just draws people to you. While others may have charisma on a personal level you have it on a far grander level, that of a Warrior King or leader like Ysgramor. This is the charisma required to win over entire peoples and crown oneself king and where a personal level of charisma may be like honeyed words someone can’t resist, this is akin to a roaring tempest that drags people to you. Warriors, mages and others will find themselves drawn to your banner should you raise it and you’ll quickly find yourself surrounded by competent advisors and companions like Ysgramor and his ilk were. This also comes with the knowledge to lead your troops in such a manner that would earn you the respect of grizzled generals and veterans, after all what’s the point of all these people if you can’t lead them?"
200 CP,The Prisoner,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"This rather odd young Nordic woman you ran into not too long ago is a curious sort, clad in a mix-match of worn Stormcloak and Imperial light armor she claims a rather fantastical tale of a dragon laying waste to Helgen just as the Empire was just about to execute Ulfric Stormcloak and other prisoners, though her sheer energy and drive to reach Whiterun to warn the Jarl certainly lend credit to her words. Regardless of your trust in her words you struck of something of an burgeoning friendship with her after you helped fight off several bandits that had ambushed the lass and showed yourself an agreeable sort. Left in over her head she asked if you’d accompany her as a traveling companion of sorts if you’d like given she could use a partner in traveling Skyrim, a homeland she has little experience with in truth.
