A child of Sithis, or at least someone who must’ve been touched by the entity is here. That would be you Jumper, for your world is that of the shadows and your trade is in blood and murder. When it comes to the art of assassination there are very few in the Dark Brotherhood’s history who were quite as good as you were. Sneaking into a heavily guarded fortress, silently slaughtering your way through so you can plant your dagger in a King’s chest is just as easy as it would be for you to cut your way through a camp of drunken bandits. More than that, skills such as impersonating officials and guards is child’s play and dancing around alerted foes and slipping a dagger through their armor is much the same, all without even being close to touched. An Archmage or a Warrior King may be titans on the field of battle, but what can they do about the knife they can’t even see?"
