0 CP,Silent Sisterhood Training,Talons of the Emperor,"The Silent Sisterhood are put through harsh regimens of training, indoctrination and chemical therapy. The end result is some of the finest ‘normal’ human soldiers in the Imperium. They are taught to fight with several weapons and with their bodies, and are given some the most complete educations on the warp and that which wields it inside the Imperium. They are taught to track psykers to fulfill their duties as the mistresses of the black ships, whether they seek refuge in the wilderness or within crowded cities, and to move without being seen."
0 CP,Flame,Talons of the Emperor,"Mastery of fire was the first step on humanity’s road to ascension. It was a way to push back the dark, to keep one safe and fed. It allowed them to forge weapons, and eventually, seize control of their world and their destiny. Even now, tens of thousands of years later, man still reaches to flame to protect themselves. Much like the Emperor’s own sword, your weapon can light itself aflame. Its searing heat makes light and leaves grizzly and agonizing wounds upon those you strike."
0 CP,Power Armour,Talons of the Emperor,"The armor designed for the Emperor’s finest is made to enhance their already considerable natural abilities even further. Sensor arrays which grant a HUD as well as additional ways to detect your surroundings, a respirator, communications equipment, temperature regulation, lenses to help one see well outside the visible spectrum of light and prevent the harmful effects of abrupt light changes, fiber bundles to vastly increase their user’s strength... and let’s not forget the defensive armor plating it’s coated in. Few weapons will be able to present a serious threat to someone wearing a suit of power armor."
0 CP,Jump Pack,Talons of the Emperor,"Jump packs are lightweight harnesses fitted with rocket thrusters to enable flight. The Talons’ jump packs are modeled after the Raptora Imperialis, taking the shape of a great pair of wings. Capable of being manipulated independently, they allow for spectacular speed and mobility and can be used as shields."
0 CP,Purity Seal Kit,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","A small, ornately designed Require filled with ink, quill, wax, sanctified seal and paper with which to write litanies that are affixed to weapons and armour. One's written and applied by a Sororitas are especially coveted, though they all confer some protection against the forces of chaos."
0 CP,Chain Sword,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","Chain swords are roughly sword-like in shape as the name suggests, with a large flat housing containing the chain. Generally only the forward curved section is open, and is thrust at the enemy where the spinning chain teeth can bite into flesh and bone."
0 CP,Basic Training ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"All novice sisters of the Adeptus Sororitas, regardless of their Order, are taught a wide variety of basic skills, some needed by all, others needed in a pinch. Each sister knows basic ranged weapon operation, ground vehicle usage, hand to hand and melee combat, medicae, how to craft purity seals among a few other skills."
100 CP,Fanatic Discipline ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Silent Sisters are more than blanks. Even those who fulfill more clerical duties than combat actions are hardened through incredibly strict training regimens which leave them all but immune to the horrors of this galaxy. Pain means nothing to the Sisters; so great is their discipline that they do not cry aloud when injured. So hard is their will that they will not break before the charge of transhuman warriors, despite the natural dread they bring with them. Fear, pain, doubt; they should be beneath the Sisters, and they are certainly beneath you. Your cold ferocity is found eerie by your enemies, and your will to do what must be done no matter the price insures your attacks are more lethal than they otherwise would be."
100 CP,Feral Grace ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Sisters are known for many things. Chief among them is their quiet, their aura of wrongness, and their potency against the empyrean. But these are far from the only things they’re known for. The first of these one is likely to notice is their swiftness, their economy of motion, their sheer, bestial grace. You move in swiftly, dancing away from your enemies’ strikes. You easily slip in between ally and enemy alike, making it easier to mob larger foes beside your allies. Getting inside their comfortable reach then harassing them and robbing their strikes of power even as you drive your own home- these are your forte."
100 CP,Defilade ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Sisters are not the transhuman juggernauts that their fellow talons are. Charging through hails of bolter fire is occasionally necessary, but is far from their preferred tactic, for who would relish letting their sisters in arms die? After all, despite their power over the immaterium, despite their training, their bodies are only human. While it is not the most glorious part of their work, the Sisters know how to present a hard target, particularly when operating with the other half of the Emperor’s Talons. You have a nearly preternatural sense for incoming fire, and will find yourself diving for cover where others would be blown apart. This is particularly useful when fighting beside those in heavier armor than yourself. You find yourself working in tandem, their heavier plates interposing themselves just in the nick of time to deflect shots which would have claimed your life. While being careless will render this useless, a little caution and team work will ensure enemy fire is nearly harmless to you while your larger, more durable allies are yet functional."
100 CP,Infiltration,Talons of the Emperor,"The Sisters of Silence, though they are deadly and elite troops in their own right, can’t match the shock and awe value of the Imperium’s transhuman warriors. They aren’t capable of walking through hails of lasfire and throwing the men wielding them about like toys. But there are things those same transhumans can’t match the Sisterhood in. One of these is infiltration. After all, men seven feet tall and weighing seven hundred pounds have a hard time blending in to the populace. The Sisterhood, however, is tasked with combing through humanity and locating psykers and other blanks- and that means investigating without being noticed. You know how to drift through crowds without a trace, how to ferret out information without drawing attention to yourself. Best of all, you are capable of masking the signature of your soul- or lack there of. You can hide any part of yourself that distinguishes you from normal, so long as you aren’t actively using it and it’s not obvious at a glance."
100 CP,I Deny You,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"The faith of the Sisters of Battle is a powerful ability that is rewarded. There are two main ways that this is demonstrated by the Adepta Sororitas. The first is their ability to perform miracles. For example one of the Sororitas fighting Aayla Secura fired two-headed eagles and angels from her flamethrower which pursued the Jedi. The second is through their ability to ignore their foes' attacks. A clear example of this is when Shaak Ti is fighting against a high ranking Sororitas her force powers become useless. At this moment Shaak Ti gazed into the force and saw the Emperor who uttered a simple phrase. He told the Jedi  “I Deny You” and Shaak Ti was unable to affect the Sororitas which then resulted in their mutual deaths. You will now gain the ability to use miracles due to your determination and faith. All that is required is sheer determination and faith in something. This could be yourself, a cause, or a being. The only advantage of a being is that they may assist you much like how the Emperor assists the Adepta Sororitas on occasion.
"
100 CP,Rosarius ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"The rosarius is typically a necklace worn by members of the Adeptus Ministorum or the Space Marine chaplains. The rosarius is often used to represent devotion to the Emperor and a close relationship with the Ministorum. The rosarius generates a powerful conversion field that is capable of blocking both most psychic and physical attacks. Even attacks that would pierce an Astartes armor would be stopped by this field. 
"
100 CP,The Canoness ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"There are few amongst the Sisters of Battle who live long enough and prove themselves worthy of reaching this position. You however seem to have befriended one such figure. This individual is a Sororitas Canoness who wields a powerful set of Paragon Wargear. This is one of the most valuable and venerable pieces of equipment used by the Sororitas. This woman has a close relationship with you and cares for you a great deal. She could even tolerate you performing acts of heresy without trying to kill you. In addition to this she has a small group of followers made up of six Celestian Sisters. These women are her so-called daughters. They will do anything in their power to protect their Canoness and due to your relationship with her you as well. You may design the personality, appearance, and your exact relationship with each of these women as you wish.  
"
100 CP,Litany of Hate,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","Kill the Mutant, Burn the Heretic, Purge the Xeno. I'm sure you've heard the mantra of the militant services of the Imperium, and with your service you'll learn why even minor unrepentant grievances against the Emperor are hated. You will be able to recite these reasons in a firm and succinct manner that will share your thoughts and feelings on these matters. Allies that hear you will share your hatred, fighting your enemies with the same fervour that you would, along with resistance to Daemonic Presence. 
"
100 CP,Linguist,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","All sisters of the Dialogous are expert linguists, able to translate the various dialects of low gothic for nobles and clerics. Occasionally they'll be asked to translate something from a Xenos device or artefact. The methods of research and translation have been perfected over the millennia the Orders Dialogous have operated to make the process as efficient as possible, and these processes are now know to you."
100 CP,Only In Death Does Duty End,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","
The primary role of all Sisters Hospitalia is to heal the sick and infirm, and grant them final mercy should their wounds be to dire. All Sororitas in this order have extensive training with the medical devices available to the Imperium's forces, with a fair majority of them serving time in hospitals as surgeons, performing complicated surgeries and installing cybernetic implants. You have the abilities of some of the best healers the Sororitas has to offer, capable of performing miraculous feats with battle field supplies and operating complicated surgical devices."
100 CP,Gourmet Chef,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","The sisters of the Orders Famulous provide a wide array of services to a noble house. They don't start with the political experience to offer sage advice after all. Many are taught the culinary arts, the fastest way to a man's heart is through is stomach after all. the dedication to which a sister of the Adeptus Sororitas throws herself into her occupation is intense, and even the mundane skills of homemaking are no exception. Given the right equipment and ingredients you could create a banquet fit for the Emperor himself single handed and even the food rations offered to the frontline Guardsman taste better if you prepare it."
200 CP,Thoughtmark,Talons of the Emperor,"The Silent Sisters are exactly that; silent. And yet, they still need to communicate. They have no psychic powers after all. And so they learn thoughtmark, an immensely adaptable form of sign language that is capable of both rapid and subtle communication. But this is not the only manner in which they make use of this somatic language. Many of them have taken these complicated gestures and use them to focus their inherent powers. You, too, can focus your power in this way. Even negligible powers can be made to be felt, though they will be far from overwhelming. Even a Pi class psychic or a Tau class negative psychic could force normal men and women into convulsions with a gesture, and greater talents would have greater power at greater range still. These gestures also render normally dangerous skills born from lack of control safe."
200 CP,Overawe ,Talons of the Emperor,"The most deadly weapon that the Sisters wield is their own aura, but it has limits. Most especially in range- and so they need to close the gap. But their problems do not end there, for despite their power armor and executioner swords, they are relatively normal women in the physical realm. But these relative limitations do not alter their duty, and so they adapt, and so they overcome. When it comes to the charge, there is no one more skilled than you, and those you lead. You blitz forward like lightning, crushing your enemies beneath your tread, even as they’re suppressed by covering fire. Even those who would normally defeat you will find themselves hard pressed by you, so long as you rush to meet them in close combat. Your strength increases during that brief moment, letting you deal savage wounds that even transhuman warriors would be lucky to survive."
200 CP,Helm-less ,Talons of the Emperor,"The sisters disdain helmets, despite their obvious advantages. And yet, they never seem to suffer for it. Should the majority of your body be covered in armor, then the entirety of your body will be as well protected as if they too, were covered by the full protection of your armor at its strongest point. No longer will you have to fear a lucky shot. You also have the sort of good looks that might drive someone to the vanity of discarding a helmet when they march to war. Whatever wounds you receive will even heal in an aesthetically pleasing manner, whatever you define that to be."
200 CP,Oblivion Knight,Talons of the Emperor,"Oblivion Knights are the elite of the Sisters’ combat forces. Rarely are they deployed outside of the most dire circumstances- such as when Alpha psykers throw entire planets into war and madness. It is they who are placed in command of formations of their sisters when they aren’t deployed in entire cadres, and it is they who lead their sisters to triumph. You have been entrusted with a large combat formation of the Sisterhood. Seven hundred fifty sisters follow you, divided between the different chambers as you see fit. Seekers, wielding flamers and needlers, Prosecuters with bolters of quality normally seen in the hands of Astartes, or Vigilators armed with Execution Blades for close combat. All will be clad in Vranite power armor, and have more than a modest supply of grenades. You will also receive enough Kharon Pattern Acquistors to transport your sisters with speed, safety, and subtelty. Heavily armed, and protected by a spectra-distortion field, these vehicles are difficult to target and adept and slaying or capturing opposition."
200 CP,Psyk-Out,Talons of the Emperor,"Your weapon was heavily impregnated with negative psychic energy during its forging. While no more effective against physical targets, save perhaps instinctively unnerving them, against psykers, sorcerers and witches it’s another matter entirely. Against the unnatural it causes horrible wounds, prevents them from using their powers and most likely shatters their psyches even as you do the same to their bodies. If you get in a solid hit there’s an equally solid chance they’ll lose control of their own powers and tear themselves apart. Such weapons can be further enhanced through the powers of a blank or psyker."
200 CP,Liber Heresius,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","An immense tome with an armoured back and a lock that keeps the information inside safe. Upon its pages you will find all manner of information about heretics and cults from thousands of witch hunters. Everything from how to identify heretical symbols to how to identify incipient heresy to the various heretical creeds and mottos. While useful in tracking down cults, it could also be considered a ""How to start your own Heretic cult and not get caught."" guide, and so the tomes are closely guarded."
200 CP,Suplply of Surplus Sororitas Infranty Equipment,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","Should the amount you have collected up above be insufficient, here is a crate of Sororitas equipment, enough to outfit any additional followers you collect in your travels. Standard power armour, bolters, grenades, heavy weapons, everything you need to give new followers the tools to spread the Creed with bolter, flamer and melta. All relics, Cheribum/Servitors and Vehicle parts are not included."
200 CP,Seraphim ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"Seraphim are the most elite warriors of the Sisters of Battle alongside Celestians, and select only the most talented and experienced Sororitas to join their ranks. You have now been granted the rank of Seraphim and undergone their training. The Seraphim are particularly skilled when it comes to using jump-packs and hit-and-run tactics. Additionally the Seraphim are considered to be truly inspiring sights by any members of the Imperium notably the Imperial Guard who witness them in combat. You will have this ability as well inspiring faith in your allies. 
"
200 CP,Sororitas Power Armor,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"The Sororitas utilize special power armor crafted specifically for their order. The armor is a lighter version of the Adeptus Astartes armor providing similar levels of protection. Due to the lighter weight it allows for complete mobility and no decrease to the wearer's speed. As long as the armor is not heavily damaged it will be capable of maintaining power infinitely. The armor provides a large enhancement to the user's strength and its blessed metals protect the wearer from psychic attacks. Should you somehow destroy this armor it shall be repaired and reappear in your warehouse the next day. Lastly this will also come with a basic bolter or one weapon of your choice such as a power maul.
"
200 CP,Inquiry,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","The Dialogous are trusted with some of the best kept secrets of the Imperium along forbidden knowledge. Given the ordeals they have endured to reach their station they are trusted with asking questions no one else in the Imperium should ask. They are taught ancient methods of inquiry with which to uncover the truth, either scholarly or interpersonally. When dealing with a universal truth you know how best to phrase a question to an authority to get the answers you need, when dealing with a personal or historical truth you know how to leverage appearance and good will to expose all but the most protected information. Even if you don't get the full story, the next avenue to pursue will become clear to you.
"
200 CP,Knowledge Is Power,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","Guard it well. It should come as no surprise that, with the forbidden lore a she has access to, a Sister Dialogous must bend the truth to the uninitiated, and in some cases outright lie to them. Faith in the Emperor and his Imperium allows them to do so flawlessly, with clear consciences so long as the lie or half truth serves the ends of the Imperium. You can craft the most intricate falsehoods and recite them with such conviction that even those with contradictory firsthand knowledge would be driven to a moment of doubt."
300 CP,Knight-Centura ,Talons of the Emperor,"Each Knight-Centura is among the most experienced Oblivion Knights that serve the order. They are entrusted with command of their sisters across an entire battlefield, for across many battlefields have they marched, emerging victorious. You will be entrusted with a true host of the Sisterhood. Thousands of the Sisterhood march behind your banner, following the same selection process as an Oblivion Knight. In addition, more elite members will follow you. You will have cadres from the Chamber of Judgment and Oblivion, expert witch hunters and investigators and some of the finest swordswomen and strongest blanks in the Imperium, respectively. Should you purchase this rank as a Custodes, you will instead merely be given the detachment as allies and will not receive the rank. They will still count as followers, follow your orders, and function exactly as the purchase above lines out."
300 CP,The Sword of Oblivion ,Talons of the Emperor,"This highly ornate Execution blade is a symbol of the Knight- Commander of the Silent Sisters. This blade is wickedly, impossibly sharp. It can cut through nearly anything, more easily than nearly any power weapon- but it has no disruption field. Instead its absurd cutting ability lies within its incredibly precise construction and the mysterious substance which it was forged from. Only the Emperor Himself knows the origins of this hoary blade, and it is He who granted this blade to the first Knight-Commander of the Sisters of Silence."
300 CP,Armour of St Katherine ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","The golden armour of Katherine Elysius, Shield Bearer and second in command to Alicia Dominica, the founder of the Adepta Sororitas. She was among the six sisters that stood before the Golden Throne in the Age of Apostasy and was present when Vander was executed. Following this she founded the order of the Fiery Heart and led her order in countless battles across the galaxy before dying at the hands of the Witch-cult of Mnestteus. In mourning her order was renamed to the Order of Our Martyred Lady"
300 CP,Ardent Blade,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","A powerful weapon wielded by one of the founding saints of the Sororitas. Blessed by the Emperor's vengeance, this weapon is more effective against abominations and daemons. The power of the Astronomican builds up in it periodically and can be released in a wave of purifying fire that burns those untouched by the emperor's light.
"
300 CP,Mace of Valaan,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Sororitas","An ornate weapon which projects a halo of energy similar to a soul storm generated by a Living Saint. Not only can it be used as a bludgeon, but all creatures of Chaos passing through the threshold are burned and eventually killed should they stay in range of its aura for too long."
400 CP,Cadre Tactics,Talons of the Emperor,"When the Sisters leave their ships to prosecute those who defy the Emperor, they select their strike teams carefully. These carefully selected Sisters are nearly always specialists of a specific skill- some matter of stealth or combat that the Sister in command deems useful or necessary for the mission. Sadly, this is merely an ideal state of affairs- when an emergency arises, all hands must serve. You, however, won’t have to deal with that sad state of affairs. Your uncanny leadership skill allows you to share your own skills with your troops, albeit at a significantly lessened level. Still, if you’re a master of swordsmanship you can expect peasant levies to be at least semi competent, and for the already skilled to become exceptional. Do note that this will never grant ability greater than your own."
400 CP,Mistress of the Black Ships ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Imperialis Armada is the designation for the fleets manned by unaugmented humans- save for the vast fleets under the Sisterhood’s command. The black fleet is the second largest fleet in the Imperium, and is charged with rounding up every psyker and blank within its borders. These vast prison ships are heavily armed and armored, that they may keep their cargo of psykers under control and out of the grasp of any who would seek to sieze them. Running these ships is no small task. Void ships are complicated machines, as is using them. You, among all your sisters, are a master of these ships. Such is your knowledge of them that you could build one from the ground up, given time and resources. Keeping them ship shape is a simple matter in comparison; you have a sixth sense for when something goes wrong. Warp jumps are safe and nearly reliable, you can coax near half again more speed from their thrusters than should be possible, as much fire from their guns, and power from their shields. So too are you a commander that the Imperalis Armada would salivate over- your ships glide into formation with near impossible ease, pounding your enemies to scrap with incredible accuracy, all the time maneuvering to protect one another. Your skill at providing support to air and ground forces is no less uncanny, orbital bombardments hammering down with nearly no scattering. There is no aspect of void ships which you have not mastered. May your enemies howl their frustration into the void."
400 CP,Excrutiatus ,Talons of the Emperor,"Though the Sisters are deadly in battle, it is not their primary purpose. Their primary purpose is the locating, capture, and transport of psykers through out the Imperium. The most experienced sisters with the sharpest and most inquisitive minds are excepted into the Excruciatus. They are the sisterhood’s hunters, judges- and executioners. You are an exemplar of the Excruciatus. Your senses are sharper than any normal humans should be, constantly searching for evidence of your quarry. No trace escapes you, and your wits are swift enough to process the information you collect all but instantly. It would be shameful to fall prey to an ambush or be unable to discern a lie, after all. And when you find them you are well versed in planning and carrying out infiltration, raids, and tactical assaults against even the most nightmarish and esoteric of enemies in order to secure your target. In addition, you are frightfully skilled in the arts of torture, and few can refrain from spilling even their most tightly kept secrets to you for any appreciable length of time."
400 CP,Martyrdom is Your Duty,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"The Sisters of Battle are amongst the most devoted beings in the entirety of the Imperium and few even dare to question their faith. One of the tenants that they are taught is to never falter and to ensure that they deal with their foes no matter the consequence. This perk gives you an ability based on this concept. Someday you will likely encounter an enemy that you do not stand a chance against. Despite this it is possible for you to become the victor. You will find that no matter what or who you battle there will always be a method for you to succeed. It may require you to sacrifice something, perhaps even your life, but it will be there. So are you prepared to join the ranks of your fellow Sisters who gave up everything in the name of victory. 
"
400 CP,The Blade of Admonition,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,The Blade of Admonition is the sword wielded by Alicia Dominica. This blade was used to cut off Goge Vandire’s head. Anyone who gazes into the blade will see a reflection of their own soul. Against the blade's enemies this can paralyze them granting its wielder opportunities to slay their foes. Its wielders however are inspired by the spirit of Alicia Dominica and will carry the grace of the Emperor himself into battle
400 CP,Cloak of Saint Aspira,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,The Cloak of Saint Aspira was worn by the Canoness Saint Aspira of the Order of the Bloody Rose. The most important trait of the cloak is that it was built with fragments of armor belonging to the Emperor of Mankind. These fragments ward protection onto its wearer and carry the protective blessing of the Emperor. Saint Aspira was said to charge into battle without fear as she knew the Emperor himself was personally watching over her. 
400 CP,Mantle of Ophelia,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"The Mantle of Ophelia was worn by Helena the Virtuous, a Living Saint and one of the most revered leaders in the history of the Adepta Sororitas. The mantle is thought to have sacred powers of protection given to it by the Tears of the Emperor himself. Helena anointed the Mantle with these tears. As a result the relic protects the wielder from almost any form of harm on the battlefield and it is said to grant them the charisma of the Emperor. "
400 CP,Sacred Banner of the Order Militant,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,Each of the six orders of the Adeptus Sororitas possess a sacred banner. Each of the banners were sewn with hair from the original founding members of the Sororitas. These banners are only wielded by the most pious and accomplished of their members. The mere sight of these banners can fill the wielder's allies with zeal. Under these banners no force shall ever consider retreating and they will become capable of feats far beyond their normal capabilities. 
400 CP,Rod of Grace,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,The Rod of Grace is a melee weapon wielded by Helena the Virtuous. The rod possesses a powerful gravity field granting it a similar effect to a power weapon. The main unique feature of the rod is its ability to focus its energy into a powerful beam to target foes at a distance. This blast is capable of piercing through thick armor such as the Space Marines ceramite. 
400 CP,Scepter of Vengeance,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"The Sceptre of Vengeance was the huge, heavy power mace wielded by Saint Ophelia. The head of the scepter is engulfed in holy flames burning away at the wielders' foes. These flames are particularly effective against daemonic beings and spiritual entities. "
600 CP,Raptor Guard ,Talons of the Emperor,"The most elite martial sect within the Silent Sisterhood is that of the Oblivion Knights. Each are incredibly strong blanks, even by the lofty standards of their Sisters, and each is a masterful combatant in melee. So fierce are the Oblivion Knights that they are rarely deployed outside of truly dire circumstances, such as wide scale psychic rebellion or when Alpha level psykers need to be captured. But even among these women, there are those who aren’t satisfied with merely becoming one of the most skilled warriors that unaugmented humans could aspire to match. They look at the skill of the Imperium’s tanshuman warriors with envy. These women strain against the limits of humanity, and in so doing they hone themselves to an edge that many would call impossible for unaugmented humans. And so they come to join the Raptor Guard, the most elite warriors of the elite Oblivion Knights. You have the skill to join the raptor guard, and more. Inside the Sisters of Silence, only Jenetia Krole herself could match blades with you. Your skill with a melee weapon, though certainly not your body, is roughly comparable to a Custodes Shield Captain, post human men with centuries of experience. Your skill set is particularly well suited towards mitigating the advantages others might have over your body. Whether it be strength, speed, or simple height, you are adept at parrying, predicting, and attacking in ways that prevent such things from overwhelming you completely. Though it will still remain a very significant advantage over you, a normal person could match blades with an Astartes and have a reasonable expectation of victory."
600 CP,Daemon Slayer ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Sisterhood truly shine in their element. Against daemons and psykers, they are the most deadly and effective fighting force the Imperium can field. Massed ranks of blanks can render such foes nearly helpless. Then they easily tear them apart with blade and bolter, discipline and flame. When you face such entities, you will find your attacks drastically heightened and theirs equally lessened. Even facing a greater daemon, you may well be able to overcome it alone. And yet... when Daemons are slain they go back to the Warp, back to their master, and can be summoned to trouble the galaxy again and again. There are very few ways to permanently end such entities, and they are frequently difficult to employ and astonishingly rare as well. You no longer need fear the return of your enemies. When you slay something, it stays slain, annihilating it’s mind and soul as you break it’s body."
600 CP,Knight-Commander ,Talons of the Emperor,"There are three senior most ranks within the Sisterhood. The Knight-Commander is the sister who commands all the Sisterhood’s forces upon land, sky, or sea. At the head of the elite army, few can claim greater responsibility than her, and none save the Emperor Himself may give her orders and be certain of obedience. The entirety of the Sisterhood’s planet side forces are now under your command. They are a massive army, capable of combing an entire galaxy for psykers and fighting on dozens of fronts at once."
600 CP,"Luna, the Somnus Citadel ",Talons of the Emperor,"The Somnus Citadel is the headquarters of the Sisters of Silence. It is a massive fortification, bristling with weaponry and attack drones and craft. It holds the habs, armories, and void docks that can house the entirety of the Sisters should the need arise. The vast majority of the structures can be sunk within Luna itself, even further augmenting the defenses that most would consider to be over kill. There are few fortresses in the Galaxy to equal this citadel, either as a bastion to break enemies upon, a prison beyond compare, or as a command and control center. Any ships docked at the citadel will be repaired, rearmed, and retrofitted almost instantly, so long as you have the supplies to do it. And given the massive stores it has, which restocks every decade, that’s unlikely to ever be a problem. Unless you need to furnish a far larger fleet than that of the Black Ships, which are vast enough in number to scour the entire galaxy for psykers. These massive docks are fully capable of creating new ships, so long as they aren’t overly taxed with maintenance and are supplied sufficient resources. Its prison complexes are meant to hold psykers of every rank when necessary- the prisons will suppress the supernatural powers of any you deem hostile within its halls. Disregarding blatant negligence or idiocy, you will never need to worry about your prisoner’s escaping unless an army has managed to break open you defenses. And speaking of armies, you now have one. Thousands of Sisters and servitors dwell within the Somnus Citadel, serving as wardens ready to man the defenses at a moment’s notice. If you travel to other universes, the Somnus Citadel will follow you, to be placed wherever you please, still astride Luna if you so wish."
600 CP,Living Saint ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"Living Saints are amongst the Emperor's most loyal servants who have been infused with a shard of his very being. They are blessed with many powerful abilities. The first is the Inviolable Aura which grants near invulnerability to any damage in a short area around him. The second ability is to imbue their flames with the Emperor's divine might. Third, is the ability to transform into an angelic figure growing wings of psychic energy granting the saint flight. Fourth is the ability to fire powerful blasts of energy with the Emperor's power. This ability is particularly useful against beings such as daemons. Lastly and most importantly is the ability to resurrect and fight once more. You will be restricted to a single death every ten years.
"
600 CP,Sororitas Orders ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K Jumpchain,"There are six major orders of the Adeptus Sororitas. They are the Bloody Rose, the Argent Shroud, Our Martyred Lady, the Valorous Heart, the Ebon Chalice, and the Sacred Rose. Aside from them there are a number of minor orders who typically are in charge of a specific planet or split off from one of the major orders. By taking this option you will be able to take the full force of an entire major Adeptus Sororitas order. This force will comprise two hundred thousand battle ready sisters. This force will additionally come with all of the supplemental forces such as the Hospitaller, support staff, and all of the other members who are under the banner of an order. You may purchase one of the canon orders or create one of your very own. This force will be loyal to you above all else even if you went against the Imperium itself.
