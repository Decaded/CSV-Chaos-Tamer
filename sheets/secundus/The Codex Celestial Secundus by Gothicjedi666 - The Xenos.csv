0 CP,Orks is Built For Fighting ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You can handle yourself alright in a scrap. Not brilliant or fancy, but you can fight. You never freeze up from shock or fear neither."
0 CP,Jolly Monsters,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"Orks laugh and have fun, about the only people in the setting to do so. But mostly they do it while murdering their way across worlds. This is because Orks don’t really empathize with others, or realize aliens might not have fun scrapping like they do. Why even build a fortress, if not to dare someone to tear it down? Now you too, can switch off your doubts and cares for others whenever you need to and just enjoy the krumping."
0 CP,Nice Hat,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You have a little top hat, well, it’s human-sized but small on you, with optional monocle. It carries an air of sophisticated civilization that makes fellow Orks eye you darkly, but other races much more likely to see you as reasonable, trustworthy or at least someone they can make deals with. As an added bonus, if you ever want a break from the Orky lifestyle, the hat is great at deflecting suspicion. It won’t fool the Inquisition, Commissars, psykers or other people actively looking for xenos infiltrators, but your average Guardsmen or civilian won’t notice anything amiss until it’s pointed out to them that you are, in fact, an Ork in a very stylish hat."
0 CP,Choppa ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"A crude weapon, many would say, but what would an ork be without a handy axe or cleaver blade for chopping stuff up? Can be applied to any melee weapon to give it the aesthetic, so nobody questions/tries to take your +5 elven mithril longsword."
0 CP,Horns,Warhammer 40K: Orks,The horns or tusks of some great beast you killed. Gets you a little more respect in Ork kultur.
0 CP,Waaaagh! Bana ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"A big flag, or trophy stikk with skullz, to remind the Boyz what you’re fighting for. Is propa inspiring and makes the Boyz much less likely to leg it."
100 CP,Fiery Warrior,Imperium of Man,"A fairly typical member of the T’au Fire Caste, it’s a mystery why and how she came to ally herself with you. Specializing in long-range combat with her advanced rifle and battlesuit, she can deal incredible amounts of damage and get away before your enemies know any better."
100 CP,Warp Fusil,Minor Xenos,"This musket-like weapon fires plasma partially through the warp to bypass shields a armor. It is stable, requires no ammunition, and comes with instructions to build more Warp Fusils."
100 CP,Shipment,Minor Xenos,"A large quantity of bulk materials or goods which other species - humans among them - will find valuable in some capacity. Possibly a raw or refined material from homeworld, possibly manufactured goods, possibly the spoils of war or salvage. Each purchase is enough trade goods to live very comfortably on for two years, in human terms, if you had no other income but to  sell them at market value. Naturally, the more rare and valuable you decide the resource is, the less of it you actually have."
100 CP,I Am Slaughter,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"Everybody knows the Orks are jolly, goofy, and usually the obvious threat before the real one reveals itself. You can bring to life the true menace and foreboding of a species that lives only to fight and kill, and when you want to be serious, no one can treat you as a joke, for they sense their own mortality in your words."
100 CP,Yooful Exuberance,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You carry within you the one thing everyone else in the galaxy, from the Necrons to the Space Marines to the Eldar seems to have forgotten. The ability to have fun. To see the silver lining in every cloud of  bloodspray, and enjoy a good scrap as much as a relaxing trip to the beach. Corruption and despair have no hold on the young at heart."
100 CP,Throat Slitta,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You know where to hit to maximize damage when striking from stealth, and how to take down an
enemy silently."
100 CP,Elegant Weapons,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"Swords, axes, spears, and shields are barbaric weapons, vestiges of a time before a species could overcome their own evolutionary limitations. Ranged weapons, robotics, and drones have made all T’au tall, and you are supremely skilled in using ranged weapons of all types, ranging from slingshots, to plasma rifles, to vehicle mounted missiles and cannons. Your accuracy, precision, speed, and ability to maintain such weapons will not be matched by any mundane user with similar equipment."
100 CP,Business as Usual,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"War machines of any appreciable size or complexity cannot exist without economic and civilian infrastructure. You can easily manage such infrastructure to support a war machine, keeping workers on track and productive even as beings that the superstitious would call demons are clawing at the gates of your city. War-time fatigue and loss of morale will not touch those you manage."
100 CP,Fancy Robes ,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"These fancy robes fit you perfectly, regardless of what form or species you are at any given time. They also always are viewed as being both expensive and elegant as well as being appropriate for your given local. Moreover, you may import an existing outfit to fill this role."
1000 CP,Blackstone Fortress,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"A Blackstone Fortress is a massive, alien-constructed starfort and Warp-based strategic weapon employed by both the Imperium of Man and the forces of Chaos during their more recent conflicts. According to some Imperial savants, the Blackstone Fortresses were constructed and first used during the war between the Old Ones and the Necrons, remembered in Aeldari legend as the War in Heaven. The Blackstone Fortresses were known to the ancient Aeldari as the Talismans of Vaul."
200 CP,Masterwork Vespid Neutron Blaster,T'au Empire,"This neutron blaster is built with vespid crystal technology, and has been altered so as to be usable by you even if you lack the insectile wings that Vespids need to use the sonic controls of this weapon. Moreover, it is just a little stronger, more accurate, more durable, smaller, and more stable than an ordinary blaster. You also gain a blueprint of the standard vespid neutron blaster, which requires both Vespid crystals  and Vespid wings to use, though time and research may allow you to overcome those limitations."
200 CP,Dakka Dakka Dakka,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"Humies talk about “spray and pray” but you were never the religious type. Whenever you unleash a burst in the general direction of the enemy, at least one of the slugs or rokkits or bombs is going to hit something terribly important. A weak spot, a gas tank, a commander or medic. This perk doesn’t activate if you actually try and aim."
200 CP,Knows What Cover Is,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"Unlike most Orks, you know how to take advantage of cover to not get shot before you can close. And cover is remarkably effective for you. People may wonder how a card table or shrubbery that should only offer concealment can stop bolter rounds, but you know with a chest-high barrier of any kind you won’t die."
200 CP,Lucky ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"The blue paint must be working. You might be hit, but never by blind chance. Even a massive
artillery bombardment will leave you untouched unless it was aimed at you specifically."
200 CP,Da Red Onez Go Fasta ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You can make any vehicle go 25% faster just by painting it red. Yes, even FTL starships. No, it doesn’t make sense, but it happens anyways."
200 CP,Wyrm-Killas,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You and your lot are the masters of surviving any wild terrain, but most especially a hostile jungle where everything and everyone wants to kill you."
200 CP,Extra Stikkbombs ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You always have at least one grenade on you. If you don’t seem to, rifle around in your pockets a bit, check the back ones, you’ll find one."
200 CP,Boarboy ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You are a skilled rider of beasts, and quite good at taming, raising and breeding them as well."
200 CP,Burna Boy,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You’re just a bit of a pyromaniac. Luckily you’re very good with incendiary weapons of all stripes, never get blowback or fire going where you don’t want it to. Even in the worst case, you won’t get more than comically singed."
200 CP,Tankbusta,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You blew up a tank once, and things could never be the same. You love seeing these supposedly
invincible vehicles come apart under your rokkits and you’re very good at placing them where they’ll do the most damage."
200 CP,Speed Freek ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"Your personal vehicles all move significantly faster, and aren’t much slowed by terrain. Whenever you hit a rock or pothole, you’ll bounce off without any real damage."
200 CP,Gunnerz Delite,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"Neither you, nor any gunner aboard a craft you’re steering, have your aim thrown off by your speed or sudden turns or bouncing about."
200 CP,Dead Sneaky,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You can tell when people are looking your way and when they ain’t, as well as how alert sentries are and if they’re looking for you."
200 CP,Proper Killy ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You’re just really good at killing things, quick off the mark and know exactly where to hit ‘em to put em down with nothing fancy."
200 CP,Boarding Action,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You’ve spent years leading boarding actions on everything from starships to speeding tanks. You’re sure-footed in all circumstances, and a deft hand at fighting in cramped quarters."
200 CP,Buff ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"You enhance your allies, maybe with a warcry or warpath, making them much more dangerous."
200 CP,Best Armour Teef Can Buy,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"Any armor you wear just seems far tougher, and you wear it well so you never notice the weight nor get any pinching or chafing."
200 CP,Killa Reputation ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"The Arch-Arsonist of Charadon, the Arch-Maniac of Calverna, the Overfiend of Octarius, the Mighty Mangler of Bork, the Beast. Now you too can have an intimidating title you are known by, and a reputation worthy of it."
200 CP,Kustom Forcefield ,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"A protective device, that encases you in an energy field which deflects incoming fire."
200 CP,Least Evil,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"You emit a series of pheromones that cause others of your own species or similar species to view you as an authority. This won’t let you control their minds, but people will give extra weight to your opinions and intrinsically assume that you know what you’re talking about and should be trusted."
200 CP,Pursuit Predation,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"Eldar are perfectionists, Orks escalate, Chaos corrupts, Necrons destroy, Tyranids consume, T’au adapt, but Humans endure. Whether this is physical endurance in trying circumstances, or mental endurance when plagued by an insane galaxy, you are capable of stubbornly continuing when all others around you would give up."
200 CP,Masterwork Chain Sword,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"An uncivilized weapon for an uncivilized galaxy. This sword is a potent weapon for melee combat, kept in immaculate condition by the soldiers brought it when he defected to the T’au. This sword will never be remarked upon by superiors, even when it is blatantly non-standard equipment for the army or unit your are a part of. You may also import a different melee weapon to fill this role."
200 CP,Battlesuit ,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"You may choose one type of canon T’au battlesuit, ranging in size from the XV25 Stealthsuit to the XV88 Broadside, per purchase of this item, and receive the suit, it’s basic schematics, and a steady supply of ammunition and spare parts for the suit. Moreover, the suit in question will automatically grant you a moderate level of skill in its usage the first time you enter it. Furthermore, as piloting a Battlesuit is a high honor for the Fire Caste, you will be recognized as the legitimate owner and pilot of any suit you purchase here. The weapons loadout may be any standard option available to your suit."
400 CP,WAAAGH!,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,The WAAAGH field is a gestalt ability possessed by the Orcs. This field is what allows their technology to work and increases their power based on the number of Orks following their boss. This perk gives you a power similar to the WAAAGH. The greater the number of forces you possess the greater your abilities become. Your abilities and technological abilities will all be increased by this effect. The boost becomes exponentially more powerful as you gather more followers.
400 CP,Clean Yu’vath database,Minor Xenos,"This database contains technical schematics and scientific knowledge for Yu’va technologies, such as their crystalline constructs, psi-tech amplifiers, cybernetics, a more. It has been purged of all Chaos taint and any schematics or knowledge that relies on Dark Sorcery to function, with simplified and weaker psi-tech of similar function replacing those designs and knowledge. With time and research, you may be able to recreate corrupted Yu’Vath technologies, such as Bone Wardens, without relying on the powers of Chaos."
400 CP,Distinct Goods ,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"If there is a Greater Good, then there must be a distinct, lesser good, and even if your actions seem to conflict with lesser, plebeian goods, they still can serve the Greater Good. You are skilled at justifying your actions such that, even when people believe your actions are immoral, your actions will be viewed as either a well-meaning but sub-optimal action, or a necessary evil forced by circumstances out of your control, except by those individuals who distrust you so much that they would not believe you to honestly state the color of the sky."
500 CP,Shas'O Vior'la Shovah Kais Mont'yr ,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"Better known as Commander Farsight, this Shas’o is a legendarily skilled commander who would surely end up in Trazyn the Infinite’s collection in a place of honor next to Ursarkar Creed. Fiercely independent and hot blooded (for a T’au), he is immune to the Ethereal’s pheromone-based mind-control and might occasionally catch tactical-level glimpses of the future, hinting that he may be the first T’au with a psy rating higher than Rho. He comes equipped with the Dawn Blade and a bespoke, elite Battlesuit."
600 CP,Planet Murder,Minor Xenos,"This planet is a perfect prison. Any being or race you defeat in combat and confine this planet will be unable to leave by any means, supernatural or technological, without your consent. Moreover, none on this planet will be able to harm you or your companions. However, nothing stops the prisoners from harming each other or any other visitors they may have."
600 CP,Galactic Record,Minor Xenos,"Let it be said that the Hrud are diligent librarians and record keepers. Within this indestructible dataslate is the comprehensive (and accurate) history of all the species of note in this galaxy. In future jumps, this dataslate will update to include important information and a comprehensive history of all the major factions and notable individuals that you may encounter."
600 CP,Halo Device,Minor Xenos,"The Halo Devices are xenotech artifacts of unknown origin, allowing an enhancement to physical parameters and granting immortality. This one in particular has been adjusted to make sure that you won’t be mindjacked by another xeno. It will grant you all the benefits of the original devices; agelessness, extreme regeneration, negation biological needs and physical enhancement."
600 CP,Kroot Warsphere,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"This egg-shaped warship has weak shields, slow maneuvering, and weak guns, relative to its size, but it has several major advantages. Firstly, it is large, large enough that it can be considered a mobile staging platform rather than a ship. Capable of carrying millions of Kroot (or other T’au affiliated species) through space and even landing on planets to serve as temporary or permanent colonization hubs. Secondly, it is very heavily armored, just by sheer dint of its size, its thick plating can shrug off large amounts of fire from enemy vessels. Thirdly, it has a true Warp Drive, technology that eludes the T’au to this day, making it strategically faster than any other T’au vessel. Fourth, it comes crewed with a skeleton crew of kroot voidsman, who can instinctively navigate the warp without navigators or psychic powers. Fifth, it is protected from Warp entities by a Kroot field that is oddly reminiscent of the orkish WAAAGH field, serving as a Gellar field replacement that cannot fail until the ship itself suffers major structural damage and requires no power from the ship itself to function. The crew of this ship are loyal to you, the T’au and Kroot both recognize your ownership and right to captain this vessel, and as part of your purchase you also receive the schematics to construct more of these ships, even without the innate technical insight that Kroot use to build these vessels."
600 CP,Dawn Blade,Warhammer 40k: T’au Empire,"You now have a sword similar to the Dawn Blade wielded by Commander Farsight. It is older than T’au expansion, older than the Imperium of Man, and it’s origins are shrouded in mystery, having been constructed by unknown Xenos in Segmentum Ultima long ago. Its materials defy scientific analysis by the greatest and wisest members of the Earth Caste, and its chronophagic alloys steal the life-span of those it kills, adding power and life to the wielder. It can cut through any mundane materials and do significant harm even to warp entities, being far superior to ordinary power weapons. In many ways, both its iridescent glow, its life-devouring properties, and its ancient nature, it seems to resemble a Gauss weapon..."
800 CP,Pharos Device ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The Pharos was a pre-Imperial installation of Necron design. While operating on very different principles, and significantly less powerful, the Pharos, like the Astronomicon, served as a beacon aiding navigation through the Warp. It was used by Guilliman when Imperium Secundus was separated from Terra by massive warp storms during the Horus Heresy. It was destroyed during the Heresy, but after the Indomitus Crusade Belasarius Cawl discovered that there may have been more than 1 such installation. Apparently that is true, because you now have one. While it does not have the same range as the Astronomicon, it also does not require an godlike level of psychic might to operate, nor does it require the sacrifice of thousands of psykers. It is also filled with necron technology, but if you decide to tamper with that it is entirely at your own risk. It is located either on a planet you own,or a planet near your starting point. In future jumps it becomes a Property you may import or not in the standard way of fiat backed properties."
800 CP,Space Hulk,Warhammer 40K: Orks,"A dozen ships melded together, a constantly shifting dungeon crawl full of ancient treasures and fun enemies. Also drifts in and out of the warp, but if you have a destination in mind it will kind of meander over thataways."
