0 CP,Grog ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"A strong ale brewed from the nutrient-rich algae that is a Squat staple. Technically a couple mugs could substitute for food, but it’s got a kick you probably won’t enjoy on an empty stomach. Each purchase grants one keg that refills nightly."
0 CP,Ratling Rations,Imperial Guard - Jumpchain,"You’re a dab hand in the kitchen. You have the potential to be an excellent chef if you applied yourself, and more importantly, you can turn the general unappetising rations issued to Imperial Guardsmen into something distinctly edible."
100 CP,Artificer Helm,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"A very tough helmet, sloped to deflect fire and blows. But the real treasure is predictive software for incoming fire, making it easier to spot gaps and a person much, much harder to pin down with fire. Plus night vision."
100 CP,Big ‘Un,Imperial Guard - Jumpchain,"A friendly Ogryn likes you enough to hang around. He (or she) is a fairly typical Ogryn; large, strong, incredibly stupid, and claustrophobic. You have earned their undying loyalty, and as an Ogryn this manifests as a willingness to dive into the fire to keep you safe – with natural Ogryn resilience, they’re quite capable of shrugging off wounds that could kill a man several times over. They will follow any and all orders you give them (believing your orders originate with the Emperor himself) and are very eager to please their friend, but their limited intelligence should be remembered when giving one. Though on the bright side, they’re also too stupid to realise what a bad idea barrelling straight at a gigantic Tyranid is and will do just that when your life is in danger, unless it happens to involve entering a confined space. They come with carapace armour, a great big power maul, and a brute shield. This may be taken multiple times, if you feel the need to be protected by several Ogryn at once"
100 CP,Communicator,Warhammer 40k: Squats,A handheld communications device that can transmit to any Squat/Imperial system within range and cannot be jammed.
100 CP,Devoted Navigator,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","A strain of abhumans that has been sanctioned by the Imperium due to their sheer necessity, Navigators are responsible for guiding human ships through the Warp via the use of their specialized third eye, which grants them many Warp-related powers the uneducated might assume to be those of a psyker. They are one of the Imperium's most important assets... and now you have a loyal Navigator of your own. Your Navigator is adventurous, and deeply desires to see more of the Galaxy with their own eyes, and may even hazard a trip out of the ship to visit wherever you are as long as it isn't a Death World or an environment utterly inhospitable to mostly-human life.

100 CP,"Durkin Thanaguard, Captain of the Guard",Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Leader of Thurgrim Ironheart’s Hearthguard retinue. A cunning fighter skilled in ambush tactics and deep striking. Comes with his own followers, his Hearthguard squad,"
100 CP,Eye patch,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"While you may or may not enjoy reveling in the fear, awe, and disgust of those around you, it can occasionally be quite convenient to fit it. This eye patch can be adjusted to fit over you're 3rd eye. When worn, it becomes invisible, and disguises any mutations or other out of place characteristics."
100 CP,"Festus, Master of the Forge",Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Guildmaster, inventor and a bit of a mad scientist, renowned among all craftsmen. Creator of the phoenix bolt, artificer helm and his personal weapon, the Arc-gun. An electric weapon that can chain-hit through many nearby targets."
100 CP,"Gullrum Grimm, the Forgotten Slayer",Warhammer 40k: Squats,"The 40K version of Gotrek. Whatever Gullrum’s original crime, it has been long since washed away and forgotten by his many glorious deeds seeking a righteous death. He has trained his body to near super-Squat levels, and fights with a fearlessness and bloodlust inspiring to young Slayers and Berserkers alike, wielding the twin power-axes Heart-Ripper and Soul-Crusher."
100 CP,Horned Mother ,Imperium of Man,"It is rare to see beastmen within the forces of the Imperium, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. This abhuman resembles a white goat more than anything, and is a naturally caring soul. You can expect her to raise the spirits of all that interact with her, though she does save her special pies for her special child; you."
100 CP,Lightning Maul,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Really, it’s a Thunderhammer, but from an age when only Squats had them. Really, it’d be rude not to use their name. But seriously, it’s a Thunderhammer."
100 CP,Little ‘Un ,Imperial Guard - Jumpchain,"Ratling wants to come along with you. Good cook, like all Ratlings, but more importantly this one is part of the secret Ratling black market network. If you can pay their (exorbitant) prices, you can find nearly anything on the black market, all thanks to a generous system of bribery and occasional theft. This may be taken multiple times, if you wish to create a small organised crime “family”."
100 CP,Mechanical Basics,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"You know how to maintain and repair most common equipment of the day. And with that comes a decent knowledge of chemistry, physics and computer science. It’s the future after all, things are complex."
100 CP,Navigator House ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"There are a large number of Navigator Houses within the Imperium of Man. Typically these houses will bind themselves to a particular group or faction. For example each of the Primarchs were said to have the loyalty of one of the larger Navigator houses. You seem to have acquired a similar relationship with one of the houses. To fulfill their duties they have sent you the most talented of their sons and daughters. They will place at least one Navigator on each ship that you own. The only thing they ask is that you raise their status and lead them to glory. They are now bound to your fate and will fall if you do as well. This means that they will do everything in their power to assist you. You may choose the demographics of the Navigator House as well as their personalities and appearance
"
100 CP,Ogryn-Proofing,Imperial Guard - Jumpchain,"Ogryns, being roughly as tall and strong as an Ork Nob while utterly lacking the latter’s intellect, find it easy to break apart any weapon they’re given with a few solid hits. You understand the process of Ogryn-proofing a weapon, ensuring that even a creature as large, solidly built, and utterly stupid as an Ogryn can use it, as an Ogryn-proofed weapon is both durable enough to survive being used as a club and simple enough to operate that an Ogryn can easily fire it in the general direction of their enemy. The smart ones can even figure out how to reload it."
100 CP,"Orrin Greybeard, the Eldest Father",Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Easily the oldest, wisest, most learned and given the nature of Squats, most powerful psyker of the race. Orrin has a special power to protect allies, but it is his counsel that is most useful to those who know him. Wields Stoneheart, a massive runic axe forged from the still-living stone at the heart of a mountain on a dying world. If there is any shield or armor that can turn that blade, Orrin has never met it."
100 CP,Paternova,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Beyond their mutations and their psychic powers, the Navigators are even stranger than you think. And the greatest amongst them are stranger still. Known as the Paternova, this being is the most powerful of the Navigators and serves as their leader. While the politics of the Navigators are deliberately confusing and frustratingly vague to outsiders, you’ve managed to glean some knowledge of it and used it for your own ends. Now, like the Paternova, it seems that your psychic might is inherently welcoming to those related to you by blood. Through some manner of warpcraft, for as long as you live, those related to you shall find that their psychic abilities to be greatly enhanced, a tremendous aid if you’re the type of person to have a large family. And unlike the actual Paternova, you won’t even have to look like a mutated monster of a man!"
100 CP,Phoenix Bolts,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"The Squats have so mastered plasma technology, they’ve figured out how to put a small plasma charge inside autogun and bolter rounds. It’s not as good as a dedicated plasma weapon, but gives more punch than conventional explosives. Buying this automatically applies the same to your and your armies weapons, besides providing complete schematics and plans for the process."
100 CP,Rare Earths ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"A crate, refilling nightly, of any rare or exotic material that may be found in the Warhammer 40K universe, since the rulebook isn’t terribly clear on just what it is the Squats mine so much of. Can be taken multiple times. In future Jumps, you may designate a rare material at the start of the Jump and also get a refilling crate of that."
100 CP,Rune Axe & Neuro Pistol,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"A huge heavy axe, covered in runes that allow a psyker to use it as a force weapon. The Pistol disrupts the nervous system, stunning opponents and rendering them more susceptible to psychic powers, but is ineffective against enemies in fully sealed and insulated armor."
100 CP,Scanner,Warhammer 40k: Squats,A life-signs detector that is pretty good at providing warning of those approaching Kommandos before you get completely blindsided.
100 CP,Second Sight,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"The first power developed by most Squats, long before they are considered an Ancestor. You can see through the illusions and sorcerous stealth favored by your enemies, Slaaneshi and Tzeenchians in particular, and your dreams sometimes contain portents of things to come, or notable events in history. After this Jump, this applies to similar illusions and invisibility."
100 CP,THE SQUATS LIVE! ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Your will is indomitable, your ability to forge ahead when all the universe seems to want you to die, despite terrible losses leaves heroes and champions awestruck. Naturally, this helps you resist the control and influence of others."
100 CP,Thurgrim Ironheart ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Warlord of Thunder Hold, and thus military leader of the League of Thor. There is no braver, cannier or more experienced war-leader among the Squats today. He stacks up well against the best strategists of the Imperium. If Thurgrim has one flaw, it is that while he will have a fighting retreat to an advantageous position, he will never quit the field entirely."
100 CP,Tunnel-Fighter,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"All able-bodied Squats fight when their Stronghold is attacked. You are very good at combat in cramped confines, and moving over broken ground."
100 CP,Tunnel-Sense,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"The Imperium is full of abandoned mines, labyrinthine spacecraft, underhives larger than many cities and the like. It is easy to get lost, and the lost are seldom heard from again. You, though, have a native sense for tunnels, a good head for direction and distance traveled, letting you sketch out a mental map with ease and tell how far you are from the surface or your starting location. It may not sound like much, but it works wonders for Cain."
100 CP,Brusque ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Squats value honesty and not wasting time, so have the reputation of being rude. You gain some benefits from
this, though, as nobody ever takes personal offense if you’re short with someone or demand they get to the point already. It’s just
expected of a Squat."
200 CP,Black Boxing,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"While certain red-robed rats of Mars always trying to get their grubby mechadendrites on your stuff is annoying, messing with them is endlessly entertaining. You can easily tweak your work to be nearly impossible for others to duplicate. If you’re feeling particularly spiteful, you can build in some cross-connections so anyone trying will blow themselves up."
200 CP,Bounty Hunter,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"One way for a lone Squat to make a living, I guess. You are an expert in tracking people down, using means both primitive and highly sophisticated, from the jungle to the depths of the largest hives."
200 CP,Fair Wages For Fair Work,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"It’s a rough galaxy, and if you see someone without any guarding their back, you could take them for an easy mark. Never you though. Whether through the reputation Squats have through vengeance or your own demeanor, people always pay you a fair price for your work, and never try to skip out by killing you. Sure, they may try and kill you for other reasons, but such is life in these times."
200 CP,Fast Service ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Some might wonder what place a mechanic has on the battlefield, but they clearly never saw a tank take a crippling hit. Fortunately, your skills are such that you can repair many vehicles and devices that would seem at first glance only good for parts, and in a fifth the normal time."
200 CP,Fusion Projector ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"This superior version of a flamer, based on cutting equipment, removes the need for vulnerable tanks of promethium, while producing a much hotter flame. You can also tighten the focus to a single target to work as a poor man’s melta."
200 CP,Graviton Gun,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"A weapon that warps gravity around the target, making things much heavier or lighter, depending on the setting."
200 CP,Plasma Gun,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Among the best things about being a Squat, reliable plasma guns every bit as potent as the Imperial version that don’t explode. Come in pistol or rifle versions, can be taken multiple times."
200 CP,The Star-Struck Navigator ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Unlike most Navigators you might find in the more public eye of the Imperium, Cicera is considerably less...subtle than her kindred. While an ordinary Navigator would be able to blend in with the rest of humanity, save for their third eye, Cicera does not have that luxury. With skin and hair as pale as snow, amethyst veins and warp-colored eyes, Cicera stands out even amongst the rest of her kind. But don’t think this appearance of hers will deter her. What she lacks in subtlety, she more than makes up for it in firepower. Standing heads and shoulders above most of her fellow Navigators, Cicera is psyker of great power and skill, capable of wiping out scores of daemons through her mastery over her Third Eye, supplemented by her experience in the use of cryomancy. More than once, she has left a battlefield littered with frozen corpses. Of course, just because she has phenomenal psychic powers, it doesn’t mean that she is ignorant to the usage of tools and weapons. After all, she has met blanks before. She knows full well, that her psychic powers are not infallible, a sentiment not shared by many of her fellow Navigators. To that end, she has equipped herself with an arsenal that wouldn’t be out of place in the Imperial Guard, if only far more ornate. Her weapon of choice is a Combi-weapon, a fusion of a  orce Rod to enhance her own psychic capabilities, and a Grav-Gun, perfect for crushing most forms of enemy machinery under their own weight. To defend herself, she is garbed in a suit of Reinforced Void Armor, enough to make her almost as durable as a Space Marine, even without shielding herself with her psychic capabilities. No helmet though. Can’t cover up her most attractive feature after all. Outside of battle though, Cicera is far more demure, preferring to stay away from most forms of social interaction. When she isn’t tasked with navigating ships, you’ll find her in her quarters, reading a book, painting on a canvas, or making a few miniatures with her psychic powers. However, her favorite hobby is stargazing, something she never got much of a chance to do in her younger years on account of the harsh training she underwent. She’ll very much appreciate it if you can get her quarters with an open view of the cosmic void. As for her interactions with others, you will likely have to bear the brunt of that. Unaccustomed to the outside world, the only person she’s willing to communicate with for now are you and your Companions. For others, she usually just stares at them disdainfully, almost as if they weren’t worth her time. Fortunately, that’s the worst thing she does, which is better than what could be said of some other Navigators. Still, maybe you can help her out with that. Navigators can’t work alone after all."
200 CP,War-Trike,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Biker dwarves! This hog will get you around the battlefield with speed and style, and per usual for purchased vehicles has unlimited fuel and self-repairs. Also a pair of forward-mounted autoguns or bolters that never run out of ammo."
200 CP,Warp Charts ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"These 4 ancient charts each show a warp route between 2 locations of your choice that do not rely on the Astronomicon. They are more challenging to follow, and incur greater risk of problems during the transit, but they have been out of use for so long that few people even know that such routes exist, and the chance of the particular route you use being known is almost non-existent. I hope I don’t have to explain the value of having a hidden back door to your chosen systems."
300 CP,My Friend Lenny,Warhammer 40K: Imperial Navy,"Lenny is an Ogryn. He’s about as smart as a 6 year old, and with the same level of impulse control, but he is about 3 meters of solid muscle, and more loyal to you than a Sister of Battle is to the Emperor (please don’t kill me). Partially because he’s not really smart enough to understand temptation or betrayal."
300 CP,Neo-Plasma Generator,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"A curious reactor that somehow uses zero-point energy to create and contain a warp rift, drawing Empyrean energies from it and converting that to a form of plasma. This is several times greater than the Imperium can manage in generating power. Comes with complete schematics and plans."
300 CP,Wisdom ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Maybe it’s the experience, maybe constant contact with the ancestors, but you have achieved a level of inner peace. With the surrender of ego comes a piercing insight. It rarely takes you more than a single short conversation to figure out what a person really wants and how they go about it. This combination gives weight to your words, making you more persuasive."
300 CP,Xeno-Archaeologist ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Let the tech-priests wring their hands over tech-heresy, you know that all xenos and archaeotech works on sound physical principles. They worked before, and can be made to work again. You are a master of figuring out and reverse engineering technology, taking less than a tenth the time it would take a Guild workshop, and about a millionth the time it would take the AdMech."
400 CP,As A Fine Wine,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"All Squats grow in psychic potential and power with age, you just do so twice as quickly and without apparent limits. This applies equally to all your other powers and skills."
400 CP,Exo-Armor ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"The Squat’s equivalent to Terminator armor, normally worn only by a Warlord and his retinue. The result of taking the most rugged environment suit needed to handle everything from hard vacuum to dust-storms to wading through toxic radioactive vats, then hanging more armor on. Exo-Armor may look kinda... round, but it’s wearers are every bit as tough and strong as Terminators. Comes with a free power axe and shield, though you can swap either for a ranged weapon."
400 CP,Perpetual,Imperium of Man,"There is a rare kind of human out there, one that counts the Emperor as one of their ranks. Perpetuals, the immortals. Not only are they at peak physical condition and never age past their prime, but they are capable of regenerating from almost anything. Loss of their head? Watch it grow back in seconds. Reduced to a literal puddle? They'll be right as rain soon enough. It would take the complete destruction of your entire body to actually kill you, as even leaving behind a drop of blood will see your return. Your perpetuity seems unique, in that you  ay return to life even from complete molecular destruction or worse once every ten years, or once every Jump, whichever is shorter."
400 CP,The Hollow Atlas,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"his xenos artifact can prove a powerful aid to those who travel the void. The Hollow Atlas is a series of clear crystal spheres nested within one another. Each sphere is covered in spindly, complex etchings impossible to decipher, and all but the outermost sphere are rotating rapidly in different directions. The entire assembly glows with a soft-blue light. The device provides a series of maps for the entire region that includes the jumper’s starting location. However, using such a strange xenos device is not for the weak-willed. It takes great effort and willpower to activate, and can only be activated by a person with some kind of psyker or psychic ability. For the Hollow Atlas, both Astropaths and Navigators count. When active, a series of highly detailed three dimensional star-charts in glowing blue energy erupt from the Atlas to fill whatever room or area it is currently occupying (within reason). Usually, these charts are of a region of space the user is interested in visiting and thinking about. The region displayed can be as large as a sub-sector or as small as a single solar system. However, sometimes the Atlas does not show the user what he wants to see, but other regions entirely. Often there is no discernible reason for this, however should the user heed the Atlas and travel to this region of space, he seldom finds the trip wasted. In future jumps, the Hollow Atlas will update to the region around the owner’s starting point.
"
500 CP,Battle Suit ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"The Squat version of a Dreadnought. But unlike anyone else until the Tau, they can just pop open the canopy and climb out when done. You can even wear Exo-Armor inside, and fire on the move. One arm hoists a massive Dreadnought Power Axe, and one gun arm with your choice of autocannon, heavy bolter, heavy flamer or plasma cannon. Who's the short one now?"
600 CP,Guildmaster,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"You have risen through the ranks to become the seniormost Engineer’s Guild member in a Stronghold. There is nothing about Squat or Imperial technology you do not understand in detail, and you’re brilliant at adapting the principles of one device to another. You’d stand a good chance of fixing the Golden Throne, if they’d ever let a filthy abhuman into the Imperial Presence."
600 CP,Made It To 8th Ed. ,Warhammer 40k: Squats,"Your existence cannot be erased, not by reality warpers, time-travelers, malevolent writers. Nothing and no one can deny that you are real, and you matter. So go forth, and fear no darkness."
600 CP,Navigator Spire,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Looking something like a gothic wizard's tower, this structure is part dwelling, part arcane workshop, and part observatory. The windows on the very top level open onto the Warp, allowing you to look outside of reality itself. From there, with the right skill, you can not only navigate through the Warp, but also see vessels headed to your location, as well as observe conditions giving you a way of detecting Warp Storms or major psychic workings before they are completed. It also has it's own, independent Gellar field, protecting it from daemons and warp rifts. Just as a bonus, you can also use the windows to look back into previous jumps, or into your home world, if you want to check out how people you knew are doing. This property can be either a warehouse attachment, or an independent property, or can be attached to any vehicle you own that is at least half a kilometer in length."
