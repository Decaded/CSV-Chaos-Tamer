0 CP,Astartes Combat Knife ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","A normal human would be more apt to call this weapon a sword, if it wasn’t for the too-wide grip. But in the hands of an Astartes, it is nothing more than a long knife. Issued to each Space Marine at the moment he recovers from his first gene-seed implants, and kept on their person until the day they die, this blade holds a monomolecular edge that you will never need to sharpen. Furthermore, so long as you reach for this knife, you will find it on your person, even if you left it elsewhere. There are certain variations on this knife that you may also purchase, although you can have one of the more common variants, such as the Poignard, Gladius, or the Star-Fang Knife, for free. 
"
0 CP,The Codex Astartes,Ultramarine Gauntlet,"A copy of the unabridged writings of Roboute Guilliman, revealing to you the secrets of superiority as a Space Marine."
0 CP,Shock Grenades,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"Often used by Primaris Reivers, shock grenades are a non-lethal Imperial grenade that temporarily disorient opponents with sudden loud noises and intense flashes of light."
100 CP,Watchers in the Dark,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","The Watchers are a diminutive, robed race of creatures that now inhabit the fortress monastery of the Dark Angels, but who once lived on Caliban before its destruction. They possess a near-exclusive ability to resist Warp entities to almost the same degree as a Blank, although without nullifying the Warp around them as Blanks do. They communicate with one another through psychic means, and have been trying to guide the Dark Angels against Chaos since even before the Horus Heresy. You receive a group of 10 Watchers, who will endeavor to aid you—although they will never actively fight for you, they are more than willing to assist you in other ways, even during combat. Not to say that they can’t fight; if attacked, they will defend themselves, and quite ably at that, considering that they once engaged in battle against the Warp-twisted mosnters of Caliban.
"
100 CP,Primarch in Stasis,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","No, probably not the Primarch you’re thinking of—Thunder Warriors called the leaders of their legions Primarchs, yes, but this was only the name of their rank, not a term with the connotations a Space Marine might link to the term. This is a stasis tube containing a Thunder Warriors Primarch, perfectly preserved at the height of his skill and ability, of such incredible martial ability that anyone less than the Captain-General of the Legio Custodes himself is certain to be defeated by him. It was his hope at the time of his preservation that a cure would be found to the genetic and mental deterioration experienced by the Thunder Warriors; sadly, temporary gene treatments are the best he can find, even—or perhaps especially—in the modern era.
"
100 CP,Venerable Dreadnought,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Normally, being interred within a Dreadnought chassis is seen as a great honor to an Astartes, but Grey Knights simply see it as a continuation of duty, and do not yearn for it. This Doomglaive Dreadnought is an old soul who felt that his duty was incomplete, and so requested to continue service after being mortally wounded. He is wise beyond even his advanced years, and contains a host of knowledge about daemons and the Warp; what’s more, his psychic powers are amongst the most devastating to ever appear in the entire Chapter.
"
100 CP,Gentle Giant,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","This surprisingly large Space Marine of the Storm Giants (a Successor Chapter to the Salamanders) has taken the compassionate nature of his Primarch to new levels, levels that might be deemed heretical if they were widely known. He has sympathy even for the alien, and tries to avoid killing people who haven’t “earned it”, regardless of their species. Considering his size and impressive strength, though, there are few he can’t defeat when he is finally roused to anger.
"
100 CP,Grey Knights Thunderhawk,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","This variant of the Thunderhawk has psycho-reactive plating fitted with an interlaced Aegis System to protect it from psychic attacks, and also has its Heavy Bolters replaced with Psycannons and its Hellstrike Missiles replaced by Mindstrike Missiles.
"
100 CP,Frost Axe ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","These melee weapons are exclusive to the Space Wolves, and are similar to the more common Power Weapon. Its cutting edge is made from energized diamond, giving it the appearance of a blade formed of purest ice; however, you may instead opt for your axe to have been studded with the diamond-hard teeth of a Fenrisian Kraken.
"
100 CP,Thunder Hammer,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Amongst the strongest of the Power Weapons, it operates in a peculiar fashion. Rather than keeping the disruption field active all the time, it is designed to activate upon impact; this allows it to conserve power until it is needed, and also means that its force when released is even more devastating than it would normally be, knocking any foe lighter than a Terminator off their feet with even a light tap. 
"
100 CP,Mental Stability ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","The process of creating a Thunder Warrior was a flawed one, as it often resulted in certain instabilities of the mind that only expressed themselves more strongly over time. These mental flaws could be many and varied, so it’s a good thing you don’t have to worry about that. You are incapable of experiencing mental ailments and psychological disorders. While things might make you sad, you will never sink into actual depression. You are assured of healthy cognizance.
"
100 CP,Transhuman Dread ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K ,"Transhuman dread is the phenomenon that occurs whenever a normal being witnesses a Space Marine in action. The unnatural designs and movement of the Astartes is difficult for the mind to process. This process causes them to freeze up and limits their capabilities when they face the Transhuman beings. You will now gain an amplified version of this ability. The greater you become the more powerful your aura will become. For example the aura of a Primarch can halt elite Space Marines in their tracks. Lastly you will be able to control this ability perfectly ensuring that your allies are unaffected by this ability.
"
100 CP,Volkite Weapon,Talons of the Empire,"Volkite weapons were the first weapons issued to the Astartes Legions, and though eventually replaced by the more adaptable and easily manufactured bolter, it was not because these weapons were anything less than absolutely lethal. Firing a thermal ray, these weapons cause deflagrtion on organic matter. Flesh and bone burst into ash and flame, the entire target combusting,and destroying anything near them as they go."
100 CP,Know No Fear,Imperium of Man,"It would be a poor Astartes to cower in fear of a Hive Tyrant, no matter how understandable it may be to the common man. Thankfully, you are above such things, your transhuman mind incapable of experiencing fear at all, and you will not hesitate in the face of the actions you must perform to ensure that the mission is complete."
100 CP,Helfrost Gun,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Hailing from the world of Fenris, home of the Space Wolves, Helfrost weapons are a rather unique and interesting tool of war. You could even consider it as a sort of counterpart to the famed Melta weapons so often used by Guardsmen and Space Marines alike. Whereas as a Melta fires off a short-ranged beam of concentrated heat, the Helfrost instead unleashes a short-ranged beam of the purest cold. And with this pistol, you and your foes will know just how deadly the cold can be. Once struck by the beam, flesh blackens and shatters with catastrophic frostbite and armor offers no protection, buckling and cracking as frost spreads from the point of impact. And unless your poor foes can fight their way free, they shall find themselves as a withered revenant forever imprisoned within a jagged and never-melting tomb of ice and frost."
100 CP,Heavy Bolt Pistol ,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"While most Primaris Astartes are issued a standard ‘compact’ Bolt Pistol for use as an emergency sidearm in a pinch, others prefer a bolt pistol more suited for their larger size. Favored by Reiver Squads in particular, Heavy Bolt Pistols feature an elongated barrel and a larger bolt shell than the average bolt pistol, giving them a heavier punch than normal."
100 CP,Bolt Rifle ,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"Developed by Magos Cawl to arm his new Primaris Marines, the Mark II Cawl-Pattern Bolt Rifle features extended range and armor piercing capability compared to the standard Godwyn-pattern bolter that has long been the standard weapon of the Astartes Chapters. Much like the Mark X power armor issued to its user, it is a highly customizable and modular weapon, as well, easily taking modifications. The Primaris Astartes generally use two main variants of the Bolt Rifle, taking advantage of this modularity.."
100 CP,Absolver Bolt Pistol,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"One of the heaviest single-handed ranged weapons in common use by the Primaris Astartes, Absolver Bolt Pistols fire a much heavier bolt shell at longer range than other common bolt pistols. Often found in the hands of Primaris Chaplains, dispensing the Emperor’s Wrath upon His foes, as well as the hands of Primaris Apothecaries "
100 CP,Bolt Carbine,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"An assault weapon commonly used by Reiver squads, the Cawl-pattern Bolt Carbine is designed for Reivers that need ranged fire support. Capable of laying down a barrage of bolts while the squad is on the move, the Bolt Carbine is features a shortened barrel and an extra foregrip compared to other bolter patterns, enhancing handling in the chaos of a firefight."
100 CP,Omni-Scrambler,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"Usually used by Vanguard Infiltrators, the Omni-Scrambler is a potent backpack mounted ECM device. Scrambling vox frequencies and disrupting enemy communications, these devices are used to assist Vanguard forces in infiltrating behind enemy lines."
200 CP,Fenrisian Wolf,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","The massive Fenrisian Wolf is a fearsome and semi-sapient predator of the homeworld of the Space Wolves, and now you, in the ancient tradition of Primarch Leman Russ, have befriended and trained a Fenrisian Wolf of your own.  Although legends tell of truly massive varieties of Fenrisian Wolf that can even have teeth as large as tree trunks, you ""merely"" own a Thunderwolf. These creatures might not be the size of the Fenrisian Wolves of myth, but they are still huge, having more in common with a Terran rhinoceros than a canine in size. With a shaggy coat as tough as matted steel wire, and jaws strong enough to chew through iron, this Thunderwolf is now your loyal ally, devoted to you in all things, and will heed your words. But before you treat it as just another animal, just remember... there are no wolves on Fenris.
"
200 CP,Forgebreaker,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Once created by Fulgrim, it was gifted to Ferrus Manus as a sign of the Primarchs' brotherhood, which lasted until the outbreak of the Horus Heresy. It would later be given to Perturabo of the Iron Warriors. This enormous Power Hammer crackles with electricity, and when brought to bear against any object, it is certain to shatter the item in question.
"
200 CP,Assault Bike,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Also known as the Space Marine Bike, this light vehicle is used throughout the Imperium, and even by Renegade and Chaos Space Marines. It is extremely powerful, capable of propelling a fully armored Space Marine at dizzying speeds while remaining responsive enough to perform a full range of death-defying combat maneuvers, and tough enough to ram through rockcrete walls without harm. It is equipped with twin Bolters mounted on either side of the headlight, or with an Astartes Grenade Launcher. You may alternatively have the Primaris Raider-Pattern Combat Bike, if you so desire.
"
200 CP,Land Speeder ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","A light anti-gravity vehicle serving as the primary reconnaissance, scouting, resupply, and fast attack vehicles of the Space Marine Chapters. The anti-gravitic plates allow it to climb to heights of up to 100 meters, but officially they are supposed to use the ground as cover and shouldn't go that high. It is lightly armored to the point that Power Armor provides better protection, and instead relies on speed and maneuverability to avoid enemy fire. It relies on an underslung Heavy Bolter or Multi-Melta for firepower.
"
200 CP,Rhino ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","A common troop transport produced by the Imperium, it has an extremely versatile design that has given it a great many variants. It is extremely dependable, able to run on any semi-combustible fuel source, and can be produced from any locally available material. You may select any pattern of Rhino that you desire, but if you want a Rhino variant, such as a Predator or Vindicator, you’ll need to pay for the privilege. If you so desire, you can have your Rhino be further modified with additional weaponry and defenses, such as Dozer Blades,
"
200 CP,Razorback,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"Similar to the Rhino, the Razorback is an armored transport but comes with a mounted heavy weapon such as a lascannon or heavy bolter, making it ideal for supporting Grey Knights on the front lines. While it sacrifices some troop capacity, its enhanced firepower makes it a valuable asset in offensive and defensive maneuvers."
200 CP,Narthecium,Warhammer 40k Night Lords Jump,"The Narthecium is the medical equipment of a Space Marine Apothecary, with implements specifically designed to treat an Astartes' unique biology, most notably for retrieving the gene- seed from the Progenoid Glands of an Astartes. And for that, it comes with tools to tear through Power Armor. The one you hold, whether pried from the corpse of an Apothecary, or used by you if you had been an Apothecary pre-heresy, though, is even more efficient at this, with a giant drill and saw capable of even getting into a Terminator's armor. Now, you CAN use this to treat your battle brothers with their wounds... But you can also use it to rip through your enemies and remove their gene-seed for your own uses."
200 CP,Battle Brothers,Ultramarine Gauntlet,"A squad of glorious tactical Ultramarines eager to follow you into battle in
pursuit of the glory you will undoubtedly bring them."
200 CP,Plasma Exterminator,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"Archmagos Cawl, among his many fields of study, has shown a mastery of Imperial Plasma technology. The Plasma Exterminators wielded by Inceptors are an example of his work. Packing the firepower of a full sized Plasma Cannon into short-ranged and single-handed package, these are usually wielded in pairs by Inceptor Squads. Like most plasma weapons, a wielder can supercharge them, making them far more deadly, although doing so does carry a risk of the weapon lethally overloading."
200 CP,Accelerator Autocannon ,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"Used by Vanguard Suppressors, this autocannon is a hybrid of autocannon and rail gun. When combined with their shock-absorbing servo plates, this allows a Suppressor Squad to punish enemies lurking outside of bolter range with rapid-fire volleys of foot-long shells from their belt-fed guns, then engage jump packs to relocate. The additional acceleration system offers this autocannon enhanced armor penetration, while the high rate of fire is ideal for disrupting enemy gunlines."
200 CP,Redemptor Dreadnought,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"An upgraded version of the venerable Dreadnought, this new creation of the Adeptus Mechanicus still serves the same purpose as earlier variants: To allow crippled beyond recovery Astartes to continue to serve the Emperor, even in death. Like much of the Primaris’ armory, the Redemptor is a versatile machine, and may be armed with several weapons. The primary armament of a Redemptor, mounted on the right arm, is either an anti-infantry Heavy Onslaught Gatling Cannon for cutting down lightly armored foes in a hail of shells or a heavy Macro Plasma Incinerator, for destroying heavier armored targets with concentrated bolts of plasma. Mounted under the power fist on the other arm is either a Heavy
Flamer or a lighter Onslaught Gatling Cannon, while the torso is fitted with either dual Fragstorm Grenade Launchers or paired Storm Bolters. An anti-air Icarus Missile System finishes off the Redemptor’s armaments, with all of this powered by an extremely potent plasma reactor. Of course, while the Redemptor does pack heavy firepower and is unusually responsive to its crippled occupant, there is a small flaw to the machine: The improved performance also puts increased strain on its occupant, causing those of weaker will to be ‘burned out’ by the demands put on their damaged bodies. Still, in these dark times, one thing the Imperium does not lack is more dying heroes..."
200 CP,Bolt Sniper Rifle,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"Designed for the use of Vanguard Eliminators, the Bolt Sniper Rifle is designed for precision long range shooting, thanks in part to an extremely advanced and integrated auspex. In the hands of a skilled marksman, this rifle can be used to eliminate enemy command elements. In addition, this versatile anti-infantry weapon is designed to work with, and includes a supply of, several specialized bolt shells designed exclusively for this rifle."
300 CP,Soulspear ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","An arcane device used by Rogal Dorn himself, and entrusted to the Soul Drinkers Chapter during the Second Founding. The weapon's output and effect was effectively the same as that of a Vortex Missile, although more controlled, tearing open reality with each swing. It can be used to kill spiritual beings that may be resistant to permanent death, as seen in the destruction of the Daemon Abraxes.
"
300 CP,Fireblade ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Crafted by Ferrus Manus as the perfect weapon, it was delivered as gift to Fulgrim as a sign of the friendship between those two Primarchs, only to be broken by Ferrus when Fulgrim tried to convert him to Chaos. He repaired the blade and used it to duel Fulgrim on Isstvan V, only to be cut down by his once-brother. This superb weapon is a Power Sword capable of generating immense heat, a weapon of such sublime craftsmanship that it could be considered an insult for it to be wielded by anyone less magnificent than a Primarch. 
"
300 CP,Repulsor Grav-Tank,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"Designed and created by Archmagos Belisarius Cawl to make a transport vehicle ‘worthy’ of his Primaris Astartes project, the Repulsor is an advanced gravitic armored transport that has seen extensive use over the course of the Indomitus Crusade. This armored fighting vehicle features a large array of weapon systems, ranging from the humble Heavy Stubber mounted on the rear of the vehicle to deter enemy infantry to the advanced Las-Talon or Heavy Onslaught Gatling Cannon mounted on the main turret. In addition, the vehicle is heavy enough, and the anti-gravity field it produces strong enough, that it does not so much ‘skim’ over terrain as ‘crush the terrain before it flat’."
400 CP,Spear of Russ ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Also known as the Dionysian Spear, the Wolfspear, or Gungnir, this is a legendary artifact of the Space Wolves, although the weapon itself was forged by the Emperor in his very first subterranean fortress during the Age of Strife. It was originally known for its ability to ""illuminate"" those it touches, revealing to them some aspect of “truth”. Being pierced with this weapon will cleanse the victim of corruption and malign effects upon their mind.
"
400 CP,Stormtalon Gunship ,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"The Stormtalon Gunship is a more compact and agile flying vehicle that provides close air support to Grey Knight forces on the ground. With weapons like the twin assault cannon and missiles, it excels at attacking enemy infantry and light armor from above. Its maneuverability allows it to operate effectively in various environments, providing both speed and firepower."
400 CP,Stormhawk Interceptor ,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"While not as commonly fielded, the Stormhawk Interceptor is a dedicated air superiority fighter, primarily used for aerial dogfights and engaging fast-moving threats in the sky. Armed with twin assault cannons, heavy bolters, and missiles, it provides excellent anti-air support, making it ideal for covering ground forces from aerial threats."
400 CP,Land Raider Redeemer ,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"The Redeemer variant of the Land Raider features devastating flamestorm cannons that excel at clearing enemy troops from fortified positions. This vehicle is also heavily armored and can transport a squad of Grey Knights into close-range combat, where its weapons are most effective. It provides both fire support and mobility, making it ideal for close-quarters engagements."
400 CP,Land Raider Crusader,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"The Land Raider Crusader is a heavily armored transport designed to carry Grey Knights into the heart of battle. Equipped with hurricane bolters, a twin assault cannon, and frag launchers, it’s designed to break through enemy lines. With thick armor plating and impressive firepower, the Crusader is both a fortress and transport, capable of carrying a larger squad than other Land Raider variants."
400 CP,"Why Won’t You Die, I Cut Out Your Heart",Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K ,"Space Marines are incredibly hard to kill. For example when Saphran fought the enemy Jedi they pierced his lungs, cut off one of his arms, cut out his heart, and struck him dozens of times with their lightsabers. Despite everything he refused to die and was still capable of fighting them. You share this trait and are remarkably hard to kill. You will be capable of maintaining your peak condition and surviving numerous wounds that should have killed you. You will be far more resilient than other members of your kind. As a human you would be on par with a Space Marine in durability. Should you be a Space Marine or Emperor forbid a Primarch it could be nigh impossible to kill you in open combat. 
"
400 CP,Dreadnought,Ultramarine Gauntlet,"A One-Up of a different kind, if at any point you are wounded beyond the point of recovery you will be rescued and placed in this mecha-suit, while it isn’t a pleasant experience at least you’ll be alive."
400 CP,Logistics Win Wars,Ultramarine Gauntlet,"If there is one lesson of the great Guilliman that every Ultramarine should hold close to their hearts it is the importance of logistics, after all the kingdom of Ultramarr only stands as a pinnacle of Imperial culture due to the logistical
brilliance of the Ultramarines! You are capable of managing any organization with the utmost eficiency, even something as sprawling as the Spiritual Liege’s kingdom."
400 CP,Relic of the Primarch,Imperium of Man,"You have a great and terrible honor, for you have been chosen to wield an artifact that was once used by a Primarch during the Great Crusade. Perhaps you go into battle with Guiliman’s Hand of Dominion or the Spear of Telesto that was once used by Sanguinius, or perhaps the Angel Blade of Lion El’Johnson. Whatever you possess, expect for many to look upon you with high expectations or covetous eyes."
400 CP,Astraeus Super-Heavy Tank ,Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"A blend of Archmagos Cawl’s technological innovations and STC data rumored to have been recovered by the Minotaurs, the Astraeus is a super-heavy armored tank that is used by the Primaris Astartes. Unlike its smaller ‘cousin’, the repulsor, however, the Astraeus is designed for combat and combat alone. Mounting several heavy weapon systems as well as starship-grade Void Shields, the Astraeus is a mobile fortress that is a threat to any opponent within weapon range, whether on the ground or in the sky."
500 CP,Sanctic Halo ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","An elaborately filigreed Iron Halo possessed by the Ultramarines Chapter, this relic not only deflect bullets and repels blade thrusts, but also amplifies the wearer's willpower and how your will affects your own body; you can withstand psychic attacks that would kill an ordinary Space Marine, and you can quickly re-knit even grievous wounds in the thick of battle.
"
600 CP,Excindio-Class Battle-Automata,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","These are the tortured and neutered remains of the murderous Men of Iron, captured by the Emperor's forces and transformed into many-armed Battle Automata to be used by the Dark Angels’ Ironwing division. Every Excindio is equipped with kill-switches, because they do not understand mercy or restraint and take vicious delight in any carnage they cause, such was their hatred of organic life. Yours is loyal to you… but that won’t stop it from getting carried away.
These towering robots went into battle with Battle Claws on their main arms, secondary Manipulator Arms, Phosphex Canister Launchers, Nerve Induction Shredders, Atomantic Pulse Cannons, Graviton Flux Projectors, and an internal Refractor Field. You receive 3 Battle-Automata with this purchase; seven are enough to pose a threat to a Primarch.
"
600 CP,Space Marine Chapter ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K ,"A Space Marine Chapter is a force of one thousand space marines. In the story we witness a number of Chapters such as the Skywatchers (Ultramarine), Crimson Razors (Imperial Fist), Salamanders, Space Wolves, and some other assorted members of different chapters. You may choose a canon Space Marine Chapter, one of their successors, or create your own Chapter. Their loyalty will be unbreakable to the point that even their true Primarch would be unable to turn them against you. Should any of them perish they will be replaced within a few weeks.
"
600 CP,Death World,Imperium of Man,"In order to train the greatest warriors in all of the galaxy, their environment must be exceptionally harsh during their training. You have been given command over one of the deadliest planets in the galaxy, be it because of the environment or the creatures that inhabit it. Perhaps it’s filled with monsters that the ignorant would equate with the beasts of Chaos or Tyranids, or the planet is an eternal ball of fire and lava. Thankfully, there is a compound present meant to safely house an entire Astartes Chapter, as well as all of their serfs and belongings."
800 CP,Strike Cruiser,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","As most Space Marine Chapters only control 2 or 3 Battle Barges, they more frequently use Strike Cruisers. The arrival of a single Strike Cruiser is usually enough to quell a rebellious planet, even before its deployment of the full Company of Space Marines and their equipment that can be stored aboard a Strike Cruiser. The armament of a Strike Cruiser is comparable to that of a Dauntless Light Cruiser, with two Weapons Batteries; however, it omits Lance Weaponry in exchange for a mighty Bombardment Cannon. You may additionally equip your Strike Cruiser with a Nova Cannon for mastery of ship-to-ship combat.
