0 CP,Basic Gear ,Imperium of Man,"It’s a dangerous galaxy out there, and you can’t exactly go out there without anything. Though it may not be much, you now own a pair of clothes, Imperial Guard-grade flak armor, as well as a laspistol."
100 CP,Aquila Lander ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"A popular and effective vehicle, the Aquila Lander is a multi-role unit, capable of operating both in atmosphere and the void, whether in light ground attack, exploration, or battlefield transportation. It can move at a cruising speed of 2,200 kph, carries 10 people or equivalent cargo in addition to it's pilot, and bears a nose mounted autocannon."
100 CP,CQC ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Combat, for an Armsman, is a brutal, close quarters affair, where you never have good sight lines, you are constantly surrounded by things that will kill you if they break, and quarter is rarely asked or offered. You are an expert in fighting under those conditions, using the environment to your advantage, and minimizing collateral damage. You even know how to use collateral damage as a weapon against your enemy, if you’re willing to take that risk."
100 CP,Dress Sword ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"It's not enough to slay the enemies of mankind, you must look impressive doing so. This chain cutlass is fine and well balanced, and is obviously of high quality. It also has the interesting feature that any martial feats you accomplish while wielding it, and any speeches where you brandish it, are inherently more impressive than they would otherwise be."
100 CP,Flyboy ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"What kind of pilot doesn’t know how to fly? You know how to operate every kind of aerial small craft operated by any Imperial faction. Your skills with these vehicles is equivalent to a professional fighter pilot specializing in that vehicle. You also know how to project that je ne sei qua that gets fighter jocks into so many bar fights and boudoirs both. Finally, you are given a certain degree of latitude in military regulations and expectations based on how valuable you are."
100 CP,Fury Interceptor,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Primarily serving in void combat, the Fury can also serve as a very heavy attack craft in atmospheric actions. There it is intimidatingly powerful, with a turreted twin linked long barreled lascannon, 2 long barreled lascannon banks with 5 linked lascannons each, and 12 void capable missiles. It has a crew of 4, with a pilot, copilot, forward gunner/crew chief, and tech-priest enginseer, and moves at a cruising speed of 2,500 kph. Still, for all it's impressive might, it's unlikely to do any significant damage to a warp capable void ship. Instead, Interceptors are used defensively to pick off enemy small craft and torpedoes, and offensively to suppress the enemies anti-small craft turrets to allow assault boats and bomber to make their attacks."
100 CP,Monitoring Station ,Planetary Govenor,"The distant reaches of space hold many secrets, and this system is home to an advanced Monitoring Station that is tasked with uncovering them. The station is equipped with some of the most sophisticated sensor technology in the Imperium, capable of detecting even the slightest anomalies in space-time and distant Warp-translations. However, despite its impressive capabilities, the station is woefully under-defended, relying on its secrecy and Navy squadrons to patrol the nearby area and respond to any threats to the station. The station's primary mission is to monitor the activity of nearby systems, tracking the movements of ships and celestial bodies, and detecting any signs of potential threats. Its operators work tirelessly to parse the data flowing in from the vast network of sensors, searching for any clues that could hint at enemy troop movements. The Monitoring Station is a vital part of the Imperial Navy's early warning and defence system, and its operatives are the first line of defence against any potential threats. Its location is kept secret from all but the highest-ranking officials, and even then, only on a need-to-know basis. Any attempt to interfere with its operations will be met with a swift and uncompromising response."
100 CP,Naval Shotcannon ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"A heavy, 2 gauge shotgun, capable of semi-auto fire or 3 round bursts. It comes with 10 full 24 round box magazine, a tripod, ear protectors, bags to be turned into sandbags, and supplies of any special shotgun ammo you have, remade in it’s size."
100 CP,Pilot,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"Considering how many different types of ships you go through this is a useful skill. You have the skills to pilot any sort of vehicle, regardless of whether it's a walker on the ground, a fighter in the sky, or a ship designed for the depths of space. Keep in mind that larger vehicles will typically require multiple people to crew. It doesn't matter if you know how. One person can't crew a battleship designed to be manned by 10,000 on their own."
100 CP,Pilot,"Warhammer 40,000 Jump: The Imperium","Skill in flying both atmospheric craft and spaceships, does not apply to warp travel."
100 CP,The Endless Drift ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Perhaps the most horrific fate that can befall someone on a ship is an unstoppable death. This could be due to your ship being too damaged to travel or if you lose power in the midst of a battle. You however, are not destined to die this way. You will find that should you enter conditions such as those mentioned above you will be spared. Perhaps your ship will be found by an allied patrol while drifting or your ship will be ignored by your foes in the midst of battle. As long as you have faith you will never fall to an unstoppable death and you shall have the chance to fight once more.
"
100 CP,Void Suit,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"When you are inside of a spaceship there is always a chance that something terrible will occur causing you to evacuate the ship. This is an advanced void suit that is capable of allowing anyone to survive in an open vacuum indefinitely. The suit has an unlimited supply of oxygen, is temperature resistant (both hot and cold), and has thrusters should you end up floating around on your own. This suit will come with the blueprints needed to produce more and the suit will be replaced should you lose it. 
"
100 CP,Leadership,Warhammer 40K: Imperial Navy 1.02,"A Leader without any followers is just a wanderer shouting and waving his arms. Honestly, even with every armsman on board, the officers of a ship would not be able to maintain control if the overwhelming majority of the crew weren’t willing to at least passively accept their authority. Many pirate ships started out as proud navy vessels before an unwise commander drove a large enough segment of the crew into open revolt. Given the lot of many common voidfarers, it may seem amazing that they would accept their lot, but people’s capacity for acceptance is profound if they’ve never known anything better. Still, bovine acceptance can never produce excellence, and a crack crew requires a strong degree of personal investment. even from the lowest members. You have the qualities of a great leader, not just a passable one. You know how to instill an Esprit de Corps, and give people something to look to beyond themselves. When you respect people, even in a backhanded way, (“they may be base-born scum, but man can they fight”) it comes across, and you know just how to build upon that as well."
1000 CP,Ramiles Class Star Fort,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02," A Ramiles class Star Fort is a potent tool of Imperial might. 4 spokes each provide a docking port for a ship of up to Cruiser size. Between the spokes there are 4 quadrants, each has powerful Macrobroadsides and Lance batteries, as well as Torpedo Tubes and a Landing Bay for small craft. These potent stations are not only used by the Navy, but also by Astartes chapters like the Space Wolves and Ultramarines, and even as a Watch Fortress by the Deathwatch. Some stations, like yours for example have the facilities to construct some void ship components. Most impressive however, is that these vehicles which lack realspace drives are yet capable of warp travel. The potent  generators of a Ramiles can generate a Warp bubble and a Gellar Field, after which it can be towed through the Warp to a new deployment point."
200 CP,Any Port in a Storm,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"When a Warp Storm hits, or your Gellar Field is failing, it can be imperative to get back to Materium as soon as possible. However, that isn’t always possible, especially in times or areas of major disturbance. Warp Storms can impinge on the Materium, making them little safer, or you could re-enter the Materium in an asteroid belt, or inside a planet. Also, if at all possible, you don’t want to drop back in the dark space between stars, far from any hope or help, or even a rock to be shipwrecked on if your ship breaks. But the Emperor Protects! Whenever you are in the midst of an issue and need an immediate emergency refuge you will see a small ball of golden light. You don’t have to respond, but if you choose to follow it, it will lead you to a refuge. This refuge is guaranteed to either have a breathable atmosphere, or a way you could provide a breathable atmosphere, and not to be immediately lethal. More than that, there is a good chance that there are resources in the vicinity that you might be able to use, if you can find them and make them usable."
200 CP,Captain Signy Mallory,Planetary Govenor,"She is a force to be reckoned with, a veteran of countless battles and a true icon of the Imperial Navy. As the captain of the Norway, an ancient Gothic-class cruiser, she leads her crew with an iron fist, demanding the utmost discipline
and dedication from every member under her command. Despite her reputation as a heartless commander who throws men's lives like dice, her crew looks up to her with a grudging respect, knowing that they serve under one of the most skilled and effective captains in the entire Imperium. She's a woman of few words, preferring to let her actions speak for themselves, and the only thing that seems to ignite her passion is the challenge of combat. Her eyes are a piercing and intense blend of fire and ice which inspires both awe and fear in those around her, and her unrelenting focus on her mission has earned her a reputation as a leader who never reckons wrong or right. To some, Captain Mallory may seem like a cold and calculating figure, with no emotions to control and no mercy to show. But for those few who know her well, there's a deeper layer to her character. Haunted by the lives she's lost in battle, her sleepless nights are filled with the memories of all the comrades that died at her command, and sometimes, a melancholic melody echoes through the dimly lit halls of the Norway. Yet despite the haunting beauty of her strings, the crew knows not to approach the port observation deck too closely, for their Captain is in mourning, and none dare disturb her wordless eulogies. Despite this inner turmoil, Captain Mallory remains resolute in her duty to protect the Imperium from the horrors that stalk the void between stars. Her fierce loyalty to her crew and her unshakable commitment to the Imperium make her a beacon of hope for all those who fight with her."
200 CP,Man the Lifeboats ,Warhammer 40K: Imperial Navy,"Fighting in multi-kilometer ships crewed by multi thousands and powered by colossal explosive engines, as they throw
house sized explosive shells at each is extremely dangerous, and that’s before some idiot commander decides it’s a good idea to ram the enemy and detonate the warp core ripping both sides from existence. Now you have something of a 6th sense, of the “rats fleeing a sinking ship” variety. You will have warning with enough time to reach a life boat at a dead run from where you are. Furthermore, you are guaranteed that there will be a lifeboat in range that has at least 1 open spot."
200 CP,Officer of the Fleet ,Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet 1.0,"The Imperial Navy has seen to it that your regiment has its own Navy attaché. Her attitude to you is very business like and expects you to do your job as she does hers. With efficiency and speed. She despises bureaucracy and will try to get through to the brass as fast as possible. Very rare type of officer considering how much nobility and officers love to delve and fester in the byzantine system of Administratum and other Imperial offices. This will lead to faster availability of Orbital and Aerial Support. Sometimes even other ships besides the destroyer will join in carnage to support your ground activities. When you get to know her more, you will find that she likes to spend a lot of time in bars, just hanging out with lower ranked officers and soldiers and getting absolutely wasted. Along with other soldiers. In her moments of weakness, she will let out that she misses her home station that is coincidentally close to your area of operations. Will you brave Warp just to get her to see her home station once more ? If you do, your relationship promotes to something more friendly and possibly even intimate."
200 CP,PFC Peter,Warhammer 40K: Imperial Navy,"Fresh out of boot camp, with good evaluations and an eager zeal to destroy the enemies of the God Emperor of Mankind, Peter is a skilled naval trooper, trained in shipboard and void combat. He's especially good at climbing and rappelling, and always seems to know when things are about to go wrong before they do. Armed with an autogun, and a webber pistol, armored void suit, and bayonet/combat knife, he sees his faith in the Emperor as his greatest weapon. If you have the Armsman background he's in your squad, or assigned as your subordinate if you purchased rank. He is remarkably restrained in his application of force towards enlisted crew, claiming that “with great power comes great responsibility”"
200 CP,Valkyrie ,Imperial Guard - Jumpchain,"A Valkyrie is both a troop transport and a gunship. It carries enough space for a dozen men, a multi-laser, and either Hellstrike missiles (which are designed to knock out vehicles) or rocket pods (which are designed to take on groups of infantry at once)"
200 CP,Wing-man Warren,Warhammer 40K: Imperial Navy 1.02,"Warren is a hotshot, and he knows it. Already a combat ace with several kills under his belt, he pilots the same type of craft as you, (or one of your choice if you don't have a small craft,) and he and you are partners, covering each other's back, whether that's in combat, or in bars and off-duty pranks. He does have a tendency to run his mouth, which can get him and you into trouble. He also has quite a lot of superstitions and “lucky” rituals, which may work, seeing as he does seem to very lucky. If you decide to follow them, you may find that you become luckier, if you can bear with never using the 3rd stall in the lavatory, drinking rat pee with breakfast every 3rd Tuesday of the month, and other similarly bizarre or inconvenient practices."
300 CP,Cobra Class Destroyer,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Cobras are one of the smallest warp- capable ships in the imperial fleet, and also one of the fastest. They generally used as Torpedo boats. They are also relatively quick and simple to build. A Cobra has 2 weapon slots, one on the prow, (Generally holding torpedo tubes,) and one dorsal (with a macrocannon). They are 1.5km long, and .3 km abeam at the fins. They mass 5.7 megatons, and carry a crew of approximately 15,000. They have a maximum sustainable acceleration of 7.6 gravities. They carry 1 array of smaller turrets."
300 CP,Overlord Gunship,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"No matter how grand and mighty the Capitol Imperialis is, it still suffers from a few ungainly weaknesses. For one thing, the massive transport travels at a snail’s pace compared to the other land vehicle of the Imperium. And for another, if it can’t simply run over the obstacles in its path, it won’t do very well traversing more treacherous terrain on account of its size. The Overlord Gunship does not have those problems. While it may only be a fraction of the size of the Imperialis, the Overlord Gunship is still a massive beast of an aircraft. In fact, it’s so large that even Thunderhawks seem small in comparison. Whereas those aircraft can carry up to thirty Space Marines, the Overlord can carry at least eighty and it’ll still have room to spare for two Space Marine transport vehicles. But don’t think that’s all the Overlord can do. First of all, its quintuple engines make it fast enough to break into orbit while also possessing hulls armored and thick enough to perform orbital insertions with ease. And to make it even more durable, it also comes with energy shields for even more protection. It will take ruinous amounts of firepower to bring this down. And like with many other vehicles of the Imperium, the Overlord Gunship is brimming with enough weapon to kill a full company of soldiers. With its Desolator Lascannons, Melta Cannons, Heavy Bolters, its wide variety of missiles, and more, the Overlord Gunship is closer to a flying Imperial Knight than anything else. About the only question left is how you got your hands on this given that these ships, unlike most of the Imperium’s technology, are brand-spanking new."
300 CP,Ship ,"Warhammer 40,000 Jump: The Imperium","A Light Cargo ship licensed in your name, warp-capable and packing enough firepower to ward off small pirate raids.

300 CP,The Breaking Yard ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"In a desolate star system without a single planet, but filled with dense asteroid fields, lies the Breaking Yards. At first it seems like a serviceable if shabby and  run down shipyard surrounded by a field of wrecked vessels in various stages of deconstruction, and a number of macrocannon and point defense turrets to discourage pirates or debt skippers, but closer inspection reveals that there are no facilities of any kind that would allow for the construction of any of the parts that would be needed to build ships. Instead, this yard opperates by taking wrecks and stripping them of anything that might be useful or valuable. Ship components can either be sold for use elsewhere, or installed on different ships for a fee. Thiscomes with a crew of scruffy void-born laborers and technicians, and possibly a heritech as well and their only loyalty is to you. You get to take the entire star system and any upgrades with you into future jumps, where you can choose to import it, or keep it as a warehouse attachment"
400 CP,Captain Locke ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Captain Locke is a highly skilled Captain, with a penchant for disregarding or “creatively re-interpreting” her orders to allow her to do what she thinks is right & save people. This has led to her being out of favor, & she’s been unofficially promised she will never be promoted again. She comes with her own Dauntless class Light Cruiser, which she commands."
400 CP,Falchion Class,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The Falchion is a “new” class, having first been laid in 261 M41. With a mere 550 years of service, many in the Navy's senior ranks overlook it as an untried vessel in no way comparable to the venerable Sword. Still these ships are very well constructed, flexible, and (relatively) innovative. Unusually for a frigate, the Falchion carries Torpedo tubes (albeit with half the ammunition storage of a Cruiser) in addition to the 2 DorsalMacrobatteries. Originally designed as an escort for larger craft, many of the more reactionary senior officers tend to treat it as nothing more than an up-gunned heavy destroyer. Falchions are 2.2km long and .3km abeam at the fins. They mass 6.5 megatonnes and carry a crew of 27,000. They can maintain an acceleration of 4.6 gravities, and have an array of point defense turrets."
400 CP,Firestorm Class ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The Firestorm is a relatively recent design, intended to create a lance armed frigate. They can generally outrange and outgun most frigates and raiders. It carries 2 weapon slots, one dorsal and one prow (which houses the lance.) A Firestorm is 1.8 km long, and .3 km abeam at the fins. It masses approximately 6 megatons, and has an approximate crew of 25,000. A stock Firestorm's maximum sustainable acceleration is 4.4 gravities. They are defended by an array of smaller defensive turrets."
400 CP,Imperial Navy Sector Headquarters,Planetary Govenor,"A massive space station that serves as the central hub of Imperial Navy operations in the sector. It is a sprawling complex of interconnected modules and hangars that can accommodate an entire fleet of starships, along with their crew and support staff. The station is heavily fortified with layers of shields, armour, and weapon systems, and is capable of withstanding even the most powerful attacks. The station is equipped with state-of-the-art communication and sensor arrays, allowing it to monitor activity across the entire sector and quickly respond to threats. The command centre, located at the heart of the station, is staffed by the sector's most experienced and skilled naval officers, who work tirelessly to ensure the security and defence of the Imperium.The station also serves as a training ground for new naval recruits, who learn the art of space combat and strategy under the guidance of seasoned veterans. In addition to its military functions, the station also houses a variety of civilian facilities, such as markets, living quarters, and recreation centres, that cater to the needs of the station's inhabitants. Despite its imposing size and formidable arsenal, the station is a symbol of hope and security to the people of the sector, who know that the Imperial Navy is always watching over them from the vast expanse of space."
400 CP,Strategy ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Tactics are very important, but in the end, a single battle is only a single battle, no matter how glorious, and it is easy to win the battle and lose the war. The ability to see the weak points in your position, and that of your enemy, understanding how different actions will effect the course of the conflict, knowing where you can borrow forces from, what locations have to be reinforced, and which ones must, regrettably, be sacrificed, this is Strategy. You know all this, and have an instinctive feel for the flow of wars that will allow you to deduce trends, even when some of the information is hidden by the enemy. You can also share your strategy and planning perks with your subordinates, so long as you and they are engaged in a direct, specific conflict."
400 CP,Sword Class Frigate,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"When it comes to manners of combat in the void, Escorts are the Imperium’s smallest and most common vessels. Every fleet in the Imperium can count on having at least a handful of these at their disposal. And of the Escorts, the Sword Frigate is one that has been tried and tested since the first days of the Imperium. At over a kilometer and a half in length, weighing over six million tons and carrying a crew of over 25,000 souls, the Sword is a powerful and yet simple vessel used by just about every force in the Imperium, whether it be the Imperial Guard, the Space Marines, or even the Adeptus Mechanicus. As for weapons and armor, you’ll find that this vessel may just surprise you. Boasting thicker bulkheads and plenty of redundant supports and beams in its construction, the Sword can take a surprising amount of punishment, better than most of its contemporaries. And with the multitude of laser weapon batteries on its hull coupled with its two macrocannons, it’ll be able to strike back with enough firepower to make wrecks out of its fellow escorts."
400 CP,The Repair Station ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"There are a number of vessels that can no longer be reproduced due to the fallen technological standards of the Imperium. One such example of this is the Death of Defiance battleship due to the massive spinal gun that the ship possesses. This means that when these ships are damaged or destroyed it can be impossible to create a replacement, so repairing them is of the utmost importance. This is a massive mobile repair station capable of working on any vessel within the Star Wars and 40K universe. It is capable of rapidly repairing entire fleets and even performing modifications as needed to the vessels. It is not capable of constructing new vessels without blueprints however, so you may not order to produce a fleet of Gloriana class battleships if you don’t know how to do so on your own.

400 CP,Touched by the Emperor,Warhammer 40K: Imperial Navy,"The Emperor Protects! This truth is a fundamental element of the bedrock of Imperial society. And to protect, the
Emperor makes use of mortal, (& postmortal,) instruments. To those allies around you are obviously such an instrument. People will look to you for salvation when things get desperate. In addition, this negates any destiny or plot armor that would determine who will win or lose in any conflict. This is good thing, because fate will regularly draw you to pivotal events."
500 CP,Dauntless Class,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Dauntlesses are considered the eyes and ears of the fleet. They are smaller than full cruisers and can make speeds rivaling frigates, yet they have the endurance and boast the storage space to carry the fuel and supplies for long patrols. They are generally equipped with a powerful for lance battery on the Prow, in addition to a Port and Starboard weapon mount. Dauntlesses are 4.5km long and roughly .5km abeam at the fins, and mass a full 20 megatonnes. They support a crew in the region of 65,000, and can hold an acceleration of 4.3 gravities. They also have an array of defensive turrets."
600 CP,Armageddon Class,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"When the Emperor gives you Lemons, you make Lemonade” still see use in the 41st millennium. An Armageddon is built on the ruined hulk of a Lunar class cruiser, upgraded and up-gunned to take the fight back to the foe. Lunars were never designed to carry the extensive crews required, to say nothing of the upsized engines and weapons, and the thickened armor, and Armageddons are undoubtedly cramped. More than that, room that would normally be used to store supplies had to be sacrificed, and the remained has to supply the much larger crew, leading to Armageddons only being able to store 3 months worth of supplies, compared to the 6 months of most other craft. Still, their power is undeniable, and no admiral would turn them away when they are available. An Armageddon is 5km of armored might, with a beam of .8km at the fins. It masses a whole 30 megatonnes and carries over 98,000 crew. It can accelerate at 2.5 gravities, and has 2 point defense banks. It also has 1 Dorsal and 1 Prow Weapon, as well as 2 to Port and 2 Starboard."
600 CP,Dictator Class,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The Dictator class started out as a retrofit for heavily damaged Lunar cruisers, replacing the rear of the Port and Starboard weapons with landing bays. They have proved popular enough as long range anti-piracy patrol flagships that some have now been constructed from scratch. Dictators are 5.1km long and .8km abeam at the fins. They mass 29 megatonnes and have a crew of 85,000, plus approximately 15,000 pilots and support personnel. Dictators retain an acceleration of 2.5 gravities. Aside from the landing bays they have a batch of Torpedo tubes at the Prow, and a Macrobroadside to Port and starboard. They also have 3 arrays of gatling autocannons for defense against enemy fighters and torpedoes."
600 CP,Dry-dock ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"While ships of the Imperium are incredibly robust, and many repairs can be made floating in space, still there are many repairs that require the ship to be docked. This setup allows up to 4 vehicles of up to Warhammer 40k Cruise size, (but not Battlecruisers or Grand Cruisers,) to dock and be repaired, or even, over time, built from scratch. This can be integrated into a vehicle at least 6.5 kilometers in length or to a space station, or can serve as a warehouse attachment, or can float free in space. You will have to provide the crew and their living spaces yourself, as well as the materials and ship components. For those looking to get into shipbuilding, the Cobra and Iconoclast class Destroyers, Claymore class Corvette, and Lunar class Cruiser are known for being relatively simple and easy to build for their size and class, even with minimal resources and little trained labor. It’s also true that the difficulty of construction scales faster than size. Just"
600 CP,Flag Bridge ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.03,"An admiral needs a flag bridge/Central Control, and that's just what this is. It has multiple stations for specialists, and a throne in the central for the most important person: you. It's well armored, but with giant windows and a giant hololithic tank to display the battlefield. The scare can be adjusted from less than a kilometer up to a scale to incorporate multiple galaxies. The strategy game fans will be happy to hear that it shows the location and boundaries of all your lands, properties, vehicles, and forces in real time, and each one can bring up a small box with icons and text to indicate it's status and condition. This can be a Warehouse attachment, a separate property, or can by attached to any vehicle you own that is at least half a kilometer in it's longest dimension."
600 CP,Flight Deck,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Home Sweet Hangar. Of course you need to have some place to keep all your nifty small craft. This set of armored small craft can hold up to 120 vehicles up to 100 meters in length, or more for smaller vehicles, although only 60 of those may be ready an in position to launch at any one time. The hangar is armored and sealed against vacuum and environmental effects, and has a forcefield that keeps it sealed when the hangar doors are open. It also has attached storage for fuel and spare parts, attached small craft repair bay for when your fancy new craft get shot up, and lounge, recreation, simulation, training and ready room facilities. As an imported property, it also has landing fields. This can either be added to a vehicle you own that is at least half a kilometer long, or can be a property or warehouse attachment. The repair bay is large enough and well enough equipped to do full rebuilds on vehicles up to 100 meters in length."
600 CP,Impossible Pilot ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"What you can do with a small craft is, quite frankly, impossible. You can dance rings around Eldar or Drukari vehicles, even in a craft that shouldn’t be able to keep up. You can make your craft do things that are, or should be, physically impossible. Flying through a cinematic minefield is child’s play for you, and goading your enemies into shooting each other aiming at you would be a fun diversion. You aren’t invincible, but you are the very best pilot in the entire galaxy."
600 CP,Lunar Class,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Lunars form the backbone of the battlefleets. Their relatively uncomplicated design dates to or before the dawn of the Imperium, and they can be constructed at worlds that are normally incapable of building capitol ships. They generally mount an installation of Torpedo tubes in their fore slot and 2 Macrobatteries and 2 Lance Batteries, one each on Port and Starboard. Lunars are 5km long and .8km abeam, and mass about 28 megatonnes. They carry a crew averaging at 95,000, and can maintain an acceleration of 2.5 gravities, and have 2 arrays of defensive turrets."
700 CP,Avenger Class ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Avengers are the stereotypical grand cruisers, if something so absurd has actual meaning. They are simple and brutal with massive short range broadsides designed for breaking enemy lines. Given their standard tactics; IE to charge into the midst of an enemy formation and disrupt them with short range fire allowing other ships to capitalize of the confusion this creates, they are today some of the rarest of the already rare grand cruisers. Every surviving Avenger proudly bears the scars of many a desperate combat. Avengers are 7.5km long and 1.8km abeam at the fins, or at least they were at that long forgotten time when they were new. They mass about 40 megatonnes, and are crewed by more than 140,000 souls. They can sustain an acceleration of 2.2 gravities. They have 3 weapon emplacements on Port and 3 on the Starboard, and are defended by 3 arrays of point defense turrets."
700 CP,Mars Class ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The Mars class was designed as a “jack of all trades” warship, with a Dorsal Lance Battery, a Macrobroadside to Port & Starboard, Launch bays to Port & Starboard, and a Armored Prow with a Mars pattern Nova cannon, both of which are intrinsic to the design and can't be removed. They are flexible ships, but changes in naval doctrine led to Mars and most of the Imperium's major shipyard discontinuing construction in late M38. Mars are 5.4km long and .85km abeam at the fins. They mass near 33 megatonnes, and have crews exceeding 105,000. Their max sustainable acceleration is 2.3 gravities. They have 2 defensive turret arrays."
800 CP,Emperor-Class Battleship,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","A large vessel that was once used by the Legiones Astartes during the Great Crusade, it has 8 squadrons of attack craft, including interceptors and bombers, as well as a number of prow-mounted Weapons Batteries."
800 CP,Retribution Class ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The Retribution is a favorite of many Battlefleet admirals, who prefer it despite it's lack of the advanced sensors of the Emperor class for it's great abilities in direct combat. Retributions come with heavy armor and an armored rammingprow, as well as Torpedo Tubes, a Dorsal Lance Battery, and on each side 2 Mars pattern Macrobroadsides and a Landing Bay, plus 3 defensive turret arrays. They are 10.3km long and 1.2km abeam, and have a normal crew of 160,000."
900 CP,Apocalypse Class ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The Apocalypse class is one for which the knowledge of it's construction has been lost. Some believe they were designed to combat the threat of the large number of Grand Cruisers in service to the Ruinous Powers, a task at which they are quite effective. The design is also considered to be the predecessor to the Retribution class of battleships. Apocalypses are armed with a Nova Cannon and 6, yes, 6 Lance Batteries. 3 to Port and 3 Starboard. The Port and Starboard Lance batteries are Sun-hammer Lance Batteries, which have much greater range than usual. They also have a single Dorsal Macrobattery, and 3 sets of defensive turrets. Their engines are also supercharged, boosting energy production to power the lances. Apocalypses are 10.3km long and 1.1km abeam, and have a crew of 150,000."
900 CP,Emperor Class ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The Emperor class is at least as old as the Imperium itself. These combination Carrier and Flagships are venerable and proud of the tradition they exemplify. When Hive Fleet Behemoth had cornered the combined Imperial Navy and Ultramarine fleet and all seemed lost, it was an irreplaceable Emperor class that charged headfirst into the middle of the swarm and detonating it's warp engine, sucking it and most of the swarm into the eternal doom of the warp and saving trillions of lives. Emperors carry 2 Dorsal Lance batteries and 2 Landing bays and a Macrobroadside on each side. They also have a command bridge optimized for carrier operations. They also have 3 arrays of point defense turrets. Emperors are 10.4km long and 1.2km abeam., and carry 175,000 crew members."
900 CP,Nemesis Class ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Nemesises are very rare ships that some consider the apex of the Emperor design line. They are pure carriers, with
3 Landing Bays to Port and 3 to Starboard. Their only direct weapons are 2 Dorsal Macrobatteries. Nemesises are slightly more nimble than many battleships, and are intended to avoid closing where possible. Theyare 10.4km long, and 1.2km abeam, with a standard crew of 180,000. All Nemesises are ships that started their service as Emperors and then were modified to the Nemesis pattern."
900 CP,Victory Class,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.03,"Victory class battleships are an ancient design which distinguished itself during the Great Crusade. Many think it is a variant of the Retribution class, with it's macrobroadsides replaced with Lance batteries, and a Nova Cannon replacing the Torpedo tubes in an attempt to replicate the Apocalypse class. Victorys come in at 10.3km long and 1.2km abeam, and have a crew of 170,000. Like most battleships they have 3 sets of defensive turrets."
900 CP,Wayfarer Space Station,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"While the Imperium devotes a percentage of it's energy into war-making that would be frankly impossible in any other setting, civilians, or at least, non-combatants still outnumber combatants by more than 10 to 1. Wayfarer is a designation given to a broad category of small civilian deep void space station operating largely independently. Many times they are hubs of asteroid mining or gas extraction. Sometimes they are Mechanicus research stations. Some grew up out of Vox or astropathic relay stations, or watch stations along long-forgotten borders. Others are found along mostly empty stretches of major trade routes servicing traffic, or at the junctions of minor trade routes. They have extensive hydroponics decks allowing them to be self-sufficient in terms of food and air, and have multiple civitas decks, containing all the businesses and facilities of a town. Yours is a rough sphere about 5km in diameter, with 10,000 crew who's occupation is exclusively focused on the operation of the station, as well as up to 100,000 other inhabitants in various roles. It has 2 Mars pattern Macrobatteries, and a Starbreaker Lance battery. It also has 2 Landing Bays. Your station is defended by a Multiple Void Shield array and 2 sets of defensive turrets. Attached there are 6 docks that can accommodate a ship up to Cruiser size, as well as 2 drydock slips that can perform larger repairs on ships up to Light Cruiser size, or even slowly build small Transports and Raiders."
