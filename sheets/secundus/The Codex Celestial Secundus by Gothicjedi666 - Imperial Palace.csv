0 CP,Morgaine Rousseau,Planetary Governor,"A courtesan from the planet of Lascivia, exudes an air of sensuality and confidence. Her raven black hair cascades in waves down her back, and her bright green eyes sparkle with an almost ethereal glow. She wears an elegant gown of deep purple, which clings to her curves in all the right places, and her neck is adorned with a choker of sparkling diamonds. With a sultry voice and a flirtatious smile, Morgaine knows how to capture the attention of any client. She moves with a fluid grace, as if dancing to some secret rhythm that only she can hear. Her every movement is precise and deliberate, from the way she lowers herself onto a plush velvet couch to the way she sips a glass of rare Amasec. Paired with her stunning appearance and charm, Morgaine has a sharp wit and keen intellect. She is not just a pretty face, but a master of seduction, conversation, and politics. With years of training under the tutelage of the finest courtesans on Lascivia, she knows how to use her gifts to manipulate those around her and get what she wants. Underneath her cool exterior, however, Morgaine carries a deep pain. She fled a life of poverty and abuse on her home planet to become a courtesan, but the memories of her past still haunt her. Despite her success, she feels a nagging sense of guilt for using her body and her mind to please others, and she often wonders if she is truly happy or just trapped in a gilded cage."
0 CP,Honored Title,Talons of the Empire,"When a Custodes has finished being created and trained, they are given a name from Terran myth. Gods, heroes, monster slayers- this is done both tomark them as they hero they are, and to allow the nobility of Terra, from whom the Custodes are created, save face. As they fight and win battles in the Emperor’s name, impressive deeds are rewarded with impressive names. Old and storied Custodes can have dozens and dozens of names. You may select a single name to address yourself by, and anytime you do something impressive you will receive another fitting title."
0 CP,Plastic Figures,Imperium of Man,"You have received a sizable black box, one that is filled with all manner of strange, plastic figurines. They seem to depict a vast majority of the Imperium’s fighting forces, including ones resembling the Primarchs. They are fully painted, and any that are broken or destroyed will be restored within the day."
100 CP,Eye of an Emperor,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"When you are powerful enough you have to realize even the smallest action you take could have a profound impact on those under you. With this perk you have the ability to see the bigger picture. You can consider how implementing a policy would work out or how developing a manufacturing process would affect your forces. You are now hopefully better equipped to effectively run a galaxy spanning empire.
"
100 CP,Pallas Grav-Attack ,Talons of the Emperor,"Using the same anti-gravity technology as the Coronus, these fulfill the role of lightning fast tank hunters. They are most useful for reconnaissance, skirmishing, and hit and run tactics in part due to its powerful machine spirit. Nonetheless these agile skimmers are capable of stand up fights thanks to its auramite armor and flare shields. Its primary armament is a twin-linked Arachnus blaze cannon, though some are mounted with adrathic devastators instead. You may choose which of these armaments is mounted on your grav-attack for free."
100 CP,Venerable Land Raider ,Talons of the Emperor,"These battle tanks cum transports are some of the most versatile vehicles deployed by the Imperium, and the Venerable masterworks deployed by the Talons are the most potent of them. Molded from auramite and adamantine, these hyper resilient vehicles possess machine spirits of incredible potency, which are fully capable of controlling both the auto-repair protocols and imparting incredible accuracy to the weapon systems of the land raider. There exists more than one account of a venerable land raider’s bold and aggressive machine spirit wreaking bloody vengeance upon foes that have slain its crew. The land raider posses significant armaments: a twin heavy bolter, two twin lascannons, a mounted storm bolter, a hunter killer missile, and smoke launchers. There are few foes capable of enduring this fury, and fewer still capable of damaging its heavy armor."
100 CP,Coronus Grav-Carrier ,Talons of the Emperor,"These swift anti-grav skimmers are the one of the most favored forms of transport among the custodes. They are armed with hull mounted heliothermic twin-linked bolt cannons, turret mounted twin-linked Arachnus blaze cannons, and searchlights, all guided by a powerful machine spirit make sure these vehicles are capable of laying down heavy fire support for their passengers. Their anti-grav units are powerful enough to suppress charging infantry, and in conjunction with its auramite hull and flareshield they are very difficult to put down. But these are all secondary considerations compared to its use as a transport. These machines are blindingly swift, allowing Custodes to out flank their enemies with ease and to avoid counter attacks solong as this enduring vehicle still operates."
100 CP,Auric Aquilas ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Auric Aquilas is a dawneagle jetbike of exquisite craftsmanship, but that is not what truly sets it apart. Its use of forbidden archeotech is. It is swift as thought and protected by an immensely powerful golden force field. Its rider enjoys the sort of protection that would cause most tank crews to feel envy, especially when coupled with its incredible mobility."
100 CP,Gyrfalcon Jetbike,Talons of the Emperor,"The gyrfalcon pattern jetbike is one of the few models preferred by the Custodians, and it’s little wonder why. These plasma motor boosted bikes are a far hardier breed than the classes typically fielded by the Astartes, as they need to be in order to bear the Emperor’s own into battle. Large enough to be compared to a grav speeder, these swift auramite steeds mount refractor fields, and either a bolt cannon, adrathic devestator, or a twin linked las-pulser. In addition, you will be granted a lance with this jet bike, that you may strike down your enemies more personally. It will be a free melee weapon with whatever amenities you purchase from the table, or you may give it the same purchases as a melee weapon you have already used the table upon. "
100 CP,Auramite ,Talons of the Emperor,"Auramite is the golden material that the God Emperor himself uses in his personal projects. His ships, his armor, his weapons- and that of the Custodes as well. It requires rare materials to produce and is ruinously expensive- but Auramite’s incredible resilience makes the cost more than worth it. Resistant to nearly every type of energy and impact you care to name, this material has myriad uses. You will receive shipments equal to any project you care to use it for. Simply order it, and within a day it will appear, either in your warehouse or at a location of your choosing."

Your patronage has allowed these talented individuals to flourish and produce some of the most exquisite works of art, music, and literature. As a result of your patronage, you have built a vast network of talented artists, musicians, and writers who owe you their success.

Your analytical and strategic mind makes you a natural leader and decision-maker, capable of navigating complex political and economic landscapes with ease.

Not only can it store an unlimited amount of data and automatically store it in a way that’s pleasing for you, but it can interface with any technology you may run across."
100 CP,Pure Blood,Imperium of Man,"Your line has its origins stretching back since before the Imperium formed, the purity of your blood undeniable. Not only is your body cured of all imperfections, both physical and mental, as well as gaining a resistance to all illnesses and viruses, but those who share in your blood will receive similar benefits, being perfect examples of humanity."
100 CP,Look at its little legs and oversized body,Warhammer 40K -- Emperor Text to Speech - Gauntlet,"You have a suit of Centurion Power Armour, suitable for dangerous assault work where even Terminator armour isn't enough. Not only is it heavily armed and armoured, the Emperor thinks you're adorable and will give far more consideration to any suggestions you make if you wear this and sit on his knee."
200 CP,Parenting Skills,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"Managing an empire often can seem like raising a child. It requires an immense amount of work, sometimes seems like it's not worth it, and will often cause long sleepless nights. In the end though you would happily do it again when you see the result and take in those special moments. This skill both makes you a parent fit to be rewarded with a best dad or mom in the universe mug, and to help children/young organizations who are in need of guidance. Lastly please take this, we don’t need a second case of the Emperor to occur. One galaxy level set of family issues was enough to deal with. Also if you can give perks please give this to the Emperor, it will save a lot of trouble."
200 CP,Custodes,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"You join the ranks of the Custodians. The Custodes is an elite cadre of genetically-engineered transhuman warriors who are even more potent in combat than the Adeptus Astartes. They are to the Space Marines as the Emperor is to His primarchs, and it is rumoured that they were each created by the Master of Mankind personally. They are the equivalent to walking armies unless challenged by an equal"
200 CP,Training Facilities ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Emperor’s Talons are very well trained. In war and in peace, as assassins, diplomats and investigators. They are famously disciplined, deadly, and wise. Achieving this level of education and skill is no small challenge, especially on the scale necessary to match the Emperor’s aims. And so He created tools for them to achieve such highs. Hallucinariums, great labyrinths that can show impossible and terrible vistas, that they may practice against any foe in any condition imaginable are among the most simple of these. Hypno-indoctrination, to directly implant skills in a targets mind, fractal thought exercises, strategic cogitators and far, far more. This is everything you need to make the elitist of the elite of the elite soldiers and scholars by the standards of the Imperium at its height. It can also make those subjected to the curriculum absolutely loyal to any person or cause you’d care to name. You may also add or subtract from its curriculum if there’s something particular you’d like to teach."
200 CP,God-Strike Teleportarium ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Imperium’s teleportation technology is highly advanced, rare, and often unreliable. But the Godstrike Pattern used by the Talons is an even more advanced teleportarium, with few equals within the Imperium. With incredible range and reliability, these vast machines can instantly transport even super heavy vehicles in perfect safety. You may place your teleportarium upon a property, place, or ship of your choice."
200 CP,Ares Gunship ,Talons of the Emperor,"While the Custodes primary duty is the protection of the Emperor, they have marched beside Him into battle, and carried out wars in His name when He turned His gaze elsewhere. The Ares Gunship is one of the first such tools of war they used, and they earned a deadly reputation in both the Unification Wars and the early years of the Great Crusade. They have identical mobility and defensive measures as the Orion Dropship, but their weaponry is superior in exchange for a lack of room for passengers. It has two Arachnus heavy blaze cannons, two infernus firebomb clusters, and a nose mounted Arachnus magna-blaze cannon. The latter is the weapon this gunship was designed around, and the creation of a single example of this incredibly powerful and massive cannon can beggar a noble family of Terra. It is fully capable of punching through even titans, and annihilating infantry and lesser vehicles en mass."
200 CP,Caladius Grav-Tank/Annihilator,Talons of the Emperor,"The Caladius grav-tank is the mainline battle tank of the Talons, and uses the same anti-grav technology of the Coronus. Dedicating the space that normally would contain Custodes in the transport to weapons systems, the Caladius has the heaviest punch among all the vehicles of its size. Covered in heavy auramite plating, a flare shield, and possessing the same rate of machine spirit as its brothers in design, this grav-tank is incredibly swift and heavily armored. It’s armed with a hull mounted twin-linked heliothermic bolt cannon and a turret that contains either twin-linked Iliastus Accelerator canons or, more rarely, twin-linked Arachnus heavy blaze cannons. In the latter case it is called a Caladius-Annihilator."
200 CP,Emperor’s Light,Talons of the Emperor,"This misericordia is acrystallized shard of the Emperor’s aureus light, and traditionally born into battle by the Captain-General. In addition to being able to carve through armor with ease, this long fighting dagger floods the heart of its victims with the same Light it was made from, making it an object of dread to the forces of Chaos."
200 CP,Gatekeeper ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Gatekeeper is a master-crafted guardian spear, thrumming with barely contained power. This weapon is capable of an utterly freakish rate of fire, scything down the Emperor’s enemies in an utterly withering hail of bolts. But more than that, it’s machine spirit is capable of near prescient predictive targeting, allowing no escape from its wielder’s wrath."
200 CP,Auric Shackles ,Talons of the Emperor,"Created in the Dark Age of Technology, these archeotech restraints adapt themselves to the neural nets of sentient beings. The end result; even the thought of escape becomes impossible. So great is its power of suppression that hostile beings are debilitated from their mere presence. They are issued to Custodians tasked with bringing in the Imperium’s most dangerous enemies, secure in the knowledge that they will be unable to overcome them no matter how mighty they are."
200 CP,Praesidius,Talons of the Emperor,"Created by a master Terran armorer, the Praesidius was the magnum opus of a much lauded career. This storm shield is both beautiful and functional, for it is forged of auramite in so exacting a manner that each molecule is precisely where its creator planned it to be. But they did not stop at mere perfection down to the molecular level; they also labored to create a a unique network of displacer field generators within it. The result is that anything that would strike the shield is shifted harmlessly away by localized but incredibly powerful displacement fields as the network focuses all it’s power on the exact point of impact."
200 CP,Piercing Strike,Talons of the Emperor,"Armor is an important aspect of war throughout the entire galaxy. It is no mistake that every fighting force worth the name clads their soldiers in some sort of armor, and far more upon their vehicles. But few armors are without flaw, and the Custodes are adept at exploiting them. Finding the weaknesses of your enemy’s armor and body is reflexive for you, as is guiding your weapons to them. Crippling the systems of super heavy vehicles, spilling the life’s blood of terminators, spearing the sarcophagus of a dreadnought... these, and more, are all natural to you."
200 CP,Machiavellian Strategist ,Planetary Goveror,"You have an unparalleled talent for manipulating those around you and bending them to your will. You know how to use your position of power to your advantage, leveraging your wealth and influence to control the people and institutions around you. Through bribes, threats, blackmail, and other underhanded means, you always come out on top. Your network of loyal followers is vast and far-reaching, consisting of corrupt officials, unscrupulous businessmen, and ruthless enforcers. They are willing to do your bidding no matter the cost, and their loyalty to you is absolute. With their help, you can shape the world to your liking, pulling the strings behind the scenes and making the powerful dance to your tune."
200 CP,Oaths of Fealty,Imperium of Man,"For countless millennia, the people living upon your homeworld have given your line their loyalty and faith, a line that you will never sever. You will find those who swear fealty to you and your cause, or at the very least surrender to it, will rarely seek to rebel against you. It is only when pushed to their extremes that they would even entertain such treacherous thoughts."
300 CP,Emperor’s Shield ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","The personal shield of the Emperor, but now wielded by the reborn Primarch Lion El'Jonson in M42, it was somehow ensconced within the mysterious Warp-adjacent realm of Mirror-Caliban. Holding great power, the shield is able to reflect the attack of any enemy right back at them.
"
300 CP,The Watcher’s Axe and the Eagle’s Scream ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Watcher’s Axe is an immense, and immensely powerful, power axe that crackles with golden lightning. It is fully capable of bisecting dreadnoughts in a single swing. Mounted along its spine is the Eagle’s Scream, a master-crafted bolt weapon that fires adamantium-tipped penetrator bolts with spectacular accuracy, range, and with overwhelming rapidity."
300 CP,Moment Shackle,Talons of the Emperor,"The moment shackle is a relic from the Dark Age of Technology that is normally stored within the vaults beneath the Imperial Palace. This ancient device is capable of trapping moments of time and using them to slow or speed the flow of time in its immediate environs, allowing its user to avoid attacks that would normally strike them or to attack with blinding speed. It can even excise split second events from history, perhaps deleting the moment its wielder was wounded, for example. Some even claim this artifact can be used to peer into the future."
300 CP,Obliteratum ,Talons of the Emperor,"This heavy brace mounted explosive launcher makes use of several technologies forbidden to all save the Custodes upon pain of death. It fires canisters of splinterglass stuffed with heavily compressed antimatter. They shatter upon impact, erupting into night black clouds of nothingness, devouring all it touches. Nothing can withstand the Obliteratum, and nothingness is left in the wake of its fire."
300 CP,Work Staff ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,This is a large supply of NPCs and various members of the universe who are capable of filling any holes in a workforce. Each of them will be as skilled as the average worker with some occasional talents appearing. With this you will never have to be concerned about being unable to fill the buildings you produce. Also you don’t have to worry about causing any employment issues as it will draw numbers from your population before creating any if needed. All of these people will become followers and staff any business or facility you own post jump. 
400 CP,Emperor’s Sword ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Once wielded by the Emperor of Mankind himself, this finely wrought, master-crafted sword seems to be forged from gold, but is infinitely harder than that soft metal could ever be. From hilt to tip, it is engulfed with leaping flames, and when swung, the burning blade draws pyrotechnic arcs through the air to cut through armor and vehicles with ease.
"
400 CP,Administration Center,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,This is a facility designed to handle all of the administration needs of your empire and any other territories under your control. It will be fully staffed and always capable of handling whatever task you assign them. In addition as you have paid CP for this they will never have any errors. So don’t worry about accounting forgetting to crunch the extra battleships you added. While everything will be handled some things may need a signature to authorize if they’re important enough or you told them to. They will have some way of alerting you and will wait if your in the middle of intense combat. 
400 CP,Library Sanctus ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Library Sanctus is a repository of knowledge, and unlike nearly all others in the Imperium, it is completely uncensored. Within its halls you can find tomes and cogitators on myriad subjects. Upon matters of Xenos biology, culture, and technology, upon chaos, upon archeotech- here you can find references and honest information on them all. While many things are fragmentary, due to Humanity simply not ever having or managing to fully recover the knowledge, it is all accurately written, and a sufficiently clever person could piece most things together given enough time. There are a great many who would kill to have access to this hidden library- and just as many who have to make sure none do. Use its knowledge well. You will find blueprints for any item your purchase within its halls, though xenos or archeotech beyond your faction’s knowledge base will be scattered and fragmented, requiring a not inconsiderable amount of research to piece together."
400 CP,The Apollonian Spear ,Talons of the Emperor,"This spectacular guardian spear was created by, and first saw service in, the Emperor’s own hands. He wielded this deadly weapon during the long years of the unification wars, and it never failed Him. He only parted with it when the first Captain-General was granted that immense honor, granting it to his most trusted guardian. Its disruptor field is so immensely powerful that no armor may withstand it. So powerful is it that it can unmake entire enemies whole with a single well placed strike. Its haft has a hyper-velocity bolter worked into it, capable of punishing even heavily armored of foes at extreme range. So great is the force of these bolts that they often leave foes dizzy, slow, and disoriented- if they’re lucky enough to survive the initial impact. But this blade has another ability: as its edge meets flesh it will fill its wielder’s minds with revelations about those it reaves from life. This spear tells only truth, pitiless and cold. All that enemies once knew will become your knowledge in the same instant they die. Though this can be a gift, it can also be a heavy burden, to know all the life of one’s enemies. To know them as they knew themselves, and to know the imperfections which lead to their folly. Perhaps it will make you less eager to spill blood, as He once intended."
400 CP,Aegis of the Emperor ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Cellular alchemy that creates a Custodian leaves each of them forever touched by a spark of the Emperor’s own greatness. This manifests as the Emperor’s blessing. Your enemies attacks will be turned aside at the last moment. Projectiles that would have normally struck home missing by millimeters, blades that would have torn them asunder are harmlessly deflected by armor plate. Normally it is all, technically, within in the realm of possibility. But with you, the Emperor’s blessing is a palpable thing. Those attempting to harm you will suffer freak accidents. Stones turn under foot, reliable weapons jam, animals throw themselves at their faces just in time to throw off their aim. Your Sire’s will turns fate and chance against all that would harm you, though determined foes or foolhardy decisions will see this protection overcome."
400 CP,Impregnable Mind ,Talons of the Emperor,"The taint of Chaos finds no purchase in a Custodian’s mind or soul. They are taught every mnemonic and technique to resist deceit, warpcraft, and sorcery the Imperium knows of. Through the blessing of the Emperor, you are even more resistant to such things. Illusions and mind manipulations, whether they come from technique, technology, or from supernatural powers slide off of you. Sadly, this provides no benefit against more physical means, other than your completely indomitable will. A bolt of warpfire will burn you just the same, though you can ignore any pain it causes you with the contempt it deserves."
400 CP,Powerful Aristocrat ,Planetary Goveror,"You were born into a family that holds great power and influence in society, giving you significant advantages in both politics and business. You have been raised in an environment of luxury and privilege, with access to the best education and social circles that come with being a part of the upper echelons of society. Your family's long and distinguished history may have garnered a great deal of respect and recognition, making it easier for you to navigate the social and business worlds. This can also give you an edge in negotiations, as people are often eager to do business with those of noble birth. Your social status can also influence the opinions of others, as your words and decisions carry weight and can sway the opinions of those around you. Additionally, your family's wealth provides access to significant resources such as business ventures, land, and investments that can further increase your wealth."
400 CP,Courts of Nobility ,Imperium of Man,"It is not just your duty on the battlefield that you must uphold, but also the social obligations amongst high society. It is a song and dance you are well accustomed to, capable of maneuvering through the convoluted and entangled politics that would even leave a Necron somewhat impressed. It is not just moving through such an environment, but manipulating such people as well, making them come to predetermined conclusions without ever realizing that you ever had a hand in it."
600 CP,Master of Logistics,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"Many don’t realize the sheer amount of paperwork that is generated by an empire. This grows exponentially larger the greater your territory is. You, however, need not be concerned. You are a master of logistics and organization equal to if not surpassing the greatest minds of the galaxy. Even Guilliman would be impressed upon seeing how efficiently you are capable of running your territory. This will also extend to planning such as how to create the most efficient chain of supplies for a military to promote growth. "
600 CP,Gene-Lab,Talons of the Emperor,"The Imperium’s greatest strength does not lie in war machines, despite their vast power- it lies within Humanity itself. And this Lab will help you make Humanity greater still. These labs are guaranteed to produce genetic sequences and abilities without error, so long as they are properly sequenced and used upon a proper recipient, though it can be applied at any time in their lives. Even when used upon adults. This is something beyond even the personal gene-labs of the Emperor Himself. It also houses the extensive equipment needed to create new sequences and reverse engineer sequences from samples, though it will require a highly skilled user for highly advanced sequences. If you load in an improper sequence it simply won’t work- this lab has a zero percent rate of failure and an equal mortality rate in procedures. It has twenty one tubes, each of which can hold a single individual. It comes with two preloaded sequences- that of blanks, which the Imperium has never managed to successfully bring about with gene-craft, and that of Custodians. Simply shove someone into the proper station and they’ll walk out a veritable super human within a week. The lab can do the work itself once it has the proper information stored within in it, though skilled supervision can speed up even its unreal pace. You may also use your gene-lab to grow subjects from the ground up, should you desire it. A truly, spectacularly, ridiculously overpowered Gellar field is built into the lab’s center. It is inscribed with two words: NUNQUAM ITERUM. The field covers the entirety of the lab, and is guarenteed to never fail. Even should every god and daemon to ever exsist join forces in an attempt to breach it, it will hold."
600 CP,Divine Usurper ,Planetary Goveror,"Through sheer force of will and charisma, you have convinced the faithful that it is not the deity they worship, but rather you who is worthy of their devotion. Your magnetic personality and persuasive speeches can convince even the most devout of your divinity, and their prayers and worship now flow towards you instead of the deity they once believed in. You have learned to harness this incredible power, syphoning it away from the deity and channelling it into yourself. With each prayer and act of devotion, you grow stronger, and your abilities become more potent. You are a true usurper of the divine, stealing the power that rightfully belongs to another and using it to fuel your own incredible abilities. But beware of discovery, for there are those who will see you as a threat to their faith and seek to stop you at any cost. Your followers will need to be fiercely loyal and willing to fight for your cause, or else your divine reign may come to an end."
600 CP,Living Saint,Imperium of Man,"You truly shine with the light of the God-Emperor of Mankind, having been blessed with a small portion of his essence. Your very presence is anathema to all things daemonic and Chaos, burning it away in holy fire. Not only does this grant you greatly improved physicality and a saintly charisma, but the light you bear will also allow you to deliver true death unto all daemonic entities. As His holy instrument in the material plane, let none live, lest they tarnish his dreams of Mankind."
700 CP,Bucephelus ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Bucephalus was the first flagship of the Emperor, serving him during the early years of the great crusade. It was a work of martial artistry, every micro meter designed to make a warship of unsurpassed beauty and power. So massive it had its own gravity gradient, this ship flew unopposed across the galaxy, crushing all enemies of Mankind it came across."
800 CP,Imperator Somnium ,Talons of the Emperor,"The Bucephalus was finally supplanted in the late years of the Crusade, and though many thought it would never be surpassed, they were proven wrong when the Emperor created the Imperator Somnium. The Imperator Somnium, the Emperor’s Dream- it became his flagship, and it a thing of such impossible quality the name the Master of Mankind granted it is fitting. Dwarfing all other ships produced by mankind, including the massive Bucephalus, in size and firepower the Imperator Somnium is so large it can't be compared to other human ships. Only the Orbital plates of Terra itself can compare to its size. It is a massive command carrier, capable of launching fleets of space and sky superiority fighter and bomber craft, despite its terrifying main guns."
