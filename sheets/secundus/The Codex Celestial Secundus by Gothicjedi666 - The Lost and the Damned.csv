0 CP,Tools of The Trade ,Warhammer 40k Night Lords Jump,"As a slave responsible for maintaining the weapons, armor, and quarters of your demi-god masters, you naturally need the tools to do so. Having to run from room to room on the ship to fetch them is a waste of both your time, and your master's. For this reason, you get this bag /box, or any container of your choice, effectively. When you reach into the container and think of a mundane tool (a hammer, a brush, a drill, etc) you will produce it from the bag when you remove your hand. This container also holds multiple chemicals for varying things, like cleaning, paint removal, staining wood, metal, etc. These are all completely mundane, having no special effects to them beyond potentially being toxic. It also comes with the proper protective gear inside to keep you safe from said chemicals! How generous of the Chaos Gods!"

Whether moving through the shadows of a hive city, slipping past enemy patrols, or lying in wait for the perfect moment to strike, you are a phantom of Chaos.

100 CP,The Sorcerer in Spite of Himself ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","When the Space Wolves invaded Prospero, they never asked the individual Space Marines if they were guilty or not. In response to the invasion, Magnus the Red teleported his entire Legion through the Warp onto what would be known as the Planet of Sorcerers, with no one having the chance to stay behind. And when everyone else in the Legion turned to worshipping Tzeentch, well… it didn’t take the live human sacrifices to realize what might become of him if he tried backing out. This Sorcerer of the Lorehost of Apoketh warband doesn’t actually like Chaos, and if anything considers it rather horrifying… but although he does not fear death, he would very much like to avoid it, and as such has mostly gone along with the whole song and dance of worshipping Tzeentch, despite his personal feelings.
"
100 CP,Dark Knight ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Once, he believed that the Night Lords would fight for justice. After all, as brutal as Conrad Kurze was, his goal was ultimately to bring peace to Nostramo. And yet, as he served in the Legion, this Night Lord encountered atrocity after atrocity that could not be excused as merely a means to subdue a population with terror tactics. So, he began to prepare—and when the Night Lords turned to Chaos, he was ready, and was able to escape without suffering injury (and while doing some serious sabotage to the ship he was on, too).  But just because he was opposed to the Chaos didn’t mean he held loyalty to the Imperium; to the contrary, they were as bad in his eyes as Chaos. This Space Marine instead struck out on his own, fighting against tyranny and evil wherever he found it, in whatever form it took.
"
100 CP,Immortal Machine ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","The Iron Warriors have always sought the approval of Perturabo, and have never accepted that their Primarch simply does not care about them. But this warrior realized this, even back during the Great Crusade. They did not participate in the rebellion against the Emperor; instead, they bid their time, and as soon as an opportunity to escape came, took it. They took up refuge on a Hive World, gave themselves some extra cybernetics, and explained away their large form as a benefit of their bionic enhancements. They hid away the passing millennia, and even managed to learn enough of data manipulation to forge credentials for themselves and join the Machine Cult. "
100 CP,Fallen Angel,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Why did he turn from the Emperor? Even if you were to ask him, he couldn’t tell you. Maybe it was the charisma of Luther. Maybe he had believed in Chaos once. Maybe it was resentment towards the behavior of the Lion. To be honest, he doesn’t remember. But still, he loathes himself for his betrayal, even though he does not act on it. Still, he remains a potent fighter, specializing in the use of dual-wielded Bolt Pistols in combat, although he’s also a mean hand with a Chainsword.
"
100 CP,Unholy Crusader ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Exhaustion becomes foreign to you, and fatigue is a word that you only need to know of for spelling bees. You no longer tire or grow weary, be it from lack of rest or from overexertion.

100 CP,The Skulls of your Enemies ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"These skulls belong to some of the greatest foes you’ve faced throughout your jump. Primarily they act as trophies and proof of your power, though anyone that sees them will understand the might of the being they belonged to. But that doesn't do anything for you, which is when the second part will kick in. To be wearing or be in the possession of these must mean that all of them were slain by your hand. Your foes will be weakened by the intimidating knowledge and should their willpower be weak enough they may even start to flee immediately. "

200 CP,Skull Helmet,Warhammer 40K: Kill Team Chaos Vol 1 0.1,"Forged to resemble a fearsome skull, this helmet serves as both protection and a potent symbol of terror. Infused with the dark essence of Chaos, it instills an overwhelming dread in all who gaze upon it, causing weaker opponents to flee in terror at the very sight. The helmet's hollow eye sockets seem to pierce into the soul, unnerving even the stout-hearted, while the voice that resonates from within it carries an unnatural authority, compelling others to obey or falter in their resolve."
200 CP,Defiler,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Walking like some sort of daemonic crab, the Defiler's hull supports a massive turret containing a Battle Cannon, although they are also supported by a Reaper Autocannon and a Havoc Launcher.

You receive a squad of 10 Rubric Marines that are genuinely mindless, and there is not a consciousness lurking beneath the surface that is captured in unending suffering. Normally Rubric Marines would only obey Sorcerers, but those you have purchased are entirely loyal to you and only you.

"
200 CP,Daemonic Name,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","A more spiritual mutation, a Dark God has recognized you and gifted you with your own Daemon name. While this makes you vulnerable to certain abilities if anyone discovers your Daemon name, spiritual entities of all sorts will have a higher opinion of you and will treat you as one of their own, rather than as just another mortal. Furthermore, if you have powers that can empower someone by speaking their true name, your Daemon name is considered to be such whenever it would be beneficial to you.
"
200 CP,Allure of Slaanesh,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","As terrible as the Prince of Pleasure is, there’s no denying that he holds a visceral appeal. Your throat is mutated such that you can produce a siren song which draws your enemies in and damages their morale.
"
200 CP,Savior ,Warhammer 40k Night Lords Jump,"This is a Night Lord who surprisingly does not want to kill every human, or even enslave them. They are of your design, from appearance, age, and gender. They have decided to claim you as your Master, and are oddly far nicer than most other transhuman demigod Chaos worshippers would be. It wouldn't be too hard to convince them to leave your current Warband with just you."
300 CP,Witch-Eater,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","You generate an aura of retaliation against powers spawned from another dimension, such as the Warp; anyone who attempts to use such powers near you will not only find it much more difficult, but should they succeed they will experience a “blowback” effect that causes them harm.

Whenever you cast a psychic power or spell on an enemy, your attack will always penetrate their defenses and inflict damage directly upon them, ignoring barriers, armor, or wards.

The blade of the staff is the remnants of a desecrated Spear of Shadows, taken from the hands of a dying Farseer. The top of the staff features the horns of a Daemon Prince. The ""eye"" in the stone is a Stone of Hidden Truths, which reveals that which is hidden from mundane sight. The sacred fetishes of the staff contain ashes from burnt Prospero, crushed Psychneuein wings, the soulbound skull of the last Chamylidryth Prophet, and more.

"
600 CP,Drach’nyen ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","Drach'nyen currently takes the form of a Daemon Sword, but in truth it is a Daemon that is unbound to any form, nor service to any Chaos God, having been born from the very first time a living being deliberately committed murder. Currently appearing as a sword simply because that is the form that its wielder wants it to be, this weapon can rip apart reality itself where the weapon strikes, and it rips through any material without resistance. This blade can also devour the souls of those it slays.
