0 CP,Quantum prayer-book,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Bound in iron and edged with copper leaf, this tome details the structure, laws and mysteries, most
common prayers, tenets and rites of the priesthood. People who study the book, particularly those
of a scientific bent, will find it very inspiring. May or may not result in machine spirits becoming
an actual thing if the doctrine is followed by enough people in a non-40k jump. You can produce
non-respawning copies on demand to bequeath to others if you wish."
0 CP,Shrine to the Machine God,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Plasma candles and sweet incense frame this small shrine. Items blessed by the devout upon the
micro-altar feel surer in hand and swifter in use against those things anathema to the Machine God."
100 CP,Archaeology,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","All Explorators worth the name know how to run a dig. How to choose a site, how to mark, search
and lay out a site, how to carefully sift obstructions and prevent contamination of sensitive
environments. Though most of the work is performed by servitors, some tasks are too delicate even
for specialized models. Every Explorator can personally perform these tasks with both speed and
care, and most prefer to."
100 CP,Celestial Cartography,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","What the Cult seeks is millennia old, and you mastered conventional cartographic techniques long
ago. Now you study the movements of stars and tectonic plates, the shifting history of warp-routes
and the records of resource expenditures centuries past. With these data-points you may extrapolate
reasonably accurate information to determine the state of an area centuries or even millennia past.
From there you can determine the places most likely visited by a people long past and focus your
efforts upon them. When your mission encompasses entire sectors, searching blindly for a location
may take decades or even centuries of fruitless labor."
100 CP,Engine-sister,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Voluminous red robes cannot hide the curves beneath to this woman's eternal embarrassment.
Friendly and perky in conversation to both man and machine, she is torn between her desire to be
closer to the machine and her attachment to humanity. The possibly of a harmonious union between
the two has inspired her to follow you."
100 CP,Magos designation,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","You have been recognized for your mastery of a facet of the Machine God's mysteries. Choose a field of Imperial technology such as genetic manipulation, voidship construction, cybernetics or even psykana. Beyond the mere rote learning of lesser adepts you have a deep grasp of the principles that govern your field, and can reliably produce even the more uncommon expressions of your specialty. With time, effort and discretion you could even modify and improve upon your specialty as needed. Those few things beyond your full understanding can still be built and
maintained by carefully following STC blueprints."
100 CP,MIU implant,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Unlike the electro-grafts which transmit information, the mind-impulse unit is designed to transmit
somatic and sensory data between an organic mind and prepared device, usually a vehicle. It allows
for the control of a machine's functions as if they were direct extensions of the adept's body. This
model can be easily programmed to interface with any number of devices, and will allow for
seamless and intuitive control over all standard template construct patterns."
100 CP,Neuroplasticity,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Techpriests collect many implants over their long lives, but even with training and technological aid
the human mind was never designed to be altered in such ways. You are something of an outlier, as
your mind readily accepts desired modifications of any sorts. You could say that, instead of blood,
you are a universal recipient of mechanical implants, and you need never worry about the rejection
of mental or physical alterations, and you adapt to such additional quickly and easily."
100 CP,Plasma Cutter,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Easily used by hand or mechadendrite, this humble piece of archaeotech excels at the simple task it
was designed for - cutting and welding metals of almost any type and thickness, from thin wiring to
adamantium plating. It can be used as a deadly weapon in an emergency, but is awkward and
unsuited to such a role. It never seems to run out of fuel."
100 CP,Rites of Maintenance,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","While already designed to be incredibly robust, Imperial equipment inevitably requires
maintenance. You can locate and identify problems within a machine in a fraction of the time it
would take other adepts. Not knowing how a machine functions does not make fixing it any more
difficult so long as you have the proper parts, tools, and rituals to guide your hands."
100 CP,Subtle Bionics,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","From hesitance at abandoning the human form or the acquisition of high-grade miniaturized
components, there is little outward sign of your integrated cybernetics. Cables are subdermal and
woven to follow existing muscle groups, cyber-limbs are hidden beneath a layer of synth-skin, and
artificial eyes resemble the organic model closely enough that sight alone cannot recognize them as
anything but. Only large external bionics like mechadendrites are plainly visible, and the smaller
models can be hidden beneath the folds of a thick robe. While hiding the blessings of the omnissiah
would normally offend even the most emotionless magi, there are occasions where concealing one's
affiliations and abilities can be advantageous."
100 CP,Magos Psychologis ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","A recently-promoted Magos who engages in the study of the mind, they have always had a fascination with machines—the more complex, the better. But when they realized that not all machines are made of gears and cogs, their perception of  the world expanded, and they knew that the Omnissiah wanted them to study the most complex machine of all; humanity itself. But they had no interest in the viscera of the flesh, so has engaged in extensive study of the mind, recording data from both augmented and un-augmented humans, keeping track of what changes in Skitarii as brain tissue is replaced with cybernetics, and examining emotional responses, particularly of those who are supposed to be “free” of such influences in the first place. They have a particular interest in the mental functioning of those who have neurological modifications or who are otherwise artificially enhanced— or artificially reduced—compared to baseline humanity."
100 CP,Skitarii Praetorian,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","An elite, heavily-modified Skitarii warrior, they have been augmented to the point that they’re fully as large as a Space Marine, and with the combat drugs rushingthrough their system they might just beat one, too... or they would, if they weren’t so bad at acting outside of orders. Still, they’re damn near impossible to put down for good; if they ever do take serious injuries, then they’ll automatically be upgraded into a Sicarian Ruststalker, and become even more viciously dangerous. Still won’t be all that smart, however."
100 CP,The Biological Machine,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","Where the Magos Psychologis has no interest in the body, this Enginseer is actively trying to earn their promotion to Magos Biologis so that they can freely research the flesh. Everything that exists is made up of orderly systems. A machine is simply a physical system that uses power to apply forces. By this definition, the human body is simply another machine, simply a squishier one. They’ve intentionally taken the least invasive cybernetics they could find, and went out of their way to make aesthetic changes so that to a layperson, they might not appear to be in the Machine Cult at all. They want their body to be as
“normal” as possible... mostly so they can study the “abnormal” in comparison. They want to study organs, implantations, and non-cybernetic, non-genetic methods of altering the body. The power of the Adeptus Astartes is all the proof that is needed that the flesh can hold as much power as technology, they just need to find a way to apply it."
100 CP,Omnissian Axe,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","This axe is employed solely by the servants and close allies of the Adeptus Mechanicus. A holy icon of the Machine Cult, it is given to Tech-Priests and Techmarines who have shown their faith to the Machine God in battle. It is forged of the finest materials, using the secrets of tempering and power field generation, and such is the skill that goes into their make that they have no equal among other Power Weapons. However, it is not only a weapon; it also functions as a multi-tool, usable in rites of repair and construction.
"
100 CP, Artisan,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Unlike many in the machine cult who care not for appearances, your equipment and visible bionics
are shelled with precious metals and etched with devotional symbols. You have the skills and sense
of aestetics needed to add a bit of artistic flair to any object you craft, and you can choose for
objects you possess for a prolonged period of time to gain a similar improvement with no effort and
without detriment to their functions. Though seen by many in the cult as wasteful or vain this
attention to appearance can endear one to those in the higher ranks of Imperial society who value
such affectations. You may choose to suppress this perk entirely or only for specific items."
100 CP,Rite of Percussive Maintenance,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Sometimes called the “Technical Knock”. Simply, you know just how to hit a piece of machinery to cause it to work properly. This can function on any device, but is only really reliable on relatively simple or intermittent problems. On the other hand, being able to just whack a computer and have it stop flickering, rather than spending hours debugging or testing to find the one loose wire is quite helpful."
100 CP,Electoo,Planetary Govenor,"A subcutaneous tattoo that employs crystalline circuit technology to store and manipulate digital information. An inert layer of conductive material is injected beneath the skin, providing a foundation upon which the crystal circuitry stacks are built. The electoo can then be programmed to function as any form of digital control or monitoring device, and as the body assimilates the material without a trace, the electoo becomes a conduit through which the divine knowledge of the Machine God can flow. The electoo is also ideal for carrying secret messages. Information is coded, making it almost useless except to the intended recipient. Electoos carrying secret messages can be split between several people and only work when the information encoded into each is joined. An individual with an electoo need not even be aware of its presence or contents."
100 CP,Acolyte of the Machine God ,Planetary Govenor,"You have undergone the sacred ritual of initiation into the Cult Mechanicus, and are now blessed with the favour of the Machine God. Your body has been augmented with cybernetic enhancements that enhance your physical abilities and connect you more deeply to the machine spirits of the Imperium's technology. You are able to understand the sacred binary language of the machines, and hear their voices whispering their secrets to you. As part of your initiation, you have also gained a deeper understanding of the rituals and beliefs of the Cult Mechanicus. You are now able to perform the intricate ceremonies and blessings that are required to activate and maintain the technology of the Imperium, and to communicate more effectively with other members of the otherwise impermeable Mechanicus."
200 CP,"Crystal stack micro-cogitator","Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","An ancient and difficult-to-produce pattern, this implant is small enough to be fitted into the human
skull and allows for vast amounts of data storage far beyond common neurological modifications.
Each implant must be grown specifically for an individual tech-priest, and the micro-cogitator
stores information in a format unique to each mind it is linked with. Even if physically extracted or
interfaced with, it is near-impossible for outside forces to decrypt the data inside without the
owner's assistance."
200 CP,Drug Glands,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Vat-grown and gene-tailored, these artificial organs release combat drugs into your system with the
proper mental trigger. The hyper-drenalin cocktail boosts strength and reaction time, and
suppresses the feeling of pain. While the glands are also designed to filter out toxins and mitigate
the side-effects of these or any other drugs in your system, using the glands too often and too
quickly risks damage from the buildup of toxic by-products."
200 CP,Impossible precision,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Behind the mighty engines and clanking gears of Imperial armor are smaller yet no less important
components. Servicing those delicate elements requires a fine touch, and you work with steadiness
and precision. Your hands and other appendages will not twitch from surprise or adrenaline, and
they will exert the exact amount of force you desire and no more. Exactly how precisely you can
work is subject only to the limits of your perceptions."
200 CP,Unique Materials ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,Some worlds possess metals and other materials that can’t be found anywhere else in the multiverse. This option allows you to choose a material that is found throughout the multiverse and gain a small foundry that is capable of producing it. The amount produced will be equal to a 3 by 3 block annually. You may be able to speed the process up by feeding the foundry a large amount of energy.
200 CP,Imperial Knight ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k ,"The Imperial Knights are small to medium sized walkers used by forces throughout the Imperium. They are predominantly used by the so-called Knight Houses and the Freeblades. The Knights are all smaller and considered to be less dangerous than any Titans. The primary difference in the various types of Knights depends on the main armaments. You may use this option to purchase any Imperial Knight or Chaos Knight variant that you desire. Lastly these Knights will already be bonded to you, so you don’t have to perform the Ritual of Becoming to earn the respect of the machine spirit.
"
200 CP,Magos Dominus,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k ,"The Magos Dominus are the senior tech priests who command the Adeptus Mechanicus military operations and are in charge of military advancements. By taking this option you may recruit or design a companion worthy of this designation. An example of this would be Magos Dominus Kailie. She was in charge of analyzing the Republic’s fighting strength and identifying any major threats. Additionally she was more than capable of dispatching her opponents personally. Her body was forged into a feminine shape that was built to cause death by channeling the might of the Omnissiah. Literally every inch of her body was built with efficiency and perfection on a mono-molecular level. Finally she was assisted by a small army of servo skulls. Together they were capable of fighting an entire clone force. You may recruit Kailie herself or design a similar companion. Their loyalty will be towards you immense, even surpassing their belief in the Omnissiah. If you are truly opposed to a Magos Dominus then you may choose a different class of Magos as well

200 CP,Control Stave ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","More like a short rod than a staff, this is a tool and a weapon both; it can both be used as a bludgeon, and also allows its user to more easily interface with their Skitarii warriors. Yours has been further modified; while using the Control Stave, all of your followers in the current battle with you will be able to receive you orders immediately, and you can direct the actions of your followers with the precision of a surgeon."
200 CP,Electro-Priest,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","You have been inducted into the cults of the Electro-Priests, and your body prepared to channel the copious amount of electricity that is the incarnation of Motive Force in the world. You gain an immunity to electricity, and when exposed to an electrical current you will harmlessly absorb it. You can then store this holy energy in batteries or capacitors for further use. However, you also gain an additional ability depending on if you are a part of the Corpuscarii or Fulgurite cults. A Corpuscarius Electro-Priest gains the ability to channel discharges of electricity to attack others, while a Fulgurite Electro-Priest can instead absorb all of the bio-electricity from a foe they touch, stealing the energy for their own use. Regardless of which type of Electro-Priest you are, you can also charge your muscles and cybernetics with the Motive Force, allowing you to move more rapidly and strike with electrical power."
200 CP,Goliath Class Factory Ship ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Goliaths are great factory ships that devour stellar plasma to power their fuel creation processors. They are fragile and potentially explosive craft, but absolutely vital to the Imperium. Most Goliaths are property of the Adeptus Mechanicus. In addition to 2 humongous cargo holds, they are equipped with a Plasma Refinery which in addition to it's primary purpose produces extra power for the ship as long as it harvests plasma at least once a year, and a Manufactorum. Goliaths are armed with a macrobattery Port, Starboard, and Dorsal, as well as a supply of defensive turrets. They are 4.9km long and .9km abeam at the fins, and mass 16 megatonnes empty. They have a crew complement of roughly 41,000 and can maintain 1.5 gravities of acceleration."
200 CP,Upgrade Materials ,Darktide ,"750,000 plasteel and 500,000 Diamanite. This is the ‘currency’ used for upgrading equipment. Whether Hadron actually uses all of this in the upgrade process or if she’s extorting you for services... let’s be honest, it’s probably extortion, but you don’t have a lot of other options. You can find raw materials on Atoma Prime, but that’s during missions."
200 CP,Sacred Unguents,Imperial Guard - Jumpchain,"A small box of a half-dozen high quality, scented unguents. Machines seem to love being anointed with these and using them is a sure-fire way to get its machine spirit to like you more, or just forgive you for the time you rattled its delicate circuitry using it as a club. Mysteriously, when a machine is anointed with sacred unguents, it becomes near- impossible to jam for several hours."
200 CP,Mining Station ,Planetary Govenor,"This is a large space station built to extract valuable resources from the asteroids and planetary bodies in the system. It is equipped with a wide range of mining equipment, from drills and excavators to advanced processing and refining facilities. The station is staffed by a team of skilled miners, Tech-Adepts, and enginseers who work around the clock to extract and process as much ore as possible. The station is divided into several sections, including living quarters, workshops, storage facilities, and command centres. It is connected to a network of mining drones and automated vehicles that are dispatched to gather resources and bring them back to the station for processing, allowing it to extract valuable ores and minerals from the asteroids more efficiently than other mining outposts in the sector. The station's crew must always be vigilant for potential hazards, such as collisions with asteroids or pirates seeking to plunder its riches, but despite these dangers, the mining station is an essential hub of activity in the system, providing valuable resources for trade and manufacturing throughout the Imperium."
200 CP,Bio-Enhancement Implants ,Planetary Govenor,"These implants are designed to boost the user's physical abilities and improve their overall health. They can enhance strength, speed, agility, and endurance, making the user a formidable combatant on the battlefield. The implants can also improve the body's natural healing processes, allowing the user to recover from injuries faster."
200 CP,Xenoarchaeologist ,Planetary Govenor,"You possess a deep understanding and reverence for the ancient technologies of alien civilizations, despite their heretical origins. Through your extensive study of xenoarchaeology, you possess a keen eye for identifying the subtle nuances of alien artefacts and technologies, as well as the ability to interpret their functions and potential applications. Despite the heretical nature of these technologies, you are not deterred by the potential consequences of studying them. In fact, you believe that it is the duty of the faithful to explore the mysteries of the universe, regardless of their source. Through your
investigations, you have gained valuable insights into the workings of the universe and the myriad possibilities of technology that lie beyond the Imperium. Your mastery of xenoarchaeology allows you to identify and study even the most obscure and enigmatic of alien artefacts, and to harness their power for the greater glory of the Imperium. Through your unwavering faith and keen intellect, you are able to push the boundaries of knowledge and unlock the secrets of the universe, no matter how esoteric or dangerous they may be."
300 CP,STC database,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","A trove of information that elder magi would be jealous of, this cogitator core contains almost all of
the STC blueprints common known to the Mechanicus that relate to a single field of study. These
could be weapons, vehicles, cybernetics, voidship components, chemical or biological processes, or
almost anything else. The broader and more advanced the subject of the database, the fewer
complete patterns within and the more incomplete fragments that can only be puzzled over. While
there may be fragments within other fields that touch upon such, you cannot take a database
covering lost or extremely restricted information, such as the most ancient archaeotech, the
formative steps of space marine gene-seed or custodes, Grey Knight or temple assassin armaments."
300 CP,Black Widow ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","A designation from Cadian soldiers, this armored reconnaissance walker’s true name can only be spoken in the Lingua Technis.

300 CP,Conversion Field ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","A device that generates a protective energy field; when struck, this barrier converts the energy of impact into light, making a blinding flash when it stops an attack. The field can even protect against plasma blasts; however, it can only withstand so many attacks at once, so can be overloaded."
400 CP, MIU mastery,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","Connecting to a machine and controlling it directly can be difficult, even for experienced adepts. But over time, taking control of a new body with a vastly different form has become second nature for you, quickly switching between new forms and the different inputs they bring without disorientation. Hearing becomes radar. Hands become turrets. The engine, your heartbeat. Whatever information the machine provides, it will always be translated in a way that makes logical sense by the association. Through this connection, driving and piloting come easily, and it is near-impossible for irregularities in the connected systems to be hidden from you."
400 CP,Binaric Weaving,"Adeptus Mechanicus
Jumpchain v1.21","The skills gained during long years plumbing data-vaults as a humble logistican have only
improved over time. You excel at writing code, understanding machine-script better than native
grammar structures. You can understand simple programs with a mere glance and correct any errors
you find within seconds, and scrutinizing longer lines of more complex coding for a single
misplaced byte can take mere minutes with your skills. Scrapcode crashes ineffectually against
your data-barriers, its transmission doing nothing but opening the offending heretek's systems to a
counter-intrusion. Interfacing with a system infested with a daemon or true AI would be unwise,
but with your skills emerging unscathed from such an encounter is only highly unlikely rather than
completely impossible."

Everything can be measured, everything can be explained, and yet there is more to reality than the laws of the material universe. Wielding power not unlike the miracles of the Sororitas, you are perhaps a true priest of the Machine God. As your dedication and understanding grows, you will gain an increasing affinity with all things mechanical. You can sooth their woes and hasten their functions with a touch. Their wrath grows cools at your supplication, and the unrighteous who would use machines against you find them rebelling. There are many ways to influence the mechanical, and this ability will grow increasingly stronger over time if you have the dedication to discover them and the piety to fuel them."

Through the divine blessings of the Omnissiah, you have been granted the ability to perform feats of multitasking that were once considered impossible. You can seamlessly process vast amounts of data and make swift decisions with unparalleled speed and can seamlessly shift between multiple tasks, performing research and analysis even while in the midst of the most perilous of dangers. By means of your cybernetic enhancements and augmented senses, you can also form a sacred bond with the minds and senses of numerous Skitarii and Battle-Automata all at once.

By dismantling and analysing even the most complex machines and devices, you can replicate their functionality and even improve upon it. However, your talents in this area may not go unnoticed by other factions within the Cult Mechanicus. Some view the act of reverse-engineering as sacrilegious, as it challenges the divine nature of the Machine God's creations. You may face opposition from those who believe that tampering with technology is a sin, and they may even see you as a heretek and an enemy of the Cult. But as a true devotee of the Machine God, you understand that knowledge and understanding are the keys to unlocking its divine power. With your exceptional talent for reverse-engineering and the blessings of the Omnissiah, you can use your abilities to advance the goals of the Cult Mechanicus and further the will of the Machine God."

Though these rare, nigh-mythical ships are seldom brought to battle, when they do enter combat they can bring to bear nearly impenetrable defenses and weaponry whose range and firepower puts even that of Imperial battleships to shame. An Ark Mechanicus is also outfitted with industrial capabilities rivaling that of many hive cities, with kilometre upon kilometre of manufactoria, refineries, crackling Plasma Reactors and laboratories, test ranges, chemical vats and gene-bays."
600 CP,Blessed by the Machine God,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"You were specially blessed by the Omnissiah. Equipment you care for never breaks down, and functions long past what should be physically possible. You can see and feel the flow of information, whether that is traveling by wires, or wirelessly, and can even intercept it and get a sense for what is being conveyed. You are extremely skilled at building and repairing human 40k tech and you understand how to build every non-Archaeotech ship and/or small craft of the Imperium. You can also merge with machine spirits, even the massive machine spirit of an Ark Mechanicus, without losing yourself, and can even claim the dominant role in such a merging.

600 CP,Forge World,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The forge worlds are the main fortresses of the Adeptus Mechanicus. They are responsible for producing all of the equipment used by the Imperium of Man. This can range from the mass produced lasguns used by the Imperium guard all the way to the massive battleships. By purchasing this you may acquire a forge world of your very own. This world will possess I-Maximus production levels which is the highest standard of the Imperium. The world will have the capabilities to produce anything, but it will have a notable speciality. For example if your forge world specializes in producing Astartes equipment then you could easily outfit an entire chapter in full wargear in a short time, but you would only be able to produce a small amount of starships in a short time. If you were specialized in ship construction however then you could easily produce a fleet in the same amount of time. There are no bad specialties, it simply depends on what you need at the time.

Through your divine gift, you are able to identify inefficiencies and address them with ease, rooting out the most minute of defects and correcting them with precision. The machines under your care work in harmony, producing goods at an unprecedented rate that would cause lesser adepts to weep in awe. With the Omnissiah's guidance, you can oversee the production of vast quantities of goods, far surpassing quotas and meeting deadlines with ease. But your mastery over the mechanical processes of forges does not end there. You are also an expert in building the machines that build the machines, crafting the most intricate and precise devices that make possible the most efficient production of goods. Your knowledge of the inner workings of these machines is unmatched, allowing you to design and construct workflows that operate with flawless precision, maximising output and minimising waste.

Unfortunately there are a number of useful pieces of tech that don’t have STC’s or were simply lost to time. This isn’t even counting all of the tech you likely have acquired from out of jump That is where this device comes in. It has the ability to scan tech, including that from other settings, and produce incorruptible STC that will work anywhere. Plus this allows you to pass off items that would otherwise be declared heresy as knowledge of the ancients. Quite useful for becoming friends with the mechanicus as well."
