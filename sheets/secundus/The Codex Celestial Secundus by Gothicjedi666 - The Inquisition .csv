0 CP,Bread & Honey ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Despite what the people might believe, Inquisitors are still human. They still need food and drink like ordinary
men and women do. Well, most of them anyway. There’s a few of them who are... divorced from such biological
needs. But even those who have no need for sustenance can still enjoy a good meal and a good drink to wash it
down. So regardless of whether or not you need it, you have the signature dish of the Imperium. Simple, good
old-fashioned corpse-starch! And to wash it down, you have your recaff.
A few bars of corpse-starch will be enough for all your nutritional needs and a cup of recaff will be quite helpful
for all those long nights, be it fighting daemons or investigating heretics. And you don’t ever need to worry about
running out of the stuff. You’ve got a crate of corpse-starch bars that always seems to be full by the end of the day
and a caffeine box that never needs to be refilled. As for the taste, well, it tastes better than you might think but
worse than you’d hope. Still, food is food and besides, who says that you have to be the only one to eat it?"
0 CP,A Luxury You Cannot Afford,Imperial Nihlius -Jumpchain,"It is a demanding thing, to be an Inquisitor. To be an Inquisitor is to bear responsibilities that no ordinary mortal could ever hope to carry, to make decisions that many others would balk at. And yet you are certainly quite far from ordinary. Whether it be borne through simple hard-earned experience or imprinted onto you through more supernatural or technological means, you possess a certain quality that few, if any, Inquisitors are without. Like many others before you, regret and grief can be pushed down whenever necessary, ensuring that you shall not be impeded by such things when the hardest decisions must be made."
100 CP,Digital Weapon,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","A rare weapon, usually only found as a relic from the Dark Age of Technology or created by a Jokaero, these take a full-sized weapon, and reduce it in size until it is just a ring, while retaining its full power. The technology behind Digital weapons is complex beyond belief, but no matter how small they are, they will always be full effective in regards to range, power output, and every other regard the weapon may be measured by.
"
100 CP,Master Crafted Bolt Pistol,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,A Bolt Pistol is a smaller version of the Bolter in standard use by the Space Marines and other Imperial forces such as the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas and certain members of the Astra Militarum and the Imperial Navy. Purchasing this grants you a master crafted Bolt pistol. It will come with a supply of unlimited ammo and will be repaired if you somehow damage it.
100 CP,The Greater Good ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Many associate the expression “For the Greater Good” with the T’au, but it is an apt description for the Inquisition as well. Torturing innocent civilians, declaring exterminatus, or sending loyal troopers to their deaths to draw out an fearsome foe are but examples of what the Inquisition are expected to do. They must harden their hearts to perform these duties. By taking this perk you will be capable of doing this as well. You will not be haunted by guilt, horror, or sadness of any kind. You will still be capable of feeling these emotions, but they will not hamper your duties or cause you any long term damage. May you perform the duties of the God Emperor with all your might and feel no hesitation. 
"
100 CP,The Canoness ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"There are few amongst the Sisters of Battle who live long enough and prove themselves worthy of reaching this position. You however seem to have befriended one such figure. This individual is a Sororitas Canoness who wields a powerful set of Paragon Wargear. This is one of the most valuable and venerable pieces of equipment used by the Sororitas. This woman has a close relationship with you and cares for you a great deal. She could even tolerate you performing acts of heresy without trying to kill you. In addition to this she has a small group of followers made up of six Celestian Sisters. These women are her so-called daughters. They will do anything in their power to protect their Canoness and due to your relationship with her you as well. You may design the personality, appearance, and your exact relationship with each of these women as you wish.  
"
100 CP,Amethyst Eyes,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"The Imperial Guard is composed of the finest soldiers within the Imperium—often drafted from the greatest
soldiers of a world’s Planetary Defense Force—and you can find them all across the galaxy, fighting against
humanity’s countless foes, from xenos to daemons and more. Numbering in the billions, without the Imperial
Guard, the Imperium could not stand for they are the foundation upon which the Imperium wages war. After all,
if you throw enough bodies, you can fix almost any problem.
But the Imperium isn’t stupid, despite how it may seem at times. They know full well that the precision of a scalpel
is needed just as much as the brute force of a hammer. Which is why the Tempestus Scions exist. Often trained
since childhood, the Tempestus Scions are the best of the best of the Imperial Guard and as such, are tasked with
missions that ordinary Guardsmen are not trained or equipped to handle. And Lyla Kaiserin is one of them.
With a scarred yet stunningly beautiful face, Lyla has no shortage of admirers and yet, it is her eyes which are her
most striking features. In fact, once you see them, it is blindingly obvious what world she calls home. Let me give
you a hint. The planet broke before the Guard did. Yes, Lyla is one of the many Cadians who have found
themselves without a home and like many Cadians, that doesn’t stop her from continuing the good fight, no matter
how far she has to go.
As a soldier, Lyla is every bit what you would expect from the soldiers of Cadia. Fierce and brave with a foul
mouth to boot, she can field strip a las gun with her eyes closed in only half a minute and reassemble in another
thirty seconds. Although, she does have a knack for explosions, often exulting and preaching of the magnificence
of the grenade, be it a simple frag grenade or a mighty vortex bomb.
For her armaments, she comes equipped with a triple-barreled Hellgun, capable of punching through power
armor and blowing open a fist-sized hole along with it. Her sidearm is an archaeotech Plasma Pistol, one that fires
purple bolts of plasma and never overheats. But her real pride and joy is her Assault Grenade Launcher. It might
ordinarily be a single shot weapon, but she’s had it hooked up to a backpack filled with all sorts of grenades, letting
her let loose a torrent of explosions at any target in range.
And don’t think that offense is all she has. She armors herself with a suit of Kasrkin Carapace Armor and an energy
shield from House Van Saar of Necromunda. It’ll take a lot of enemy fire to bring this bad girl down. And if she
ever needs anything more than that, she’s an able hand at the wheel when it comes to most vehicles. Get her in
something like a Heavy Sentinel and she can mow down troops faster than a man can throw down a grenade."
100 CP,Exorcist Missile Tank,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Of course, while an APC can work as a poor man’s battle tank, you’ll need something more dedicated if you want
to rain fire and death onto your foes. Courtesy of the Sisters of Battle, the Exorcist Missile Tank can do just that.
One of their most revered and venerated weapons of war, each Exorcist is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. Generally
equipped with a pintle-mounted Storm Bolter and a powerful Heavy Flamer in order to defend itself, an Exorcist
is a beauty to behold on the battlefield and with the missile launcher atop, you will definitely be the center of attention. Designed after the most ostentatious and beautiful of pipe organs, the Exorcist missile launcher is capable of launching either explosive or high-incendiary missiles. With this, you’ll be wiping out enemy emplacements, squads, tanks and even aircraft in flight with a single salvo of blessed missiles. You better get good at playing the organ though. That’s how the launcher works after all. Of course, if that isn’t to your liking, you could always have the Exorcist missile launcher replaced with something more conventional. However, that’s the boring choice and the Sisters of Battle probably won’t approve of you removing one of the most important aspects of the tank."
100 CP,Grav Chutes,Planetary Govenor,"Grav chutes are a must-have for those who need to make rapid and dramatic escapes, or for those who frequently find themselves jumping from high places. The backpack-mounted devices use anti-gravity fields to slow the user's descent, allowing for safe landings even from great heights. The chutes are lightweight and easily manoeuvrable, making them ideal for use in zero-G environments as well. The user can control their descent with great precision, allowing them to land exactly where they need to be without the risk of injury."
100 CP,Escape Artist ,Planetary Govenor,"Your exceptional physical abilities, combined with quick reflexes and a sharp mind, allow you to extricate yourself from the tightest of situations with ease. You are a master of evasion, able to slip out of handcuffs, navigate through complex security systems and vanish from the sight of your enemies in the blink of an eye. With this perk, you gain enhanced agility, flexibility, and dexterity, allowing you to move quickly and gracefully in any environment. You also possess the ability to think on your feet, coming up with creative and effective solutions to any challenge that comes your way. Whether you're infiltrating an enemy stronghold or trying to evade a pursuing foe, the skills gained here will be invaluable. Additionally, this grants you proficiency in specialised equipment such as lockpicks, grappling hooks, and other tools that will help you in your escape endeavours."
100 CP,Inquisitorial Ordos,Imperium of Man,"All inquisitors are placed into different Ordos, what kind of enemy they specialize in facing against. The Ordo Malleus seek to confront the forces of Chaos, while the Ordo Xenos face more alien threats. Maybe you prefer a more obscure branch, such as the Ordo Redactus, which works to erase more troublesome events from the history books. You have been fully trained by a senior Inquisitor of an Ordo of your choosing."
100 CP,Psycannon ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"The Psycannon is the perfect bolter for any Inquisitor expecting to battle against psykers, daemons and heretics. Lined with silver and inscribed with anti-daemonic symbols, every bolt fired from a Psycannon is one impregnated with negative psychic energy. Beyond being even more damaging to those touched by the Immaterium or born from it, it shall also deliver a devastating blow to their psyches. To be struck by a Psycannon’s bolts is to find oneself frayed apart at the seams, the negative psychic energy tearing apart their mind, body and soul. It is no wonder that weapons like these are a personal favorite of many in the Ordo Malleus and the Grey Knights."
100 CP,Dialogus Advance Ria Lightsworn ,Black Crusade - Part 1,"Not all Adepta Sororitas take to the field with fire and fury. Many serve as scholars and advisors, such as this woman with striking blonde hair and eyes of ice blue. She seeks to obtain as much knowledge as possible so that she might better advise and understand where actions lead, while using her knowledge to detect even the slightest traces of corruption. Yet for all her duties, she finds it is best to wear bulky armor or thick robes anyway... being born on an Agri-World, she had access to foods most of the Imperium does not and has developed an above-average curvesome figure. She is not ashamed, but she does wish it would stop distracting those she’s trying to talk to."
100 CP,Sound of Silence,Black Crusade - Part 1,"Even though you’ve thrown your lot in with the golden light of the Imperium of Man, the Milky Way galaxy can still be a rather rough place. Entire worlds made barren and desolate, billions in destitute conditions or worse... and let’s not talk about how even other members of the Imperium might decide that might makes right and attempt to practice it on you with any resistance branding you a heretic. The horrors these can all bring would drive lesser men to ruin. But you’re not 'lesser', and you’ve gained a resistance to being broken by these atrocities. You’re not ignoring them, but you can acknowledge the reality of the situation without the weight of its existence crushing you or driving you to do unsavory things to avoid being in the same position. In the grimdark future, you’re a comfortable shade of grey."
100 CP,Beginner’s Luck,Black Crusade - Part 1,"To survive, you must be able to adapt. In order to adapt, you must be able to learn. The Imperium of Man frowns on the common man learning too much and getting seduced by the powers of Chaos, but you? Learning is your gig. Skills you never knew before, you can now pick up with alarming speed to get a suitable level of competence with it. This won’t instantly make you a master, but it can make you on average quite quickly... enough for you to take that skill and work on it yourself the rest of the way, and enough to learn how to demonstrate proper etiquette for a social gathering at the governor’s palace the very next night, for example."
100 CP,Aesthetical Integrity ,Black Crusade - Part 1,"If there’s one thing you’ve likely noticed about the forces of Man... it’s that they really like their odd aesthetics. Lots of skulls and eagles, lots of black and gold, the kind of thing that looks badass and divine but by all rights shouldn’t be functioning. Why not join in on the fun and pick this up? This option will let you change up the design of your weapons and armor, putting on eagles or gothic-looking appearances, or even just embellished designs and  aesthetics in general while suffering no loss of effectiveness. Demonstrate your loyalty to the God-Emperor and all of Man!"
100 CP,Guiding Pen,Black Crusade - Part 1,"Though the complexity of Mankind’s mind has bore eternal fruits of purpose and progress, there are those who would use it for squabbling and factionalism. After all, riches and spoils of war have caused Man to slay their own kind when blinded by short-sighted goals and empty dreams of power. But you know better, and through your will they will know better too. You can more easily coax factions that dislike each other to working towards a common goal, or even encourage two hated rivals to put aside their differences for this one strike. It’s not a permanent solution, but all roads must start somewhere."
200 CP,Juvenat Treatments,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,Rejuvenats are a type of treatment used by the Imperium for the extension of mortal life. While they are effective at greatly expanding one&#39;s life. This can be used to extend an individuals life for hundreds of years. Perhaps you have proven yourself a valuable officer since you acquired this. Many notable officers are given these treatments so that their service will continue. You will receive enough of the treatment to supply a dozen individuals. In addition you will receive the formula needed to create the treatment.
200 CP,Drop Shuttle ,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,"You have come into the possession of a personal aircraft. This is a small ship mainly designed to ferry personnel to and from larger ships such as the transports. It is a space capable vessel and is heavily armored. By default this will be an Argus Lighter, but you may choose another similar ship such as the Aquila Lander."
200 CP,Modified Power Armor,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,This is a set of modified power armor for your use. Power armor is a set of enhanced mechanical armor that greatly enhances the users strength and resistance. By default females receive modified Sororitas Armor like Amberely Vail and Males receive smaller Space Marine armor that has been scaled down similar to the Neophytes. Alternatively you may purchase this twice to receive both sets of armor.
200 CP,A Deadly Rose,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,The normal image you have of an Inquisitor is likely that of an intimidating figure constantly scowling and filled with paranoia. Amberley Vail is quite different from this most of the time. She is a remarkably beautiful and intimidating woman. She earns the admiration and fear of those who meet her in equal measure. You share this quality with her. Your appearance is greatly improved and you possess an intimidating aura. Even veteran members of the guard know to not arouse your wrath.
200 CP,Twins They Were,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Where would the Imperium be without the Ecclesiarchy and where would the Ecclesiarchy be without the Adepta Sororitas? Since the Age of Apostasy, they’ve been a common sight across the Imperium, their presence serving to bolster the faith and courage of the common man. Of course, they also serve as able deterrents to any who would dare to rebel against the Imperium. The sight of a Sister blowing a man to shreds with a bolter or watching the men they burn with their Flamers scream in agony as their flesh sloughs away helps people change their minds rather quickly. But let’s not fret about the Sisters of Battle and instead focus on your companion. Or to be more accurate, companions. That’s right, for the price of one, you get two! No older than twenty-five, these two Sisters—Eliana and Soriana Illumoise—were originally supposed to be stationed on Sepheris Secundus but with the opening of the Cicatrix Maledictum, approaching the planet became a nigh-impossibility and as such, they’ve decided that sticking with you is the best option they have. As for their appearances, they’re about what you might expect out of one of the Adepta Sororitas. Both of them are astonishingly beautiful, bearing flawless faces framed by their natural snow-white hair and with bodies that seemed to have been sculpted by the Emperor Himself. They have no trouble turning heads and more than once has a sinner repented upon seeing their visage. But for personality, the two of them could not be more different. For one thing, both of them specialize in entirely different branches of the Sororitas. Eliana is a Sister of Battle and perhaps one of their fiercest soldiers. In battle, she shows her fervor and zealotry to the Imperium with her proclivity towards fire, burning all those in her path. Soriana on the other hand, is part of the Orders Dialogus, and her knowledge and diplomatic skills lets her translate all but the most encrypted of texts and keep peace between even the most different sects of the Imperium. Naturally, this also means that they also wield different equipment. Eliana wades into battle clad in the standard of power armor of the Sisters of Battle, along with a Rosarius to further protect herself. For weapons, she wields an Infernus Pistol, a Godwy-De’az Pattern Boltgun combined with a Hand Flamer, and a vicious two-handed Chainsword that she wields with but a single hand. On the other hand, her sister armors herself with special Sororitas Carapace Armor, complete with a Rosarius, and wields an ornate Bolt Pistol alongside a powerful Null Rod for use against daemons and psykers. And yet, despite all their differences, the two of them are more like than even they realize. With their loyalty to humanity and their faith in the Emperor, the twins are the pinnacle of what humanity should be. And their faith has been more than rewarded. Their faith is of such strength that they become capable of great feats that some would say they were psykers or for those more foolish, witches."
200 CP,Inquisitorial Black Ship,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Not to be confused with the Black Ships meant to stow away Psykers for the journey to Holy Terra, Inquisitorial
Black Ships are instead ships made by Inquisitors, for Inquisitors. Borne from a desire to not become reliant on
the Imperial Navy or the Space Marines, the Black Ships of the Inquisition are in fact quite old, with their presence
having been noted as far back as the Horus Heresy. Painted entirely black, and running without lights, a Black
Ships makes for a rather secretive and spacious vessel, perfect for any Inquisitor.
As for its armaments and armor, you won’t be disappointed. Built as a combination between a Strike Cruiser and
a Navy Battlecruiser, the Black Ship is somewhere around four kilometers long, weighing in at twenty-six million
tons, and carries a crew of almost 90,000 bodies. And with its size comes room for plenty of weapons. From a
Bombardment Cannon to port weapons batteries, and torpedoes, there’s no shortage of tools to let the Black Ship
annihilate the forces of your enemies."
200 CP,Liber Heresius,Imperium of Man,"An artifact tome first laid down during the Age of Apostasy that has grown to contain the wisdom of thousands of Ordo Hereticus Inquisitors. By properly interrogating its pages, the reader can gain wisdom that enables them to predict and counter the strategies of renegades and traitors before their schemes come to fruition. Over the centuries, the Liber Heresius has become incredibly unwieldy, as each new wielder scribbles his own notes into its margins."
200 CP,Sanctioned Psyker Boone & Commissar Raege,Black Crusade - Part 1,"Originally the daughter of a noble on a relatively important planet, Boone was originally meant to be taken by the Black Ships in order to be fed into the Golden Throne. Thanks to paperwork shifting, she was instead taken to be trained as a Sanctioned Psyker in the Imperial Guard. Since then she has tried her best to fulfill her duties as a personal assistant and as the company Psyker, with varying degrees of success. Her superior, the dreaded Commissar Raege, is by contrast an exceptionally skilled fighter who is just as good at leading her troops into battle. She’s quite skilled at channeling her anger, and is more protective of Boone than she would like to let on despite her hatred of all other psykers. It’s safe to say the both of them have issues despite working well together."
200 CP,Common Sense,Black Crusade - Part 1,"Why is this an option, you ask? Well, I’m sure you’ve heard so many stories on how common sense... isn’t common. With the closed-minded nature of the Ecclesiarchy and the Inquisition it can lead to many becoming dogmatic, fanatical or just plain assholes. Which means it’s up to someone to keep them in line. I’m not saying you don’t have it, but picking this up will bolster that common sense while giving you the mannerisms and skills to articulate yourself to others so they can understand the advantages of thinking and acting rationally. Yes, sometimes sanity does have its advantages. As a result, your mind is also significantly less likely to be open to the influence of others’ charisma, by the simple reasoning of looking at their ideas and realizing just how stupid it sounds. If you willingly give into those things... well, that’s on you."
200 CP,Cleansing Rounds ,Black Crusade - Part 1,"Though the power and determination of Man is what will see their destiny achieved in the end, the unfortunate truth is that not every person is initially strong enough to do what needs to be done. They can be torn asunder and shredded like a farm animal by those who consider them as such. You cannot let this happen. You will not let it happen. With this, you have learned a powerful ritual to bless and consecrate various forms of ammunition so that it deals significantly greater damage against the unholy and the corruptive while being very painful. There is no punishment too great for those who would tempt Man."
200 CP,Not Done Yet,Black Crusade - Part 1,"The enemies of Man would call them craven and weak, unable to fight for what they believe in as a mere being of flesh. The Emperor knew better, for if Man fought for what was truly his then there was no force that will keep them from their goal. However, there is no shame in helping them along or giving strength to their convictions. Just from fighting near you, your forces will find their healing noticeably accelerated as their wounds knit and allow them to keep going. Yet for lethal strikes... should they find themselves on death’s door, they will find inner strength for one last attack. One great push that will come with the strength of ten before they finally give. In death they will find peace, but that does not mean they will go alone."
200 CP,Legion of the Damned,Black Crusade - Part 1,"Even in death, there are those who continue to look out for Man’s benefit. When all hope is lost and it feels as though the darkest hour is upon them, there is a brotherhood of vengeance and flame that will refuse to let this come to pass. A brotherhood made from those who perished. With this, they will find your forces. They will follow them, and only in their most dire moment they will arrive in holy flame and do what they can to save as many as possible. They are said to be wraiths or ghosts. But you know better. You know they are the will of Man made manifest. They are what happens when Man refuses to"
300 CP,Stormcaller Stave,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Nestled deep within the Segmentum Solar, the Hive World of Necromunda serves as one of the most industrious planets within the Imperium, even when compared by the standards of the Forge Worlds. There are few regiments of the Imperial Guard who have not had the honor of laying their hands upon the works of Necromunda. But for as many weapons of war are produced by the countless factories within the hive cities of the world, there are an equal number of riches and archaeotech relics hidden within the vast and labyrinthian hives and wastelands covering the surface of the planet. The Stormcaller Stave is one such relic. Most often utilized by the shamanic Wy’tari of Necromunda’s Ash Waste Nomads, this stave is responsible for their ability to conjure up and control the dust storms that plague the wastes beyond the hive cities of Necromunda. And now, so can you. With this staff in hand, you will be able to conjure up storms of your own, storms of ash and dust, of thunder and rain, storms that can encompass an entire village in seconds at best and minutes at worst. Finally, should you possess psychic powers, the storms you conjure can become far greater, enveloping cities in their entirety, and even making them unnatural. Something like a rain of fire or a storm of blood is not out of the question."
300 CP,Chronal Energizer,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"So incredibly rare, this device and those like it are so very rarely seen in the hands of even the most powerful and extravagant of the Imperium’s servants, be they Rogue Trader or Inquisitor, taking years or even decades of dedicated searching in order to obtain one. Taking the form of black tetrahedron enveloped with unfathomable runes and dark green circuitry, its unassuming size, no larger than a man’s hand, belies its true potential. Twist the top and you will see it for yourself. Once activated, the world itself takes on an eldritch and emerald glow as all things besides you slow to a crawl and you find yourself vibrating out of tune with the material realm. In doing so, all others shall see you as little more than a blurred image, like you were a mirage of some sort. With this, you’ll be able to move fast enough to make even one of the Eldar look slow but do be careful. While the device you have is free of the more horrific consequences—namely, being scattered into other dimensions or forever left unable to interact with the physical side of reality—it still afflicts you with terrible fatigue after its effects wear off, usually after a minute or so."
300 CP,Vortex Grenades ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"If this doesn’t scream dangerous, perhaps you should get your senses checked. Unlike regular grenades, these devices utilize complex and intricate warp technology to function, technology dating back to before the Age of Strife. Upon detonation, these grenades burst open a rift—a vortex, if you will—between real space and the Warp. These rifts often resemble what we know of as a black hole and it acts like one. All things within the rift shall be drawn into the warp, ripped apart until they become part of it and only the mightiest shall be spared of this terrible fate. You do not want to be anywhere near these when they go off. Fittingly enough, owing to the nature of their creation, vortex grenades are astronomically rare. They are manufactured only in small quantities by the Adeptus Mechanicus and found only within the hands of the Imperium’s greatest agents and assets. Use these well and use them wisely."
300 CP,Silence Falls,Black Crusade - Part 1,"There was once an order called the Sisters of Silence. Granted they are still present, but they were as respected as they were feared, considered wraiths that could find corruption no matter how deep it was. They were so sacred as to unsettle Ork savagery and bring existential horror to the Eldar. In essence, they were Untouchable. ...and whether it is because you trained under them or found some manner of their texts, you may be as such too. Psyker abilities not only wash over you like water in all but the strongest cases, but also a hazard around you, being actively interfered with should you will it. Divinations fail, mind probes go blank, and more. Rejoice, for the howls of the Warp will be empty words. For the purposes of this ability, you do not have the downsides of being a Blank."
300 CP,Ode to Mankind ,Black Crusade - Part 1,"For ten thousand years, the Emperor has been sitting upon the Golden Throne. Ten thousand years, he has suffered and waited, trapped in a living nightmare. Many say he no longer has strength. They would be wrong. He has seen your coming, and he has saved a minute portion of strength should you choose to accept it. It would be an arduous process, and you would never be the same again. Yet... it could help you survive. Better, it could help turn the tide of battle. For so long he has taken. Now he shall give. It’s a tiny piece. The barest sliver of his own soul. Yet in taking it, you shall find yourself changing.
Your soul shall grow stronger and greater, and on demand you could give off a brilliant light that would burn corruption itself away. Your voice would carry the weight of age and wisdom, causing many to believe that you know what you speak of. Even your very mind would change, allowing you clairvoyance into important events in the future that can be shared with  thers. Events so real it’s as if you were there. Who knows if more would occur over time, but in doing this you are almost like... it would be a strain to use the term ‘family’, but considering his situation it is clear you would be seen as one of his  avored agents."
300 CP,Sanguinor’s Legacy,Black Crusade - Part 1,"Legend has it that the Sanguinor is a manifestation of the Primarch Sanguinius’ better nature and honor, the part that kept his inner darkness in check that was free to roam after his death at the hands of Horus. Others believe that he is the original founder of the Sanguinary Guard, kept alive by the divine will of the Emperor. The real answer may lie somewhere in the middle, an answer that will need to be riddled with this strange warp-entity that has begun to appear in your forces. Appearing only in dire need to both your forces and your goals, this entity embodies the noble nature and desirable traits that your own forces see in you. This entity also represents the combat prowess others believe you possess, fighting with such fervor that some say it could make the impossible a possibility. It is hard to say. Yet if Man’s hope and wishes for a brighter future could make this, there may be a possibility after all."
400 CP,Supply Caches ,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,"When you are stuck in the trenches or whatever terrain you are currently holding you probably aren’t going to get the opportunity to resupply. Luckily your predecessors already dealt with this. It would appear that every large battlefield you enter is filled with various supply caches scattered throughout the area. This doesn’t guarantee that there will be anything good, but you will never have to worry about ammo or food with these. Who knows you may get lucky every now and then and stumble upon a forgotten tank as well."
400 CP,Null Rod ,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,"A Null Rod is an anti-psyker Power Weapon employed by the Grey Knights and the agents of the Inquisition. This obsidian rod perpetually crackles with anti-psychic energy, nullifying the Warp-spawned powers of psykers. Even a glancing blow from such a weapon can provoke a cataclysmic neuron failure in a sorcerer or mystic, leading to instant death. Your rod shall be enhanced so that it is unnecessary for its energy to be discharged. This rod will be effective on any spiritual entity in addition to the psyker or warp based opponents."
400 CP,A Thousand Faces ,Ciaphas Cain: Hero of the Imperium V1,"Amberley Vail seems to actively jump between persona’s depending on the situation. For example at various times in her career, she has played a cabaret singer, a vapid aristocratic scion, and even a Corporal of the Valhallan 597th. You share this mastery over acting. Even a member of the Alpha Legion would be impressed by your mastery over disguise and mystique."
400 CP,Prison Complex ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Deep within the bowels of one of the Imperial ships orbiting Axum the Inquisitor Tahr Whyer built a hidden prison complex to hold some of the most feared enemies in the Imperium such as Iskandar Khayon of the Black Legion. This is a prison designed to hold any being. This prison will provide you with any tools needed to hold someone perfectly as long as you are capable of imprisoning them within. This prison will come fully staffed with guards and security systems to handle any prisoner. For example if you held psykers here then you would find that some Sisters of Silence would appear in your services. Lastly you will find that no one will be able to break into this prison unless you bring them in willingly.
"
400 CP,Inquisitorial Training,Planetary Govenor,"You have undergone rigorous training at the hands of the Inquisition, which has equipped you with advanced combat and investigative skills. Your combat training includes proficiency in both close and ranged combat, as well as knowledge of various weapons and tactics. In addition, you have been trained in investigation techniques, such as crime scene analysis, interrogation, and covert operations.
