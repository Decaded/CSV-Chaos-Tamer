0 CP,Holo-Wafers,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Ordinarily, holo-wafers are nothing more than novelty items that find use as bargaining chips, badges, crest displayers, signal markers—anything that a common card or small sign could be used for—save for its pleasing projected hololithic image. But in the underworld, a holo-wafer serves as the “marques” of assassins and hitmen, a signal to many that a death was no mere murder. For you, these holo-wafers carry your symbol. Leave them behind a corpse and the people shall know that it was you who was responsible for the act. Watch as your reputation spreads across entire Sectors with but a well-timed death. A reputation is a powerful thing but do remember that it brings its own complications with it. Strangely, you’ll find that you always have one of these wafers whenever you reach into your pockets."
0 CP,Purity Within,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","An assassin must undergo annual brainwashing sessions to reinforce their absolute loyalty. But you certainly didn’t start Jumping just to end up somebody else’s mind-controlled puppet, so by taking this perk rest assured that you are immunized against this and all other forms of brainwashing and mind control. Also, for the duration of this jump your superiors will fail to notice that you’re not actually brainwashed unless you actually disobey a direct order where they can see it."
0 CP,Psycho-Conditioning,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Assassins do not pick their targets, they are mere bullets fired at the Imperium’s foes. Your mind is strengthened to withstand the rigors of combat and cold-blooded murder, allowing you to act without hesitation, fear, or guilt when you deem it necessary. It also hardens you against trauma. This does not significantly alter your sense of ethics."
0 CP,Assassin Training,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Over 90% of Assassin recruits die on the trip to Terra, between short rations and intensive training in lightless spaces, heavy grav, zero-g, etc. Those that survive can begin their real training, which includes a fairly comprehensive curriculum in Imperial technology, history, philosophy and art and a physical program that- well, just read the page quote above. You are without a doubt one of the most capable mortal humans in the 40K universe."
0 CP,Omni-Scope,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Not truly a weapon but rather an attachment for one. Or to be more accurate, attachments if the crate you have now is any indication. Found mostly in the hands of legendary assassins and famed bounty hunters on account of its rarity and value, this should prove useful to you. Composed of several finely tuned sensors wands linked to a precision lens, the Omni-Scope is, in essence, a combination attachment with all the benefits of a preysense sight, a red dot laser sight, and a telescopic sight. With all these at your disposal, your foes could be hidden ten miles away in a fortified bunker and you’d still be able to put them down like the mongrels they are."
0 CP,Sympatic Dataspikes,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"You know, regardless of your opinions on them, you have to admit that the Imperium’s Assassins have some of the best and finest equipment possible. Just look at these if you want an example. A pair of wrist-mounted, retractable spikes, these aren’t really meant to primarily be used as weapons. Oh, they’re very good at letting you punch through the weak spots of foes clad in armor, but that’s not their main use. Rather, you’re meant to jam these things within cogitators and machines, allowing you to either siphon off information or inject rather damaging scrap-code into their systems. This is especially handy if you’re planning on fighting hereteks or members of the Dark Mechanicum."
100 CP,Imperial Assassination Force,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The assassins primarily operate alone, but they unite together to combat more dangerous targets. This is a group of a dozen Imperial Assassins that belong to the various orders. Each time you purchase this you may create a dozen assassins that will serve alongside you. You could choose to receive assassins from a single order or you could choose two members from each of the six orders. Each of them will have been trained since they were young to fight alongside each other and to serve you. They will strike against any foe you send them against and they will not stop until they have fallen. It is less important for the assassins, but you may still customize the appearance, personality, and species of these assassins.
"
100 CP,Charnabal Sabre ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","An elegant and deadly weapon dating back to the ancient dueling societies and assassin cults on Terra during the Age of Strife, the Charnabal Sabre is press-folded and stamped many times over before being micro-serrated with a sharp edge. These weapons are so finely made that they can clash with Power Weapons without being destroyed, and sharp enough to pierce armor. They are extremely lightweight for their strength, being a tool of speed and finesse rather than brute force.
"
100 CP,Polymorphine Compatibility,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Compatibility with the shapeshifting drug is on a scale, after all. You just happen to be highly compatible, enough to change your gender and even apparent body mass, to an extent."
100 CP,Against Foreign Agents,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins",The very first modifications made to an Eversor are to enhance their immune system to survive the rigors and toxicity of their own combat drugs. You never get sick and negative side effects or addiction from combat drugs are unknown to you.
100 CP,Spy Mask,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","A mask which inserts neural jacks to upload information directly into your mind. Can monitor temperature, wind conditions, thermal imaging and basic psychic disturbances."
100 CP,Stock ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","You have a satchel of poisons, antidotes and ingredients, enough to kill a large town, that restocks weekly."
100 CP,Psyber Eagle ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","A two-headed cyborg eagle that can relay to you all it says and hears, via a handy implant. Can also enhance psyker powers."
100 CP,Combat Drugs,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","A bag with all the chemical enhancement for fighting you could ever want and more. Psychon, ‘Slaught, Reflex, Barrage, Fury- hope you took the immunity to side-effects perk. Even got some of the good Dark Eldar stuff in here. Refills weekly."
100 CP,Polymorphine ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins",An unlimited supply of the shapeshifting drug needed to be truly Callidus.
100 CP,Synskin ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","An assassin needs to be able to move, so this armor was developed that is actually spray-painted on. Provides better protection that most carapace armor, and even some strength enhancement."
100 CP,Poisoned Blades ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Envenomed stiletto knives, the last resort of an assassin in melee, and extremely effective if you can find an eyehole or chink in even powered armor."
100 CP,Love on the Battlefield ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"The relationship between the Vindicare Assassin LIIVI and the Farseer Taldeer was not something many imagined possible. Despite that, this couple are a formidable duo capable of great feats. LIIVI is obviously a terrifying assassin, having been trained as a Vindicare, and Taldeer is an Eldar Farseer with all the power implied. This purchase will allow you to take them with you. Maybe you’ll give them a chance to relax, now that the entire galaxy isn’t trying to kill them even more than normal."
100 CP,Stealth,Talons of the Emperor,"Noise is a near inevitable part of violence- but it’s not always desired. In ambushes, in assassination, in infiltration, unnecessary noise can be the difference between life and death. And even more importantly, the difference between success and failure. And so these modifications were designed to make sure that death was both swift and subtle. Your weapon makes no noise when fired, and it has no muzzle flash. If it’s an energy weapon, then it’s visible signature will be both vastly minimized and be entirely outside of the visible spectrum of light."
100 CP,Holo-Wafers,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Ordinarily, holo-wafers are nothing more than novelty items that find use as bargaining chips, badges, crest displayers, signal markers—anything that a common card or small sign could be used for—save for its pleasing projected hololithic image. But in the underworld, a holo-wafer serves as the “marques” of assassins and hitmen, a signal to many that a death was no mere murder. For you, these holo-wafers carry your symbol.

A reputation is a powerful thing but do remember that it brings its own complications with it. Strangely, you’ll find that you always have one of these wafers whenever you reach into your pockets."
100 CP,Poison Globes ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Every good Inquisitor should know that brute force isn’t the only way to kill an enemy. After all, why waste all your time pumping bullets and bolts into your foes when a single dose of poison can kill them far faster? So, by following in the footsteps of the Venenum Temple and their assassins, you’ve gotten your hands on their own Poison Globes. Filled with crystalline shards, these grenades disperse a rather potent gaseous neurotoxin strong enough to debilitate, if not outright kill, almost every foe you might encounter. Not too useful on those wearing power armor unfortunately."
200 CP,Unbound,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","An Assassin’s life is strictly monitored and regimented, heck, an Eversor is put into stasis between missions. But every now and then an Assassin- usually of the Vanus Clade-earns the trust of the Senate and is allowed to wander the galaxy and follow their own judgement in picking targets, as long as they check in with Holy Terra annually. You now enjoy such freedom, and in future Jumps your superiors are far more likely to trust you  with extended missions and detached duty, and less likely to set you on onerous tasks."
200 CP,Mother Gullet,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","When Planetary Governor Thygmus van Spracht turned rebel, a Callidus assassin was sent to abduct his infant heir. Impersonating a nurse, the assassin distended their jaw, swallowed the babe whole and walked right out before regurgitating the baby, screaming, but safe. A week after seeing the footage, van Spracht surrendered. You can likewise rearrange your innards, either to hide surprisingly large objects inside, or fake death by getting stabbed where your heart and kidneys no longer reside."
200 CP,The Blinded Seer,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","When a Culexus assassin was dispatched to finally end the schemes of the infamous Lithandros-Esmanthil of Saim-Hann, the Farseer could see his end but not the cause. For weeks he struggled frantically to find an escape from his fate before he exhausted himself and finally lay down to accept his gruesome end. Like that nameless assassin, you know how best to evoke a terror in your target that causes them to flail about in panic and waste their strength and resources before you administer the coup de grace."
200 CP,Lobo Implant & Cortex Upgrades,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","You control your own body, completely. Every muscle, you can twitch individually, you can make your own heart race, slow or stop and control your metabolism to enter a deep hibernation. You are extremely aware of your own body, and any damage or alteration is immediately apparent, though you can shut down your pain response. Finally, the Lobo Implant increases hatred. Should you wish, you can focus your wrath on a target so you will spend every waking moment thinking on or working towards their demise and then just switch off any time you want."
200 CP,Cryptocrat ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","None have mastered the art of code-making and code-breaking like the Vanus Clade. It is a rare cipher indeed that can keep you out for more than an hour or so, and your own codes baffle enemy efforts."
200 CP,Exitus Weapons,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","The very finest sniper-rifle Imperial technology can produce, with the range to hit targets over the horizon, and the force to pierce Terminator armor, and the ability to fire with total silence. Has a pistol with rather less range, but a superior rate of fire and similar penetration and silence, in case you get cornered."
200 CP,Needler,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins",A discreet pistol that fires tiny needles of crystalized poison or drugs that dissolve near instantly in blood and leave no puncture mark. Pretty worthless against even basic armor though.
200 CP,Executioner Pistol ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","An overpowered bolt pistol with a needler attachment, allowing you to fire whichever projectile makes the most sense."
200 CP,Psyk-Out Grenades,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Grenades enhanced with dust from the Golden Throne. Can banish most daemons and weaken the Greater ones, interrupt warpcraft and sever psykers from their powers for hours or days."
200 CP,Neural Shredder,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","A rare and poorly understood weapon, this pistol fires an invisible wave of EM energy that passes through any armor or wall, but disrupts nerves, causing seizures, unconsciousness or death, depending on setting."
200 CP,The Stargazer’s Demise,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Progressive astrologer Lenas Scard discovered many truths running contrary to the Imperial Creed in his studies of the heavens, and was marked for death before his heresy could spread. Erasmus Menst of the Vindicare Temple climbed the highest spire of the hive and waited for the telltale glint of light off a lens, before shooting the astrologer through the telescope and through his eye. Like Menst, you are incredibly perceptive and can pull off an amazing snap-shot given just a fraction of a second’s window of opportunity. Any shot that you previously could have made with lengthy aiming, you can now make as an instant reflexive action."
200 CP,Master of Poisons ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"You are an expert when it comes to dealing with poison and venom. Well essentially any mixture that's designed to cause pain and death. You are so renowned for the suffering you can cause that even the Dark Eldar would essentially roll out the red carpet for you. As a side effect you are also the greatest master of antidotes and curing these ailments in the galaxy. After all, the only difference between the doctor saving you and the assassin killing you is their intent."
200 CP,Hyperpolymorphine,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"The signature tool of the Callidus Assassins, polymorphine is a very interesting drug. With it, a Callidus Assassin could change and shift their flesh to adopt the appearance of another person and, with great training, even take on the appearance of something like an Eldar or an Ork. And despite all that polymorphine allows one to do, others have sought to improve upon the substance, regardless of the costs. One such person was Inquisitor Dahwrin, whose Thorian beliefs led him to believe that an improved version of polymorphine could lead to the creation of a Divine Vessel, one who could take in the Emperor’s soul itself. His efforts to create such a vessel failed but that did not mean they did not bear fruit in other ways. Thought to have been lost to a rogue Assassin, it seems that you have found your hands on a supply of hyperpolymorphine, enough to utilize it a dozen times, along with the blueprints to create more. But what can it do? Well, to put it mildly, it’s polymorphine on steroids. So long as the drug is running through your system, you’ll have all the benefits of polymorphine and your shapeshifting abilities have improved that you could pass through pipes a foot wide, strengthen your bones, muscles, and flesh, improve your organs and senses, grow extra eyes and so much more. With proper training and experience, you’d be more than a match for the Callidus Temple’s assassins."
300 CP,Master of Assassins,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","There are old assassins and bold assassins, but few old bold assassins. You, however, have been in the killing business a solid two centuries, with a killcount making you an object of envy among your temple. You could easily spend your years here training the next generation of assassins, or in a leadership position dealing with the cutthroat officio politics. Assuming you were crazy. Still, your instincts in the field are preternaturally keen, your experiences keep you sharp as a well-honed razor."
300 CP,Trained At A Temple of Assassins ,Warhammer 40K -- Emperor Text to Speech - Gauntlet,"You're trained and equipped as an expert in one form of assassination. Pick one of the Assassin temples and you have all
the training and equipment of these without any of the drawbacks. You can purchase this more than once.
Vindicare - sharpshooters, specialists in sniping and marksmanship
Callidus - use the shape-changing drug Polymorphine for infiltration and impersonation
Eversor - drug-fuelled berserkers who carry out brutally violent attacks
Culexus - psyker-killers, immune and invisible to psychic powers
Venenum - experts in the use of poisons and subtlety
Vanus - blackmailers and information gatherers who maneuver their pawns to kill for them"
400 CP,The Grot That Turned,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Big Mek Oilguzla had a huge force of Deff Dreds, but as he turned them on a hive-city, he was suddenly slain by one of his own Gretchin. Like Militza Scarvelli, who did the deed, you have enough skill with polymorphine to impersonate humanoid xenos, like Orks, Tau and Eldar, and know enough of their language and culture to not be easily caught out."
400 CP,A Ghost Among Devils ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Xantaka, a sorcerer of the Thousand Sons was infamous for his ability to summon daemonic legions strong enough to overwhelm a  orld within hours. Until a Culexus assassin walked right past his unholy sentries, through his wards, past his rubricae bodyguards and evaded the notice of the sorcerer himself before burning his brains to ash at close range. You easily escape the notice of anything touched by warpcraft, even psykers themselves will not see you with their ordinary or cursed eyes."
400 CP,Enhanced Endocrine Response,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","An Eversor can move at speeds blinding to even an Astartes, thanks to their enhanced version of adrenaline, frenzon. More, time seems to slow and they react with careful deliberation faster than an unenhanced, and most enhanced, can on reflex alone. You also have immense hysterical strength on demand, thanks to hypermusculature and a redesigned skeleton, and a secondary heart to make you that much harder to kill. A final gland, the Terminus Gland, means if killed your body will explode into a superheated acid that can melt through tank armor."
400 CP,Anathame,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","A dagger with shapeshifting envenoming properties, so it is always the weakness of whatever it is used against."
400 CP,Cogitator Gauntlet,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","The other signature tool of the Clade. This bulky metal gloves does contain an impressive ability for electrical discharge and EMP, should the user be attacked. Its true purpose, however is to project a dozen or a score of holographic screens, to provide data and control truly commensurate with a Vanus assassin’s ability to multitask."
400 CP,Neuro Gauntlet,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","A glove with hyper-alloy armor-shredding claws, containing injectors for a potent neuro-toxin. Your target will die, in unimaginable agony, while all their powers and strengths are halved. Refills hourly, comes with a single antidote injector for the thumb."
400 CP,Animus Speculum ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","A scary elongated skull helmet with in-built gas filter and air supply, advanced sensors, dampening systems to tamp down the blank aura at will, and the ability to focus the blank power into a brain-melting Arcane Eye energy blast. Also contains a Psyocculum, which makes psychic entities glow and be visible through walls."
400 CP,C’Tan Phase Sword,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","A sword blade that passes through armor, defense fields, and basically everything but the body of a C’Tan Shard, which will instead absorb it."
400 CP,Deadly Paperpusher,Wh40k Adeptus Administratum,"You are not a Guardsman or a Sororitas or a Skitarii or an Astartes or a... well, you are not a lot of things. Not now, at least. You are, essentially, a paper pusher. However, you can be a very deadly paper pusher when things come down to it. In your hands even innocuous items like vellum and paperclips become lethal weapons. There is nothing you cannot successfully use as a weapon and with deadly skill as well. Are you secretly an escapee from some Assassinorium sect? Who knows."
600 CP,Specificity ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Even amateurs have heard of binary poisons, where two discreet substances combine in the body to form a poison, so you can dose everyone with one half and have it be harmless. Well, in the interests of not getting blamed, you’ve taken this a lot farther. With a little study, you can tailor make a poison to a target, to attack them specifically, bypass any resistance they might have, and be harmful only to them. This also leaves no discernable evidence, as anyone analyzing food or
surfaces will find only harmless substances."
600 CP,The Tigers Caged ,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Hettman Gretch of the 593rd Kadaveran Tigers led not just his regiment, but all the Tigers in rebellion, until a Callidus assassin killed and replaced first his trusted Astropath, then the commander himself, scattering his forces and calling down an artillery strike on their high command. You are extremely skilled at impersonating people, needing very little observation to get the voice and mannerisms down, and are supremely skilled in all forms of sabotage, from moving units around to destroying equipment, you can wreck just about anything with scant risk of being caught."
600 CP,A Destiny Denied,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","Nothing the Imperium had could touch the Chaos Lord Maleficus. Not until the day he ascended to Daemon Princedom, and was immediately showered with psyk-out grenades and utterly annihilated by a Culexus Assassin. Like this assassin, you have an amazing sense of timing, with the skill and immense good fortune to always find your targets at their most vulnerable, most opportune moments for you to strike. Let none stand beyond fear of the Emperor’s wrath."
600 CP,The Cull of the Goliaths,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","In M37, the Abhuman Goliaths started a probably-Khornate blood cult and stopped contributing to the Imperial Guard. By accident, six Eversor assassins were dispatched and by the time they were done, there were no living Goliaths. Your combat skills make you the match of armies and the death of cities. With time and effort, even entire worlds."
600 CP,The Lammas Campaign,"Warhammer 40,000: Imperial Assassins","In this 15-year war with Biel Tan, a Vindicare famously held up a massive Eldar offensive for most of a day by strategic picking of targets. When they finally stormed his ruined tower, they found only grenade traps. Like this sniper, you are extremely skilled at picking targets whose death will cause the most destruction, and efficiency. You are always thinking, doing the calculations of distance and angle for a shot, planning the path of the round before and after the target. It is easy for you to line up to shoot not just one xenos, but the five behind them, or bounce a round off three surfaces to get a headshot from a radically new angle, even to shoot a target over the horizon, with only a screen to show they really are on the stage. You are also very evasive and good at quickly setting up traps."
