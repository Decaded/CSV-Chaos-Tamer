0 CP,Phoenix Lord Action Figures,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","This set of small, finely-crafted figurines seems to be exactly what it says on the tin – a collection of well-articulated and fully-equipped toys made to resemble the Phoenix Lords of the many Aspect Warrior Shrines, including even the unknown Phoenix Lords of the Crimson Hunters and the Warp Spiders."
100 CP,Soulblade,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","Ancient close combat weapons channeling the power of the world spirits, Soulblades cleave easily through any armor. You may import another weapon to gain this effect."
100 CP,Haywire Grenades,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","Others may sneer at your ‘primitive’ and ‘quaint’ ways. But who will be laughing after your EMP grenades turn their fancy vehicles and sophisticated thinking machines into massive paperweights, hmm? Six Haywire grenades, replenished weekly."
100 CP,Webber,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","A pistol firing balls of compressed silk wire from the giant spiders common to Maiden Worlds. On impact,
the webbing explodes in all directions, trapping entire squads if aimed carefully. "
100 CP,Sylandri Veilwalker,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","A shadowseer of the Harlequins’ Masque of the Veiled Path troupe. Fond of secrecy and illusions, an
incredible friend to have, but also incredibly annoying with her refusal to ever explain herself, deal with the cleanup, or do shared chores."
100 CP,Yvraine,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","A dancer from Biel-Tan, became a warlock, and a warrior, before becoming a pirate captain and winding up in an arena in Commoragh where she challenged Lelith Hesperax, lost, and then was killed and reborn at the hands of a priestess of Morag-Hei as the herald of Ynnead. She fled the Dark City Biel-Tan to raise the Yncarne, then revived Guilliman to lead the Imperium. Yvraine is a powerful psyker, a polymath, and an especially graceful and skilled fighte"
100 CP,Impressionable Youth ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","A child? Why would this child be sent to you, with no Perks save for basic Eldar physiology? The answer becomes clear on closer inspection – this one is apparently a half- breed. While they lack training in any of the common skills of the Eldar, they did seem to inherit some knowledge of repairing Mon'Keigh technology – perhaps training by their human parent earlier in life?"
100 CP,Jetbike ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","Mighty weapon and loyal steed all in one, this swift single-seater transport is armed with a pair of twin-linked Shuriken Catapults, which serve as extra protection for the fragile but swift machine. Incredible anti-gravitic motors allow speed and maneuverability only an Eldar with his or her heightened reflexes could possibly pilot, whether in level flight or ascending into the skies. The Shining Spears are the most proficient with this vehicle, and receive one free as part of their Aspect Wargear."
100 CP,Guardian Mesh Armor,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","Guardian Mesh Armor is formed of tens of thousands of individual pieces of thermoplas interwoven to produce a dense material resembling reptile scales or chainmail. It becomes momentarily rigid when hit, spreading force across a larger area, thereby reducing the damage. The thermoplas also disperses heat rapidly, giving reasonable protection against energy weapons. The material is psychically sensitive, automatically reacting to the wearer's movements and thoughts to maintain a glove-tight fit as they move and fight. Guardian Mesh Armor also contains additional features, including an independent air supply and heat-sensing lenses."
100 CP,Hallucinogen Grenades ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","While the Dark Kin are more versed in the use of such weapons as these, your kind are no fools. The effectiveness of these devices, which when detonated release an invisible gas that befuddles and torments the minds of their victims, cannot be denied. There are now five of these in your possession, which will replenish their full number every two days."
100 CP,Gyrinx ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","This graceful, cat-like creature is odd in many ways. Empathetic to a fault, and capable of forming a mighty mental bond with its owner, it can even improve the speed of its master's thoughts. In temperament, habit, and even (slightly) physicality, it will, as your bond grows, come to resemble you."
100 CP,A Sharp Tongue ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","You almost seem to take after a certain Ulthwe Farseer in how well you find just the right buttons to push on your enemies. Your words alone seem to have quite the effect –sending Space Marine Captains, Imperial Guard Generals, and Ork Warbosses alike into a frothing rage."
100 CP,Vein Seeker ,"Warhammer 40.000
Dawn Of War: Soulstorm","You live for the elegant dance of the blade, the subtle art of murder and the invigorating spray of fresh blood. From scalpels to power blades, carving up the weak and foolish is a pastime beyond compare to you, and you wield such tools like one who’s honed their skills over centuries. You could use your talent to dispatch your foes more quickly... but then, where’s the fun in that, if you can draw it out and strike where it causes the most pain instead? Their sweet cries of agony are a far greater reward than just another corpse, after all."
100 CP,Reaver Jetbike,"Warhammer 40.000 Dawn Of War: Soulstorm
","Fast enough to outrun almost any enemy and equipped with a powerful anti-infantry splinter cannon, Reavers are excellent for harassing enemy forces in hit-and-run strikes. Although they are fragile and their weapons are not very effective against vehicles, they can be outfitted with shields to bolster their resilience, and when upgraded with targeting modules they become much more deadly – especially when firing on the move."
100 CP,Resistance ,Commorragh Jumpchain V1.0,"You are immune to most commonly used toxins some quite obscure ones as well. Also provides a resistance to the side effects of most hard drugs in this jump and the next. This will come in handy more times than not considering this places penchant for poisoning rivals.
"
100 CP,Just Another Day in the Life,Commorragh Jumpchain V1.0,You get a pretty substantial boost to your willpower and strength of mind. Also has the effect of getting rid of squeamishness which is useful in itself.
100 CP,Hoverboard ,Commorragh Jumpchain V1.0,"A hoverboard either won or ""acquired"" from some of the lowlife riff-raff. Sports impressive speeds and you can do some wicked stuff if you got quick reflexes, which you should really be. If not I am sure there are drugs that can help. Its Commorragh after all
"
200 CP,Soul Stone,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"A Spirit Stone, also known as a Waystone, Dreamstone and a Tear of Isha, is a small, seemingly precious gem carried in a variety of different aesthetically-pleasing settings on a Craftworld Aeldari's chest, used to save their souls from consumption after death within the Immaterium by Slaanesh. It works like a horcrux and holds your soul on death. This soul stone will work regardless of what race you are. It will also give you an opportunity to undergo rebirth if you have enough time and the ability to do so."
200 CP,Clonefield ,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","A specialized device that projects dozens of holographic duplicates, all moving in perfect synchronicity with you. Few foes have the perception, or the time, to pick out the real threat among all the false ones."
200 CP,Phoenix Gem ,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","When Asuryan was laid low by the C’Tan, the mother goddess Isha drew the heat of a hundred suns into a single gemstone to revive the king of the gods. This gem is but a small fragment of that one, yet it retains the power to revive the recently slain."
200 CP,Witchblade ,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","No, not the fancy glove, that’s only in comic books. This psychically attuned sword serves as a focus of your psychic powers, enhancing your physical might and letting you cleave tanks in two and split Terminator armor with ease."
200 CP,Webway Seeds,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","A bag of twenty-six wraithbone seeds, replenished monthly. When planted, they grow overnight into a
webway gate large enough for people to pass through. The visible growth is just a fraction of the true expansion into the twilight between the Materium and Immaterium, linking up with the existing Webway. If you do not define an area, it will continue expand to a scale to move vehicles, armies and starships. In future Jumps, you can use this to build your own Webway network."
200 CP,Salacious Seer ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","This Seer, bearing both the Seer and Spirit Seer perks, appears to have an unhealthy interest in the concept of “love.” While romance is not unknown among the Eldar, this individual's propensity to use their gifts in a pursuit known as “matchmaking” is something of an annoyance to the Craftworld at large. Still, consider also that they seem to see a future together with you – regardless of any prior arrangements. The Craftworld's hope that you might be able to rein them in may well be unfounded..."
200 CP,Jovial Jester,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","At first glance, this individual seems to be an average Harlequin, bearing the Player perk. However, closer examination reveals more – namely, that the individual in question is incredibly mentally unhinged – in an entirely harmless manner. Well, that is, if you consider a fondness for terrible puns, an irrepressible energy, and the seeming inability to stop smiling “harmless.”"
200 CP,Reckless Ranger,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","Young, impetuous, and with a sense of adventure, this Ranger has heard tell of your many travels. Of course, then, they would seek to join you. Whether or not this is for the best is... debatable. This Ranger has formed a close friendship with one of the Mon'Keigh pets – the creature referred to as a “dog” - and is rather fond of simply-made foods, such as one might find on an Exodite World."
200 CP,Cloak of Shadows,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","To confound or resist the aim of one's enemies and their ranged weapons is a tried-and-true tactic among the Eldar, and this robe which garbs its wearer in shadows to soften the blows of their shots is little different."
200 CP,Nightwing,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","This aircraft, a fighter-interceptor designed for speed and maneuverability, is first and foremost a dogfighter, taking on other aircraft with ease. Moreover, in order to protect it from enemy fire, the Nightwing is equipped with twin-linked Shuriken Cannons and a holo-field that blurs its movements."
200 CP,Wave Serpent,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","This ten-seater transport uses the finest Eldar anti-gravitic technology to levitate itself above the ground, and is armed with twin-linked Shuriken Catapults for protection. Notably, like other Eldar vehicles, its Wraithbone construction ensures that no other race can make use of it."
200 CP,Wraithguard,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","Less a vehicle for a living pilot than it is for a Spirit Stone, this Wraith-construct may serve as a body for the soul placed within, allowing it to fight once more as a Guardian or Aspect Warrior would. Larger Wraith-constructs exist, but obtaining them will be somewhat more difficult."
200 CP,Tactical Sadist ,"Warhammer 40.000
Dawn Of War: Soulstorm","Amateurs stab their victims in the back. You feel that’s just not quite the right scale... and decided to do it to entire armies at a time. You have a keen insight into how enemy forces are arrayed, perfect for identifying whatever weak spots might be present in their fortifications, troop deployments vulnerable to interception, undermanned territories ripe for a ‘visit’ and other such military weaknesses. You’ll find it easy to determine where to strike to do the most damage before your enemy can bring in their reserves or otherwise deal with you... though whether you decide to stick around and continue the carnage or make a retreat, laughing all the while, is your choice."
200 CP,Shuriken Grav Platform,"Warhammer 40.000
Dawn Of War: Soulstorm","A mobile weapon system built for suppressive fire, this machine sends an endless stream of munitions against all those who oppose the Eldar. Although the damage of each individual hit is fairly low, it has a high rate of fire and the weapon’s spread give it an area-of-effect that allows it to whittle down entire squads of infantry at once. While it is largely ineffective against heavily armored targets, the Shuriken Grav Platform is vital as a support unit – its attacks slow enemy infantry, allowing the Eldar’s frequent edge in speed and mobility to shine even more. That said, it is not very well armored and is easily destroyed when facing heavy enemy fire."
200 CP,Brightlance Grav Platform ,Warhammer 40.000 Dawn Of War: Soulstorm,"200): a derivative of the same mobile frame as the Shuriken
platform, the Brightlance Grav Platform is built for anti-vehicle support. Equipped with a potent
energy weapon, this unit deals modest damage against more heavily armored targets, though it
lacks any area of effect and is not very useful against infantry. Most importantly, however, the
Brightlance Grav Platform illuminates weak points in their target with each hit, and for a few
seconds after each impact other Eldar can use these markers to deal substantially more
damage than normal when engaging this target."
200 CP,Raider ,"Warhammer 40.000 Dawn Of War: Soulstorm
","These sleek skimmer vessels are fast, lightly armored quasi-transports equipped with an anti-vehicle Dark Lance. Although they have only limited space to carry infantry, the vehicle’s open design allows troops to fire on enemies from the Raider’s deck. These vehicles can quickly traverse the battlefield and ignore obstacles with unique jets that release a terrifying wail upon landing, demoralizing and knocking back enemies before engaging them. Like other vehicles, they can be equipped with shielding upgrades to bolster their initially low resilience."
200 CP,Incubi Companion,Commorragh Jumpchain V1.0,"Gain a really loyal and incorruptible bodyguard to accompany your journey into the Dark City. He
isn't too talkative but will come with you to later jumps. Don’t let his taciturn demeanour fool you
though. He is just as evil as the rest of the city."
200 CP,Blaster/Blast Pistol,Commorragh Jumpchain V1.0,"A gun that shoots streams of darklight lasers (Derived from anti-matter) that will royally fuck up a target. Comes in Pistol and handheld forms. Christ ok, be bloody careful. I am totally not responsible for anybody blowing themselves up with this."
250 CP,Nightwing,Warhammer 40.000 Dawn Of War: Soulstorm,"A fightercraft with unmatched speed, the Nightwing carries a pair of Brighlances to engage other air targets, as well as Shuriken Cannons to shred lightly armored ground forces. Their speed and area of effect damage against ground targets make them ideal for hunting down and eliminating vulnerable infantry. They can also be upgraded to continually repair themselves without the need for resources or the aid of Bonesingers, making them excellent harassment units. Their main weakness is the lack of anti-armor firepower."
250 CP,Raven ,"Warhammer 40.000 Dawn Of War: Soulstorm
","Swift fliers that are deadly against infantry, light vehicles and other aircraft, the Raven’s speed allows them to harry targets or retreat in moments. Although they lack the firepower to handle heavily armored targets, they can temporarily disable the weapons on enemy vehicles, making such targets easy prey for any other nearby Dark Eldar. Like other Dark Eldar vehicles, the Raven can be fitted with shields to bolster their lacklustre resilience."
300 CP,World Shrine,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","Exodites use to commune with the world spirit, can take the form of a menhir or just a small altar. This has two benefits in all that a realms (material, Warp and Webway) meet, and that all prayers here are heard. These benefits carry to future Jumps, possibly with some adaptation to local cosmology."
300 CP,Falcon Grav Tank,Warhammer 40.000 Dawn Of War: Soulstorm,"Unusual for a transport, this Eldar hovertank is a versatile, all-purpose vehicle. Not only can it carry two squads of Eldar into battle, but its decent resilience and multiple weapon systems allow it to engage both infantry and vehicles with good results. It is initially equipped with a forward-facing Shuriken Catapult and a turret-mounted Scatter Laser-Brightlance combination, but can also have the Brightlance weapon replaced with a Starcannon for pure anti-infantry duty. Finally, as a hovertank it can briefly overcharge its engines to fly over obstacles or enemies, giving it unmatched mobility beyond its already respectable speed."
300 CP,Wraithlord,Warhammer 40.000 Dawn Of War: Soulstorm,"These mecha house the souls of slain Eldar, allowing these warriors to fight alongside their brothers and sisters once more. While notably faster than most other ‘walker’ vehicles, the Wraithlord is a bit less resilient. However, it can decimate most targets with ease, be it by fighting in melee with lethal power fists, or engaging from a distance with its dual heavy flamers, starcannon, or even a brightlance if upgraded with such a weapon. As a result, the Wraithlord is a hard-hitting combat machine that still works excellently with the Eldar’s focus on speed."
400 CP,Rune Armor ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","Forged of Wraithbone and engraved with runes of warding, this armor is best used by a Farseer or Warlock, whose psychic energies react with the armor and turn aside blows from Lascannon and plasma weapon alike. In beauty immaculate, in fit ever molded to your form, this armor truly is a work of legend."
400 CP,Singing Spear ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","Operating by the same principles as the Witchblade, this Wraithbone spear has another unique property in that it returns to the hand of its wielder after being thrown. It is, however, less effective than a Witchblade in close combat due to requiring two hands to use."
400 CP,Corsair,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","Perhaps it is not enough to simply watch nature. Instead, you have worked your way on board one the Corsair ships criss-crossing the Webways and Real Space. You were fortunate that the ship did not belong to the Dark Kin. However, life as a pirate is not much different, as you pillage, and ransack those unlucky enough to cross your path. Your life on board has given you camraderie and wealth untold. There is yet more, for to live aboard a ship, as a Corsair, you must make your name known far and wide. You have become more charismatic, as well as having gained an intuitive grasp of three-dimensional space combat and ship boarding techniques, knowing where to strike to bring down an enemy vessel with minimum hassle."
400 CP,Ranger,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","Stricken by a wanderlust to see the Galaxy, you have become a ghost whispered in the wind. Your psychic gifts specialize in helping you survive to see that alien sunset. Already light on your feet, you have taken your gifts further than expected. Not only can you psychically control the sounds you make, but your scent, too is at your command. Along the way, you picked up some skill at tracking foes and quarry, but any simple beast can follow a trail of footprints or scents. Your skill at the hunt allows you to make a precognitive estimate as to where your prey is - and were it will be. Let the fear of the hunter be known once more."
500 CP,Runestones of Jarankyor,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","Special psychestones used by one of the greatest Farseers of past millennia. These enhance the clarity of precognition so much that anyone can see visions of the future in the stones, and a Farseer can parse an order of magnitude more futures, faster than ever."
600 CP,Eldar Craftworld ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"You have acquired the full force of an Eldar Craftworld. The full strength of each craftworld is shrouded in mystery. Many guesses have ranged from a few million to over a trillion. It is likely that the population of these worlds are limited by the amount of Eldar rather than the amount of space available to them. For simplicity's sake you may assume there are three billion Eldar on this craftworld or you may instead choose a canon craftworld to receive. Approximately 70% of the Eldar will be civilians, although they will be trained in combat as has accustomed. The remainder will be soldiers and among them will be some Eldar worthy of calling heroes. It is likely only one or two among them will be capable of matching someone such as Eldrad however. You may freely decide the demographics of the world if you wish to alter it. "
600 CP,Tall and Narrow Gate ,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","How curious. Rather than an item in and of itself, this is a series of what appear to be information crystals. The information they contain, however, is in and of itself far more interesting. It is information as old as the first war between your kind and the Necrontyr, if not older – the architecture of a system invented by the Old Ones and inherited, as were many of their wonders, by your people. The means by which your ilk avoid the predations of the Warp in their travels across the stars. The very feat the one who Mon'Keigh call the Emperor of Mankind attempted to recreate using his Golden Throne. Within these crystals lie the keys to the creation of the Webway itself. However, you have nowhere near the almighty psychic power the Old Ones wielded in their heyday, and the Warp was far calmer then, when they merged its outermost layer with realspace to form a skein-realm that was neither Materium nor Immaterium, and yet both. This knowledge is of little use to you here. With that said, there are other worlds beyond this grim, dark galaxy. Worlds ripe for the foundation of a fresh, unbroken Webway. Perhaps a fine and proper starting point for the application of this system is simply connecting faraway points on a single planet, about the same size as Old Earth before it came to be called Holy Terra. A feat connecting the northernmost and southernmost points of such a world, that one might step through a gate at the bottom of the world and exit at its top or a number of points in between, might well cost you precious decades of psychic exertion, spiritual focus, and of course the construction of the actual Webway Gates. Even so, given much longer, you might well connect the planets within a system to one another at singular points. As your psychic power and the amount of time at your disposal grow, so too shall the potential this information brings. And should you truly ascend into a state akin to or even surpassing that of the Old Ones themselves? You might erect Webway Gates at opposite corners of entire galaxies."
600 CP,Fareseer,"Warhammer 40,000: Craftworld Eldar","To ply the depths of Wraithbone circuts as spirit. To tear knowledge from the skeins of time and avert disaster before it can ever come to pass. To wield the power of decision over an entire Craftworld. To truly know, more than the most scholarly Mon'Keigh could ever hope for, more than the Dark Kin can remember, more than the most inquisitive Tau will witness, more even than those the Dark God Tzeentch grants his boons to – this is the way of the Farseer. Your abilitiyto read the future shall ever grow now, great enough to lead every Eldar in your Craftworld to the best possible future. In this galaxy, that means many will still perish in vain – but the Craftworld as a whole will survive. In a less... unsavory universe, who knows how much pain your predictive prowess will be able to prevent? To see difficulties that lie ahead and plan for them. To sense the awakening and movements of enemies. To perhaps, with many millennia, grow to match the eldest of Seers himself... this is the path you have chosen. It will be a long road, fraught with peril, but the rewards at the end will be truly staggering. A brief note – perhaps out of a sense of mercy from your provider, you will likely not meet the bane, or perhaps boon, all Farseers face – that of melding in mind with the Infinity Circut of the Craftworld, and in body with the Dome of Crystal Seers."
800 CP,The Black Library,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","Hidden within the Webway, the Harlequins maintain the Black Library, the ultimate repository on everything the Eldar know, and could steal, regarding Chaos, the Warp, and their own history and lore. It is very nearly an infinite library, and now you get a copy that updates with historic, scientific and supernatural lore of each setting you visit. If two copies of a given text exist, there’s excellent odds you own one."
800 CP,Maiden World,"Warhammer 40,000: The Ynnari Eldar","A garden planet, to those who are welcome, long ago terraformed brilliantly by the Eldar, including a series of menhirs, stone circles and shrines joining the spirits of the dead into a world spirit. To intruders, this place is deadlier than Catachan as all life turns hostile."
