100 CP,A Psyker Sidekick,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","This mortal psyker has been attached to your unit to assist you in sorcerous matters. They lack the physique of a Space Marine, but their training in the psyker ways has been extreme, and their talent for learning is prodigious. They are a Beta-level psyker, either a Primaris psyker if you’re loyal to the Imperium (no relationship to Primaris Space Marines), or a sorcerous rogue psyker if you are a Traitor. If you’re one of the Thousand Sons, they can even be your own personal Thrall Wizard. You may choose two psychic disciplines for them to have an enormous level of knowledge and talent in, and you can rest assured that they are immune to possession from entities of the Warp.
"
100 CP,Delta ,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"This is the level where the Inquisition and the wider Imperium deem a psyker’s power to be strong yet safe enough for sanctioned use. Psykers at this tier can perform more advanced feats like astral projection, allowing their consciousness to travel across great distances, or clairvoyance, which enables them to see events and threats before they happen. These abilities make Delta-level psykers invaluable assets in war and intelligence gathering, but they still remain controlled, ensuring that they do not become dangerous warp portals for daemonic entities. The Imperium trusts psykers of this level to serve without excessive risk of corruption."
100 CP,Mind Blades,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"Through the psychic power of Mind Blades, the Grey Knight can imbue his allies' melee weapons with psychic energy, granting them unerring accuracy and the power to pierce even the smallest vulnerabilities in their enemies' armor. This ability enhances the lethality of any strike, making each blow land with devastating precision. Even against heavily armored foes, these empowered blades seek out and exploit the weakest points in their defenses, ensuring swift and brutal victories."
100 CP,Smite,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"Smite is a classic and lethal psychic attack used by the Grey Knights. Lightning-like bolts of psychic energy leap from their fingertips, tearing apart foes in an instant. These bolts are charged with warp energy, capable of obliterating both daemonic and mortal foes with ease. Smite is often used to thin the ranks of enemies from a distance, softening them up before engaging in close-quarters combat. It is a powerful tool for Grey Knights when facing large numbers of foes, as the bolts can chain between targets."
100 CP,The Summoning,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"The Summoning is a psychic power that allows a Grey Knight Librarian to call upon their allies across vast distances. By reaching out through the warp, the Librarian can summon their comrades to their side in the blink of an eye. This power allows for quick reinforcement during battle and is particularly useful in dire situations. However, the Librarian must have a personal connection with the individuals they wish to summon, knowing their presence and identity in the warp, ensuring that only trusted allies answer the call."
100 CP,Quicksilver ,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"Quicksilver accelerates the reflexes and physical speed of the Grey Knight's allies to supernatural levels. By tapping into the Librarian's psychic powers, those nearby move with blinding speed, allowing them to react faster than their enemies can anticipate. This ability is especially valuable in combat, where heightened reflexes can make the difference between life and death. With Quicksilver, Grey Knights strike with unmatched swiftness, overwhelming their foes with rapid and precise attacks."
100 CP,Psychic Hood,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"The greatest danger to an Astropath is not the enemy in front of them, at least usually. The greatest danger is in fact their own powers and the myriad daemons of the Immaterium that want to eat their soul and use their body. This hood, woven with protective sigils, and combining special circuitry to bleed of extra warp energy, this gives a small, but vital boon to help keep your warp powers from going out of control. Since you’re buying it here, it will also do the same for all you supernatural powers, providing a cushion against overuse or out of control abilities."
100 CP,Witchsight,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"Witchsight is an ability possessed by almost every psyker with the Imperium of Man. This power allows them to witness the true character of a being dispelling any disguises or methods of concealment they possess. The most common variable is that the darker someone’s soul is the more demonic they appear. Similarly the purer a soul is the more angelic and golden they appear. This perk will grant you the purest Witchsight possible even surpassing the most insightful of the Eldar. 
"
100 CP,The Howling Wind,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"The Stormseer gathers the powerful winds of the Chogorian steppes, driving them forwards to cast aside the enemy. This ability functions as a single powerful gust of wind that can knock aside even Space Marines.  
"
100 CP,The Sanguine Sword ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"This ability works by having the Librarian's channel their psychic power into their Force Weapon. This causes the weapon to take on a violent crimson hue as he infuses it with a sliver of his inner rage. This allows the blade to easily cut through resilient armor and it makes their attacks particularly effective against daemons.
"
100 CP,Unleash Rage,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"By reaching into the minds of his fellows, this ability allows the Librarian to unleash the savagery within the Blood Angels' psyche. This ability causes the target to enter a berserker rage allowing them to literally tear their opponents apart. Overuse of this ability however can be incredibly draining to the target.
"
100 CP,Wings of Sanguinius ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"This ability allows the Librarian to sprout a pair of blood-red wings of psychic energy from his back that can bear him aloft, allowing him to fly over the battlefield. These wings greatly resemble the wings of the fallen Primarch Sanguinius. Should you be a Blood Angel Space Marine you may become a perfect copy of your Primarch. 
"
100 CP,Power Bestowal ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"But if you wish to share your power with more than just your family, the Paternova likely isn’t the option for you.
This is, however. Like the Emperor himself, or if you’re feeling more heretical, the gods of Chaos, you can splinter
off a portion of your power, bestowing it upon another willing soul, even if they aren’t psykers. With this, you
can effectively create Daemon Princes in all but name. Of course, it would behoove you to remember that what
can be given so easily be taken away, often with disastrous consequences befalling the souls who you just ripped
away your power from."
100 CP,Wyrdvane Psyker,Imperial Guard - Jumpchain,"You’ve picked up a Wyrdvane Psyker, a psyker who has yet to fully master their powers, though they are trained and screened enough to minimise the risk of Perils of the Warp occurring. Under the gaze of a more experienced, controlled peer (such as yourself), they can link minds together and channel the power of the Warp in a relatively safe manner. This may be purchased multiple times, if you wish to create your own battle squad"
100 CP,Primaris Psyker ,Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet 1.0,"You have garnered a service of Primaris Psyker. These psykers are feared by many due to their overall disposition and
uncomfortable atmosphere surrounding them. She is not happy about the whole “fear” part and this has led her to be
very closed and focused on job and her own mental psyche (kinda important, when any mistake can lead to daemon
incursion). She is scared of being seen as a monster and having to be exposed to the stares of people so you won’t see
her much. If you try to help her and make her feel accepted, she will turn a bit possessive. On one hand, her mental
fortitude will go through the roof due to her being sure of herself and having support in you, but having a yandere psyker following you around can sometimes be a problem."
100 CP,Nemesis Force,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"A force weapon is powerful. That fact cannot be denied but even it falls to the same problem many weapons have. If the wielder is powerful enough, the weapons they wield often become little more than pretty trinkets, incapable of matching up to their wielder’s might. But there are ways to get around that problem, especially for force weapons. With the addition of a psi-matrix attuned to your unique psyche, your weapon has now become a Nemesis Force weapon. And as your psionic might grows, so too shall the power of your weapon."
200 CP,Beta ,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"This is the power threshold required for a Grey Knight to have a chance of becoming a Librarian. At this level, you are a living powerhouse, capable of performing incredible feats that can reshape the battlefield and the environment itself. You can control the weather, summoning storms, lightning, or blizzards, and even cause catastrophic events that can decimate enemy forces. In ancient times, psykers of this magnitude would have been revered as gods among men, with powers that rival the natural disasters feared by humanity. Now, you are a weapon of the Emperor, capable of bringing calamity upon the enemies of mankind."
200 CP,Nemesis Hammerhand,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"The Nemesis Hammerhand ability allows the Grey Knight to augment the power of their strikes with psychic force. By channeling psychic energy into their fists or weapons, they strike with devastating power, capable of crushing even the most resilient of foes. This ability is often used when facing particularly tough enemies like Chaos Space Marines or monstrous daemons, as the sheer force behind each blow can pierce through even the most formidable defenses. With Nemesis Hammerhand, no foe is too tough to withstand a Grey Knight's assault."
200 CP,Banishment Stone,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"The Banishment Stone is a unique psychoreactive crystal, a rare and powerful artifact belonging to the revered Grey Knights Chapter. Encased within a Theldrite housing, it is wired into the base of a Grey Knight's skull, establishing a
psychic link that activates when the Grey Knight slays an enemy war leader. As the leader dies, their psyche is amplified into a resonant shockwave of despair and fear, spreading across the battlefield. This effect overwhelms the minds and souls of any nearby foes, paralyzing them with dread and disarray. This momentary paralysis provides a critical advantage to the Grey Knights, enabling them to strike with precision and crush their adversaries' morale."
200 CP,Psyker Discipline - ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"Although the powers of psykers are many and varied, they usually fall into one of several disciplines. The five most common psychic disciplines are: Biomancy, Divination, Pyromancy, Telekinesis and Telepathy. It should be noted that, whilst two different psykers may both use the same discipline, their powers are likely to manifest in unique, idiosyncratic ways. So for example, an Imperial psyker using the Pyromancy discipline may hurl blazing bolts shaped like an avenging, two-headed eagle whilst a corrupt Chaos sorcerer might conjure multi-hued conflagrations of living Warp fire and an Ork psyker or ""Weirdboy"" could vomit cones of billowing green flames. Some specific powers for each discipline can be found with the psyker link in the notes. Purchasing this perk gives you a large boost in skill with your chosen discipline. You will learn the listed abilities at an expert level. Also this perk may be bought multiple times for each discipline. "
200 CP,Emperor's Tarot,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Care to have your fortune read? These highly illustrated cards are actually wafers of psycho-reactive crystals that aid in divination. Here they are used to get in touch with the wisdom and perception of the Emperor of Mankind. They are a potent focus for any non-evil divinatory abilities, supplanting the need for any other specific focus, although your efforts can still be aided with other additions. Even if you do not have any divinatory abilities, you can still use them for surprisingly accurate tarot readings. They also can shift their faces to be the appropriate displays for any card games you know."
200 CP,Force Weapon ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"Force weapons are powerful tools wielded by psykers. These weapons amplify the power of a psyker allowing them to exert far more power than they would use otherwise. Force Weapons take the form of swords, spears, warhammers, axes or other close combat melee weapons. By purchasing this option you may acquire one of these weapons of your very own. 
"
200 CP,Lightning Call ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"By raising their arms to roiling storm-clouds overhead, the Stormseer can call down lightning strikes upon his foes. This ability can be used in clear skies, but it is significantly easier to use in the presence of a storm.
"
200 CP,Spirits of Chogoris,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"Many and terrible are the spirits and ghouls of Chogorian tribal folklore, and it is Warp-wrought simulacra of these ancient terrors that the Stormseer now unleashes on the foe. This ability causes the nightmare like spirits of Chogoris to terrorize your foes. They simultaneously attack the enemy physically as well as mentally.
"
200 CP,Fear the Darkness,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"By casting a psychic shadow across the battlefield, the Librarian summons the indescribable malice of the Warp, unleashing it in a mighty wave of sheer terror, assailing his foe's soul with nameless torment. This ability is particularly effective on large groups.
"
200 CP,Blood Boil ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"With a blast of psychic power, the Librarian drives his enemy's blood into a seething frenzy, superheating the target's blood, flash-boiling it and causing it to burst from their eyes, mouth, and ears with explosive finality.
"
200 CP,Might of Heroes,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"Focusing his will, the Blood Angels Librarian utilizes the deadly powers of the Immaterium to flow into him, heightening his speed and strength to unimaginable levels and summoning up a deep well of rage to smite the foes of the Emperor.
"
200 CP,Blood Lance ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"The Librarian conjures a mighty psychic lance, glistening with gore. On a single word of command, the lance flies from his hands, hurling a blazing crimson lance of psychic power that skewers everything in its path.
"
200 CP,Stormlance ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"The Stormseer calls upon the lightning that embodies his Chapter's way of war, and brings it to bear against his enemies. When he summons this ability he hurls a bolt of lightning in a straight line out to its maximum range, striking everything in its path.
"
200 CP,From the Depths,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"From the Depths is a unique psychic ability used by the Carcharodons Space Marine Librarians. This ability clouds the minds of their adversaries with a choking mental darkness, amplifying their fear and surprise so that it paralyzes them. Their minds writhe with images of watery depths of numbing cold and writhing pelagic shapes, leaving them vulnerable to assault. This ability will allow you to bypass most beings' mental defenses with the exception of the most strong willed beings. 
"
200 CP,Jaws of the World Wolf,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"The Rune Priest implores the spirit of the world upon which he walks to open its rock-fanged maw, and a chasm cracks open under the feet of his enemies, sending them tumbling to their deaths.
"
200 CP,Verminspeaker ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"The psykers who have managed to evade the grasp of the Black Ships and remained unsanctioned often develop
unique abilities, ones rarely displayed by those with actual training. But that doesn’t mean those powers aren’t
useful. Just look at the Verminspeakers for example. Like them, you’ve learned how to exert your psychic abilities
onto the beasts of the galaxy and in doing so, see through their senses as if they were yours. Not only that, your
psychics allow you to impose your will upon them, forcing all but the strongest of beasts to see you as they would
the greatest of their kind, willing to obey your every command."
200 CP,Runecraft ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"By utilizing your psychic gifts, you open yourself to the Immaterium and with it, the whispers and temptations of
chaos. It is the very reason why the life of a psyker is a harsh and difficult one, almost akin to walking with death
shadowing your every step. And though there is no way to make a psyker’s life safe—all those who say otherwise
are merely fools or liars—there are ways to make it safer. Whether it be runes, glyphs, sigils, or some other symbolic language, you have learned to channel your psychic powers through symbols, and by doing so, you lessen your exposure to the Immaterium and its cloying grasp. By doing so, you may sacrifice power, but you will more than make up for it in sheer versatility. You could store a spell in one of your symbols to save it for later or you could even engrave your symbols onto objects in order to enchant them with tremendous powers. On its own, Runecraft may not be the most impressive of disciplines, but when used in conjunction with other powers, you will truly be capable of creating wonders."
200 CP,Astropath,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Second only to the Navigators, the Astropaths are some of the vital elements of the Imperium. Where the
Navigators deal with the traversal of the Immaterium, the Astropaths handle manners of communication. And of
the psykers who serve the Imperium, the vast majority of them are Astropaths and it is through them how the
Imperium remains whole. You may not have undergone the training of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, but you’ve
more than proven yourself to be a worthy Astropath. With this discipline at your disposal, you are capable of partaking in Astral Telepathy, a way of communicating with others across the vastness of the cosmic void. While it is difficult and time-consuming for clear and stable messages to be sent, you could work alongside other Astropaths to form an Astropathic Choir, a way to ease the burdens of Astral Telepathy. But even if you are not capable of doing so, you should know that there are plenty of ways to improve one’s telepathic abilities, especially for an Astropath."
200 CP,Sariel Valtari ,Planet Governor,"She is humble and unassuming woman, her bald head bears the mark of the Astra Telepathica tattooed in black ink, a mark of the sacred duty she has undertaken. Sariel is a powerful psyker, with the ability to divine the future and communicate with other Astropaths across the stars, and has a small astropathic choir under her guidance. However, her gift comes with a heavy burden - she is often plagued by visions of death and destruction, and her paintings, which she creates based on her visions, are often seen as morbid or unsettling. Despite the accuracy of her predictions, Sariel has struggled to gain recognition for her talents. Many people are skeptical of her abilities, dismissing her paintings as fanciful or the product of an overactive imagination. Some even accuse her of deliberately spreading fear and panic through her art. To make matters worse, many of Sariel's predictions are so far into the future that they are dismissed as irrelevant or impossible. But Sariel knows that the future is not set in stone, and that even the smallest actions can have far-reaching consequences. She continues to paint, driven by a deep sense of duty to use her gift to protect the Imperium, even if no one believes her. Despite the lack of recognition, Sariel is dedicated to her role as an Astropath and remains loyal to the Imperium. She is a quiet, introspective person, often lost in thought as she tries to decipher the meaning of her visions. She has a deep respect for the chain of command and her fellow Astropaths, but she sometimes feels isolated and alone in her experiences. Sariel's paintings, while unsettling to some, are highly prized by those in the know. Inquisitors and high-ranking officials secretly seek out her work, recognizing the value of her predictions and the insight they provide. But to most people, she remains an enigma, a misunderstood figure whose true importance will only be revealed with time."
200 CP,Biomancy,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"When someone thinks of a psyker, the first image that often pops into their mind is a man hurling forth bolts of lightning from their fingertips. And if you want to be like one of those psykers, it’s best to start off with Biomancy, the art of manipulating the biological energy and processes of themselves and of others. With this, you’ll not only be able to conjure up lightning from your body, but you’d be able to heal yourself and your allies, shape your body to your whims, or turn the flesh of your foes into bloody works of art. The Mechanicus may decry the flesh and its weaknesses but to a powerful Biomancer, the flesh is mightier than any metal."
200 CP,Divination,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Countless men have sought to see into the future and now, you are one of few who can actually claim to have done so. While practitioners of this discipline may not demonstrate the flashiness or sheer might of the other disciplines, a Diviner is nonetheless perhaps the most dangerous foe to face. After all, when the basics of this art will see a novice bearing witness to the future yet to be, imagine how much more terrifying it could be against one who knows how to use it. With Divination, entire armies will dance to your whims as they move like puppets on the strings of fate that you make."
200 CP,Pyromancy,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"It is fire that has been mankind’s greatest tool. It is fire that has seen them rise above the myriad beasts and creatures of ancient Terra and it is fire that has taken humanity to the stars. And so, even the greatest of psykers must acknowledge the gift of the flame. And so too shall your foes. With the might of Pyromancy, rarely will you ever be caught lacking in firepower. It may be a simple thing but for Pyromancers of the greatest kind, the flames they bring forth shall cast ablaze entire worlds with the blazing heat of a roaring star."
200 CP,Telepathy ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"After the art of throwing lightning from your fingertips, the discipline of Telepathy is perhaps the one most known by the people of the galaxy. And it is also the most insidious of them all. And why wouldn’t it be? After all, what manner of monster would violate the sanctity of another’s mind? Well, they do call Inquisitors monsters masquerading as men. For novices of this art, their attempts at telepathy are less than subtle, blindingly obvious to most that there is something wrong. But for those with talent, they will find that a knife in the back hurts more when in the hands of one they thought they knew for years. For a Telepath, subtlety is key, especially when paired with a more obvious threat."
200 CP,Technomancy ,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"It is through their minds that humanity has created wonders and horrors that would stand the test of time. From humanity’s earliest days to their reign amongst the stars, it is their minds that have brought them forward and delivered them to their apex. And so, is it any wonder then why a discipline revolving around the manipulation and creation of technology came to be? As you might be able to guess, Technomany is the art of manipulating machines through the use of one’s psychic might. From communicating with machines spirits to forcing machines to break to healing them with but a word and more, Technomancers are some of the most versatile psykers around, their powers finding use whether they’re on an abandoned voidship or lost in the middle of a labyrinthine cavern. But that is not their greatest asset. You see, the greater a Technomancer becomes, the more they shall come to understand the machine. Even those unaware of their talent possess an aptitude for machinery that would see them climbing high into the ranks of the Mechanicus. And the greatest of them all has an understanding that shall exceed all but the finest of Tech-Priests."
200 CP,Umbramancy,Imperium Nihilus - JumpChain,"Fire may have been mankind’s oldest ally, but it was the darkness and those that lurked within that humanity knew and feared above all else in those primal days. And as the ages have gone, this fear has never truly left. It is always there, lurking deep within, waiting to come bubbling up to the surface once more. Now, in this tumultuous time, fear of the dark and of the unknown grips at the hearts of men everywhere you go. Yet, there is wisdom to be found in embracing your fears and in doing so, learning to use the darkness against your foes. A specialty of the Raven Guard Space Marines, Umbramancy is a unique and useful discipline of psychic abilities. For starters, novices in the art will start off being able to cloak themselves in darkness, shielding them from the sights of their enemies and letting them pull off ambushes worthy of any Raven Guard. But as the Umbramancer grows in both power and skill, they will be capable of so much more. From enveloping foes in a veil of darkness to drowning them within a shadow whirlpool to turning even their own shadows against them, the enemies of an Umbramancer shall learn to fear the dark once more, no matter who they may be."
300 CP,Shield of Sanguinius,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"The Librarian wills a shimmering golden barrier of psychic energy into existence, preserving his companions from harm. This powerful barrier will halt any attack in its place. The only issue with this ability is that it requires a massive amount of energy to maintain meaning that it is not useful against weaker sustained attacks. 
"
300 CP,Fury of the Wolf Spirits ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"The Rune Priest summons up the spirits of the Thunderwolves Freki the Fierce and Geri the Cunning from the netherworld. These Thunderwolves were Primarch Leman Russ' wolf-brothers and constant companions. The Rune Priest sets the charcoal-black spirits of the two most exalted Thunderwolves upon the foe, their eerie howls sending men mad with fear. As long as this power is sustained, the Rune Priest is flanked by two spectral wolves that he may direct against his foes with a verbal command.
"
300 CP,Heart of the Khan ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"The Stormseer reaches deep into the legacy of Jaghatai Khan, and brings forth the legendary swiftness and ferocity of the White Scars' Primarch in himself and his battle-brothers, allowing them to move with speed that is superhuman even by the standards of the Adeptus Astartes.
"
400 CP,Luminiferous Resonator,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines v1.0","This lambent crystal device is worn about the neck, or set into the palm or brow, and is used to focus the bearer's native psionic ability; even a non-psyker could blast an enemy with raw psychic force, and an actual sorcerer could accomplish much more.
"
400 CP,Alpha ,Warhammer 40K: Grey Knights Jumpchain,"At this supreme level of psychic power, you are no longer just a mortal psyker—your abilities have ascended to god-like proportions. You can bend the very fabric of the warp, creating immense warp storms capable of enveloping entire planets, turning them into chaotic maelstroms that no enemy can escape. Your mastery over the immaterium is near-absolute, though the risk of madness constantly looms at the edge of your sanity. Few psykers can maintain this level of power without losing their mind, but those who can wield it are unparalleled forces of destruction and cosmic manipulation, feared by even the most powerful daemons."
400 CP,Psychic Stave ,Imperial Guard - Jumpchain,"A psychic stave, also called a Force Stave, is a staff crafted from rare woods, decorated that is designed to help focus and boost your own psychic powers, enabling you to sheath it in crackling psychic energy capable of striking at the very souls of the living and tearing through reinforced armour like tissue"
600 CP,Anathema ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"It seems that much like the Emperor of Mankind you are anathema to chaos. Also, your psychic might is now second only to the Emperor himself. Your mere presence is poison to daemons and you are capable of granting them true death. Your willpower will also receive a tremendous boost, in order to be able to understand and manipulate the warp without going insane. In simple terms you are now something between a Living Imperial Saint and a shard of the Emperor, with all that it entails"
600 CP,Psychic Choir ,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Astropaths and other psykers often combine their powers in order to accomplish great feats. Imperial psykers have discovered certain tricks of techno-arcana that can boost the power of a group, and built special areas for this purpose. This is one such set of chambers, by default looking something like the inside of a gothic cathedral. It boosts all psychic powers used within, but that's not all. Unlike any other such building, it severely curtails the consequences of failure. Sure, you might fry your brain, but you won't accidentally summon a daemon or call down a fireball on a friend or something. This can be a warehouse attachment, or an independent property, of can be attached to any vehicle you own that is at least half a kilometer in length."
600 CP,Gestalt Powers,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"No matter how powerful a psyker, they can’t do everything by themselves. When Astropaths need to do things that are beyond the abilities any one of them alone, they form what is called an Astropathic Choir, There they pool their powers together. You have the same ability to pool psyker or other psychic abilities with others for increased effect. This has a synergistic effect. It is not a simple addition, nor does it suffer diminishing returns in your case, but it is not multiplicative either. Still, you can merge psyker, psychic, and psionic powers, regardless of their nature or source, though all the members of the gestalt must be willing. There is no upper limit to the power you can achieve, but as the anchor and focus, holding each additional member of the link will add stress and necessary concentration, and this cannot be maintained indefinitely, or without close physical proximity.."
