0 CP,Throne Gelt,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"100,000 Thrones. 40k does indeed have money, but it is not standardized. There are forms of currency that are cast by individual segmenta, by individual sectors and subsectors, that are printed by various merchant guilds, and that are put out by different planets, or even different hives on the same planet. With this you get 100,000 Thrones worth of money in whatever currency or combination of currencies you choose, based on the value of those coins or bills when you acquire them."
100 CP,Sister Elyse,Planetary Governor,"A member of the Orders Famulous of the Adeptus Sororitas. She is a tall and imposing figure, with a stern countenance and a no-nonsense demeanour. Her ivory hair is pulled back tightly into a bun, with not a single strand out of place. She wears the traditional robes of the Order, which are adorned only by a fleur-de-lis embroidered on her chest. Despite her intimidating appearance, however, Sister Elyse has a gentle soul and a kind heart. She has spent much of her life working with children, and is a highly skilled educator who takes great pride in her work. Her voice is warm and reassuring, and she has a way of putting even the most nervous child at ease. Sister Elyse is deeply committed to her faith, and sees it as her mission to instil those same values in the children under her care. She is a firm believer in discipline and hard work, and expects nothing but the best from her students. At the same time, she is a compassionate and understanding mentor, always ready with a word of encouragement or a listening ear. Despite her status as a member of the Adeptus Sororitas, Sister Elyse is not a warrior by nature. Her strength lies in her ability to inspire and guide others, and to help them unlock their full potential. She is a true servant of the Emperor, and a shining example of what it means to be a member of the Orders Famulous."
100 CP,Spoils of Conquest,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,This individual is someone that you took as a prize after one of your battles. Maybe they were a powerful warrior that garnered your interest or someone that simply didn’t look away from you when you gazed at them. Either way you had a passing interest and decided to take them with you. Now they serve some sort of role for you. If they were a warrior then they probably submitted and now fight for you. If they were royalty maybe you made them your servant out of amusement. The options are all up to you otherwise then it will be random. Regardless they will never betray you and you may customize them within realistic limits.
100 CP,Pet ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"Given that you’re going to spend a long time alone in the void it will help to have a friend. So take this so that you have some company.

100 CP,Manager,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"One of the main requirements of being a successful trader. You need contacts and friends to go to in order to sell your wares.

In this case you’ve got an old hand at the game willing to help you. This individual has plenty of experience and is willing to share it with you if they haven't already.

If you are a champion"
100 CP,Personality of a Protagonist ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"You are suited for handling difficult situations that would leave others broken. Whether the loss of your friends, witnessing a great tragedy, or simply dealing with complex emotions that have piled up you can handle these situations in stride."
100 CP,The Deep Dark ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"You are going to spend many days, if not years staring into the void with no one to keep you company. Such a job could drive even the greatest of men insane if they had nothing to do. However, your mind works differently. You don't seem to care about the voyages. I would even go as far to say that you find the nothingness of the void to be peaceful. You don't suffer from the isolation of space travel nor boredom of the mindless journeys"
100 CP,Charming Face ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"Seems that people can’t help, but feel at ease around you. This perk gives a noticeable boost to your charisma. At the very least you could always become the life of the party. Your main advantage however, is making people more relaxed. This makes them more comfortable when negotiating and more willing to spend a bit more than they otherwise would have been comfortable with."
100 CP,Contraband,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Smuggling is rife within the Imperium of Man. Perhaps one of the many reasons for this may be that some of the smugglers are on the navy ships intended to prevent smuggling. This 1 foot square box expands to a crate 2 meters on a side, and is full of proscribed goods. These might be illegal drugs, or minor xenos artifacts, or texts that the mechanicus or the ecclesiarchy or someone else deem unsuitable for the public, or some other goods that it is illegal for the majority to possess. And it is in fact quite illegal. Execution would probably be on the light end of punishments, and authorities in the Imperium are quite creative when it comes to punishment. However, to the right customer, their value is worth the risk. How you deal with these is up to you, but please do be careful."
100 CP,A Waste World,Planetary Governor,"This is a planet that has been almost completely stripped of all natural resources and is usually inhospitable to most forms of life. Waste Worlds are often the result of excessive mining or industrial activity, or the aftermath of a catastrophic war or disaster. The landscape is barren and scarred, with little to no vegetation or water. Toxic chemicals and heavy metals may leach into the ground and atmosphere, making the planet uninhabitable without specialised equipment or bioengineering. The few surviving life forms on a Waste World may be adapted to the harsh conditions, such as scavengers or mutant creatures. Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, Waste Worlds are often of great interest to the various factions and powers of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The rare resources that remain on these planets may be vital to the production of weapons, starships, or other critical technologies. In addition, the inhospitable conditions of a Waste World can make them a useful hiding place for those seeking to evade detection or persecution."
100 CP,Lyra,Planetary Governor,"Lyra’s sharp features are framed by a mass of unruly auburn hair that falls in waves around her shoulders. Her piercing green eyes seem to take in everything at once, constantly scanning her surroundings for potential threats or opportunities. Her skin is tanned from years spent under the harsh sun, and a scattering of freckles across her nose and cheeks gives her a youthful appearance that belies her streetwise demeanour. Despite her lean build, Lyra's muscles are toned and well-defined from a lifetime of running, climbing, and fighting. She moves with the fluidity of a cat, her lithe frame able to contort itself into all sorts of positions. Her quick reflexes and nimble fingers make her a natural at sleight of hand and pickpocketing, and she takes great pride in her ability to relieve others of their valuables without being detected. Lyra's clothes are a patchwork of rags and stolen garments, cobbled together from whatever she can scavenge. Despite their shabby appearance, her garments are designed for maximum mobility and flexibility, allowing her to move with ease through the crowded streets of the city. A small leather pouch at her waist contains her ill-gotten gains, along with a few tools of her trade - a set of lockpicks, a length of wire, and a few other odds and ends that she uses to gain entry to locked doors or to disable alarms. Although she may seem tough and streetwise on the surface, Lyra has a vulnerable side as well. Her life on the streets has left her with few friends and even fewer allies, and she has learned to be fiercely independent and self-reliant. She is wary of strangers and quick to defend herself if she feels threatened, but deep down she longs for a sense of connection and belonging that has always eluded her."
100 CP,Ari,Planetary Governor,"Ari is in her early 20s, with a lean, athletic build and an unapologetic tomboyish demeanour. Her clothing and gear are all practical and utilitarian, with a focus on functionality over fashion. Her strawberry blonde hair is typically tied back in a messy ponytail, and her sharp eyes are always scanning the environment for interesting machines and gadgets to tinker with. Ari's love of mechanics is apparent in everything she does, from the way she talks about her work to the grease stains on her fingers. She's constantly taking things apart and putting them back together again, always looking for ways to improve or optimise the machinery around her. Despite her rough exterior, Ari has a quick wit and a sharp tongue that she uses to great effect when dealing with authority figures who try to get in her way. She's fiercely independent and doesn't take kindly to anyone trying to tell her what to do, but her loyalty to those who earn her respect runs deep."
100 CP,Genetor Prima Novae,Planetary Governor,"Genetor Prima Novae’s attention is often consumed by the intricate mechanisms and experiments she runs within her laboratorium. Her once-human form is now interwoven with metal and wires, the lines of circuitry running over her skin like veins. She is single-minded in her pursuit of knowledge, at times losing touch with the social graces of her fellow humans. Her speech patterns are formal and technical, reflecting her deep commitment to the Machine God. Despite her distant demeanour, there is a passion in her eyes that suggests a desire to unlock the secrets of the universe. She is always looking for ways to enhance her own abilities and those of her fellow warriors, even if it means delving into esoteric areas of science. At times, however, she becomes too consumed in her work, pushing herself beyond the limits of what is considered safe or sane. This is when she needs someone to bring her back down to terra, to remind her that there are more important things than the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, and the dangers of unbridled curiosity."
100 CP,Veteran Bodyguard,Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet 1.0,"The battlefield is not a place where technically any sane Jumper should be and since your form here will be significantly reduced, you need to be careful. That is why you need someone to protect your back. This soldier is a grizzled veteran of many battles. She has skill in wielding most of the weapons of the Imperial Guard and even when push comes to shove, she can also handle non-Imperial weaponry due to a rare pass from the inquisition combined with more combat experience than any normal human should ever have to have. How could she get this amount of influence ? Nobody knows. She tends to act like the mother of the squad, always caring for everyone, but especially for you. She will notice, when you are tired and guard you, when you are at your weakest. If you fall asleep at your job, she will give you a lap pillow. Hanging around her for some time will peel more information about her previous work. She used to work for
inquisition as one of the personal kill teams of one of the Inquisitors with huge reach in this part of the space. Which explains why she gets access to more weirder weapons in her arsenal. Her youthful appearance is also a result of rejuvenat treatments as her service to Inquisition was long one. Don’t ask the lady her age, would you ?"

200 CP,Luxury Goods ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"While you are going to be carrying a variety of supplies, luxury goods generally are more profitable when you can sell them. Though these aren't just useless trinkets after all in a war torn death world anything that isn’t food and ammo is a luxury. These items will fill one of the areas in your cargo hold and turn into specialty items that the world you are entering into a deal with will greatly desire. For example if you went to Krieg then the supplies would become master crafted shovels and weapons for their troops. Whereas in a pleasure world it may be a supply of exotic spices and other items meant for enjoyment. "
200 CP,Environmental Adaptations ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"You appear to have gained a beneficial ability considering your line of work. You’ve adapted to extreme environments. You are not bothered by extreme temperatures, pressures, and unusual amounts of gravity.

200 CP,Officer I Swear That’s not Mine,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"Sometimes you’ll find that smuggling just pays so much more than normal trading. If you ever decide you want to give it a try you’ll find out that you were born for it. When it comes to coming up with hiding things and giving excuses you can easily come up with one on the fly. Hide stuff where no one would think of looking and give those workers a perfectly valid reason that no one needs to open the crates. Official inspectors will be struck by sudden cases of laziness or be called away to deal with more important things when you're trying to hide something. Just don’t push it, no matter how good you are trying to smuggle a titan or something equally large will still pose an immense challenge."
200 CP,How Dare You ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,It appears years of building up a friendly reputation has paid off. If someone attacks you without justification such as a pirate looking for a payday or a greedy governor confiscating your goods then someone will come to your aid. In the case of the pirates maybe the local Space Marine chapter was traveling close by and received your distress call. Seeing it was you they didn’t hesitate to send out ships to assist you. In the case of the governor maybe you unknowingly aided an inquisitor a few years ago and seeing the trouble they decided to arrest the governor for abusing their power. 
200 CP,Rosie the Riveter,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"Rosie was drafted from her work in a Voidship construction and repair yard. She has a tendency to wear a somewhat bulky void suit that don't entirely hide her curves, and keeps her hair short so it doesn't get caught in things or cause inconvenience when wearing a vac suit. While not a member of the Cult Mechanicus, she is instructed in the basics of secular repair techniques, and has a good feel for finding her way through the often maze-like interior of Imperial ships. She has a void suit and set of tools, as well as a rivet gun that has been converted into a rough and unwieldy but effective autopistol. If you are an Enlisted Crewmember, she's in your same duty detail"

They have a maximum sustainable acceleration of 2.1 gravities. Vagabonds are equipped with a dorsal and a prow mount for weapons, as well as an array of defensive turrets."
200 CP,A Death World,Planetary Governor,"This is a planet that is extremely hazardous to human life, often due to hostile environments, deadly fauna and flora, or extreme weather conditions. These planets are among the most dangerous and inhospitable places in the galaxy, and only the hardiest and most skilled individuals can hope to survive on them. Death Worlds are typically uninhabitable by humans, although they may be visited or even colonised for strategic or resource reasons. The creatures that inhabit Death Worlds are often much larger and more ferocious than those found on habitable planets, and may possess lethal natural weapons or highly venomous stings or bites. Despite their dangers, Death Worlds are often highly valued by the Imperium for their strategic resources, such as rare minerals or biological specimens, and are frequently the sites of military or scientific expeditions. They are also sometimes used as training grounds for elite soldiers or as arenas for gladiatorial combat."
200 CP,A Frontier World ,Planetary Governor,"A planet that lies at the edge of settled space and represents a point of contact between the established galactic powers and the unknown, untamed regions beyond. Frontier Worlds are often newly colonised and lack the infrastructure, technology, and protection of more established planets. Life on a Frontier World can be brutal and difficult, with colonists facing harsh climates, dangerous wildlife, and a host of other challenges as they attempt to build a new home for themselves. Despite these hardships, Frontier Worlds are also places of great potential and opportunity. Rich mineral deposits, rare resources, and unexplored alien ruins may lie just beyond the next ridge or over the next horizon. The pioneering spirit of those who settle Frontier Worlds can lead to the discovery of new technologies, new species, and new ways of thinking about the universe.. An unguarded Frontier World can be a tempting target for raiders, pirates, or other hostile forces, while well-defended, it can serve as a launching point for exploration, expansion, and conquest."
200 CP,A Feudal World ,Planetary Governor,"A type of planet characterised by a social structure and technology level resembling that of Medieval Europe. These worlds are often isolated, and their inhabitants are ruled by powerful nobles or warlords who maintain a feudal system of governance. On Feudal Worlds, the ruling class maintains a monopoly on advanced technology, and often uses it to reinforce their power over the common people. This can lead to a wide technological gap between the ruling class and the rest of the population, with the masses often lacking even basic tools and infrastructure. The ruling class is often made up of powerful knights or warriors, who may command vast armies of soldiers or retainers. These rulers maintain their power through a combination of military might, political alliances, and religious influence. Despite their relatively low level of technology, Feudal Worlds can be strategically important to the Imperium of Man, as they may contain valuable resources or serve as recruiting grounds for Space Marine chapters. As a result, the Imperium often maintains a presence on Feudal Worlds, whether through military occupation, missionary work, or diplomatic overtures."
200 CP,A Feral World,Planetary Governor,"This is a type of planet that is characterised by its primitive, often barbaric, culture and low technological development. These worlds are often isolated anddifficult to access, making them challenging to govern and integrate into the wider Imperium of Man. Feral Worlds are also known for their harsh and unforgiving  nvironments, which have shaped the cultures of their inhabitants. These worlds may be covered in dense jungles, icy tundras, or scorching deserts, and the people who live there have learned to survive and thrive in these extreme conditions. Feral Worlds are also home to a variety of dangerous creatures, from vicious predators to hostile tribes of humanoids. These threats have made the people of Feral Worlds hardy and resilient, but also deeply suspicious of outsiders. Despite their challenges, Feral Worlds are often valuable resources for the Imperium, providing valuable raw materials or serving as recruiting grounds for Space Marine chapters. As a result, the Imperium maintains a presence on many Feral Worlds, whether through military occupation, missionary work, or diplomatic overtures."
200 CP,An Agri-World,Planetary Governor,"An Agri-World is a planet that is dedicated to the production of food and other agricultural products for the Imperium of Man. These planets are characterised by their vast, sprawling farms, orchards, and ranches, which often cover much of the planet's surface. Agri-Worlds are among the most important and prized planets in the Imperium, as they are responsible for feeding billions of people across hundreds or even thousands of star systems. The crops and livestock produced on these planets are often genetically modified or bred for maximum efficiency and yield, and may be processed or shipped to other worlds for consumption or further refinement.Because of their critical importance, Agri-Worlds are not always idyllic or peaceful places. Many of them face threats from raiders, pirates, or hostile alien races, and may be subject to the same tithes and demands as other planets in the Imperium. In addition, the intensive agricultural practices used on Agri-Worlds can sometimes lead to environmental degradation or depletion of resources, creating long-term challenges for the planet's sustainability."

The Space Hulk's exterior is scarred and pitted from countless battles and collisions, and the twisted metal and debris that make up its structure seem to defy the laws of physics. The Space Hulk's interior is a labyrinthine maze of corridors, chambers, and rooms, some of which are still functional and powered, while others are shrouded in darkness and filled with danger. The ship's advanced technology is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, as they are often unpredictable and have been known to unleash sudden and catastrophic events. Despite its appearance, the Space Hulk is a tempting prize for those brave or desperate enough to risk exploring it. It is rumoured to contain vast treasures of lost technologies, ancient artefacts, and valuable resources. However, the ship is also known to be infested with dangerous creatures and hostile forces, both of which can be deadly to any unwary traveller who ventures inside."

They may be targeted by criminals, rival factions, or even hostile alien forces who seek to disrupt the hedonistic lifestyle of their inhabitants. To protect against these threats, Pleasure Worlds may rely on security forces such as the Adeptus Arbites or private armies hired by the world's wealthy patrons.

With this perk that's a concern of the past. You can now touch everything you see and engage in diplomatic relations without worrying about diseases. You can't get or spread diseases with this perk. Though anything that someone would improve you without consequences would be allowed through.

Whenever someone tries to compete against you they will keep running into bad luck.

The Jokaero look like orangutans from ancient Terra, but possess an unparalleled (and apparently instinctive) understanding of technology. They are also impossible to confine, merely inventing whatever it takes to escape, but show little regard for their miniature technological marvels, easily discarding the devices once their use is done. This one appears to be a little more directable than most, however. As well as capering all over the ship; fixing, repairing, and miniaturizing whatever takes it's strange fancy, it will keep returning to your side and will gladly turn it's attention to whatever you point it towards. As it completely ignores everyone else on the ship, you can expect a mix of envy and privilege depending on your current position."

As a devout follower of the Saint Thor, she radiates a dim light much like her patrons sanctity, calming souls in her vicinity, a calm she can in turn share with her sermons.

A particular steel alloy of which the proper method of forging has long been lost and the modern alloy providing worse results, true Moebian Steel is far more durable than mundane steel allowing for better protection at similar weight, or similar protection at lower weight. Prismata Crystals, on the other hand, are used to make heavy-duty, large las weaponry. They’re pretty rare and highly sought after for military applications. Ten ingots of Moebian Steel and a small crate of Prismata Crystals come to you per week, and you can either use them to forge your own items or barter with various individuals to get better deals or special prices. Or you can just sell them. That’s also an option."

A warship filled with such technology that many Mechanicus members would do anything for the slightest chance to step onboard and learn its secrets. A warship filled with enough weaponry that it alone could shatter planets, destroy fleets, and lay waste to star systems. However, the Dracothion initially was meant for something far more: exploration, discovery, and learning. The Nameless King's journey kept to the original purpose of
Dracothion, allowing scientists, engineers, scholars, teachers, and others to come aboard to learn from the ship's massive data banks of forgotten knowledge.” A mighty warship created by the Dark Age of Technology for the Primarch to take command of. As mentioned above this is not meant to be a warship, but instead functions as one due to the size and power of its weapons. The ship from tip to tip is approximately 90km compared to the standard 26km of a Gloriana class."

600 CP,Rewards of Conquest ,Generic Warhammer 40K: FanFiction,"One of the main concerns about conquering someone and taking everything they had away from them is that they will hate you, perhaps even attempt to rebel against you. This doesn’t seem to happen to you. Anything that you gain through combat will become rightfully yours. This includes personal duels, fights your army performs, or anyone that acts in your name. Planets that you conquer will become loyal and you won't ever have to worry about betrayal, unless outside forces interfere. This will also work on people as well. For example, if you face an enemy champion and beat them, you could choose to spare them. This would allow you to recruit them. They may not necessarily be happy, but they will become loyal enough not to betray you. In addition this will never be against you or affect you negatively. That way you don’t have to worry about someone pretending to be you and falsifying orders. "
600 CP,Ambition Class,Warhammer 40k Imperial Navy jump 1.02,"While the Imperial Navy is far and away the largest purchaser of warships in the Imperium, but they are not the only one, and rarely even full cruisers may be commissioned from scratch by extremely wealthy individuals, such as Rogue Traders. They invariably include the most opulent and luxurious quarters, and frequently favor efficiency over some of the super-redundant redundancies of Navy designs. The Ambition is one such design. Some navy commentators have opined that it's likely to be more brittle than “true” cruisers, but to date no record of any battle between one and a navy cruiser has come to light to prove or disprove that assertion. Ambitions are 4.9km long and 2km abeam at the fins, and mass 25 megatonns. They carry a complement of 89,000 crew, and have a maximum sustainable acceleration of 3 gravities. Ambitions are armed with 1 Prow weapon spot, and 2 each to Port and Starboard, as well as 2 arrays of point defense turrets."
600 CP,Knight World ,Imperium of Man,"Many of those coming from noble Knight houses are overseers of their own planets, offering the natives protection in return for obedience and servitude. You too are now the owner of your very own feudal world, where although the general state of living is akin to the medieval ages, it does house all of the amenities needed to keep the Imperial Knights in tip top shape. All upon the planet will submit to your rule completely and utterly."
600 CP,Rogue Trader,Warhammer 40K: Imperial Navy,"It looks like you aren’t a lower deck rating after all. You are, in fact, a Rogue Trader. A Noble of the Imperium. Rogue Traders are some of the most fortunate beings in the entire galaxy of the 40k setting, with a broad range of privileges most comparable to an Inquisitor, and without the same responsibilities. Rogue Traders are empowered to act in the Imperium’s name and interests beyond the border of the Imperium itself. Beyond the borders of the Imperium their word is, at least theoretically, the word of the Emperor himself, so long as they are acting in the interests of the Imperium. To this end, they are legally empowered to acquire and operate void ships, even military grade ones, and raise, equip, and maintain private armies. They may trade both within and without the Imperium, but theoretically their immunity is only effective outside the border. As much in the Imperium, theory & practice don’t always match. Within the borders of the Imperium their power and authority fluctuates with their wealth and other assets, but is generally equivalent to that of a Planetary Governor. You will find that in future jumps you will enjoy the same authority and latitude."
