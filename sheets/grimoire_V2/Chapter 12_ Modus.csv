1,,Free,New World Online Character         ,Bofuri,Modus,"New World Online (NWO) is an MMORPG played by many people. Including you. However, your abilities and items you gain inside the game are able to be used outside the game. This includes the inventory and items, the levels and stats, the interface, and all the skills. 

At least, once the Jump duration is up. Right now your NWO stuff stays in the game.

If you die in real life, you do not immediately truly die as long as one other member of the Jumpchain party has a resurrection ability. You will instead only die or require the usage of a one-up once the time limit for that resurrection ability expires. We’ve only seen one example of that in NWO, though.

Your perks and powers will work inside videogames you play. (Though you may toggle this if you want to play fair.) When using these powers inside a game, they will not originate from your actual body. No need to worry about accidentally destroying your stuff if you need to get video-game slimes off yourself, for example.

(Note: abilities and perks that operate autonomously to protect your body will still do so in the real world.)"
2,,Free,Artificer,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"Your kind didn’t make the cut in the original game, but the artificiers of the
realms certainly exists. You combine technology and magic in a perfect harmony. Being a
master of invention, you can use magic and ingenuity to unlock the potential within objects.
You are not as strong as a pure wizard, but you are just as (if not more) versatile in your abilities.
You are a talented combatant and a decent spellcaster that uses their tools as focus. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
3,,Free,Barbarian,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"Your power comes from the fire of primal rage burning within you. Your
source of rage may vary, but the important part is that you are angry and will SMASH any
opponents that stand in your way. You are the most durable class there is and your hurts pack
quite a punch as well. Raise your weapon barbarian and break anyone who dares obstruct you. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
4,,Free,Bard,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"Scholars, skalds or scoundrels, you have a way with words so that you can even
bend reality to your whims. Your talent in manipulating the Weave comes from rhythms, words,
songs or even dances. You can inspire your allies, manipulate your foes and pretty much do
anything a magic user can accomplish. Not only that, but your skill repertoire is also quite vast
too. You are the most versatile class there is, a jack of all trades truly. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
5,,Free,Cleric,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"Gods are forbidden from meddling in mortal affairs. But that is where you come
into play. You are a devoted of a certain deity which you must pick, when you first select this
class. The god or goddess you serve grants you power through your faith and beliefs, allowing
you to perform miracles of any kind. You are truly the embodiment of divine magic. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
6,,Free,Druid,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"You claim no mastery over nature, rather you are an extension of its will. You
can call pure force nature to command elemental forces, summon aid, heal wounds and even
shapeshift into bestial forms. You are nature’s guardian and fury both. You are probably a tree
hugger though. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
7,,Free,Fighter,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"Some say fighters are the most basic of all classes. They cannot be more wrong
as no other class may hold the pure mastery of combat itself that fighters possess. You are a
master all weapons, armor and all forms of fighting. Both ranged and melee, there is no one
better than you. Just in case be ready for the ridicule, if you are planning on picking human as
a race. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
8,,Free,Monk,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"You are able to tap into your inner ki, and with this your body itself has become
your weapon. When channeling your ki, few can match your combat prowess, defense ability,
speed, deftness and subtlety. Be careful of how you spend your ki reserves though, your prowess
drops heavily without access to it. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
9,,Free,Paladin,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"You swore an oath. This oath binds you to follow a certain path of life and
tenets. But if you are able to keep to your word, few can match your divine power combined
with your already great martial prowess. Though be mindful of your oath’s tenets. If you break
them, you may lose access to your divine abilities unless you restore your oath back. Or you
could go down a darker path for more power. You may choose to devote yourself to service of
a god or you could just use your oath as a source of your power. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
10,,Free,Ranger,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"You are the perfect tracker, hunter, and protector that keeps civilizations safe
from threats both within and outside. Whatever your preferred ground for prowling is, you are
a master of it and can take the meaning of ‘use environment to your advantage’ saying to the
next level. Few can match your pace in the wilds and difficult terrains, and in terms of subtlety
and expertism, only rogues and bards may exceed you in sheer versatility. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
11,,Free,Rogue,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"You are the ultimate embodiment of skill, stealth and opportunity. You strike
your foes vulnerability, while being elusive yourself. You know all the tricks in the book, when
it comes to fighting dirty and streetwise smarts (you may even add some yourself too). When
you put your mind and wit to it, there is nothing you can do rogue. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
12,,Free,Sorceror,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"Let those wizards study their books and clerics pray to their deities for meagre
pittance of magical might. Yours is the purest form of the Weave sorcerer, as you draw your
power from deep within. Your blood or ancestry (up to your choice) grants you prodigious
amounts of magical potential. Although you lack the versatility and wide range of abilities of
wizards and the like, none can match your sheer might in arcane prowess. Also, you are the
only class who can manipulate the nature of the very spells you cast. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
13,,Free,Warlock,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"At your core, you are a seeker of knowledge... or power if you prefer, it leads
all leads to the same road at the end. Through pacts made with otherworldly and powerful
beings, you gained access to an arcane might few can even dream of achieving. Nature of your
pact and patron may be determined by you, as well as the severity of your pact and your
relationship with your patron (you don’t need to sell your soul for power basically, although
you may be into that, I won’t judge). Your patron may sometimes require favors and the like,
but it won’t be anything debilitating unless you choose the relevant drawbacks. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
14,,Free,Wizard,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"Wizard, you alone have the potential to reach the pinnacle of all creation with
your shrewd mind and arcane potential. No one can even become as half good as you are, when
it comes to matters of the arcane. Although some may call you frail or weak, in time you may
compensate for all your weaknesses with the appropriate spell or ritual. Temper your ambition
with wisdom though, this path has been the doom of many wizards. Just ask poor Karsus. Note that all stats and abilities start at 0 without supplemental perks."
15,,Free,Sorothustran Sorcery,A Mage of Sorothustra,Modus,"Sorothustran magi are powerful magic users capable of using a
myriad of magical disciplines with fantastical finesse and frightening skill. The most powerful and
famous, as well as infamous, Sorothustran sorcerers categorized their sorcery into four broad
categories: Iron Law, Nornic Fractal, Wild Dream, and Chaos Calculus. Each of these broad
schools of arcane skill and thought has unique quirks and strengths, and you can pick one to
specialize in. You can use magic related to that school with greater precision, faster, easier, and
are better at piercing defenses and ignoring antimagic when you harness magic related to this
school of thaumaturgical thought.
Iron Law is the school of magic that focuses on construction, maintenance, defense, and
paradoxically destruction as well. This school is incredibly effective at stopping magic, chaos,
and most forms of reality warping. In simple terms, this school is good at both offense and
defense and is an excellent, and at least initially, simple school. True mastery of this school
allows you to be the one who decides what withstands the test of time, and what will become
forgotten, buried under the sands of time.
Nornic Fractal is the school of Sorothustran magic that deals with life, intelligence, and destiny.
Even novices of this school gain enhanced affinity with magic such as awakenings, biomancy,
healing, and minor divinations. Masters of this arcane discipline have powerful life-manipulation
abilities and can also prodigiously predict the future, at least barring things with fate
manipulation or immunity to scrying and future-sight intervening to change the future.
Wild Dream is about massive-scale and incredibly potent magic. Dreamers who have walked
down the wild road are tremendously powerful mages whose magic is boosted to star-scale but
they lack the same level of focus and precision as the other Sorothustrans do (at least by
default). This magic is centered around change and is powered by desire, growing stronger
based on how much you want something and the more determined you are to get it. Masters of
this school of magic are arcane titans who specialize in enacting grandiose changes to reality.
Chaos Calculus is the school of magic that is focused on precision, plots, methodical
breakthroughs, and planning. This school of magic and ritual craft allows you to perform faster,
cheaper, more effective rituals that tend to be more effective than the rituals done by other
Sorothustrans, which in and of itself allows you to circumvent the most common limitation for
Sorothustran magic: magic above star-scale requiring rituals.

16,,Free,Level 6,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"Where so many others failed, you succeeded. You are the apex of the Power
Development Curriculum, one who reaches heaven while yet mortal. We don’t really know what
this entails, but your computational abilities are actively ridiculous, your personal reality is utterly
perfect, and the psychic powers you possess are hilariously potent and incredibly esoteric. You
also seem to have a superhuman body, but that’s mostly covered by your angelic traits.
Requires Level Up, I’m Stronger, Coffin Technician, and the scientific version of Artificial Angel."
17,,Free,Demon God,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"Select one style of magic you learned here. While you aren’t a demon, you
have now mastered that style to the point where you can use it to twist the entire universe, and
not only command but create the “phases” that layer and compose the world. You are also very
nearly immortal, blatantly superhuman, and immensely powerful besides. Furthermore, you
have overcome the Omnipotence Paradox, allowing you to use this power freely, and unlike
other Majin, you are not impacted by the perceptions and beliefs of others. Requires Sorcerer,
I’m Stronger, Coffin Technician, and the magical version of Artificial Angel."
18,,Free,Dark One,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Modus,"​Fighting using magic is one thing. Maybe a good thing, maybe a bad
thing, who knows? And really, who cares? Because you can go far, far beyond fighting with
magic. You can wage a War with magic. Your abilities at using your abilities in combat skyrockets and evolves, taking an entirely more advanced form. To begin with, you can toss around wide, area-effect versions of any magic you
can normally do, letting you throw your curses against fortresses and armies instead of
individual people. This takes more energy, obviously, but far, far lesser than it normally should. Something to the
effect of a tenth as much. And that’s for systems that actually cost any power to cast magic in
the first place. You can do this in reverse also, ‘shrinking’ spells meant for battles and sieges to
use them in one on one duels.

19,,Free,The Dragon Reborn,The Wheel of Time Jump,Modus,"You gain four centuries worth of knowledge and experience from
the Age of Legends, alongside both the skill and experience in
every single Talent and Affinity you have to equal Lews Therin,
capable of weaving tens of thousands of weaves at once. You also
know the weave Balefire.
When a target is struck with balefire, its thread in the Pattern is
destroyed, in an amount proportional to the power of the balefire
strike. This translates to both the target's existence, and actions up
to a certain point, being retroactively erased. Additionally, balefire
will only travel a certain distance and will only penetrate through
so much solid matter, depending on the amount of Power behind
it. The stronger the blast, the farther it will travel, and the more
matter it will be able to consume before extinguishing. You do not
have to fear Balescreams, nor do you have to fear cracks in the
fabric of reality. You can control exactly how far back someone is
erased, and can choose to truly erase your target, even preventing
reincarnation. It does however naturally prevent resurrection, as
the soul is put beyond time. You can make Balefire much stronger
than normal using less power than usual.

have equal amount from every other Ajah, with over four hundred
years of experience. You also know the Flame of Tar Valon weave,
which is a direct counter to Balefire.
This weave as a direct counter and opposite to balefire, is a weave
of pure creation as opposed to balefire's pure destruction. This
""Flame"" is able to stop a blow of balefire, and on anyone who have
given themselves to the shadow or any other dark power will find
the flame being incredibly effective on them, capable of
crystallizing bodies from the inside out like freezing them in ice. A
multihued, beautiful crystal will grow from whatever is burned,
uncut and rough. The weave can also be used to repair any
damage done to the fabric of reality.

ending a tapestry. Fate is yours to play with and manipulate but doing so too often in the
same world can cause fate to bind you in its weave once more should you desire you

just a fragment that you can manipulate. (Removes the time limit on the things you can
do with fate from the Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos perks but won’t protect from the

single grand change to the weave, warping every stand from past to future (examples:
wipe out all men/woman so now the world is only made up of woman/men who have
adapted to this change, grant every single person wings, make it so people have
soulmates (maybe add timer on their arm counting down to when they meet or a mark
that only them and their soulmate will have), any change made will not impact the main
plot of the world since the change has always been that way since as far back in the
past as anyone can remember.

Their real strengths lie in their mastery of enhancing and enfeebling skills when within a party, and leveraging their many ""trades"" against their enemies when fighting alone."
40,,Free,Die Ewigkeit,Dies Irae,Modus,"There is great power in this world and that power comes in many kinds. But there is only one kind that might eventually lead to the very top. Ewigkeit is the name of a magical process wherein a special prepared artefact, known as an Ahnenerbe or Relic, is bonded to the soul of the subject in order to grant them both magical power and the ability to grow even more powerful. Not every magical item may qualify as a Relic, though the bulk of information on them will be described later. For now, the benefits of Ewigkeit and the process through which it works will be described. 

Ewigkeit users grow via the devouring of souls. The more souls and the higher quality those souls, the stronger the user will grow. Over time, these souls are slowly used up as fuel, though only a few are burnt at a time and even in constant combat this can take hours of work to get through even a small number. A Ewigkeit user can devour souls by either physically eating them, killing beings with their relics or killing them with their supernatural powers. With practice, a user can also draw in every corpse and soul around them automatically, eating even down to the little drops of blood or fragments of spirit in a small area around themselves. 

Ewigkeit boosts almost every aspect of the user and continues to boost these aspects even more as more souls are taken in. The physical strength and speed of the user will grow without regard to whether the body of the user fits it. Their durability will also grow, including their entire bodies so that even normally soft parts such the eyeballs are harder than diamonds. Their bodies become more and more resistant to any kind of poison, drug or disease, to the point that most users see no enjoyment from alcohol or recreational drugs. It is possible to, with concentration, suppress this resistance to drugs for a time. An Ewigkeit user also finds themselves less and less in need of physical sustenance or rest as they grow stronger, eventually ascending beyond the need for eating or sleeping. 

The users five physical senses heighten as their power grows, eventually to the point of picking apart individual heartbeats across a school campus or picking out the wrinkles and hairs on someone’s face from across a city or even higher. Ewigkeit users also gain a Third Eye, a sense that allows them to perceive magic, souls and hidden things. The greater the power of the user, the harder it is to hide things from them with supernatural means.  This Third Eye can work on a 360 degree radius if concentrated on and this may eventually be trained to become constant. 

A Ewigkeit user loses the need for their physical form, surviving so long as their soul is maintained no matter the damage their bodies receive. The Relics that Ewigkeit users wield are able to strike at the soul but they are otherwise ultimately immune to most normal humans. They are also able to regenerate their physical bodies at astonishing speeds to match those they move at and, so long as they have devoured souls still remaining within them, even extend this to regenerate their own soul so long as it is not yet destroyed. 

The innate magical might of a user will now also grow as their spiritual might does. The more souls gathered within you, the more that your magical spells and abilities will find themselves empowered. Obviously, any spiritual abilities will also find themselves growing stronger as your soul is bolstered by the presence of your devoured prey. As well as increasing their raw power, the user’s resistance to all kinds of supernatural effects will grow as their souls do. Resistances to raw supernatural power, to the unique conceptual abilities wielded by some, to manipulation of physical reality or time or space. While this will not progress to immunity, a Ewigkeit user becomes harder and harder to harm or effect as they grow. 

The presence of a Ewigkeit user grows as well. Just being near an Ewigkeit user that is not actively suppressing their power makes one feel like they are near a giant and those with thousands or millions of souls can feel like unbeatable titans to those weaker than them. This also manifests in the killing intent of the users, as they gain the ability to emit their murderous intent on a dangerous level. The more souls you possess, the stronger this will grow. Stopping a man’s heart, shattering concrete around you and melting an entire steel bridge are all possible if you grow strong enough, whilst a Hadou God can kill the body and soul of anything beneath its level with just this desire to destroy. If you try to train this, you will eventually be able to attack with just your killing intent, unleashing physical blows just by looking at something. 

Beyond the power they gain from holding them, a Ewigkeit user also has other ways to interact with souls that they devour. Stored inside your soul, most devoured are instantly subsumed. It is possible to look into those devoured souls and take out the knowledge they possess, though it takes a great will to handle doing this to more than a few souls at a time. 

A Ewigkeit user is not immortal however. Their souls cannot stand more than a century or so of
continued existence without breaking apart, though this can be extended for another century with magic. Those who reach a certain level of development in Ewigkeit can overcome this and if you possess a different sort of soul from another world, you will not be subject to this either. While they may eventually break apart, a user will not physically or mentally degrade through the passage of time during their life. 

Next will be described the four stages of Ewigkeit use, as well as where you start and how you progress from each level to the next. 

Assiah is the first stage, known as Activation. All those who have at least a single soul, their own, and undergo the formula begin here. At this point, you have not yet become able to give your Ahnenerbe physical form. You are still able to briefly manifest it but only in a phantom state, such as summoning a ghostly sword to stab something that you thrust your hand at. Normally, users at this state are only slightly stronger than normal people and still able to be harmed by guns, though they can run faster than any modern car, jump tens of metres into the air and kill men in a single blow. 

Yetzirah is the second stage, known as Formation. To proceed here, one must devour at least a hundred souls, though more may be required if their spiritual quality is low. The more powerful or spiritually developed a soul, the more valuable, tasty and beneficial it is. At this stage you will be able to give your relic a permanent physical form, though you can continue to recall it. Those at this stage go far beyond what is humanly possible. They can destroy buildings with a single blow, run faster enough to move across water or through the air by kicking hard enough. Their laughter alone can crack pavement or kill ordinary men. 

Briah is the third stage, also known as Creation Figment. Around a thousand souls are needed for this stage as well as requiring you to become aware of your deepest desire and gather enough willpower to force it to manifest in reality. This stage is not innately more powerful other than the new power you gain and beyond this point, any power increase will usually come from just having more souls eaten. This Briah stage is special in that it grants you a Law or Creation Figment. A special power based on your deepest desire. They come in two varieties. The Hadou/Hegemony that is focused on external effects and the Gudou/Transcendent that is focused on the internal effects. These abilities will be described in detail at a later Briah section. 

Atziluth, Emanation, is the fourth and final stage of Ewigkeit. It is not a stage achievable by anyone and indeed, you must be specifically born with the potential to be one or have that potential granted by an existing Atziluth user to become one. To those who possess the potential, the exact conditions to reach this stage are unclear, often involving special rituals or bonds with existing Gods. The users who reach this stage become known as Gods, for they rule over and above all things. Their Creation Figment emanates from them to cover the entire multiverse permanently and allow them to freely warp reality in all areas affected by their law. They become incomprehensibly immense beings, akin to walking universes or something even greater, ascending beyond all dimensions, concepts and truths. With just a brief flash of rage, one of these beings could destroy all of existence. An Atziluth user also gains the ability to create a Legion, summoning souls that they have devoured to serve them as warriors that have been scaled up to fight on the level of a God as well. The current ruler of existence is one of these beings but it is possible for more than one God to exist at once. In these cases, they are almost always driven to fight by their nature and do so by a combination of their competing Laws and a special substance known as Taikyoku. Effectively a measurement of their power, the number of Taikyoku that a God possesses indicates their strength compared to other Gods. 

The Ewigkeit process may be refused if you wish but you must also give up access to the Relic and Briah sections if you do so. You begin at the Assiah stage unless you are part of the LDO, in which case you begin at the Yetzirah stage.

Note: Comes with the Free level of the associated Limit, Ahnenerbe and Briah Perks. Upgrades available in the grimoire."
41,,Free,Basic Training,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"Everyone has to start somewhere. No matter who you started as in this place, you've got the basic knowledge any magic user has. You know the core arts of Reinforcement, Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft at an average level. Reinforcement is the enhancement of the functions of beings or objects through magical energy. You could make yourself as strong and fast as an Olympic athlete or enhance your senses to the best of human ability and so on, or you could increase the sharpness of a sword to cut through steel or the durability of a shield to endure small calibre firearms with ease. Things can only be reinforced so much at a particular skill level before they simply explode from overstuffing. Gradation Air is shaping magical energy into the form of an item, which temporarily becomes real. You could make a sturdy but mundane sword or shield with this, though they would not last more than a few minutes at a time. Hypnosis is the basic form of mind control all Magi learn to use. It can be easily shrugged off by any supernatural being or magic user at this level but manipulating ordinary humans is quite easy and only those with exceptional willpower be able to resist the use of this without magic to back them up. Formalcraft, generally considered magecraft for dummies, is a way for Magi to use the mana in the air, along with sacrifices or ritual preparation, to make casting spells easier or possible at all for those with little personal magical energy. All of these can be improved with time, sometimes to terrifying levels, but it will take effort and time. "
42,,Free,Semblance,RWBY,Modus,"A Semblance is the manifestation of one's innate and personal power as an ability unique to each individual, with the effects varying greatly from user to user. With the sheer number of people unlocking their Semblances, it can lead to unrelated people gaining similar abilities. The nature of one's Semblance is noted as representing an aspect of their character. It is a tangible projection of ones Aura and Auras ‘fuel’ Semblances. Running out of Aura usually means your Semblance is gone as well till you can recharge it.

Usually people don’t get to choose what their semblance is. However given your circumstances you get to. Lucky you huh?

Semblances come in all kinds of variations. It is impossible to truly classify all of them but with the below options you can clarify what your Semblance can and cant do.

Semblances can evolve over time as they are like muscles and are able to grow. Sometimes they might even develop new abilities altogether. Yours is no exception and the below options merely clarify what you start out with. A Rank 4 in Power might one day Develop into a Rank 5 for example.

You get 400 SP (Semblance Points) to customize their Semblance. This may be purchased multiple times, and be used in any RWBY jump doc, such as The Games We Play.

43,,Free,Inscryption,Inscryption,Modus,"At its core, Inscryption is a simple game.

Two players take alternating turns. Each turn begins with drawing a card from your deck and adding it to your hand. Using a variety of resource mechanics, you may then play those cards out on one of several lanes on the board. Once your turn is done, your cards attack the enemy, dealing damage to your opponent’s cards if there are any in the same lane, and dealing damage to the opponent otherwise. Each point of damage tips the scales beside the board, and each point of damage from your opponent will tip the scales in the other direction. If the scales tip in one direction by five or more points, that player loses.

That’s the baseline, but over time there have been countless variations. TCG, CCG, roguelike, puzzle, metroidvania, Inscryption has flirted with a variety of alternate rules and genres over the years. During the jump, which versions of Inscryption you play (if any) depends upon the course of events as they occur. In this section, however, you’ll be deciding the nature of the game you take with you to future jumps, once this is all over. First, let’s get the basics out of the way.

THE CHALLENGE:
When physical conflict is imminent, be it by an ambush from wild beasts or out-of-control robots, you may initiate a round of Inscryption in its place. The space involved will fill with a proportionate game board, and your adversaries will take the form of living cards, occupying spots in the lanes opposite you. Reinforcements or additional forces will also arrive in the form of animate cards. The exact stats and abilities of these cards will vary depending on the enemy, but will generally reflect their true abilities in battle. If your opposition has a leader, that leader will act as your opponent in the game, playing cards and using abilities as appropriate. At the conclusion of the game, the loser’s defeat will be reflected in reality, by incapacitation, death, or other loss; whatever the stakes would have been in ordinary strife. (If it was something like a friendly spar, of course, the results of an Inscryption round will be equally non-injurious.)

THE SCALES:
These were mentioned above, but let’s recap. Damage dealt to either player will tip the scales towards them. Tip the scale five points in one direction, and that player loses. Tip the scale by more than five, and you can keep the extra as foils.

After the jump, this gets some enhancements to account for your interdimensional antics. Firstly, the weight required to tip the scale will adjust to the fortitude of the players; if twice as tough as an ordinary person, it will require 10 points to knock that person out. (If there is no player on the opposite side of the board, 5 remains the default.) Second, if your foe can resurrect or has successive forms, the scale will reset between each, requiring you to tip it in their direction again.

THE DECK:
It’s not a card game without one of these. Every card you collect will automatically go in your deck, which will summon itself to you at the initiation of a round of Inscryption if you didn’t have it handy. If you do not have a deck (such as after avoiding an otherwise-fatal loss with Outside The Screen), you cannot initiate a round of Inscryption.

By paying 100 bytes, you gain the ability to alter your deck freely, adding or removing cards as you please. Your deck must have at least 20 cards; if you have less than 20 cards total, you must use all of them. You may also pay 100 bytes to split your deck into two smaller decks, choosing which to draw from each turn.

THE LANES:
Four lanes on your side of the board, four lanes on their side. Each card on the board, friendly or foe, takes up one lane on their side. If an enemy is going to arrive shortly, but isn’t quite here yet, they appear in a third lane behind the enemy’s lane, and move forward after a turn if the way is clear. After this jump, the number of lanes will depend on the size of the area; a narrow hallway could have one lane, a wide arena ten.

THE BELL:
The least complicated part of the game. When you ring the bell, your turn ends. All allies on your side of the board attack, and then your foe’s turn begins. It’s really just that easy."
44,,Free,True Magic,Final Fantasy VIII,Modus,"The real deal. This magic is capable of everything para-magic is and more, with every Sorceress specializing in one field in particular. Choose any one element or other aspect of reality to focus your magic around. This isn't the only kind of magic you're capable of, but it does play part in your theming and includes your most powerful magic. Canon examples include ice, force (non-elemental magic), space, and time. Outside of all of what para-magic can do and magic tied to your element, all Sorceresses are capable of telekinesis, teleportation within a short range, telepathy, mind control (including lesser beguiling and emotional manipulation, like stirring a crowd into a frenzy) and mental possession which can be resisted by willpower, imbuing inanimate objects with life, creating barriers, phasing through solid matter, creating illusions, and enhanced strength and endurance beyond that natural to humans. All of these take time and practice to master, which may be quite a while when the only Sorceress around to teach you would rather possess you than bother giving lessons. By being granted another Sorceresses power at their death, you can increase your own even further, but not change or expand your theme."
45,,Free,Jujutsu(Base),Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"In this world, all but a few humans possess a form of spiritual energy known as cursed energy, which is produced when feeling negative emotions such as anger, fear, or grief. Most humans, however, they have no control over this energy. As such, it leaks freely from their body, causing it to congregate and coalesce into cursed spirits. There are an incredibly rare few who are born with the ability to control this cursed energy, though – people known as sorcerers.

You are now one of these sorcerers, granting you the ability to manipulate your own cursed energy. While you aren’t capable of anything particularly special with this alone, there are a good number of benefits to this. For one, you are able to perceive cursed spirits and other spiritual entities with your senses, something usually impossible for non-sorcerers without specialised tools. Additionally, you’re able to channel this cursed energy into your body to enhance your physical abilities to superhuman levels, with greater results coming from greater investments. 

The above are but the most basic of uses of cursed energy – for more specialised and powerful ones, you’ll need cursed techniques. With this alone, you’re capable of some basic barrier techniques, which let you create (often spherical) walls of cursed energy to close off an area. The most common form of this is a curtain: a large, pitch black sphere that prevents those outside the barrier from seeing what’s happening within. Barriers can also be hardened to make entry or exit more difficult, though be aware that the more difficult it is to leave a barrier, the easier it is to enter and vice versa. In addition, you also have the capability to summon shikigami: creatures resembling cursed spirits created from your cursed energy. These require an intermediary such as a talisman to summon, tend to be rather straightforward in terms of abilities, and won’t be particularly strong, though this may be changed with some practice.

Unfortunately, aside from barriers and simple shikigami most cursed techniques are innate, and as such cannot be learned. It’s also entirely possible for a sorcerer to be born without a cursed technique, and as such you will not receive one from this alone. The Cursed Technique section later on will allow you to purchase one for yourself, though certain other, riskier methods may also allow you to obtain one.

Perhaps unexpectedly, the amount of cursed energy a sorcerer has is also something determined at birth. By default, you have a rather good talent for jujutsu, granting you a respectable reserve of cursed energy which will replenish by itself. This is more than enough to stand on the same level as the majority of sorcerers, though there are a fair few who still dwarf you in the size of their reserves."
46,,Free,Limit Break,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Alright, so you see that fighting style and weapon type you favor now with the above option? There's a special ability you can now use with those, called a Limit Break. As you fight, deal successful attacks, or take damage, an inner rage will steadily build within you. This doesn't really impact your behavior or fighting ability to any detriment, but once this energy has built up, you can unleash a devastating super move based on your fighting style using that rage. This can range from a superpowered jump and slash attack, punching someone so hard a dolphin manifests to join the uppercut, dice that have random effects between anything from instant death for your or your enemies, even temporarily turning into some humanoid monster...this Limit Break lets you temporarily defy the logic of the world to unleash these attacks on your foes. However, once you've used them once, your rage empties and you must regain that inner anger to unleash another attack. Transformative Limit Breaks last until the battle has ended, though you mercifully keep control of yourself.

You may customize your own starting Limit Break, being just about anything so long as it doesn't eclipse the stronger magic of this world...a good Summon or Magic materia will cause more widespread destruction than most Limit Breaks. As you grow stronger, you will learn more and more Limit Breaks, each more useful or damaging than the last so long as they stick to your theme and chosen fighting style. Once you've learned three levels of Limit Break, a fourth 'ultimate' move will become available to you either through intense fighting experience or hidden in a manual somewhere in the world that will require a substantial amount of effort to locate.

Post-jump, you will learn all four levels of your personal Limit Breaks regardless of your experience and efforts (or lack thereof). As you grow stronger throughout your chain, you may learn new variants and Limit Break techniques that complement your new skills and abilities, each requiring more effort than the last...though thankfully, all you have already learned will grow in strength with you."
47,,Free,Mage,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"You’re a magicborn, one of the fortunate born with the ability to use magic (See Notes). The exact type of magic you wield is at your discretion, and you’re quite adept in its use. Comes with increased willpower and mental fortitude and a rapid increase in magical skills.

Magic in Runeterra can assume different forms. You are free to take any kind of magic you want, even if the starting region has some influence on what kind of magic it’s easier for you to develop.

Everyone: Single-type elemental magic is common pretty much everywhere. Fire magic and wind magic are particularly easy to find.

Bandle City: Most creatures here have nature-related magic, but there is no specifical magic that the region is known for, except portal magic... but even that, it’s more something born by the portal network than from an innate aptitude of the inhabitants.

Bilgewaters: Water magic is the name of the game here, unless you want to try and talk to Nagakabouros about her Soul Judgment. There is also a strong affinity with necromancy, as the Serpent Isles are the closest to the Shadow Isles.

Demacia: While several types of magic have been observed in Demacia, Light, or Holy magic seems to be the unique form of magic around here.

Freljord: Ice magic is, of course, the most diffused form of magic in Frejlord, but you can access other types assuming you’re willing to bargain with the gods of the place, or with Lissandra.

Ionia: Ionia is big on martial arts and spiritualism, so there isn’t a specific magic that’s common in the area. However, there seems to be an unusual amount of people using music to perform magic. Maybe it could be a start.

Ixtal: Ixtal is the home of elemental magic... all elemental magic, but in particular fire, wind, water and earth, and arguably plant magic if you look at Zyra. However, if you don’t want to use elemental magic, the most common magic around here seems to be shapeshifting magic.

Noxus: People in Noxus use all kinds of magic, since nothing is discarded in the race for power. Necromancy and illusions seem to be more prevalent, but in recent years, hematomancy, or blood magic, has seen a resurgence in popularity.

Piltover&Zaune: Magic is... not a thing seen often here. Everyone prefers to use Hextech than actually learn magic. However, a limited form of technomancy, in the form of a better ability to assemble machines and understand them, could be the most appropriate form of magic for these two cities.

Shadow Isles: Nothing much to say here, necromancy is the name of the game. However, if you want an alternative, soul magic could be a valid substitute.

Shurima: Shurima’s magic (to not confuse with Ascended magic, who changes wildly) seems mostly focused on earth and sand. The time magic is more a bio-product of Icatia than true Shurima affinity, since it’s practiced only by the Time Mage and, on a minor part, by the Ascended Nasus.

Targon: There are two types of magic that are common on Targon. Healing magic, which is self-explanatory, and Celestial magic. Celestial magic, in particular, is unique as it can channel power in the form of any celestial phenomenon. The most common branches are Sun and Moon magic, but there are surely other options if you want.

Runeterra: There is only one type of magic that’s unique to the Runeterran faction: Rune Magic, whose only practitioner, at this time, is Ryze the Rune Mage, one of the most powerful mortals in all Runeterra. Rune magic is versatile, as it’s based on a language (the runes) and so can achieve several, apparently unrelated effects. Among them, there are blasts of arcane power, runic prisons, healing, clairvoyance and teleportation. Quite the useful mix, wouldn’t you say?"

Your arts would allow you to stand toe to toe with the last of the Three Sisters but it is unlikely you would best her. Even still, your magic is potent and nearly unrivaled in this modern world. You can perform the act of spiritual healing to slip your hands beneath the flesh of another to pull out toxins, clean out diseases, or even seal wounds without resorting to knives. You are capable of telekinetic assaults with no more effort than your mind that is capable of ripping a dozen hardened Yakuza apart in less than ten seconds. Some witches have also discovered the ability to help the spirits of the departed to move on into their afterlife by chanting sutras or other holy works. You also have one of the rare and nearly forgotten talents of body stitching. You are capable of reattaching severed body parts of others with nothing more than a needle and thread applied to the skin. No mucking about with hooking up nerves or suturing veins. Just make sure you put everything back on the right way. There have been cases of Witches slapping heads or hands back on backwards. These may not even be the extent of your talents, but you will have to discover in what direction your magic can grow on your own."
50,,Free,Moving Hell And Earth ,The Voynich Hotel,Modus,"Most mortals know the story. Wait by a crossroads on a moonless night until the midnight bell tolls its last peel. Then a devil will come to offer you whatever you desire in exchange for your immortal soul. Admittedly, the story is a little outdated at this point. No self-respecting devil limits themselves to crossroads at midnight anymore. But the rest of it? Absolutely true. Even the lowest of devils have the ability to bargain for a mortal’s soul in exchange for three wishes. Like most things with devils, there is a catch though. The devil must provide the mortal’s desires without fail or else the deal is void entire. Additionally, the more the mortal asks for with their wishes, the shorter the rest of their life will be. After all, hell isn’t interested in waiting sixty or eighty years for a return on its investment. A man who asked only for a guitar that allowed him to play like the best there ever was given ten years before his death. A woman who asked for a weapon unlike anything seen on earth, a powerful mask that turns thoughts into speech, and larger breasts had only most of a year. The one caveat is that no wish can bring another back to life. God has exclusive rights on that ability and Hell isn’t interested in starting a war...not yet at least."

62,,Free,Soul Of A Sorceror ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"Most stories in Magic: The Gathering involve titanic conflicts between Planeswalkers, vast dangers that threaten entire planes at once, monsters beyond all mortal understanding... but at the end of it all, each plane is just that - merely another place where people live their lives, and even without a Planeswalker Spark mortals can still achieve some grand things, indeed. Shandalar is no different, and while this Perk does not grant you a Planeswalker Spark (be it Oldwalker or New), you will find that even among the magic-suffused peoples of Shandalar you are one of the few great magelings of the world.

At its most basic, this unlocks your ability to use spells based on ‘Magic: The Gathering’, using a process not unlike that seen in the game itself. From drawing mana from the spiritual connection to mana-rich lands to casting fireballs and other spells to the summoning of mighty warriors and monsters, you can do it all - though your skill at such things, like many others, will depend on your experiences and studies.

Maintaining focus upon a magical matrix as complex as that used to store spells is exceedingly taxing, and without other powers to lessen the strain few mortals can hope to maintain more than seven or so spells at any given time without having to release them from their minds (permanently in most cases). However, like other mages you now have an effectively unlimited capacity for learning and remembering magical effects using this system.

Just remember: establishing a suitable mental hold over additional spells you could theoretically cast is a somewhat unpredictable process - in most cases it’s impossible for a mage to predict exactly which spell they will draw from the maelstrom of arcane power within themselves. To be truly effective, you may have to add or remove magical spells from your subconscious potential as needed. That said, you may be able to find solutions for expanding the number of spells you can harness at once in other worlds - and some spells and abilities in Shandalar can help with this process as well.

You have fully realized this ability to internalize and use magic, including the effectively perfect recall necessary to maintain such focus and the mental multitasking needed to keep a variety of spells at the forefront of your thoughts while also paying attention to the kind of pitched, chaotic battlefields most mage-duels result in before long. You are not the greatest mage on Shandalar, at least not just with this... but there is nothing stopping you from reaching such lofty heights, either."

65,,Free,Lore of the Great Maw ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"The magic supplied to all Butchers and Slaughtermasters by the Great Maw, proof of their role as its priests and clerics. You will begin as a notably skilled wizard in this Lore, knowing a handful of spells. Anytime a spell from this Lore is successfully cast, there is a large chance that the caster will be healed of many of his injuries and gain a small but significant boost to his next casting of any magic.

This Lore deals largely with the act of eating and gaining power from that act, with flesh and bone and blood and with twisting the bodies of others. The signature spell of this Lore allows the caster to empower his allies with great fortitude and willpower by devouring bones and bone marrow. Other spells include eating bones to snap the bones of your foes, devouring the hearts or muscles of strong beasts to grant that same strength to yourself or others, eating stone or metal to take on that substances durability, forcing horrific nightmares into the minds of any foe near you by devouring a piece of a brain or skull or even taking on or granting to others the traits of monsters or beings of whom you consume for a time, such as granting the regeneration of a troll to yourself and your companions. Truly gifted Gut Mages can even summon the Great Maw beneath their foes, or at least a small incarnation of it, to swallow up and devour any caught in its immense gullet.

This Lore, as with any other Lore in this world, is subject to the Winds of Chaos. At any time, the strength of magic may wax or wane at random, forcing the user to adapt rather than try to force it to obey them. If they are truly unlucky, the Winds will turn against them, resulting in some horrid accident that may even cause the user’s death. But that’s only for the unlucky ones.

Therefore, while founding the Orders, Teclis taught his human apprentices to focus on the one Wind of the eight which suited them best. The result is the system of Lores which persists to this day under the prescriptions of the Articles of Imperial Magic. You are sensitive to and capable of manipulating the Wind of Magic appropriate to your Order - Ghur for Amber Magisters, Hysh for Light Magisters, and so on - and know many of the spells devised by said Order."
74,,Free,Lore of the Vermin ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Modus,"The one and true mage-priests of the Great Horned Rat, the Gray Seers practice both the Lore of Ruin and the Lore of Plagues. A blend of divine inspiration and sorcery, the horned emissaries of the Rat-God consider it a grievous insult that Pestilens and Skryre have sought, and obtained, the secrets of these Lores. Just one more insult and betrayal added to the list of crimes skaven have committed against one another.

You, as an inducted Gray Seer, have begun plumbing the depths of the Great Horned Rat’s two wonderfully vicious lores: The Lores of Ruin & Plague. The Lore of Ruin, otherwise referred to as “Warp,” draws heavily from Warpstone and its derivative materials - allowing the caster to manipulate chaotic energies. From this Lore come such spells as The Vermintide, or the manipulation of Warp Lightning. The Lore of Plagues comes from the Horned Rat’s title as Harbinger - and though it rends a toll upon the caster’s body, the manipulation of disease, pox, and cancer alike allows one to even infect the very earth itself with diseased ichor and make poison rain down from the skies."
75,,Free,Arcanum (Basic) ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"Arcana are the various expressions of supernal truths in the fallen world. Specifically, they represent a given branch or type of magic that a Mage may specialize in. The various ranks of mastery displayed below denote the level of a given type of spell a Mage is able to cast. Higher level spells require higher Gnosis to use and will likely cost more mana to cast/maintain. It should be noted however that the higher ones Gnosis and the higher the level of spells they have access to, the greater the chance of causing a paradox is. The effects of magic that cause the greatest and most wondrous effects (i.e. creating earthquakes o granting a machine sentience) all risk paradox and may result in a backlash even against an experienced Mage. For this reason overt expressions of magic are denoted as “vulgar” whereas the subtle effects that do not cause paradox are called “covert”.

You receive the first two ranks in your ruling arcana for free and may choose one free rank in any other arcanum.

Death-
1. Initiate: You may discern the specter of the grave from its grossest to its most rarefied. You may see and speak with ghosts both resting and unquiet. You catch glimpses of death and can tell when others are near death themselves. You have begun the practice of shaping ectoplasm and so long as it is available may contort it to your will. You gain the basic powers of manipulating existing shadows for concealment. 
2. Apprentice: You may alter a corpse, changing its apparent cause of death. You may summon ghosts, entreating their friendship or castigating them. You may conjure ectoplasm (the substance the dead use to manifest in the physical plane) from nothing. You may even draw the objects held by ghostly apparitions into the world for a short time. You may cause steel to rust and wood to rot. Your mastery of shadow and concealment increases allowing you to hide even from other Awakened. 
3. Disciple: When you speak, the dead head your commands. You may temporarily walk in the realm of ghosts (twilight) and may temporarily will yourself to enter a state of death, as well as to rouse yourself from this temporary death at a later time. You may call up lifeless corpses from their burial grounds to serve as soldiers or servants. Steel and stone may crumble beneath your grasp. While a heinous act, you may choose to devour the spirits of the dead and dying to regain strength and mana. With great effort, you may be able to pull the souls of the living out of their spiritually unprotected bodies, leaving them devoid of vigor and passion.
4. Adept: You may chain the dead and ghosts to this world, forcing them to exist in their now rotting shell. You may walk in the worlds of ghosts and end the lives of normal humans with a well placed word. You may place the shadow of death upon the living, making them appear dead on nearly every level of existence. If your need is dire and your morals are questionable, you may steal the souls of others and bind them within yourself.
5. Master: Death is all too familiar to you now. You may consume the souls of both the living and the dead, restoring your willpower, physical health and mystical energies with each feeding. You may obliterate even powerful magical constructs or destroy spells with a touch. You may call upon the dead from thousands of years ago to do your bidding and answer your questions.

Fate-
1. Initiate: You may perceive the way the subtle strings of destiny alters the lives of others. You may tell if an action is one of destiny, or if destiny is to be thwarted by free will. You may detect the relative fortune a given soul carries, how lucky they have been and how lucky they will be in the future. You may also detect where, when and how a prophecy was uttered, and how it will impact the world around it, if at all.
2. Apprentice: You are able to subtly alter the threads of fortune, allowing you to make good actions more likely to happen to good people, and misfortune more likely to befall the unrighteous. Oaths you swear and fortunes you tell are more likely to be upheld or come to pass, as fate shifts ever so subtly in your favor. Even the mundane affairs of daily life may plague you less, letting you ward yourself against the inconveniences and happenstance that drive salary workers mad. 
3. Disciple: You may use your spells to improve the luck and happenstance of the tools, garments and vehicles of your allies, making them more likely to function well in their given task. Similarly, you may curse the objects of your enemies, making them more likely to break or malfunction at inopportune moments. Your workings become more resistant to other fate-­manipulating entities, and with effort you may slightly shift destiny or twist sanctified oaths.
4. Adept: You are now able to manipulate vows and contracts with ease. You may send the soulless and lifeless to their destined end, and convey the fortune of treasures, and the bane of curses as you please. You may break the chains that bind one spirit to another (both literally and figuratively), emancipating all with your power.
5. Master: You may change the destined path of nearly anyone with enough power. You may through manipulation of destiny, make a pauper into a statesmen, or lay low people of influence from their high office. Miracles and plagues in equal measure may be accomplished, as the dice of coincidence, luck and fate align under your spellcraft.

Forces-
1. Initiate: Through your magic, you may perceive the invisible physical forces which surround us. The flow of gravity, the passage of invisible light, the waves of sound, the tumultuous nature of heat and all other kinetic energy sources are laid bare to you. Perhaps you may subtly manipulate this energy to deliver a message to a person far away, a letter whispered on the winds.
2. Apprentice: You may now maneuver some of these unseen energies to your will. You may hide others from sight by bending the light around them, or slightly drain the kinetic force of lethal blows before they strike you. Through your magic you may conjure light, heat or sound and make them flourish or diminish as you please.
3. Disciple: You may transform some of the raw energies in the universe into other forms, making light become heat, or heat into a kinetic strike. Your magic is strong enough that you may maintain your invisibility even while in motion, and can control electricity and fire at a distance.
4. Adept: You may create thunder and fire from nothing. You may strike down at enemies with conjured thunderbolts and may control the weather if you are strong enough. You may call rain and winds on a clear sunny day, or bring a brief drought amidst a monsoon. Your spells may even let you move at the speed of winds, and turn bullets aside.
5. Master: You may harness the fury of the storm and earthquake, unleashing them accordingly as you desire. Even the fundamental force of gravity is under your control. You may create a miniature facsimile of a sun and outright destroy the mundane technology of sleepers. You may fly through the air as the legendary gods of old and halt bullets in mid­air.

Life-
1. Initiate: You may perceive the trillions of invisible microscopic lives that share our world. Your magic allows you to nullify poison, and detect any ailment within a someone's body.
2. Apprentice: You may manipulate your own life force to an extent, using your magic to heal yourself and dispel ailments. You may use such powers on small lower lifeforms as well (cats, dogs etc.) and may completely dominate the least of living creatures, bending insects to your will. You may manipulate your flesh, strengthening your bones and hardening your skin, making yourself more resistant to damage.
3. Disciple: Higher orders of beasts will now head your mystical commands, including snakes, reptiles, dogs and cats etc. You may throw literal barbs grown from your skin at enemies, and may mend the injuries of allies. You may change your own shape within the limits of human possibility, as well as the shapes of simple animals. If you desire, you may reshape your face entirely. You may adapt yourself to your environment, using magic to make yourself grow swifter, stronger or more enduring as needed.
4. Adept: You may change your form into that of a bird or a beast or change your normal appearance as other people would change clothes. You may change lesser beasts into greater versions of themselves (Cats into tigers, dogs into direwolves etc.) and assert your control over them. The forms of your fellow human beings are similarly mutable to you. If necessary you may even stimulate their various secretory glands and hormone production to influence their behavior and urges.
5. Master: You may wear any shape with equal ease, and transform yourself into nearly any biologically possible form that you could envision With enough time, care and application of your craft, you may even create an entirely new species, or elevate existing creatures to take on the forms of mythic creatures (transforming a lion into a griffon or a snake into a basilisk). Lesser creatures may be raised up to the intellect and capacity of humans and even humans may be manipulated with enough effort through the application of your life­-controlling spells. Some may even fear you as a deity, for you possess the magic to create life itself.

Matter-
1. Initiate: You may gaze into raw matter, and see the intricacies of an atom’s dance, knowing at sight one material from another, as well as if any mystical effects have been cast on it. You may more easily see the strengths and flaws within material objects or tools, and gain the first insights you need in how to reproduce them.
2. Apprentice: You may improve the craftsmanship of simple devices; causing swords and hammers to have perfect balance or weight. You may shape water or rain drops as well, or engage in truly biblical transformations, changing a glass of water into aged wine, or even coffee.
3. Disciple: With a bit of time, preparation and well crafted spells, you may render iron as soft and warm as butter, or as easy to manipulate as clay. You may transmute mud into steel or render glass as strong as stone. .
4. Adept: Just as you can create matter from mana, so too may you destroy it. At will you can create and destroy wood, rock and even diamond, though the size and value of such objects will require greater effort, time and mana. You may even manipulate air itself causing it to be solid, forming invisible cages. Your art has now propelled you above the concerns of lesser man, allowing you to perform the long sought parlor trick of changing base metals into gold.
5. Master: You may create alloys beyond the knowledge of ordinary men, and create elements not found on the periodic table. You may make objects grow or shrink at will, and may even annihilate powerful and durable magical artifacts.

Mind-­
1. Initiate: Through your magic you are able to sense the conscious minds around you, determining their emotional state and focus at a glance. You may tell if a person’s mind is disciplined or untrained as well as whether or not they are capable of psychic feats. Even disembodied but thinking consciousnesses are visible under your gaze. You may partition your thoughts, decreasing the processing power of your mind, but allowing you to follow two cognitive pathways at the same time. Perhaps if you are studious enough you may even touch the mind of the world itself.
2. Apprentice: You may speak into the minds of others, conveying information without the use of speech. You may control the actions of simple creatures, insects, reptiles and the like. You may defend your consciousness from hostile intrusion, and cordon off portions of your mind, preventing even you from accessing certain information. You may shift the perception of an enemy slightly, making them misjudge distance or target non­vital areas in a combat situation.
3. Disciple: You may now enter a deeper realm of consciousness through meditation;
delving into the subconscious level of your mind and perhaps beyond. You may
understand the meaning of the words someone speaks, regardless of their language. You may protect the minds of others from harm or detection. You may even strike at a person’s psychic presence, and in turn harm them bodily. Your mind may be divided even further without loss of processing power, allowing you to concentrate on multiple things at once without detriment to any of them. Alternatively you may fortify your own thoughts and capabilities and act as master of your own fantasies, whether dreaming or awake.
4. Adept: You are now a medium between your own internal self and the otherness that composes all minds. You may traverse this distance, entering into another’s memories, dreams or conscious thoughts, all of which are as tangible to you as solid matter..and just as easily manipulated. You may confound the senses of others and even turn the mind against the body, destroying it from the inside out.
5. Master: You may wander out, through your mind, into the Realms Invisible. You may forge a psyche out of nothingness and alter any aspect of consciousness you desire. If you wish you could walk for a time in the flesh of another, possessing their body and acting in their stead. You may manipulate the substance of the immaterial world and compel obedience from any mind you are capable of ensnaring.

Prime-
1. Initiate: You may perceive raw mana, and by extension magic in its untouched state. You are always aware when magic is being cast and where it interacts or intersects with all other things. You may see through mystical illusions as they are made of mana and so always look like mana to you.
2. Apprentice: You may manipulate raw mana for a variety of uses. You may force a spell or mystical artifact to yield its purpose, function and proper use. You may also transcribe your own mystical knowledge (and those of others) into grimoires for use by others of the mystical persuasion.
3. Disciple: You may enchant material objects in numerous fantastic manners depending on your other arcana. You may craft illusions out of raw magic that will fool sleepers and inattentive mages. You may give form and substance to mana, making the immaterial, material, at least for a time. You may use spells to draw mana from the environment into yourself, empowering you further. If the need is dire, you may unleash your raw mana in the unique form of celestial fire.
4. Adept: Your spells may now be used to rend the magic of your enemies into nothingness, or allow you to feed on the mana hidden even in base materials. You are suffused with raw magic, and may sculpt it into any shape you desire, or command it as one would a trained animal. You may revitalize extinguished natural nexi of mystical energies or drain similar places of their power.
5. Master: You may create a simulacrum of a human beings, animated by your power and subject to all of your commands. You may steal the mystical energies from others through your spellcraft, and use it to your own ends. You may create Hallows; nexi of mystical energy, though this requires great effort. Alternatively you may instead create mystical dead zones where no mage may regain their expended energy.

Space-
1. Initiate: You may view the tapestry of space and can discern the location of nearby hidden things, assuming you know what you are looking for. You are aware when others have tampered with space, such as when one has teleported or created a portal. You may even trace sympathetic connections, determining the strength and emotional weight held between people and objects.
2. Apprentice: You have found a means to cast spells far beyond the limits of your vision, able to scry distant locations and affect targets remotely at a much reduced effect. This is possible so long as you possess something of sympathetic significance. Similarly, you may guard your own home from similar scrying and sympathetic attack. If you possess the appropriate corresponding arcana, you may even transport small objects (matter) energies (forces) or living beings (life) through miniscule portals.
3. Disciple: You may ward your sanctum against intrusion, forbidding entrance to certain objects, creatures or individuals, for space itself bares their passage. You may see into many places at once as well as binding or severing sympathetic connections as you are able. If you desire it, you may use your magics to transform a door into a portal to nearly anywhere else in the world.
4. Adept: You are very nearly unbound in space. You may be in more than one place at once, with the aid of appropriate arcana, though your spatial doppelgangers may never meet. You may use the threads of space to entangle enemies or bind them to a given location. You may travel without motion, disappearing and reappearing as you cross the illusion of distance. If necessary you may step into the gap between spaces, waiting in an impermanent tiny universe until you are needed.
5. Master: You are able to alter the amount of space an object takes up, reducing a house to the size of a cat, or making a lonely road stretch out near infinitely. Just as you are able to be in several places at once, so to may you draw objects, places and even other people into a similar disassociated state of being; allowing them to be in more than one place at the same time. You may conceal locations within gaps in space, and twist the bonds of it to ensure that no mortal is ever able to find it. If you desire, you may ensnare others in twisting roads and winding paths with neither origin or destination.

Spirit-
1. Initiate: You are able to view the comings and goings of spirits; quasi­-sentient manifestations or personifications of the various phenomena in the world (both natural and man­made). You are able to tell if they exist in a state of twilight or if they are possessing a living host. You are able to see and determine the relative strength of the gauntlet (the barrier between the mortal and spiritual realms) and may communicate with spirits as though you were one of them.
2. Apprentice: You may communicate with spirits as you would beings of flesh and blood, as well as convince them to do your bidding. You may strengthen or decrease the strength of the gauntlet in a given area temporarily, and may affect beings in twilight with your own hands.
3. Disciple: You are now able to enter into twilight, awaken sleeping spirits in base matter or unintelligent life. You may mend damage that spirits may have taken and cast out both dark spirits and ghosts, as well as shield yourself from possession. You may also forge a bond with a spiritual familiar, and benefit from it more so than other mages.
4. Adept: You can imprison spirits, binding them into matter or flesh as needed. You may guide neophyte mages in obtaining familiars for their own and may traverse through the gauntlet and into the realm of spirits.
5. Master: You are able to raise or lower the gauntlet with relative ease. Amongst spirits, they regard you with high esteem as a member of the aristocracy. You may shape the substance of spirits, altering existing forms and even giving birth to new spiritual entities. If you desire, you may give these spirits a physical shell with which to explore the mortal realm. You may travel between the various levels of reality within the world of darkness (save of course the supernal realms), though this is an inherently dangerous power as there is no guarantee you will be able to return.

Time-
1. Initiate: You become aware of the march of time, able to tell how much of it has passed without the need of traditional timekeeping devices. You may also recognize when others have impeded or altered the flow of time around you.
2. Apprentice: You may view the recent past in an area and are more able to suss out future events, your words bordering on prophecy. Your manipulation of time may extend ever so slightly to protect your person, granting a few nanoseconds more to recognize or evade a deadly strike. Similarly, your identity may be protected from others who use the flow of time for their own gains. By expending mystical energy and effort, you may see the immediate results of your actions before you take them, thus choosing a more wise path.
3. Disciple: You are able to strike with preternatural speed and rob certain enemies of their swiftness. In moments of great importance, you may use your magic to reverse your immediate actions, taking a slightly different path than you would have seconds earlier. You look into the uncertain future with the eyes of a seer.
4. Adept: You are able to step outside of time, a place without any flow save for its own impermanence. You see both what will, and might be, and how it might come to pass. You are able to alter the flow of time, allowing you to step ahead to hours or perhaps days in the future. You may never travel backwards.
5. Master;: You are able to spin time as needed, creating “faerie glades” in which time moves much faster or much slower within them than outside. It is possible that you may be able to capture a person within the flow of time itself, holding them in stasis temporarily. A mage may temporarily alter their personal history in a given world (within reason), choosing to play baseball instead of chess and gaining all the benefits and consequences such a choice would have on their person (but not to the rest of the world). This change is only temporary and may never affect your soul/mystical abilities or other supernatural powers. (CG Note: Requires Gnosis (One Dot) - Mage: The Awakening first.)"
76,,Free,Freebies ,World Seed,Modus,"All people playing Neolife may choose two schools of magic to start with, and so do you. There’s a school of magic for pretty much everything, including Gravity, Sound, Barrier, Blood, Aura, Origin (the creation of matter ex nihilo), Solar, and Summoning magic. Of course, there’s also a field of magic for any element you can think of and more, such as Fire and Earth magic, and even Nature magic and Technomancy exist.

You can also pick two affinities to start off with at 5%. Affinities, in case you don’t know yet, can be literally anything. If something exists, it has a mana signature. And if something has a mana signature, the signature can be forged (cultivated) and controlled. Be it an affinity for life, fur, time, leaves, bark, a specific fetish, or something more abstract like luck, order, madness, or chaos, the variety of affinities is truly endless."
77,,50,Rail,Worm CYOA v17,Modus,"You can move any object or person you touch a distance of up to 50 feet in any direction in a straight line. While moving, these objects are largely resistant to damage. Small, hand-held objects move at roughly seventy-five miles an hour, while objects the size of a car move at half that speed. Anything that weighs more than a small house won't be affected."
78,,50,Nature,Naruto,Modus,"All who possess chakra possess an incredibly strong affinity to one of the following chakra natures Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Lightning, Yin or Yang. Through training additional natures can be acquired, with more than one nature being common among Jonin. Can be purchased multiple times, to a maximum of seven. If taken with Rinnegan or other bloodlines that bestow the chakra nature, this doubles the power of your affinity. Like with all things, your affinity can be strengthened with time and hard work. One free purchase."
79,,50,Practitioner(Focused Practitioner),The Dresden Files,Modus,"While still technically mortal, you've been blessed with the ability to tap into the fundamental power of creation itself, and shape it with your mind. That's right, you're a wizard. Well, maybe. See, there's all sorts of types of practitioners, partially a function of how much power you were born with and partially what kind of training you got. Unlike most of us, who get stuck with whatever hand we're dealt, you get to pick your own destiny.

Whether due to improper training or just a very narrow intuitive understanding of the concept, you're basically confined to using a single narrowly-defined area of magic. It might be something like Kinetomancy (focusing on force), Ectomancy (magic relating to spirits), or Pyromancy (guess) - hell, you might even be a Lupine Theriomorph. A lot of the full-fledged spellslingers like to look down on you, but most of the time, that's a mistake. Just because you're a specialist instead of a generalist doesn't mean you can't call down a downright scary amount of power, and, point of fact, you can.

One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in ""When all you have is a hammer"" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation.

1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law.

2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target.

3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience.

4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one.

5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line.

6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands.

7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the ""local"" Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters.

Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree. They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.

Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree. They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.

Sword Summoning (3): Usually not literal in the modern day, this ritual allows a conjurer to prepare a weapon ahead of time. This weapon may then be summoned, once, should there be need for it, so long as it is within a mile or two away. Doing so is as easily as “drawing” it from a convenient shadow or trench coat, and is even easier if the conjurer is highly familiar with the weapon in question. This ritual is not without fault, however. The affected weapon can be no larger than a shotgun or a large sword, and summoning almost always fails when performed in front of unbelievers, but a skilled or subtle sorcerer can offset the later restriction.

needed. Those unlucky few can reach out and gain a smidge of its powers if they wish,
however. By taking from yourself a bit of
your soul and binding it into the form of a
Sheele, you can turn an element, the dark,
the light, essence, or illusions to your will,
bending the world in accordance with its
nature. The spirit can channel the magic it
was born of to cast the basest of spells of
that path, as well as call upon a number of
other talents in accordance with its nature. A
sheele of air is an experienced thief and
acrobat for example, and may learn to strike
out with lightning or cutting wind. A sheele
of light, on the other hand, is a guardian,
watching it’s surroundings for magical or
mortal foes, and may learn to guard the
bodies and dreams of those who surround
it. Finally, as you grow in strength, so does
your sheele, and this growth will be most
obvious in its “soul form”, a combat form

fail you. Although... though you may be loath to admit it, your mental reserves are not similarly
infinite, your mind containing bursts of potential that recharge only slowly. These bursts of
potential may be permanently expended to learn new powers, or saved, that when you find your
power is not enough, they may be called upon, expended for no more than an hour to enhance

not limited when in a body who still possesses the pulse of life. In some ways, this can be dangerous. An untrained body can struggle to handle the power that spiritual energy grants, moving too fast or
hitting too hard can hurt you as much as your enemy. Whether living or dead, you retain this trait. Perhaps a result of the fragments inside your soul, you do not lose access to spiritual powers despite being alive nor the reverse. Things only your living
biological body should provide remain in your spirit form. Provided you have access and use of them, your powers work regardless of your mortal situation. This does not guarantee safety, as there may
be good reasons to only use these powers in their proper form. But it does make for a wonderful

It can be as specific as “I am the god of the third door through which souls pass on the way to judgement” or as broad as “I am the god of thought”. 

Your heka or magic is attuned to this thing, such that prayers made to you regarding your sphere of influence sustain your godly power and cause it to grow, and your power is expressed through your sphere of influence more readily.

How specific your sphere of influence is defines how efficiently your power can be expressed through it – a Neter of Doors might bar one shut against any ten of the strongest of men by spending a small amount of power, but the Neter of the Third Door of Duat exerting the same power could hold that very door closed against an army, differences between the personal might of each god notwithstanding.

Cancer: Grants the Red Mage Class, which can use the basic levels of all magic, but has a specialty in Arcane magic, which deals with status effects.

Leo: Grants the Knight Class, which attempts to strike a balance between physical fighting and support by dabbling a bit in white magic. Weaker than the Breaker and Samurai, but still very physically oriented.

Virgo: Grants the Monk Class, experts when fighting unarmed or with poles. They also have a bit of ability in using White Magic

Libra: Grants the Time Mage Class, which specializes in supporting allies and slowing enemies down.

Scorpio: Grants the Breaker Class, which typically uses axes or hammers. The strongest physically out of all classes, they are also heavily armoured.

Sagittarius: Grants the Archer Class, which focuses on ranged attacks using bows and crossbows. Unlike the Mechanist, their projectiles can’t bypass defence, but are less likely to miss.

Capricorn: Grants the Black Mage Class, masters of the destructive black magic arts.

Aquarius: Grants the Samurai Class, mainly focusing on swift assaults. While the Hunter chooses to focus on all sorts of weapons, the Samurai focuses on his katana and his speed is second to none. He does not use spells however.

Pisces: Grants the Hunter Class, experts with all sorts of weapons in general, they are a sort of Jack of all Trades, but are very fast. The only magic they know is white magic however.

Most of them take a bit too much time and effort to put to use in combat, and you likely need to wave your hands and make funny words, but if someone isn’t aware of these powers they might get you out of a prison cell.

127,,100,Mystic Eyes of        ,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"You've gained the fairly uncommon ability called Mystic Eyes. With this, you have access to an innate magical power that is used through the medium of your eyes. While uncommon, a fair number of Magi do have some weak form of Mystic Eyes. You'll find your new eyes aren't like that at all. Rather, they're much stronger than the average Mystic Eye. When you buy this option, you may pick a single one of the below choices. 

Fire

Your eyes possess the power of flame. With them, you have gained a control over fire and heat. You can ignite flammable material within sight with a blink. You can also naturally create and manipulate heat and fire within your field of vision. At first, this will be limited. You might be able to create several small fireballs or raise/lower the temperature of a single room by a few degrees. Eventually, you'll be able to create and fling around person sized fireballs, create temperatures that boil people's skin from their bodies in seconds or snuff out house sized fires with a thought. 

Charm

Your eyes possess the power of love. By looking into the eyes of another being, you can create a growing affection for you in their mind. A mere glance will give the equivalent of a crush on you for most non-magical beings whilst several minutes of uninterrupted eye contact with those same could create feelings of deep love that last for days at a time. Longer then this would create longer lasting feelings of course. Whilst incredible willpower might allow a mundane mortal to temporarily resist, they're rather out of luck as this magical trait quickly batters down the defences of mundane beings. Any supernatural being however, can quite easily shrug off the effects so it is unlikely you will be able to ensnare any but the weakest supernatural beings. 

Trick

Your eyes possess the power of illusions. You are able to hijack the five senses of other beings with nothing more than brief eye contact. Your skill with this new ability is limited at first. You might only be able to subtly influence one or two senses at first and anyone with supernatural powers would be able to negate your influence. But give it a few years of practise, and with something this fun how could you not practise, and you could find yourself being able to overwrite all five senses of any human as you please, as long as you had eye contact when you started. Sadly you can only influence one person per eyeball at a time, though you only need eye contact once. Supernatural beings aren't immune to your powers but it's not impossible for them to resist like it is for mortals either so don't be surprised if anyone too strong or skilled can see past your tricks. 

Pressure                        

Your eyes possess the power of punches. Or is that meant to be force? Either way, it's the same effect. You are able to create impacts on anything that you can see. These impacts are exactly like if you went over and punched whatever you are aiming at, with all the shape, size and strength of your fist. You can't make more than one eye punch every few seconds for now but you can probably work this down to around one a second if you're really punch happy. "

Long as you want it, and are not being influenced by any other to do so, you can freely change, remove or destroy any part of your heart or mind that you want to without changing or harming any other part. Remove an alternate personality with a thought without affecting the rest of your mind. Destroy any sense of pity or morality that you had without altering the rest of your personality. Bring back love into your heart after it’d been removed. What’s there can be removed and what’s gone can be remade. "
130,,100,"Emotions, Quantified",Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Modus,"As you get further into a fight the emotional state of you, your allies, and your opponents will increase. Every hit, every dodge, every block, will positively or negatively impact those involved, and the more they happen the more powerful your allies will be. This is measured on a scale of 0-5 with 0 being nearly nothing while 5 is when someone sees the fight as one of the most important things in their life. Each time your emotion level rises, you will be refreshed in terms of stamina and at emotion level 5 you will act like you are on a constant adrenaline high until you stop fighting."
131,,100,Magic System,High School DxD,Modus,"Unless you already do, of course! You may choose a system of magic that helps you actually utilize mana. In short, it provides you a mental map of reality and a way to create spells based on that map. After making your intent with the spell, you calculate the mathematics behind it using said system, and then charge it with mana. This can create everything from teleportation, elemental attacks, and even turning the magic of your foes against them if you’re a good enough wiz at math. You can buy more systems with each purchase of this perk. Every Faction except Independent and every Race except human receives a magical system for free.

You’ve got plenty of potential but mostly in a small handful of related fields. Someone might be excellent at magic relating to stealth, infiltration and turning whatever makeshift property of other people is on hand into magecraft components but be lacking outside of those fields. Either choice you make on what you use, you’ll be decently powerful. A little less than the average fairy but enough to use your spells against a weaker Servant and win. "

You’re capably trained in one style of swordsmanship that exists in this world. A veteran samurai or well trained knight are classics. A quick thinking cowboy with his six shot revolvers. Perhaps a sublimely beautiful sword-style that uses magical energy to create and control ice. You could even be a mature and educated magus, one of the swords that cuts through the mysteries of the world to study magecraft. These are all proud ways to be a swordsman, a Saber, and you’re a capable user of one of them. "

Keep in mind that any spell will still cost something unless it was originally free to cast or you have another method to make it free to cast.

For example, you might specialize your martial arts skills in the Nazzadi martial art, Hun-Zuti, or you might specialize your life sciences skill in Botany or your occult skill in Assisting at Scrying spells or Unweaving Enchantments."

Thus, you have inherited some of their powers and characteristics, a descendant of Lancelot could unlock the masterful swordsmanship he was famed for, while a famed magician would boost your magic reserves and talent for the arcane arts.

Years of training have borne fruit and you have become a master in the magic system and other skills that are inherent to your race.

With it one can strengthen their bodies, cause vegetation around them to bloom or wither, sense the ki of others to track them, see through illusions by detecting the flow of ki, forcefully putting someone to sleep, use ki to heal injuries, detox poisons or dispel curses, dealing interior damage to others by targeting their blood vessels and internal organs, and through disrupting or severing the spirit and life-force of others. While you aren’t a master, you have relatively proficiency with it and talent to grow a lot more."
148,,100,A (Future) Path To The Origin(Tier 1) ,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"Magecraft, the act of artificially reenacting mysteries through the usage of magical energy. Differentiated from true magics in that the mysteries brought forth via magecraft are limited to those things that are ‘possible’. Despite variations among individual schools, magecraft fundamentally operates as a mechanism that utilizes magical energy from the practitioner's body or the external environment to reproduce a specific phenomenon. The practitioner issues a command to the foundation, which is governed by their respective school, and subsequently executes a pre-established spell.

For 100 CP, you only know the basics of magecraft theory, from a few years of studying in the Clock Tower or under a proper teacher. You are capable of basic abilities such as formalcraft, basic hypnotism and reinforcement, as well as having some basic resistance to very weak magecraft by circulating magic energy through yourself. You probably may not even be a proper magus, just a magecraft user that knows some tricks to get by. You may either choose that path and have learned to get the best out of these basics for your line of work, or be an actual magus with your own starting form of magecraft, but expect it to be fairly weak. Think of Waver Velvet, discounting his incredible insight, or the mercenary codenamed Sigma for this level of proficiency. You are still a threat to non-mages, but it won’t be hard for those with some experience in dealing with magecraft users to take you down, even if they lack magecraft of their own, or if they bring some firearms.

Finally, this is mostly based on the schools taught in the Mage’s Association. But if you wish to, you may take this same level for other schools of magecraft. From the local shamanism of the tribes of North America, to more Eastern traditions. See the notes section for more insights."

150,,100,Magical Bond,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"The particular breed of your plant is capable of absorbing nearby magic and using them itself. Given its proximity to you, its spores are soaked with your magical abilities tinting them with your recently used magical powers.

Requires Water Gun to Purchase"
151,,100,Witchcraft,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Usually hidden from the view of others, there are a few that practice the arts called witchcraft. Fundamentally, witchcraft is a magic that affects the spirits of things. Curses wound the soul, necromancy enslaves the spirit, and the creation of a familiar twists the soul of the familiar. While these magics have historically had negative connotations, their use is not inherently evil. Knowledge of cursing can be used to treat spiritual wounds and excise spiritual parasites for example.

By purchasing this, you may choose one of these disciplines: Cursing, Necromancy, or Spiritwarping.

By choosing Cursing, you have learned a number of ways to wound a soul. While making fetishes of a target to harm them is less useful in combat due to the preparation time involved, there are techniques that are. You have mastered a technique that wraps your weapon in cursed power, allowing you to use your foe as the fetish itself. What that means is that a short time after you strike a second, significantly stronger blow is inflicted upon your target.

By choosing Necromancy, you have mastered magics that allow you to command the dead, historically used to attack the living. These magics are easier to use the more recently the target has become deceased. Fortunate, then, that you will likely soon be surrounded by the recently deceased. Long term command usually takes concerted time and effort to bind a soul, whereas momentary commands before the soul passes on are more easily done in combat.

By choosing Spiritwarping, you know the magics required to convert a creature into a familiar. The process makes the creature bound to serve your commands, as well as imbue it with echoes of your own magical abilities and increase its physical abilities."
152,,100,Cosmic Phenomena,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Each astrologer focuses on a single phenomena of the cosmos, in an attempt to take the time to understand it fully. One decided to study Black Holes for example. Through this understanding they developed the ability to manifest black holes themselves.

What this perk means for you, is that you have spent enough time studying some similar astrological function, enough to be able to manifest a simulacrum with some effort.

Do note, that these manifested objects and events pale in comparison to the real thing, a black hole manifested this way will pull objects towards itself, but it won't tear them apart with gravitational forces. Usually this means that they don't do much physical harm, but instead offer some utility."
153,,100,Holy Arts,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"The Holy arts are a type of thaumaturgy, most frequently manifesting the wrathful miracles of god, also called smiting, or a more preserving miracle by manifesting divine protection.

By purchasing this, you may choose either Smiting, or Shielding By choosing Smiting, one learns to manifest holy light that strikes your nearby foes dealing notable damage.

By choosing Shielding, once learns to manifest a bubble that surrounds a target protecting them from a significant blow. Recreating such a shield usually takes a few minutes, but skilled practitioners are usually much faster.

While there are other applications such as healing, such things take much longer to perform, taking several minutes and a significant energy investment rather than a mere moment. Either purchase grants knowledge of these other applications

Holy Arts of all kinds grow stronger the greater the vitality of the practitioner. The various arts also synergize with each other as casting one tends to leave excess holy power in the area that can be used for another art, though strangely specifically not the same art.

155,,100,Carian Sorcery ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Modus,"As a servant of the Carian royal family, it would be slightly embarrassing should you be incapable of casting sorceries. You will be no such embarrassment, as by utilizing a staff you can summon numerous variants of arcane swords, from massive greatswords to firing them at enemies from a distance. It is not enough to claim full mastery of the arcane, but it is enough for some."
156,,100,The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,Godbound,Modus,"One trade stands out from the rest in every civilisation, and it is that of the Low Magic user. A remnant of a discipline assembled from the wreckage of the Former Empires, what others call Low Magic consists of arcane legacies adapted for the limited resources of this latter age. Such spells generally require a lengthy ritual (although some spontaneous effects can be prepared in advance) and some basic tools and supplies-charms, sanctified tokens, auspicious materials and other fairly common occult paraphernalia. Many, though not all, require long rituals that can take over ten minutes for the simplest and a day for the longest. Perhaps most troublingly, mortal magic automatically crumbles before miracles and Gifts of the Words of Creation-providing little more than some flimsy resistance at best.

Beyond those limitations though the practices offer many powers, and you are something between an adept and a master of such an art. Such practices include the telepathic powers of the Academy of Thought-masters of compelling others, projecting emotions and illusions, probing forgotten memories and more tricks of the mind. Though quick castings threaten to debilitate the caster’s own brain. Or the Cinnabar Order, who can hurl exploding balls of flame, summon living flame elementals and let candles burn all day with truly quick and easy casting. Perhaps you are a Curse-Eater instead, a consumer of magical effects who can release them on others as blights contained in tokens? Despite its limitations, never underestimate the doors that Low Magic can open for you in life. This perk may be taken multiple times if you wish to have been inducted in more than one Low Magic. And if you have also taken Wisdom of the Ages, you are a true archmage of your craft-pushing any Low Magics you know to the limits of mortal mastery.

Just note these are minor powers that shouldn’t overlap with too many other things available in this jumpchain. Further, nobody’s surprised that you can do these things.

Bending an element provides substantial control over it, allowing you to move it, shape it, and direct it, though the exact nature of each depends on the individual element. It should be noted, however, that you cannot actually create an element - though Firebenders can transform their body heat into a raging inferno and Airbenders can make the breath from their lungs into a gale, Waterbenders and Earthbenders must have a source of their element to Bend."

You are skilled in the use of all four basic disciplines for no cost, the equal of an adult magus who completed their training in each area and was notably skilled.

You become proficient at manifesting and manipulating the eastern and western classical elements without the need of incantations or focus but with it the element that you are manifesting becomes several times more powerful and easier to control. By picking one of the classical elements, your hair would change according to the element that you choose to further enhance the power of your element by a minimum of ten times. You can also choose all the elements if you don’t mind having multicolored hair though the boost in the element is only a fourth compared to choosing one."

Your devout acts of faith and usage of holy miracles strengthens the light, allowing torches to burn longer and brighter and even lighting flames that have faded entirely- at least until the darkness closes in once again. In battle, you can make your weapon shine with enough light to illuminate those who skulk in the darkness, perhaps even stunning these lurking terrors with your radiance. Doing this will only strengthen the light little, for all that you’re directly channeling the Light for the purposes of your miracles, but standing at the front of your party and daring your enemies to go through you may well rekindle a spent torch entirely."

This also works for spells or other effects that have a limited duration placed on you. Additionally, any negative side effects for tapping into these abilities is reduced.

For an additional 100cp, you gain five slots that you can use to store a potion effect, spell, or other form of temporary empowerment.

203,,100,Practitioner(Wizard),The Dresden Files,Modus,"While still technically mortal, you've been blessed with the ability to tap into the fundamental power of creation itself, and shape it with your mind. That's right, you're a wizard. Well, maybe. See, there's all sorts of types of practitioners, partially a function of how much power you were born with and partially what kind of training you got. Unlike most of us, who get stuck with whatever hand we're dealt, you get to pick your own destiny.

You're a full-fledged member of the White Council, with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that entails. A lot of times that's more hassle than it's worth, especially with a war on, but there's a lot of resources you can call on when you need to, as long as you're prepared to repay the favor when need be. What this background really gets you is the full training a wizarding background offers, which has left you able to call on the entire array of everything magic is capable of. And, with enough time and preparation, there's very little which doesn't fit within that category.

One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in ""When all you have is a hammer"" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation.

1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law.

2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target.

3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience.

4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one.

5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line.

6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands.

7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the ""local"" Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters.

Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree. They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.

204,,100,“Pyromancy” ,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Pyromancy is an art born in the wake of the great disaster that befell Izalith. One of the Witch’s Daughters of Chaos, Quelana of Izalith, is credited with its birth after fleeing from her chaos consumed home. Pyromancy, like many things, starts with a little fire. The core of a Pyromancer’s art is the Pyromancy Flame, their focus and source of their power. A Pyromancy Flame is a small fire fostered and grown by a Pyromancer, becoming stronger when fed and able to be split or fractured to share with prospective students. Compared to other systems in this world, Pyromancy is heavily offense focused, with many different spells focusing on the command of fire, and in some abominable cases, poison. Several utility focused spells that draw out one’s inner power or speak to the inner nature of undead. Like Sorcery or Miracles, spells must be prepared ahead of time while resting, but can be swapped between any you know freely while resting. Pyromancy is often called primal art due to the practitioners being connected to nature, but this crudeness makes spells a bit slower to cast than other systems. On purchase, you’re bestowed a ‘Pyromancer’s Flame’ of your own, granted an adept knowledge of the foundation and basics of the art, and know basic Pyromancies such as Fireball and Combustion."
205,,100,“Miracles” ,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Miracles are the power of the gods, records or legends of their feats that then manifest as divine spells. A cleric or some other such caster of Miracles learns their spells through revelations granted by such records or legends, taught in either written form or orally. Casting Miracles requires a holy talisman of some kind as a focus, talismans normally used by clerics and priestesses in their prayers and ceremonies. Due to Miracles being sourced to the acts of the gods, it is faith in the power of the Miracle that powers it, believing a spell to work helping it perform. Compared to other systems in this world, Miracles are primarily defensive and utility based in nature, focusing on healing, deflecting projectiles, reducing magical damage and hindering enemies. The offensive Miracles that exist are either aligned with the arcane, or lightning. Like Sorcery, you must prepare Miracles ahead of time while resting and may only prepare so many at a time. You may swap out or in any Miracles you know while resting and recovering. Miracles are cast in the exact same manner as Sorceries, just with a talisman instead of a catalyst. On purchase, you have an adept understanding of the foundation, basics and nature of Miracles and know basic Miracles such as Heal and Force."
206,,100,“Sorcery”,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Sorcery, an art born from the work of Seath the Scaleless who descended into madness during his experiments. Sorcery is a complex system of magic using spells prepared while resting to unleash the potential of one’s soul. Casting spells requires a ‘catalyst’, a wooden or metal staff, to focus oneself. Due to the complexity of the art, the smarter the caster is and the better their understanding of the art, the more potent their spells tend to be. One’s soul also factors in, as the spells are born from it. Compared to other systems in this world, Sorcery focuses on offensive, augment and utility focused spells. This includes magical arrows or spears, enhancing equipment with arcane might, repairing equipment or even turning invisible. Only so many spells may be ‘prepared’ at any one time, but a Sorcerer can switch which spells they have prepared. Sorceries as a result of their nature do not require a chant or special action, just one’s focus and, if some form of projectile, decent aim with their catalyst. On purchase, you have an adept understanding of the foundation and basics of Sorcery and know basic spells such as Soul Arrow and Aural Decoy."
207,,100,Caryll Runes,Bloodborne,Modus,"“Caryll Runes are the words of Great Ones transcribed by Runesmith Caryll. Originating from the work of that prolific student of Byrgenwerth, etching these runes onto your mind can provide a number of benefits. 

Benefits can range from resisting certain types of damage, increasing resistance to various poisons, or increasing stamina and vitality, among other things. You may transcribe up to three different Runes on your mind, though you'll need the proper equipment to remove or replace them. 
 
Each purchase of ""Caryll Runes"" grants you either three Tier 1 versions of different runes, a Tier 1 & Tier 2 rune, or a single Tier 3 version of a rune. The higher the Tier of the rune, the higher quality it is, with all those listed below being available. 

You may purchase this as many times as you desire, and choose from the selection of Runes you've purchased which ones will be etched onto your brain as you enter the world. Notably, multiple levels of the same kind of rune may be purchased and equipped, their effects stacking.” 

>>[1] Anti-Clockwise Metamorphosis – “The twisted cross means ""metamorphosis"", and those who have it etched upon their mind tire less quickly. This rune bolsters the stamina of the one who bares it, somewhat at least tier Tier 1, and twice that at Tier 3.” 

>>[2] Arcane Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices ripples like a watery reflection. Those who bare this rune are granted protection against eldritch, ""Arcane"" powers. This rune allows you to resist the damage of mystical attacks somewhat at Tier 1, with twice the defense at Tier 3.” 

>>[3] Beast – “A transcription of the roar of a labyrinth beast, the bearer of the ""Beast"" rune has accentuated transformation effects. This rune physically empowers the beast within, allowing you to fall from greater heights to no harm, and draw out more power from your ‘Visceral Attack.’ 

Tier 1’s effects are mild, while Tier 3 grants five times the extra power, and twice the resistance to long drops. This does not enable you to better handle bestial urges however, so take care.” 

>>[4] Blood Rapture – ""Blood Rapture is the raw euphoria from experiencing the warmth of blood. Those who bare this rune gain the power to trigger a state of rapid, temporary healing by using a ‘Visceral Attack,’ or other vicious method of rending guts, on enemies. 

The healing even from Tier 1 is noticeable, leading to Tier 3 only being half again as potent. Doesn't do anything when trying to rip out the innards of something without blood or guts.” 

>>[5] Clawmark – “The Clawmark is an impulse to seek the warmth of blood like a beast. It strengthens ‘Visceral Attacks’, one of the darker hunter techniques, and similar techniques that involve puncturing and gutting enemies with your bare limb by a noticeable amount, with Tier 3 being three times as effective compared to Tier 1.”

>>[6] Clear Deep Sea – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices depicts down-reaching currents. This rune improves your blood and body's resistance to most slow acting toxins and infections that fester and weaken the body over time. 

The effects are potent even at Tier 1, with Tier 3 making you nigh immune to most slow killing poisons outside of soaking in a tub of them.” 

>>[7] Clockwise Metamorphosis – “The twisted cross means ‘metamorphosis,’ and those who bare this rune are afforded heightened vitality. This basically means you're a bit hardier compared to normal humans outside of damage that's immediately fatal, such as being stabbed in the heart. 

The effects are noticeable, though small at Tier 1, helping you survive with a few extra wounds when others would have died already. Tier 3’s effects are three times as potent as Tier 1.” 

>>[8] Communion – ""Several runes relate to ‘blood,’ including ‘Communion,’ which raises the maximum number of blood vials one may carry. This is a special rune tied to your free ‘Bag of Blood Vials’ gift that raises its capacity. 

Tier 1 increases its capacity by one, Tier 2 by three, and Tier 3 by five. What's so special about this? If you bought it the ability to refill over time, it will now go up to the new maximum capacity before stopping instead of stopping at twenty.” 

>>[9] Deep Sea – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices depicts down-reaching currents. Humans have certain limitations of the mind, limitations that cause certain types of information to inflict tremendous brain damage in great enough volume, a condition otherwise known as ‘Frenzy.’ 

This rune increases your resistance to this condition, with Tier 3 being three times as effective compared to Tier 1, which is itself quite notable.” 

>>[10] Dissipating Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices ripples like a watery reflection. Those who bare this rune are granted protection from electricity, whether it be eldritch or bestial in origin. 

Though the protection isn't significant, it is noticeable and can save you in a pinch even at base level. Tier 3 grants twice the protection of Tier 1.” 

>>[11] Eye – “A transcription of ""Eye,"" as spoken by left-behind Great Ones. Allows one to make additional discoveries. This rune is similar to the ‘Discovery’ talent, causing miscellaneous items to find their way into your hands more often via mysterious chance. 

The Tier 2 ‘Eye’ Rune is about as effective as ‘Discovery’ in this regard. By comparison, Tier 1 is about a quarter less effective, and Tier 3 half again as effective as Tier 2.” 

>>[12] Fading Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices ripples like a watery reflection. Like its sibling runes, ""Fading Lake"" protects those baring it against a type of energy. 

Those who bare this rune find their body warded a bit against fire of all kinds. Though small, it's noticeable enough to help when you need it at Tier 1, and twice as strong at Tier 3.” 

>>[13] Formless Oedon – ""The Great One Oedon, lacking form, exists only in voice, and is symbolized by this rune. Those who memorize it enjoy a larger supply of Quicksilver Bullets. Like ‘Communion,’ Formless Oedon is a special rune tied to an item you've been given, the ‘Bag of Quicksilver Bullets.’ 

Tier 1 increases its capacity by one, Tier 2 by three, and Tier 3 by five. Like ‘Communion,’ if you upgraded your Bag of Quicksilver Bullets it will now refill over time to the new maximum capacity.”

>>[14] Great Deep Sea – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices depicts down-reaching currents. Frenzy, slow acting toxins, deadly fast acting toxins, the ‘Great Deep Sea’ protects the one who bares it against a wide variety of problematic body degrading ailments.

It's half as effective as the more focused ""Deep Sea"" runes Tier for Tier, but is generally more applicable. Tier 3 is three times as effective as Tier 1 with this in mind.” 

>>[15] Great Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voice ripples like a watery reflection. Great Lake is an all-encompassing form of the other ‘Lake’ runes, warding the body against all forms of bodily harm. 

The drawback of course is that the more focused runes are twice as good at protecting against their select form of damage compared to this one, Tier for Tier. Tier 3 is a bit less than twice the potency of Tier 1 with this in mind.” 

>>[16] Guidance – “A Caryll rune discovered by the old hunter Ludwig along with the Holy Moonlight Sword. Guidance is a special rune tied to the ‘Rally’ Perk, improving the potency of the health regeneration whenever you trigger it. Even Tier 1 has a noticeable, though small, boost; meanwhile, the Tier 3 rune is about three times as potent.”  

>>[17] Lake – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices ripples like a watery reflection. This rune hardens the skin, making physical attacks of all kinds less effective as they struggle to get through. Not immediately noticeable at first, but helps more than you'd think over prolonged conflicts. 

Tier 3 is a bit under three times as effective as the low effect Tier 1 rune.” 

>>[18] Oedon Writhe – “Writhe sees a subtle mucous in the warmth of blood, and acknowledges visceral attacks as one of the darker hunter techniques. A unique ability, whenever you use ‘Visceral Attacks’ and similar techniques, Quicksilver Bullets will appear in your possession.

If your bag is full, then the bullets may appear in a pocket, in hand, or just on the ground. Tier 1 grants a single bullet for each attack successfully performed in this way, Tier 2 grants two bullets, and Tier 3 grants three bullets.” 

>>[19] Stunning Deep Sea – “This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices depicts down reaching currents. Some toxins weaken the body and kill over time, others kill you before you can count to three. 

This rune grants your body and blood resistance to being afflicted with the latter, helping keep you safe from these deadly, fast acting toxins and similar ailments by requiring greater doses before they take effect. Tier 1 is noticeable, while Tier 3 is about three times as potent.”"
208,,100,Cleansing Pyre,Elden Ring,Modus,"To purify the Scarlet Rot, many Redmane knights brandished a cleansing flame. Not only have you mastered the war art that bestows this flame on your weapons, but for you, fire you personally kindle or otherwise create of all kinds has a particularly cleansing effect on all manner of corruptive forces. Pots of flame are supernaturally effective on creatures inherently composed of or otherwise linked to forces such as the Scarlet Rot, and surprisingly curative to those merely tainted by them. Scourge the land with flame long enough, and if not fully cured it could at least prevent the Rot from spreading further without external influence."
209,,100,Warrior of the Crucible ,Elden Ring,Modus,"It is said that the Erdtree’s primordial formwas a crucible of life, in which all life was blended together by its primal vital energies. Somewhere in your past you have studied a great many incantations and fighting techniques which channel the primordial form of life’s energy through you. You know an Ash of War that lets you become temporarily invisible to most, through a dodge faster and further than most mortal warriors in this land can manage that lets you encircle your foe like a hunting wolf. You can conjure various natural weapon projections of vital Erdtree energy such as horns, tails and a throat pouch to breathe out a blast of fire on your body, incorporating them flawlessly into your savage fighting style. From filling your body with bestial vigour that heals you in the thick of battle, to a roar powerful enough to knock back warriors flying, to incantations evoking the power of primitive flung stone in sheer skill at least you can match the Beast Clergyman Gurranq. A sad thing, how few respect such primal power now that civilisation has moved on."
210,,100,Memory Spell Specialist,Harry Potter,Modus,You have a gift for memory charms allowing you to erase and replace memories with an almost preternatural skill once you learn the required spells.

For the Color of your origin you gain this perk free. For the Colors allied (adjacent) to your origin’s Color you can gain this perk for 100 CP for the second alignment and 50 CP for the third onward. Lastly for the Colors opposing (opposite) your origin’s Color you can gain this perk for 200 CP for the second alignment and 100 CP for the third onward. 

This perk gives you a solid understanding of the fundamentals of this Color, allowing you to easily serve as a peer in a respectable magical academy, start creating your own spells, and more easily form connections to creatures of the same Color without tutelage.

This perk also lets you apply discounts to second Color’s perks for which you have bought alignment in addition to your origin, but does not give you the free 100 CP perks instead counting them as discounted. This can be taken multiple times up the the maximum of five times."

The benefits of this are two-fold, the first being a ‘gift’ passed down your bloodline and the second being the ability to use witchcraft, a system of magic different from the hermetic spells used by mages, letting witches use spells than can’t be done by mages, like flight. By default, your gift is a weak version of the Spirit Eyes, which lets you connect to the Memories of the Void in the Netherworld and investigate the past of things and beings. Although you can also choose to have a minor form of Telekinesis, Spirit Senses or Prophesy."
213,,100,The Magic Of Mortals,Campione,Modus,"The esoteric powers for mortals aren’t quite the same as those of divine nature, being more akin to borrowing small amounts of magic force from the gods, a prayer answered. Still humans have come quite a way through making do with what they have. You are a prime example of such, being trained in spell and sword with focus on their physically practical applications over versatile occultism from a young age. While you aren’t quite in the same league as the Great Knights that lead their Orders, you could reach them in time given enough effort and opportunity."
214,,100,Magic ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have a general grasp of how magic works in this world. Unfortunately, any serious magical spells need ingredients, such as mushrooms, or scales containing the condensed essence of the Water Dragon’s power. While with the right items and fuels, turning a mountain to ash would be a simple feat, without any you will find yourself unable to muster up more than a refreshing, cool breeze. For this reason, a magician who is caught unprepared is relatively easy to defeat however strong they are after careful preparation.

It’s an accepted fact of life for Warlocks that they’ll most likely die not from enemy action, but from their own magic, as the only price it takes is the cancerous corruption it weaves into your body as it’s channeled through your aura.

Furthermore, while Divine magic can be channeled as much as you wish, it is divine power. Channelling too much will cause you to combust, though the god you call upon will warn you before such an event occurs.

Such appreciation even sees Imperial Wizards always being able to get a free meal or overnight inn room in the Mootland in exchange for a magical performance. Alas, for a halfling to be able to overcome their resistance and be able to wield even one of the Winds of Magic is a monumental effort. 

You’re one of the few halflings to have done so, becoming an Enchanter. Select one of the Lores taught by the Imperial Colleges of Magic: Fire, Beasts, Heavens, Light, Life, Metal, or Shadow (as unfortunately, due to proximity to Sylvania the idea of a halfling practicing the Lore of Death is a nigh impossibility).

The Ritual of Gnawing, to conjure a swarm of invisible, biting rats that chew through all manner of obstacle and defense; The Warp Storm, splitting the earth and sky with wracks of warp-lightning; Or the Pit of the Underworld, to crack open the earth wide and drop all one’s victims and “allies” many kilometers down.

A warning, brother-rat of Clan Pestilens. The Lore of Plague reaps a heavy toll on the world and the mortals you wage war against.

Shooting daggers with your eyes might not be possible, but if you tried it anyways they might come down with a case of bad luck and accidentally end up stabbing themselves. Even when you aren’t ill wishing those around you, you put out an aura of sorts. It could be the wicked glee as you pull one over on the defenders of light, or the sheer malice you feel at being thwarted. The more magical power you have the more you can do with this, from simple bad luck and a vague sense of unease all the way up to leaving the hero unable to draw his sword from lack of strength and will and outright stripping a Great Fairy of her rank, or giving prophets nightmares about you simply from you being in the country."

You also have the ability to manipulate three of the following elements from the selection below. You may purchase this again, discounted for Mage but not free, for an additional Element per purchase.

The Fire Element can be used to create waves of flame and small explosions at will, both excellent for initial damage and damage over time.

The Water Element may not seem like much at first, conjuring crashing waves of water to push or pull foes and such, but your control over the water you create could grant you additional advantages. Like slowly enclosing foes in layer after layer of water that, at your will would slow them down as well as apply pressure upon foes.

The Earth Element is useful in its ability to produce blunt, but easy to manipulate, effects. Tearing up hunks of the ground and throwing them around would be easy. While simple it is dangerously effective and without any fancy tricks it makes up for it in impact.

The Wind Element is very good for crowd control and utility. Blades of air are damaging but the primary power of Wind is the sheer force behind it, able to drag any foe not thrice your own size towards you or creating whirlwinds that you can use to retrieve objects or spin around enemies to daze them.

The Element of Darkness is a powerful additive that can easily be mixed into the other four Elements to create stronger effects, almost twice as strong in most cases, however on it’s own it merely creates wells of darkness that can deal no damage of note.

This allows you to use any of the various magical items of Zelda without any teaching, have a perfect knowledge of your mana pool, and grants you a slight boost in generic mana pool size.

It is heat, warmth, comfort, light, and much more. You have pondered the meaning of

While fire magic isn't much different in combat to regular magic, its versatility is what makes it valuable. The user can even control the temperature of the fire presicely so long as they concentrate on it, ranging anywhere from pleasantly warm to hot enough to forge steel. It is to be noted that Fire Magic tends to not affect living beings as it would inanimate objects, so a magical fire attack would not leave burns- Like White Magic, it instead directly attacks the SOUL."

294,,200,Talismonger,Overlord,Modus,"This class bears a lot of similarities to classic oriental magical traditions in that
you cast spells via the use of special talismans that you can create. Only you can use the
talismans you create (unless the other person has ‘Use Any Magic Item’). You’re not quite as
focused in the arcane side of things as an Arcane Caster, and not as good at divine magics as a
Divine Caster, but you make up for it in dabbling in both at the same time and having a fair
amount of exotic or otherwise unconventional magics you can call up. Where you really shine
though is that you can prepare talismans with specific spells ahead of time, allowing you to
effectively ‘cast’ those spells when you’re not in combat and then keep them in reserve until
they’re actually needed. In this fashion you can dramatically increase your combat endurance
via intelligent preparation. Crafting these talismans takes you a bit of time, effort, and some
resources and they’re only one use, but it’s dramatically easier and cheaper for you to do than
anyone else could ever possibly hope to claim. Just starting out you know a fair amount of
spells to inflict negative maladies upon your foes, and defeating a large group of armed warriors
is as simple for you as cast a few of your magics and then letting time do the rest."
295,,200,Talismaster,Overlord,Modus,"You have a fairly even mix of both arcane and divine spells, however
your spells in those disciplines are not as powerful, broad in scope, or quite as versatile as an
individual that specialized in those classes. Your single and area target debuffs and curses
however are substantially better than either by a considerable margin. You will be able to inflict
a large variety of negative status effects, such as confusion, insanity, vertigo, torpor, poisons,
the more powerful ‘toxins’, polymorphing, petrification, instant death effects, and more. Your
bread and butter, such as it is, is that you are capable of debilitating foes, whether they come
individually or in large groups, to such devastating effect that often times the battle is won
without you having to deal any ‘direct’ damage at all. You are equally skilled at defending
against such maladies. In addition your Talismans can now hold two spells at a time, however
they must be the same spell.

magical item regardless of whether or not you actually meet the prerequisites or conditions
normally required to use it. Wield a Holy Avenger as a black-hearted demon? No problem. A
book of spells only powerful wizards could even open, much less learn from, when you’re a
fighter? You can use it. A specific magic item intended solely for its creator and that repels the
touch of anyone else? As far as it's concerned you are its creator. While this innate talent has a
very narrow effect within its purview it is virtually flawless."

larger energy output letting them actively utilize more energy. You are one of these
beings with a truly massive output. If a normal person's energy output is akin to a small
stream, yours is comparable to the vast expanse of the ocean. This immense output
allows you to utilize far more energy in any given moment, overwhelming opponents
who may possess equal energy reserves but lack your level of output. As your pool of
energy grows, this ability becomes even more pronounced. Should this be purchased alongside Inexhaustible, a simple Fireball jutsu could engulf the Sun in magnitude."

on, your body will move perfectly and at full speed to attack, dodge, block or reach any foe or action
you could normally do whilst your mind is free to think independent of this. Your body is still slaved
to your senses however and cannot move faster than it normally could, only better, and thus it
remains possible to trick your reflexes, though if you choose to focus on your actions at the same

state. When you create offspring with another person or personally and directly organise the
coupling of two separate beings, you are able to dictate which traits of the parents are passed on,
including things that might not normally be passed on like personality traits that the parents gained
from socialisation and that have no genetic markers. You’re also amazingly good at raising children, particularly in moulding them into being specific sorts of people and having specific likes and loves

conditions for any power or ability that you possess, including things like spells, to activate based on
conditions. You can set a fireball to activate on a time delay, have a shield spell go off when you’re
hurt beyond a certain level or even have a self-destruct ability automatically occur when you die

sinewy muscle tissue, and...you get the point. Fortunately, eating people is more than just a lifestyle choice
- it's a way for you to grow more powerful. Each human (or in future jumps, any humanoid creature) you
devour increases your strength, although the precise amount is...well, there isn't one. The increase is
roughly logarithmic, in that it takes substantially more humans to reach new ""tiers,"" but unlike most demons,
you don't have a cap on how far this can take you. Hell, who even needs the First Demon's blood to make
them stronger; eat enough humans, and you might be able to defeat even them...

304,,200,Demon Blood Arts,Demon Slayer,Modus,"Demons of sufficient power have cool-ass magic powers. You, regardless if you even have that ""sufficient

your ""Demon Blood Art,"" which lets you do something awesome. Maybe you can transform your blood into
something else (ice, fire, spiders); maybe you can duplicate yourself by tearing off pieces of your flesh and
tossing them away from you; maybe you can shift gravity based on a series of chords or rhythms you play.
What exactly your power does is up to you, so long as you remember one thing: it has to involve using your
body (flesh, blood, bone, what have you) in some way as a sacrifice for the spell's effect. You'll get it back,
don't worry...

You can grab lasers and throw them back, explosions and redirect them, and you can even grab entire buildings if you are strong enough. You gain 15x faster reaction speed and anything you catch cannot harm you or escape your grip unless you want it to. This can negate teleportation as well."
306,,200,Fully Realized,Bleach,Modus,"The world of businesses is just as cutthroat as the world of the shadows, particularly if you have a
distinct lack of morals and the willingness to murder or brainwash any potential opposition. It might not have to come to that though, since you’re actually rather talented when it comes to the field. Creating, running and expanding business is easy for you, regardless of what you actually might be selling. Organisations under your hand tend to experience explosive growth and will often quickly absorb similar rival companies in the same field, if you choose to act in such a predatory manner. No one minds when you get a little nepotistic either, installing your personal friends in positions of wealth doesn’t cause a fuss and those friends either luck into never causing trouble or discover useful talents of their own."
307,,200,Ransotengai Master,Bleach,Modus,"An old technique, at first created to help the elderly move about, but with surprising advantages for
combat. Ransotengai is the manipulation of threads and ribbons of spiritual energy. At the most
basic level, a string of energy extends from the user’s body and can attach to another object to move
it. But you’re no basic user but a master in full. Hundreds, even thousands of spirit threads, can be manipulated with fine skill at once. The original
intention of allowing for movement in frail bodies is fully realised, as you can control your body
solely through the use of these threads. Even if every muscle and nerve was disabled, there’d be no
loss in efficiency for your fighting ability. So long as your spiritual energy still responded. The threads
can also be extended and shaped for offense or utility purposes. Each thread like a powerful limb
even at great range, moving what it connects to or perhaps even being sharpened to a terrific edge
to slice anything it connects with. The flaw of Ransotengai is that the fine threads cannot contain
much power, not without a lot of focus. While you are known as a master by other Quincy, it is by no means impossible to progress. Perhaps
the next stage is to learn to manipulate the bodies of others with your energy strings, turning them
into puppets regardless of the will of their bodies."
308,,200,Clog Wearing Menace,Bleach,Modus,"Sometimes a man is too clever. They get caught up in schemes to conquer the world and account for
every variable, so much that they become predictable. You’re not smart enough to match them on
an equal playing field, just smart enough to realise what they expect of you and how to play against
those expectations. They unconsciously rely on their preferred stereotypes and desires. This quickly
attained knowledge lets you act with unpredictability and chaos, tripping up the plans of these super
geniuses that consider themselves above everyone. If they really are a mental giant compared to
your mind, it might not work so well, but you’re more than capable of making a lot of complications
in the plans of the mighty and powerful. In a fight however, these traits make you quite the terror, concealing your intended actions from opponents with the experience or skill to predict them. All the easier to lay some tricks and traps of your own on them. "
309,,200,Maze-like Mind,Bleach,Modus,"The labyrinthine Seireitei, the dense jungle of death in Hueco Mundo, even the identical white
corridors of the Silbern. People get lost all the time, especially if not for those with your skills. You’re
a natural explorer, guide and delver into mazes. A quick and easy understanding of how maps and
locations are laid out, letting you build mental pathways to quickly seek through most confusing
locations. Even a difficult maze poses little challenge and you can easily turn this on any pursuer, quickly losing your own hunters or trackers. You know all sorts of ways to lose a tail, from simple ducks and dodges into tiny passageways to Reiryoku based techniques to confuse sensors or disguise the tracks you laid. All the better to circle around and set up an ambush of your own."
310,,200,Accelerated Science,Bleach,Modus,"Science isn’t meant to be an overly speedy process. Discovering, studying, researching, testing, replicating results and making sure it’s all safe and viable for use. Even something small can take months or years, in the hands of an incompetent dullard. But here, the intelligent make progress beyond any reasonable pace, seemingly only because of their intelligence. Your own research accelerates in step with your cerebral brilliance, allowing a proper genius to fully research and develop ideas in weeks that might normally take months. Those at the top of the field might do it in days or even less, creating incredible new technologies to counter enemies only discovered a week ago. Somehow, you manage to fit enough testing to make these creations reasonably safe for use. "
311,,200,Typhoon Release,Naruto,Modus,"Basically a stronger version of Wind Release, with it the user can generate far stronger winds to mow down his opponent than can be possible with normal Wind Release. The storms that can be generated with this bloodline are so powerful they could cover and destroy an entire island once you've achieved requisite mastery."
312,,200,Jutsu Mastery,Naruto,Modus,"Your control over jutsu is akin to an experienced master, any jutsu you already know no longer needs hand signs to use beyond the most basic of ones like one needed for Fireball Technique. Any technique you learn will very quickly be mastered up to this level: a great example of this is creating rasengan with just one hand, but this doesn’t end at that, you can even create rasenshuriken with just one hand if you know it."
313,,200,Majestic Sculptor of Worlds,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Modus,"Many Ōtsutsuki are known for performing
feats of gigantic proportions that in the eyes of mere mortals are truly godlike, such
as Shibai that was known for casually being able to generate storms with a mere
wave of his hand and to call forth thunderbolts with just an angry roar. Many of these
feats are the result of enhancing techniques and other abilities by using even more
power on them, with a case that perfectly exemplifies this is the usage of Rasengan
by Momoshiki that amplifies its size from being hand-sized into a gigantic scale.
However, merely adding more energy without any care into a technique is usually
pretty inefficient and may make it more unstable. Fortunately, as a result of
specializing yourself in this, acquired experience over the cycles or due to an innate
affinity with enhancing techniques over their regular limit, you’re now able to fuel any
technique and/or ability you have to with any amount of power without needing to
worry about any loss of efficiency or instability caused by it, allowing you to both
enhance them by fueling them with additional power or use weaker versions of them
by limiting the energy you use."
314,,200,Casting Animation Cancel,Bofuri,Modus,"Spells are slow, and you’re fast.

This cuts down the time needed to cast any spell or skill by five seconds. This means the shortest-cast spells take no time at all to cast. In addition, any gestures involved in casting those spells aren’t needed anymore, and the gestures for the spells that aren’t now instant are simplified and shortened.

No need to worry about doing a gesture exactly right while in the middle of a backflip anymore."
315,,200,Voiceless Command,Bofuri,Modus,"You no longer need to use words to activate your skills or cast spells - at least, if the words are pretty much just the name of the spell, attack, or ability. You’ll still need to chant if you have a spell that requires that, but for the shorter incantations there is no difference between saying the words and not. Those are just like using your muscles."
316,,200,Level Cap? What Level Cap?        ,Bofuri,Modus,"Your physical and magical abilities have no upper limit. Speed, strength, reflexes, power, control, all of those have no cap. Become tough enough that even the final boss couldn’t touch your HP bar, become fast enough to dodge attacks most consider instant, toss mountains, hit an entire world with a spell, and keep going from there.

Well, eventually, at least.

(Note that having ridiculous STR, or any ability for that matter, won’t have any effect on your appearance. See Mai and Yui - they have a lot of STR and not a lot of muscle.)"
317,,200,CSB (Command Synergy Battle),Final Fantasy XIII,Modus,"The inherent system behind magic on Cocoon and Pulse was perhaps alien to you, but it was only alien for so long before you understood and adapted to it.

Spells/Skills can be queued up to be cast all at once. Queued spells/skills are cast with no cast time, but the delay following them is lengthened."
318,,200,Resonance,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Modus,"In the beginning, Creation consisted of an infinite number of levels of meaning. A sword could be a song, a rose, a spirit and a philosophy, and existed as all these things at once. The Elohim use symbols and meaning to affect the very fabric of Creation through the power of her lore. Reciting a poem could cause a star to be born, because the star and poem were one in the same. You still regain a bit of this skill, and you find a significant boost in any supernatural ability as long as you have some kind resonance that holds a deeper meaning to both the power and you. As an example, a demon could invoke the Lore of Flame while holding the ashes of a close friend, and their fire would burn hotter, their control be more minute, and their general range would be measurably larger."
319,,200,The Path of the Unforeseen Card ,Cradle V1,Modus,"This path was created when a copper sacred artist had no desire to take in vital aura and thus etched scripts on tree bark to accomplish tasks. Since that day, the path has become somewhat versatile, with cards able to do a variety of things such as summoning sacred beasts, group healing effects, aoe damage effects, and even some cards that influence a person’s mind.

320,,200,Name of Power,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"Not all beings have powerful Names, but like the gods, yours is one of them. By invoking your Name aloud, you may reinforce a working of heka or a feat of godly power. When used in such a manner, your Name hammers your magic through barriers and resistances, reinforces it against meddling, braces and supports it so it lasts longer and dies out less readily, although its raw effect may only be slightly enhanced.

Your Name of Power works no matter who utters it - you can grant your own Name(s) to others for them to use in this way, but equally an enemy who overhears it spoken aloud may use it.

If you have a Greater and Lesser Name, this perk works off your Greater Name. If not, it works off one of your existing names."
321,,200,Separation From Self ,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"As a brand-new god or mortal stepping out on the world, it would certainly be a shame if some mere witch got a piece of you and put you into her power. A stray hair, a drop of spittle, spilled blood...any of these castoffs could betray you if they fell into the hands of hostile magi or gods with the will and the magic to work upon the link between yourself and it.

Only the parts of yourself that you deliberately separate with the intention of keeping that sympathetic link can be used in magical rituals or spells; all other cast-off bits become mere dead matter, worthless to a magus."
322,,200,Go Thou Far,Marvel Zombies,Modus,"You are a trained exorcist. Expelling and expunging all sorts of incorporeal entities controlling someone’s body is something you’re experienced in, as it’s your job to. From weak spirits to the Sorcerer Supreme of the Dark Dimension, there is very, very little that you cannot drive from a mortal vessel. You’re knowledgeable in all the ways a possessing entity might try to deter you - from vomiting invertebrate -filled sludge all over to you to shapeshifting into your dead wife in an attempt to traumatize you - and you’ve got the strength of will to power through all of that to connect with the true owner of the body and excise whatever foul being has invaded them."
323,,200,Weather Soul         ,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"By concentrating your inner energies, you can channel the weather through your body. The area of effect is fixed to twenty meters around you.
Sun: An intense heat radiates from your body, blinding and burning foes nearby. Makes you become a nice heater though.
Rain: Water pours out from your mouth, swamping foes and sweeping them away.
Windstorm: You become the center of a small tornado, deflecting projectiles and knocking foes back.
Snow: The ground around you freezes and enemies are slowed down to a tenth of their speed.
Overcast: A dense fog spreads over the battlefield, and enemies start seeing hallucinations.
Sandstorm: Afterimages begin to appear, and everybody is more likely to miss with their attacks."
324,,200,Circus of Itano ,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"It’s not enough to fire a single salvo of missiles. After learning from a Master Moogle Mechanic, you learned the art of adding a payload within a payload, such that the projectiles you send forth will split into three smaller copies. This includes bullets, missiles, and arrows, thrown weapons, lasers and other ranged weaponry.

You’re sure the resulting fireworks would have made the Moogle proud."
325,,200,Gambits,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"You and your companions can set Gambits, a single command tied to a condition which allows you to instantly cast a spell without consideration of reaction time or cool down. (Such as casting a healing spell below a certain threshold) It only works once before resetting, and fails if you do not have the proper resources for it. You must designate the Gambit outside of battle."
326,,200,Zodiac Augmentation,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"By choosing a single sign to focus upon, the user locks out all other Licenses and learns the next tier of the chosen sign. This negates multiple licenses, if multiple licenses were chosen – so don’t go around buying a bunch of licenses just to take this!

Aries/Serenity: It took a while of throwing yourself into the thick of things, but you’ve come out with the ability to find your inner peace even as arrows and swords are flying around you. Your spellcasting cannot be stopped when you are hurt, though it may still be stopped if your concentration snaps by other means. 

Taurus/Last Stand: You’re the last man standing, perhaps your companions have fallen, or they’re simply absent. But you’ll fight even harder knowing that the only thing standing in their way is you. For a short time, you won’t even feel pain as their blows and spells land on you.

Gemini/Adrenaline: That last spurt of energy as you feel your life ebbing away, you’ve gotten a hang of it now that you’ve been beaten into the ground countless times. On your last legs, you find the will and resolve to move quicker – if only for one final blow.

Cancer/Spellbreaker: If you can see them casting – chances are they won’t be casting. With a gesture you’ve learned involving a specific finger movement; you can stun enemy mages enough to interfere with their spells.

Leo/Martyr: The Knight is a champion that defends all. At least, that’s what you were taught. Of course, trying to remember that as you shield your allies is a bit difficult, but it has helped you to learn how to recover a bit faster.

Virgo/Brawler: By beating up countless people in drunken brawls, you finally feel fit to declare yourself a master. Granted, it was mostly against drunken soldiers, but you can definitely weave in and out of blows much better than before.

Libra/Channeling: After a frustratingly long amount of time spent realizing spells cost too much energy, you asked a Nu Mou for help on your issue. The book he gave you taught you how to control your energy flow properly. It didn’t reduce the cost of spells to nothing, but it did reduce them by a little bit.

Scorpio/Headsman: There’s been too much that you’ve had to kill. But the thought that the fight will be over once they’re all dead keeps you going, and with each enemy that falls, you feel a little stronger.

Sagittarius/Clearance Room: After a while of using your bow, you’ve come to realize that it gets pretty antsy when enemies draw close. You’ve become a lot more aware of your surroundings, but on top of that, learning how to slide several meters in a direction really helped. Ok, your knees and legs hurt afterwards – but then you got armour padding for that too.

Capricorn/Warmage: It was one thing to have spells that damaged people – but when you asked the resident Nu Mou scholar, he shook his head, chuckled and tossed you a book. “Magic for Novices”. Apparently, spells should do more than just damage people. After studying some of the theories in the book, you can now apply the concepts inside, and your spells return a small amount of energy to you when they land.

Aquarius/Focus: It’s all just a state of mind – and when yours is in perfect sync, you feel like your sword can cut through steel. Sure, you don’t think your sword was folded a thousand times like the smith said, but it does seem to cut better when you’re focused.

Pisces/Swiftness: So the Samurai challenged you to a race. He won, only because it turned out he added a condition to cut a melon after reaching the finish line. It wasn’t a very fair condition of course, but you decided afterwards to push your training up. Now it’s done, and you feel like you can do everything just a little bit faster than before.

You’re a master fighter of almost any weapon, including hand-to-hand, but you’ve a particular focus on the strange, enlarged, and wacky, giant scythe that can turn into a chain? You can easily wrap it around the heel of your opponent’s foot and swing them around before stabbing them in the face with the end of it. Giant machine arms that can act as miniguns for each finger? You know how to combo both your ranged attacks and your strength to empower each of your blows with a bit of extra kick.

Alongside this you’ve perfect awareness of your surroundings, easily able to fight hundreds if not thousands of weaker foes by yourself and come out-on top, picking up weapons from the fallen and using them and discarding them as you please like it was a dance. The environment is often never to your disadvantage, fighting while sliding down massive chains is just as easy as fighting on solid ground for you and moving waist-deep in water doesn’t impede your movement in any noticeable way. Tactics also get a boost as you’re able to plan your next moves calmly and concisely as you’re being flung into the air while upside down and missing an arm, somehow, someway, you’ll know you’re going to come out on top.

As a bonus, you seem to know how to modify items and weapons made out of thought and emotion with relative ease, knowing how to integrate regular materials that shouldn’t fit with them or otherwise finding paths to upgrades to improve their capabilities in time."

Summoned with a chant a few sentences long, this power will be decided in the following section. You will be able to freely choose what your power is and it may grow in strength over time as you gain more souls, the following section simply decides the limits you may operate within for that choice. Do note that while the strength of your power will grow with your Ewigkeit, the actual abilities it possesses will not change or have new powers added through this growth, save for if you reach the Atziluth stage. 

Type
There are two types of powers. Hegemony/Hadou and Transcendence/Gudou. Hegemony powers come from people whose desires are focused on the world around them. A man who wished to experience one perfect moment forever would be a Hegemony type and might gain the ability to slow or even stop time. Hegemony powers are thus those that are directed towards the world around the user. Transcendence powers come from those whose deepest desires are focused on themselves and what they can do. A boy who wished to never be touched might gain the power to be faster than any opponent. These powers are those that alter the self or internal of the user. Hegemony types are the most likely to become Gods, given they naturally trend towards being more ambitious, but Hegemony Gods cannot co-exist with any other God of the same type. Choose whichever type most fits your own deepest desire. 

Levels
What your power can do is up to you, within the limits of your Type, but how much it can do will be decided here. Not all powers are equal and there are some who possess greater Creation Figments than those stronger than them. A girl who can create and control fire can’t be said to have a power equal with a man who can kill anything he touches that has a history. The below levels will indicate the breadth and depth of the power you can choose. 

Second
At this level, your power is allowed to expand and cover much more. Your power may have several distinct effects or allow for the manipulation of esoteric or magical substances. This also covers magical versions of First tier powers. Abilities such as the manipulation of magical shadows and darkness are one example. The ability to summon a pocket dimension that counts as your body around yourself in which it is always night, where the life of those within the dimension is slowly drained and you gain the traits of a vampire, both beneficial and not, is another. A fire manipulation power that has fires that eternally chase their target, bypass any resistance to fire, attack the soul directly and also grant the ability to force you and your target into a pocket dimension of endless hellfire is another example. Wilhelm Ehrenburg, Eleonore von Wittenburg and Rusalka Schwagerin are all examples of this level.

Third
At this level, your power may now be something of extreme innate might, even independent of a large amount of souls. Absolute effects of a specific focus, manipulation of very broad and powerful things or abilities with a large number of weaker manifestations. Powers such as always being faster than your opponent, no matter how fast they are or what they do to try and speed up themselves or slow you down, are an example. The ability to erase any being or concept that you are able to punch, so long as it has even the smallest millisecond of history is one more. Becoming able to manipulate all of time, slowing or perhaps even stopping it near you, as well as esoteric effects such as stopping the time of your history to prevent yourself gaining more or speeding up the regeneration of your energy or slowing down your opponents are another. Machina, Fuji Ren, Wolfgang Shcreiber or Yusa Shirou are examples of this level.

335,,200,Witch,Dies Irae,Modus,"The arts of Magic are seen as somewhat lacking in comparison to Die Ewigkeit, at least for mortal practitioners. There are few left who know how to use spells even among the scarce supernatural population of this world. But you’re one of those few, even if just an intermediate caster. You’ve got a very wide array of knowledge on the supernatural, on potions of many kinds and of course, on spells. Spells for healing, for hypnosis, to create barriers of force, to extend unnaturally the youth and life of people by a few decades and more. You have much more breadth than most of the peers you’d find in this world but it would take years of practice to advance your power, years that may not be available without some way of truly extending your life."

You can read the minds of people who are within the range of your sight, see into the future for short and unfocused bursts, move objects as heavy as adult people with your mind and even look and hear distant places through clairvoyance.

Make a flat palm and swing it around really fast and you might as well be using a sword. You’ve got the ability to be able to use Martial Arts techniques that require a weapon or require not using a weapon with the opposite instead. Your sword techniques can be used with empty hands and your unarmed martial arts can be translated easily into forms that you can utilise with a sword, spear or other weapon. Whilst this ability works instantaneously, the translated techniques will be less powerful until you can actually train their use for a bit to recover that power. And anything that actually does require a specific weapon, such as an ability or move unique to a single sword, cannot be translated to the opposite format with this."

341,,200,Dakhor        ,Elantris,Modus,"Native to Fjordell, the art of Dahkor seems to draw more from Dominion’s power than Devotion’s. Driven heavily by practiced rituals and incantations, Dahkor twists the skeletons of its practitioners until ancient Fjordell symbols are carved into their bones. These twisted bones may appear monstrous initially, but they are completely functional and can be hidden by a simple robe if needed. Though their augmented bodies offer greatly enhanced strength and speed, the primary strength of the Dakhor monks is their tremendous durability. Each augmented bone is almost indestructible, granting supreme protection against most mundane weapons.

Dakhor can also be used to create more complex and subtle effects. One ritual can grant a practitioner a new appearance at the cost of a painful transformation. Other rituals can be used to teleport individuals or groups across vast distances, or to imbue a target with a powerful resistance to supernatural energies. Be warned, however, that these more complex effects exact a heavy toll. The more powerful the effect of a ritual is, the greater number of lives are demanded in payment. If you want to explore this discipline’s greatest powers, you’re going to need plenty of sacrifices."
342,,200,Theatric Qualities ,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"Well now, you can’t expect to star in a show without having some skills now, can you? By taking one of these courses, you’ll be able to specialize further on one acting aspect. Each time you take this, you can pick a different specialization.

Readers’ Theatre
No props, no scenery, no costumes. With only your voice, you’ll be able to create limited illusions. The images, however vivid, will break when they are moved through, and will fade naturally a short time after appearing. With further refinement, you can create moving illusions.

Stage Combat
The art of mock fighting – this will improve your ability to control your blows, so that you can refrain from fatally wounding a person, even when they would be struck dead otherwise. As you get more practice, you can start to control the destructive capacity of spells and so forth.

Tension Grid
More of a tool than a quality, the tension grid allows one to walk on air, supported by a conjured mesh of fine cables. The grid can bear a substantial amount of weight, but the real draw is that the grid can be used in the same fashion as a mobile trampoline.

The farther the distance between the tension grid and a flat surface below, the more energy it takes to maintain the grid."
343,,200,The Dragon ,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"For this we’re going to have to find you an instructor, but after you finish with her, you’ll be proficient in the basic skills as a Dragoon. You’ll master the art of leaping into the air to assail enemies with your spear. Your instructor will also teach you the skills “Lancer” and “Reis’s Wind”, but you’ll have to find a way to learn the rest on your own. Maybe other Dragoons in the world could help you learn the rest?"

Considering his first “lesson” is in eating your enemies raw without risking diseases – you might want to be wary of this guy. Just by consuming your weakened foes, you can recover a small bit of health and energy. That said though, he does stress that the whole process is optimized if you can cook your enemies while they’re at their liveliest – when the ingredients are fresh. Eating them then might even give you a temporary ability dependent on what you ate. Still though...is it really safe to learn from somebody with no qualms of eating things live?"

This isn't Earth, where you can throw your fancy name around and live a good life. Your presence here regardless sends ripples across Hell. Because you carry his blood in you, any powers that are demonic in nature get a x6 boost, with angelic powers getting a x3 boost. Remember how I said you would have a target on your back if you chose Hellfire? Yeah, multiply that by 10. Pretty much everyone will be gunning for you. Expect to see a couple of assassins a month, since your daddy thought it would be safe letting you live in Hell by yourself. Being watched from the shadows constantly will be your new life, since just being on the battlefield can single handedly win wars here in Hell."
346,,200,Power of Ego: Selfish Reality,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"The Power of Ego, or the Power of the Self, is a special ability found among many strong Daeva. A sharp contrast to the Miracles of the Ashavan, which are based on the Power of the Many, this is an ability that sources its power in the strong will of an individual. It allows the user to accomplish a multitude of effects that defy the laws of physics, and even causality, simply by willing it. Things such as scooping half of a building using a spoon from across the street, twisting space, so an attack becomes unavoidable or forcibly negating the regeneration of an enemy.

Since this is an often-found power among the Daeva, those of the side of evil taking this perk instead find themselves with an immense talent for using the Power of Ego, if they couldn’t already use it, as well as a strong will to back it up. Those of the side of good instead gain this ability, something that is usually only possible for them via Commandments or artifacts."
347,,200,Commandment: Vow(Lesser),Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"The basis of most supernatural abilities in the First Heaven, the Commandment appears as a self-imposed limitation taken before the Avesta. It is a declaration against the world that reflects the warrior’s personality and ideology. By swearing to God to live in a certain way, you receive a boon in exchange.

The nature of this boon varies greatly, since in the end it is up to the Truth to determine such a thing. Normally, a very restrictive bond would result in a greater power. Things such as vowing to always achieve victory, refusing any kind of companionship and living in solitude, or always fighting any being that establishes mutual recognition with one’s full strength. But there are other factors that may influence this result, such as the person’s own disposition and ideals. For example, a gentle being who took a vow of solitude would see a greater boon than those who are loners by nature. But also, those with great wills will see their Commandments also bear great results if it matches their nature, such as someone with a massive thirst for battle limiting themselves to not take any action that isn’t related to killing after establishing mutual recognition when another. And lastly, there is the own opinion of the Truth herself, who may grant better boons if she simply sees fit to do so, whether as part of her own plans or simply due to her own amusement or personal opinions of the person in fact.

The vow you take is very important, because breaking it will incur a divine punishment. When this break is unintentional, this may result in your death via divine punishment, enforced by the Law of the Truth. But when this breakthrough of your Commandment results from a willing act, an event known as Forced Falling Down occurs, in which the breaker is forced to switch sides, resulting in a change of personality and power, almost always for the worse.

While this indeed a dire thing, it is not as if most Commandments don’t have loopholes around their limitations. For example, Quinn’s Commandment makes her follow the orders of others to be able to act, and she cannot stop following other people’s orders. But the orders she receives are ranked in importance, so she can disregard someone’s orders as long as it is to fulfill a higher duty. Samrukh was also able to replace her lost limbs with prosthetics without violating her ‘do not heal yourself’ commandment.

There is also the possibility for those who have outgrown the Law of this universe itself to rebel against the punishment and outright ignore it, or even use brute force to warp reality in a way that allows for breakthrough of one’s commandment without incurring in divine punishment, such as the usage of the Power of Ego to maintain multiple contradictory commandments as some Daeva do. Albeit, this last effect is something that even the most powerful Daeva struggle with, resulting at best in just pushing the line of what’s acceptable before a willing breakthrough rather than outright denying the punishment. Only those who are stronger than God or have the capability to replace her can actively ignore the punishment. Albeit, doing so means rebelling against the Truth and may incur in her wrath, being stricken via other means than a forceful Fall when that it is not possible.

It is possible to take Commandments of limited duration, or which are active just until a condition is fulfilled. But this topic is purely academic stuff for almost everyone in the cosmos, usually no one would do this, nor could, for that matter. Commandments are strong beliefs and iron-clad held convictions, pridefully sworn as a particular way to face the world. It is impossible to replace them on a whim, as one would their clothing, unless one’s mentality and personality was hollow enough that they may not even be called human to begin with.

Since everyone is required to take a commandment as part of reading deep enough into the Avesta, you too have gained yours. The exact wording of the Commandment is up to you, as well as its restrictions. Here you have two options: You may take whatever you have gained via this jump, with the exceptions of the ‘Star Spirit’ and ‘Will of the King’ purchases, and have it be a result of your boon, at no cost at all. It is not such a strange occurrence, even if it is the result of a single Commandment. Individuals Nahid or Vararam have proven that a single Commandment can result in a large amount of powers and boons. But if you like to, you may have actually taken multiple Commandments in the way that some powerful Daeva, or the heretic Yazata Magsarion, have done.

The other option is to pay 200 CP and receive a Commandment similar to that gained by Quinn, Spenta Mainyu or Zaurid’s original Commandment. Basically, you get a boost in power by following a certain limitation but gain no real special powers from that. 

Again, you may decide to purchase multiple Commandments here.

Other abilities and items may interact with Commandments, further increasing their power if the compatibility is right. This is especially true with abilities related to your own will, like the Power of Ego that the Daeva wield.

Once this jump ends, you may decide to stop being bound by your Commandment(s) in exchange for losing any potential boon that they may grant at will, no longer bound by the Avesta. You may decide to activate them again at the start of the next jump. This only applies to any abilities not derived from the perks that you purchase below. Breaking your Commandment won’t deprive you of your abilities, but will incur in divine punishment during your time here.

348,,200,Skill Reinforcement,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"Much as the overall power of a Servant is not immediately reached, neither is the individual power of their Skills reached at the start. To find their full potential with each ability, these Skills must be reinforced with Gems gathered from suitably similar opponents. Sabers must destroy Sabers to get Gems for Sabers and so on. Rare materials must also be gathered to do the process. Finally, a proper amount of magical energy must also be spent. Once the requirements are gathered, any Skill or ability may be Skilled Up and made more powerful overall. While there is no limit to how many times a Skill may be Reinforced, nor that it must be a Servant Skill, the costs will continue to increase for further and further Skill Ups on the same skill. Gems will need to be obtained from stronger foes, materials will become rarer and more magical energy must be spent. "
349,,200,Limit Break,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Modus,"Normally a person gets more tired as they fight, losing effectiveness as time goes on. But not the champions of Gaia! The fighters of this world have Limit Breaks; special techniques they can execute after enough successful hits. Now you have one of these devastating techniques. Landing more sequential hits and combos will prepare these techniques faster. Each Limit Break has a special effect, whether it be inflicting extra damage, debuffing an enemy, or buffing your allies. Though you only start with a single basic Limit Break, you can unlock more through combat experience and training.

This perk also serves as a Capstone Booster to all 600cp perks and items, enhancing their rewards. See each description for the specific effects."
350,,200,Old Magic,Kurohime,Modus,"The basics of using magic in this world is to create a magic circle. You know the standard magic that was used before the rise of Magic Bullets, and can quickly create a pentagram using a very weak form of magic. Once you’ve made the pentagram, you need to chant and incant to make your magical effect happen; this is time-consuming, making it difficult to work magic in the middle of combat. It’s often used for tasks such as enchanting weapons, performing rituals, creating undead, or summoning before combat REALLY starts. You can accomplish some quick basic energy blasts on your own, but high-speed combat isn’t really the focus of Old Magic."
351,,200,Custom Technique(200),Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"If none of the above options appeal to you, you can always make your own technique. Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects. A situational cursed technique or one with a lot of limitations would likely only be 200 CP, for example, while one with overwhelming power and versatility would be 800 CP.

352,,200,Tool Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You’re capable of using your cursed energy to control any broom you’re in physical contact with, allowing it to levitate according to your will. The most common usage of this is for the user to ride the broom, allowing them to fly through the air with surprising agility. It’s also possible to use it more offensively though, swinging the broom at others to send gusts or blades of wind in their direction. These aren’t particularly powerful though, and will likely only slow down any stronger opponents."
353,,200,Solo Forbidden Area,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"By activating this technique, you’re able to amplify the total cursed energy amount and output of one willing sorcerer within a certain radius of yourself, which can be you if you choose. It’s not a particularly huge boost on its own, but by elevating your technique to the level of ritual by including elements of chants, gestures, dance, and music, you’re able to boost someone’s power to 120% of their normal level. Because of this, it’s not a technique best suited for direct combat, and is better used for supporting another."
354,,200,Break it Down for Me,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"One of the most interesting concepts in jujutsu is that of binding vows. By intentionally putting oneself in a disadvantageous situation, such as by imposing extra restrictions upon the usage of a cursed technique, a sorcerer can gain power proportional to the extra risk they took on. One of the most common variants of this is the increase in power sorcerers get by disclosing how their technique works to their opponents, since giving up such information discards an advantage they might otherwise possess.

As a fundamental part of jujutsu, any sorcerer is capable of making such a binding vow by default. With this perk, however, you are able to apply this concept to any of your other powers. By voluntarily explaining how one of your powers works to your foes, that power will become noticeably more effective against them. Fires will burn hotter, energy blasts fly faster and hit harder, and so on. With clever wording, you can even use this to mislead your opponents on how your ability functions while still gaining the power boost, such as through lying by omission. Naturally, if those you’re up against already know how the ability you’re using functions, you won’t gain any power by telling them how it works.

You’re also capable of applying other restrictions to yourself and your powers. Perhaps you limit yourself to a certain level of output for part of the day, increasing your power proportionally for the rest of it. Or perhaps you drastically increase your speed by significantly reducing your durability. However these self-imposed vows work, the power you gain will always be directly proportional to the risk you take on. Be aware, though, that placing or removing such a restriction upon yourself takes a fair amount of time and focus, preventing you from changing them on the fly during combat. Removing a restriction also removes any power gained from it."
355,,200,Digital Mind Wave,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"While magic and superhuman enhancements can turn someone into a one-person army, it is the bonds of those you meet on this crazy train that will push you to your limits and beyond. A somewhat more literal interpretation of this idea is this Digital Mind Wave, a mental 'slot machine' based on individuals close to you. When you spend a small amount of an internal energy resource in your body (by default, magical power), this slot machine will spin with numbers and pictures based on those closest to you. If for whatever reason you have nobody close to you, then your default choice is your benefactor or someone from your home world. Should the individuals match, a powerful Limit Break will unlock, giving you a temporary but substantial power-up based on this person. Recalling an old lover you hold fondness for will fully restore your health and energy, a junior you look after in your army unit could give you greater magical power, and so on. These also include effects just from matching numbers alone, which can make you temporarily invincible, make your attacks much stronger and more likely to damage an enemy critically, or provide a short period of infinite magical energy for Materia use, and so on.

That said, how effective this ability is depends on your emotional state. If you are demoralized and exhausted, rolling beneficial results will be increasingly unlikely and you may even find yourself getting weaker. If you are in high spirits and determined, you will find yourself getting stronger and rolling better results much more consistently. Interestingly, using a Limit Break from this or your own regular techniques will reset your emotional state to 'neutral' for the purposes of this ability, so be sure to use it for a second wind if you have the chance."
356,,200,Unshakable Resolve,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Your personal path can be quite difficult and lonesome. But fear not, for your willpower has been tremendously improved. Nothing will be able to forcibly change your mind on a matter, and you’ll be able to endure any kind of adversity without hesitation. Incidentally, since magic is governed by willpower, this Perk drastically increases your ability to wield magic, even if the knowledge of how to use it and the power to perform grand feats of magic must come from you. At least it will respond quickly to your commands."
357,,200,Silence,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Sometimes, people just have to shut up. You now have the ability to suppress any magical or supernatural power a target possesses, leaving them with just their innate might. The loss of power is permanent except against particularly powerful enemies. Silence bypasses Spell Shield."
358,,200,Lifesteal,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"This is almost self-explanatory. Your attacks steal life force from your enemies and give it to you, replenishing your health. Yes, even when attacking constructs and undead. Don’t ask why it works that way, it just does."
359,,200,Formidable,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"They say the best defense is offense. For you, the best offense is defense. The more powerful your defenses are, the stronger your attack is. Be sure to wear some heavy armor and take a big shield."
360,,200,Deep,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Jaws! Or something like that. Seems like you’re extremely well adapted to the depths of the sea. Not only can you breathe underwater, you’re also immune to the pressure and coldness, on top of being able to see in the darkness. On top of that, you’re more powerful in water, increasing your existing physical ability of roughly 50% while fully submerged."
361,,200,Special Gift,Fairy Fencer F,Modus,"There is just something special about you. One thing that remains constant about Fairies is their ability to utilize elemental magic. Pick an element (Fire, Water, Lightning, Earth, Wind, Light, Dark). You are now incredibly talented with that element, easily capable of feats that lesser Fairies can only dream of accomplishing. Maybe you want to be exceptional with healing magic? That’s fine too! This can be purchased multiple times, but each time a different attribute must be chosen.

362,,200,Salty Santa,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"The throne of Christmas is empty and unless a mighty king steps up, the children of the world will cry out in despair as Christmas passes without celebration. Yet the Santa Soul has entered you, making you the next protector of the holiday. With the powers of Santa, you can accomplish all of his many mighty feats. You can tell who has been naughty or nice, can squeeze through even the tiniest chimney and sneak through any home on the night before Christmas without being seen. If it were to deliver presents, you could somehow visit every home in the world in a single night, and you can always tell what presents someone really wants and what they really need. If it comes time to protect Christmas, you’ll find your body strengthens as if supported by the spirit of the holiday itself, and your magical energy can sup from the Christmas cheer of those around you. 

Santa Sabers treat Christmas with the utmost seriousness. Though they may be sweet and shy normally or grim and cold ordinarily, they’ll without distinction put every ounce of effort they can into protecting Christmas and the smiles of children on Christmas Day. Doubtlessly, you’ll be dragged into some sort of wild event everytime Christmas comes around. "
363,,200,Path of Magecraft (Merlin/Morgan),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"A rare path for most Sabers. You’ve been given an education in magecraft or magic, enough to be quite the competent user in a number of different fields. You’ve got plenty of potential but mostly in a small handful of related fields. Someone might be excellent at magic relating to stealth, infiltration and turning whatever makeshift property of other people is on hand into magecraft components but be lacking outside of those fields. Either choice you make on what you use, you’ll be decently powerful. A little less than the average fairy but enough to use your spells against a weaker Servant and win. 

This perk can be increased in price to 400,000 or 600,000 points. At 400, your expertise in the supernatural arts will greatly increase, putting you on par with most Casters. While you still can’t match devils like Merlin, you’re more than a contender when it comes to most notable Celtic druids or Greek magicians. You’re probably at least competent in a wide array of disciplines outside your focus, which itself is quite impressive now. At 600, this increases until your specialties could rival the likes of Merlin or Morgan in their capability and you could generally prove yourself a match for most other magi even when using something you’re not talented in.

364,,200,Magical Skill ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Modus,"Priesthood and magical learning is all well and good, but some people simply wish for one reliable power they can leverage in their everyday life. That’s just fine, and you’ve come to learn one such magical technique in the past. What your magical technique does is mostly up to you, but there are a few examples to determine the general scale and utility available to you. You could get a technique to make functional sailing vessels of any size out of nothing but straw, maybe you could summon wind and rain with a few gestures, perhaps you’d like to be able to shoot seven arrows at the same time, all of which home in on your target(s) to never miss, or maybe you’d just like to be able to call all the wild animals in an entire forest or plain to you. Another possibility would be taming any mountable beast in mere seconds, or a supernatural level of seduction. Creativity is encouraged here, but if you wish to simply pick one of the examples given, that’s fine too. Perhaps you’ll make a name for yourself with this?"

Maybe everyone here is stronger? Or there’s a bigger budget? This perk doesn’t necessarily make you stronger or give you new abilities, but you can do significantly more with the skills and equipment you do have.

381,,200,Mantra Training and Techniques,Asura’s Wrath,Modus,"You have learned or been taught numerous techniques to focus and express your Mantra, rendered as supernatural martial arts and superhuman feats of agility, durability and so on. Meditative Kata can extend your natural lifespan, heal minor wounds and fight off sickness, while strikes and attacks could shatter walls. This increases your maximum Mantra level by 1.

As an added benefit, this perk also allows you to create your own personal Mantra Form. Your first form will take approximately five years of study and meditation to fully construct, but when completed, you will be able to manifest an external mantra interface. To most people, it will look like an ornate halo, evocative of your personality and mantra affinity.

A Mantra Form usually has a core theme, such as improved combat ability, damage resistance, speed or other such boosts. Establishing a form enhances your abilities, even beyond what a given level of Mantra would normally allow. With a mantra form active, you may easily perform superhuman physical, mental and social feats, even before the direct application of Mantra. These stances and techniques however cannot enhance stranger powers such as psychic blasts or arcane magic, short of ensuring you can survive to perform them.

Successfully creating an initial form and manifesting it increases your capacity for Mantra by 1. Subsequent forms and other perks can increase this cap further, to a maximum of 8. You may use any mantra form you know, but you cannot stack them. Creating a new form takes ten years, times the number of forms you have already mastered.

Your halos can be attacked however, and if knocked aside or even destroyed. If that happens, you immediately drop down to Mantra Level 3, and any excess Mantra is wasted."

It matters not if the most destructive fireball, the vilest mental enchantment or the most devastatingly brilliant Bounded Field created purely by modern Magecraft attempts to impede you-your Mystery is simply greater and maintains the immutable perfection of every aspect of your being. Post-jump, you may add that two thousand years’ worth of history to both your background’s existence in a given world as well as to any powers dependent on time alone to grow and mature. It seems your seniority itself has become a Mystery in its own right."
383,,200,Reenactment of Mystery(Young Magus),Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Let us speak now, of magecraft.

Simply put, if an end result is achievable through scientific means, then magecraft is a process which creates that outcome using supernatural means. Fundamentally it is the reenactment of preexisting phenomena through the circulation of life energy and magical energy through the magus’ body, their implements or their familiars. In order to attune to the Mysteries attuned to the Akashic Records and reproduce their phenomena, mages use Thaumaturgical Foundations-systems straddling the line between scholarship and religion to derive theories (e.g. “Alchemy is how the world works, therefore I can instantly exchange something for something else using the spell Flash Air. A spoon for a fork, for example) shaped by mankind as a whole’s collective understanding of reality, however accurate it is.

Thus, magecraft is fundamentally at a disadvantage to entities or phenomena with higher Mystery due to being an imperfect replica of similar concepts, and diminishes in power when a significant part of the human population becomes aware of it due to greater human awareness “diluting” the same source of Mystery. More information about Magecraft can be found in the notes.

Barring truly overwhelming fonts of magical energy or preparation, battles between mages tend to be decided by mystical compatibility and strategic conservation of resources rather than superior firepower though as with all things in this world, there are always exceptions. Brute force can be a form of compatibility on its own.

Somehow, you too have the ability to practice magecraft. This purchase determines how good you are at in terms of knowledge and practical implementation. You may select any form of magecraft still in existence in the current era of the setting, from the Japanese Shugendō which combines Buddhism and mountain worship into unique techniques themed around transforming into a tengu by arriving at Hell, to Alchemy which studies control over the flow of bodies, life and matter. Either the Clock Tower’s western foundation which seeks to transform base matter into gold (and to extend the metaphor, a human being into an entity comparable to God) or that of the Alchemists of Atlas. Who, based on Egyptian metallurgy, prefer to focus on the pure conversion of phenomena as well as the prediction-and in some cases, actualisation-of the future. And a particularly unique case greatly decreasing the usual limitations of magic circuits by focusing their grandest efforts on the creation of uniquely powerful items or entities.

You are considered a highly disciplined and comprehensive student of magecraft...by the standards of a 17 year old who just gave up her ordinary life two years prior. While you are adept in whatever theories your style of magecraft provides, have a versatile arsenal spells and may even have a particular type of spell such as magical bullets that you specialise in, you are also relatively inexperienced in its practical uses, it’s deeper mysteries and the more experimental or esoteric aspects of your Thaumaturgical Foundation. Depending on your style of magecraft you could be capable of unleashing torrents of fire capable of melting steel to slag, transmuting the trees near you to water and back again, summoning a spirit capable of shredding through modern military equipment with a fingersnap within your speciality or best of all shooting a BRIGHT BLUE BEAM capable of leaving a sizeable hole straight through a building-as well as being capable of general practice spells such as carving runic wards, brewing potions, hypnotising mundane people and establishing barriers of magical energy.

As a Sage, you find that your magical strength and spirit increase roughly twice as fast as they would otherwise, and you gain the ability of Dualcast.

The effect stacks with each victory, as long as there isn’t a defeat, tie, or such in between. The effects are small at first, especially if the opponent was some weak random, but they become greater and greater alongside your opponents.

For example, if a hero gave away some important artifact, then a Noble Phantasm representing said artifact could be given away without issue. Likewise, if a Servant has a legend for receiving a lot of artifacts, they may be able to wield the Noble Phantasms of others without issue. You fulfill the latter case. In other words, you can wield artifacts and treasures that normally can only be wielded by one specific person, just as well as that person themselves. You could dematerialize and materialize a Noble Phantasm just like the Servant that it belonged to, too. Of course, this mainly applies to artifacts restricted to specific wielders. If you have to meet some requirement to wield it, like being worthy or something, it wouldn’t help you. Still, there’s plenty of Servants around in the Great Holy Grail War.

You have also sought it, and have attained immortality of a sort. Unfortunately, it’s the kind that requires regular rituals to maintain, but if you’re immortal, you have all the time in the world, do you not? That said, hopefully you aren’t the moral type, as while you can choose what kind of ritual you’ve developed to extend your life, it must be dark and terrible in some way. For example, consuming the souls of newborn children. Your ritual must be something on that level, fucked up to the point that nobody can truly say that you are a good or even neutral person for performing it. Whatever it is, it’ll be efficient enough that you could live 60 years in the prime of your life and only have to perform your ritual three times during those decades. Additionally you are generally quite talented at finding other immensely fucked up means of extending your life. Perhaps you’ll engrave your will onto your Servant?"

They were weapons without form until the first divinity picked them up, gifting them with their Aspect. That is their true strength. Each individual who picked them up from that point on saw the Infernal Armshift, morph, and change to better suit their unique essence. Sometimes drastically, sometimes subtly. Rather than embed that malleability into a single weapon, you yourself possess it instead. Weapons of all stripes that you wield will slowly alter themselves to better suit your temperament, your fighting style, your unique Aspect. Sometimes this means they will gain new abilities. Sometimes it may simply be a tweak to the weight distribution. Only time will tell what the weapon in your hands will become."
396,,200,Executor,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"You have been trained in the Mysteries of the Holy Church. Raised to fight against the evils that prey on mankind and the heretical, you exist to be the bloody arm of the Lord. You are quite superior in physical terms to most magi who are not specialized in physical combat, and have been trained to fight off against their heretical abilities. Whether or not you have any actual knowledge in the practices of Magecraft, you have quite an extensive knowledge of it, even if just to know how to recognize it and counter it. You are also initiated in the rituals of the Church, including the Baptism Rite.

Finally, as an Executor, your relationship with the teachings of the Church is quite more tolerant to the sins and vices of man that you face on the regular. As such, you find that those from organized faith aren’t quite bothered as they should be whenever you stray from their official doctrine, as long as you keep contributing to their organization."

Differentiated from true magics in that the mysteries brought forth via magecraft are limited to those things that are ‘possible’. Despite variations among individual schools, magecraft fundamentally operates as a mechanism that utilizes magical energy from the practitioner's body or the external environment to reproduce a specific phenomenon. The practitioner issues a command to the foundation, which is governed by their respective school, and subsequently executes a pre-established spell.

For 400 CP instead, you have a fairly consolidated magecraft lineage, as well as quite a talent in magecraft in general. You won’t be facing Servants, except for the weakest of them and only in the most extreme of favorable circumstances, but your knowledge alone would allow you to act as a proper support to your Servant, as well as to participate in combat and win against most magecraft users. Non-magical people have little to no chance of taking you down, unless they employ great numbers or surprise attacks with powerful weaponry. As a proper genius, you may be like Keyneth and start to be a proper practitioner of multiple forms of magecraft in addition to your own family’s speciality, having an expert knowledge of a handful of other schools.

Think of the prominent students of the Lord El Melloi Class as a basis for this level. The Beast magecraft from the Glascheit’s clan, the Butterfly magecraft of Caesarmund, or the Jewel Magecraft of the Edelfelt and Tohsaka families.

Finally, this is mostly based on the schools taught in the Mage’s Association. But if you wish to, you may take this same level for other schools of magecraft. From the local shamanism of the tribes of North America, to more Eastern traditions. See the notes section for more insights.

The practitioner issues a command to the foundation, which is governed by their respective school, and subsequently executes a pre-established spell.

For 600 CP, your magecraft comes from a legendary lineage. One that could easily be traced back to the Age of Gods, which remains extremely potent even if its Mystery has naturally degraded, as well as having a talent to properly get the best out of it, and probably innovate a fair bit at least even if you don’t try much. For this last option, you may instead decide to be an even brighter genius, having developed your own magecraft school, and possibly Thaumaturgical Foundation, during your life. Yet, despiste its novelty, its potency is up there with those ancient houses.

For this level, you are thinking of the great monsters, those that are easily on the rank of Grand in the Clock Tower system. The powerful Lords of the Clock Tower, Aoko Aozaki, Francesca Prelati, Dead Apostles who ascended via magecraft a dozen centuries or more ago, and more. The ‘beings’ of this level are considered threats to an entire military, and they are feared in the world of magecraft. There is little limit to what you can do with proper resources and time, beyond the fact that you are still limited to magecraft and cannot perform acts of True Magic, albeit your most potent rituals and spells may start to reach that realm. At this level, even fighting a Servant that is not particularly powerful on your own is possible, and you will be a great support to most Heroic Spirits. As a true genius, there are few schools of magecraft that you do not know of and that you cannot at least use in some way, with many others being tools already in your repertory.

However through lose and error and failure we rise to newest heights. With this perk, any lose you suffer will only make you greater. You might learn to dodge better or a new technique but an improvement will always be there should you fail at something and it will always make you greater than before."
401,,200,Ancient Witch,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Given the secrecy of its practitioners, witches usually don't have the benefit of mentors as much as the users of other magics. This usually means that it takes longer to master one's discipline, as such, most masters are quite a bit older than other practitioners when they could be called masters.

You yourself could be called a master in your chosen art or arts. Your curses are significantly stronger than most, you can split spirits you command with necromancy, and your familiars are quite a bit stronger. If you have learned the respective witchcraft that is.

Secondly, your repeated practice with these arts has hardened your own soul, making you unusually resistant to these same kinds of attacks and extending your lifespan by quite a bit."
402,,200,Ninjutsu,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"It may seem like magic, but pure Ninjutsu is just a sudden burst of superhuman physical ability. A burst of speed that makes one appear to have teleported, or an instant of herculean strength to throw a much larger opponent for example.

While pure Ninjutsu is usually sufficient, most higher practitioners learn some sort of magic to augment the effects. Such as by leaving behind a shadow when one seems to teleport.

As a practitioner yourself, you are capable of using pure Ninjutsu to perform various feats, but you have also been taught the basics of how to use it in conjunction with actual magic, giving you a head start when you work to integrate it into your techniques.

If you have any of the perks from this jump that grants magical abilities, you may choose one of them to already have combined with your ninjutsu."
403,,200,Elemental Mastery,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Instead of being a novice with your elemental abilities you have had time and practice to truly master the power. In addition to them being stronger, your elemental abilities can momentarily enhance your physical ones though this enhancement is usually through actualizing a metaphor. This means that summoning flames may help you 'burn through your clip' and increase your fire rate, or lightning could 'recharge you' and occasionally restore stamina."
404,,200,Evil Eye(400),20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"""If looks could kill"" is a common expression; for you, however, there is no 'could'. By giving a sufficiently focused look you are capable of physically harming those in your view. While this isn't too tiring to do for a moment, you'll find holding the effect for extended periods of time does hurt your eyes. As a secondary effect your vision is notably good, especially your vision in the dark.

For an additional 200 CP, your glare can be imbued with magical powers you possess. These effects are usually not the most complex feats of magic you can perform, but they are applied to those you look upon fairly continuously. Given time you can learn to mix other magics into your gaze and selectively choose which of the magics you could do that are applied.

To be clear, these effects can come from any supernatural energy you possess. The effects are also generally less powerful, than if you were using them for their own techniques. For example, a technique that allows you to breathe fire, would translate to giving you the capacity to burn your foes with your eyes, but not creating a conflagration that consumes everything in your field of view.

Cosmetic glow, as well as if you only want it in one eye are up to you. (If you choose to have it in one eye and lose that eye the power will transfer to another eye without issue). Comes with an optional eyepatch to 'seal' it if you choose.

406,,200,True Strife Master,Godbound,Modus,"Conflict is woven into the fabric of the world. The superficial struggle between flowing water and crumbling stone reflects echoes of deeper truths that strain the gears of Heaven’s engines. Whether from some revelation of tutelage from an ancient sage, you have somehow mastered a True Strife: A supernatural martial art capable of manifesting the tangible and esoteric qualia of a certain concept, divided into the simpler Lesser Strifes and more powerful Greater Strifes. This may be repurchased should you wish to be a prodigious martial artist capable of wielding many Strifes.

For example, the Strife of the Drowning Tide’s Lesser Strife permits a master to breathe under water, move through tightly-packed crowds of foes without being struck, imbue their limbs with weapon-like force and with some effort lash all foes around them with blurs of blows. It’s techniques include an invincible defence for the duration of a supernatural charge, the ability to breathe and sea clearly underwater while ignoring the cold and pressure of the depths as well as their wounds lashing out with tendrils of gore at their attackers, and slamming everything for fifty feet with a brutal wave of salt water and blood.

Beyond that, theurgy’s applications are seemingly limitless. It can create new forms of life and alter old ones, bring forth new races of creature that breed true, create enduring objects and enchantments-and of course blast through the gates of Heaven. There seems to be no upper limit to the power theurgy is theoretically capable of accomplishing, though the practical one is that even the Godbound find it almost impossible to devise new invocations without grim focus, great expenditures of Dominion and voyages deep into the ruins of Heaven and Hell.

For 200 CP you are a novice Eldritch-a supremely talented novice mage, a lesser adept of the Black Academy, a high priest or powerful ruler’s court wizard. You have also mastered many theurgic incantations of the Gate, and move more swiftly than most men from the power flowing through your veins. In addition to your sorcerous powers, you are considered bound to another Word representing the focus or specializations of your magic; mostly miracles, but with practice you could develop true Gifts for this Word as you may for Sorcery too. The Gate’s invocations permit you to steal life from others to prolong your lifespan, call forth tireless steeds of black iron and embers, open Night Roads, and raise the common dead as mindless husks. Though you are new in the ways of your kind, with practice and study you may yet reach the greater heights of your power as described below."

You have gained spells of the Throne, and with such power could threaten a pantheon of veteran Godbound with some planning. Invocations of the Throne can bring about anything not utterly impossible for the Eldritch’s wishes at the cost of laying an unavoidable but nonlethal doom in the Eldritch’s Fate, make themselves sovereign from particular natural laws or phenomena, sunder all other magic and even divine powers such as Gifts (though at the cost of some blowback for challenging the divine) and sheer apart the fabric of reality with the teeth of the celestial gears that support it among other dread feats.

Finally, if you also have The Brush of Death, if you wish you may be a lich-lord rather than some comparatively squishy living wizard.

410,,200,Wisdom of the Ages,Godbound,Modus,"It is one thing to have the natural talent to wield magic, but another to have the right restraint to do so without it blowing up in your face. While whatever arcane talents you wield with this are no greater, some innate genius or affinity for the mystic arts makes them much safer and more refined. Your psionic attacks can be sustained much longer without blowing blood out your ears, your twists of flame unerringly hone in on your enemies and reflexively avoid you if somehow deflected and you gain a sixth sense for knowing when bartering with an Uncreated is a really bad idea. This is equal parts uncanny prudence and a specific talent with magic of all kinds, that while seldom equating to raw power does lend itself well to greater complexity and flexibility in your casting."
411,,200,Sacrificial Magic,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Modus,"Sacrificial Magic is one of the oldest forms of magic but it is highly contested often being seen
as a forbidden dark art due to how easy it is to misuse. By sacrificing something such as your
blood or saliva you would be able to strengthen a magical effect such as a rune, ritual or spell.
The more valuable the sacrifice being used is to the user and magic the greater the results will
be with the users saliva giving less of a boost than their blood but the same amount as the
blood of a stranger."
412,,200,Multi-Spell,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Modus,"You are able to cast multiple spells at once, this can be done in multiple ways if you only have
one wand and are not able to cast wandlessly you would be able to cast the same spell multiple
times within a single casting but will find it more difficult to aim the spell. If you had two wands
you would be able to cast a spell on each with the same level of difficulty as if you were only
casting one spell. If you are able to cast wandlessly there is no true limit on the number of spells
you could cast simultaneously however you would need to increase your level of concentration
for each additional spell you cast."
413,,200,Ancient Magic ,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Modus,"You are able to use magic which is beyond the scope of normal wizards. Though this magic is
almost forgotten by most modern witches and wizards it can be used to create raw and
unfiltered magical effects which are far greater than the witch or wizard would otherwise be able
to produce. This magic was prominently used by a student of Hogwarts who prevented a Goblin
Rebellion in the late 1800’s some say that this magic is part of Hogwarts Legacy."
414,,200,Point and Shoot ,Wizarding World,Modus,"In Hogwarts, students begin to learn about nonverbal magic at their sixth year and are expected to perform spells nonverbally from that point on. And other schools are surely no different. Unlike many of your contemporaries, however, you have ingrained these lessons into your mind, ensuring that from now on, every spell you can cast is a spell you can cast with nothing more than your wand and not a sound from your lips.

This applies to more than just this world’s magic. So long as you can cast the spell, you can now do so silently, no matter the origin of said spell, whether it be from this world or another. And on a final note, gestures for your spells are now merely formalities. All you have to do is point and shoot."

For now, you have enough skill in the art to recognize whether something or someone has invaded your mind, no matter how subtle their efforts may be.

In fact, you are even proficient in blocking such attempts from most wizards save those with a mastery of mental magic. With a bit more experience and training, you could even learn to fool them, tricking their sights with false memories and leaving them none the wiser to the secrets of your mind. And on a final note, you’ll find that the training you underwent in order to achieve your skill in Occlumency has left you with a resistance against mental assault of any kind.

If you had super-strength enough to destroy planets, now you can juggle Faberge Eggs without fear of breaking. You might be able to manipulate fire on par with stars but now you find you can use it so finely that you could light the head of a match on fire. Use your star shattering telekinesis to manipulate an atom, why not?

It doesn’t matter what you do but now you have perfect conscious control and modulation of any and all powers or abilities that you possess: even in things that may be considered unconscious actions, you may consciously control how fast your heart beats, your core temperature or the strength of rapid muscular contractions. That said this doesn’t let you do things with your powers that you couldn’t normally. If your “star shattering telekinesis”, for example, couldn’t normally control or affect things on an atomic scale this perk wouldn’t change that.

This begins with mana skin the ability to coat their bodies with mana to protect from both environmental and other such effects for example the heat of lava and enhance the mages physical attributes, the greater the control the greater the effect. A more advanced form of mana control is called mana zone- the ability to manipulate mana in an area around the user. Most users utilize mana zone to gather the mana to them to enhance the range, size and power of their spells and/or Mana skin and reinforcement magic but mana zone can also be used to increase the sensitivity to the mana around them to increase their reaction time and to sense magical attacks around them. You start at the level of a Magic Knight Captain in terms of mana control and mana zone, able to cast a spell in the middle of another and utilize the mana around you to either help yourself or hinder your opponents."

Well regardless of all that, you are one of the few unique beings in this world who can think completely outside of the box always being able to find new and imaginative ways to utilise their abilities. In the field of battle it would be a miracle if an enemy would be able to predict your movements."
434,,200,Analytical Bender,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Modus,"You’re incredibly innovative when it comes to bending. You can figure out new bending skills and techniques faster, come up with new uses for the skills you have, and adapt your forms to overcome new situations and enemies.

It is a gift from Heaven itself, that grants one the potential to become so much more than a mere human and to walk with great purpose in their life. But it’s doubtful you want to be stuck with such a burden, so instead let’s work around that and offer this power for a price. Upon purchase, this grants you the ability to collect, harness, and train the mystical force of Chi. This power comes from within and can be used for a myriad of effects including healing others of wounds and poison, increasing one’s strength and reflexes, and even enhanced control over the functions of one’s body. More effects will inevitably be unlocked as you train, with prior effects being able to grow to new heights."

439,,200,Entrapment ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Modus,"There’s definitely a pattern with some characters in the story; know what they say twice is coincidence, but three times is a pattern. Hiram Shaw in the cave, Hunter in Hunter’s Folly and Lilith in her sarcophagus. Characters are trapped in a confined space via a witch’s spell (usually the Caretaker). With this perk you become an expert in seals and spells to trap beings. You can even bolster traps to make them harder to escape from. Due to this knowledge, it is hard to keep you trapped again like Hunter was pre-canon."
440,,200,Starhawk,Marvel Cosmic,Modus,"Empowered by the Hawk God of Arcturus you are capable of manipulating light and dark to create blasts of energy and solid light or dark constructs. Being empowered by the Hawk God also gives you superhuman physical capability, especially agility and reflexes."
441,,200,Cooperative Bender ,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"Though your own Bending may or may not be anything special, what you excel in is harmonizing it with the bending of others. By directing other Benders while bending along with them, your team can perform feats rivaled only by a fully- empowered Avatar. This isn't limited to your own element, either; if you have Benders from other Nations working with you, you can work with them just as easily, letting you combine elements to fantastic effect. This has also given you practice with wide-scale bending, and even without a team, the amount of your element you can bend has greatly increased.

Requires Bending Arts to Purchase"
442,,200,Utilitarian Bender,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"Bending can certainly be used as a weapon, but it can also be so much more, and you have a natural talent for using it for these more constructive pursuits. Constructing entire buildings piece by piece with Earthbending, healing using Waterbending, blacksmithing with Firebending, or even just grabbing a stubborn out-of-reach tool with Airbending - you're a master at using your abilities for day-to-day life. This also increases your ability to perform precision bending, ranging from freezing a single raindrop to creating a sculpture so life-like it captures each individual hair.

443,,200,Magical Legacy ,Fate/Zero,Modus,"To be called a real magical lineage, a family needs to have a notable specialisation. Something that separates them from any other family. This is the focus of generations of work, from the head and heir of each family at the very least, and often all other members contribute too. Whether you have a family or not, you have been trained to a level of excellent quality in one magical discipline of your choice. Easily enough to be recognised as an adult magus by the Mages Association, you’ll be notably skilled even among your age peers.

Reinforcement allows you to enhance the qualities of things, such as making a wooden stick as hard as steel, or increasing your vision to rival a hawks. Gradation Air allows you to project items using your mana, though these will always be inferior copies to the original. They may last anywhere from a few minutes to a few days once mastered. There are some objects you cannot project however, no matter what you try, such as Noble Phantasms and Conceptual weaponry."

449,,200,Summoning Singalong,Bayonetta,Modus,"Some see the role of summons as mere tools, fodder to be used and abused as needed for the sake of the task at hand. But you know that good help is so hard to find these days… after all, if you wanted fodder you’d just get other people. Your summoning abilities are tweaked somewhat, allowing any summon materialized by your hand to benefit from a significant intelligence boost so they can recognize patterns and better assist your needs. Organization can make all the difference."

These are the ki techniques that Murim warriors deploy in order to enhance their body and unleash powerful attacks. This is the Murim Warriors equivalent of a basic mage’s myriad of spells. With these techniques, a warrior is able to see in the dark with the Eyes of Night, walk in the air with Void Steps, strengthen their body beyond human limits, and more. With this perk comes the ki reserves necessary to make use of many of the abilities within, though the most energy intensive ones may exhaust you until you build up better reserves. You could now call yourself a proper warrior of Murim."

While at its root it will be the same, how it manifests will be slightly different. This is your chance to design your own custom supernatural system, though know that you will be entering into a world severely lacking in ambient energy. The maximum power level of your system cannot be much greater than that of the Murim or Fantasy systems.

This provides you the benefit of that element, chosen when you take this perk. You can purchase this perk up to five times, once for each element.

● Air: By aligning with the element of air, you are infused with the essence of life itself, granting a near immunity to ennui, depression, and PTSD, improves upon your creativity and focus, and give you a new perspective on change. It also renders you lightness of both body and step, heightens your awareness of self and the world around you, and improves on your stamina. Air is sometimes associated with wood and trees.
● Earth: By aligning with the element of earth, you are granted much of the stability and strength of the earth, giving you increased physical fitness and resilience, as well as preventing your physical and mental abilities from degrading. Your mind is similarly reinforced making you all but immune to mind-rending effects, insanity, and possession as well as strengthening your strength of will.
● Fire: By aligning with the element of fire, you are gifted with the power of progress, providing a greatly improved intelligence, enhanced problem solving ability, and self control, as well as removing impurities that would seek to subvert your own will. Fire also improves upon your energy levels, reduces the effect of fatigue upon you, and doubles the rate of physical, mental, and spiritual improvement.
● Water: By aligning with the element of water, you develop some of its fluid and nurturing properties, which improves your intuition, your ability to adapt to new situations and conditions, and makes it so you can always connect to and understand others. It also makes you more adaptable physically, able to withstand temperatures both high and low, high and low pressures, and gives physical flexibility.
● Aether: By aligning with the element of aether, your spiritual, mental, and physical aspects are brought closer together, making your soul stronger, as well as connecting you to the divine. You are inured against fear, still able to feel it, but able to ignore it and allows you to find joy and worth in the simpler aspects of life. More importantly, however, you develop an internal reserve of power derived from the aether that makes up your own soul, which you may use as a supernatural resource or a replacement for metabolic energies. Aether is often associated with gold, silver, and other metals.

At least by most. When you work with something that is unstable, it acts as if it were stable so long as it remains in your care and possession, to the point even a chemical that can, and will, spontaneously combust for no apparent reason will remain entirely shelf stable so long as it is in your possession, even if you have it jostling around in your backpack. This will last until you choose to let the effect drop or the substance is no longer in your possession."
458,,200,Ritualist,Generic Alchemist ,Modus,"You have the ability to enhance supernatural abilities by adding some level of complexity and pomp to how they are performed, using patterned hand movements, rhythmic chanting, or specialized symbols to draw out, augment, and shape the effects of any supernatural energies, powers, or abilities. The more you add and the more time put into the rituals, the stronger the effect. This can apply even to the brewing of potions."
459,,200,Alchemical Persistence,Generic Alchemist ,Modus,"You have the ability to lengthen the effects of any empowerment placed on you with a duration by a factor of five (x5) without diluting its potency.

465,,200,Moments Occasion,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"By repeating history, we make it happen once more - you are capable of calling forth one of the Historic Moments as noted in the Notes section.

470,,200,Enhanced Formulas,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"Your studies have fully paid off. You now have a suite of new features you can apply to your spells. The most obvious is that by tripling the amount of mana poured into a spell, you can forcibly increase its power to its next “tier.” In addition, you can also pump more mana into the spell to allow it to target more allies or enemies, or even to give spells a “homing” component that vastly increases their accuracy."

Just like humanity however, they too have their own magic, though their connection with nature has made it a bit. . .strange. You have skill with Pyromancy, the most primal of all magic. Pyromancy allows the wielder to call upon the powers of fire to enhance themselves or burn away others. You particularly have skill with swamp Pyromancy, allowing you to conjure toxic gasses and heavy stones. Your Pyromancy is like that of other giants however, something more. Your Pyromancy flame, should you wish it to be, is directly fused into your hand, allowing you to channel spells in strange and more innately biological ways. Poison gas becomes poison spit, and fireballs become fire fists.”"
478,,200,Sorcery of Pharros,Dark Souls 2,Modus ,"“Miracles and Pyromancy may have their own uses, but they’re held back by aimless belief and lack of refinement. Sorcery, an art born from study and logic, is thus the most pragmatic art, and for more than simple combat. You are bestowed with several talents, some for Sorcery, some for crafts, and some in the middle. First, Sorcery, you have a reasonable level of skill and knowledge for an adept practitioner. Second, you are a skilled artisan, especially in the fields of architecture and sculpting. Blending these talents, you are capable of feats displayed by the legendary Pharros, able to weave solid illusions to conceal secret doorways and gates, craft magical keys that activate dormant spells, and other tricks of that nature.”"

Unlike Sorcery, which distils the essence of the soul however, Hexes are something darker, heavier. The ability and knowledge to perform a variety of hex based spells has been bestowed upon you. A chime or staff will be required to leverage this skill, as well as some mental and spiritual ability alike. Additionally, just as Hexes are a dark evolution of Sorcery and use corrupted tools of science and worship, you too may adapt other forms of magic to darkness. Whatever spells you know of, you may create dark aligned, heavy variants.” "
480,,200,No Faith In Dead Gods,Dark Souls 2,Modus ,"“Gods? Gods are just stories to you. What you pledged faith in, in times past, was a king and a kingdom. You believed fellows in arms and the power of your sword. Maybe I’m just being presumptuous, and you believed in nothing at all. You know how to cast miracles, although to call them miracles feels overstated. Nevertheless, they are tangible power of electricity and healing alike, and they’re very useful on the battlefield. You know quite a few spells, but you don’t really believe in the stories attached. You may cast them with a general level of proficiency without believing in anything at all. Additionally, you may create minor derivatives through your brazen disrespect, spreading confusion over the birth of new miracles.”"
481,,200,“Banished Evil”,Dark Souls 1,Modus ,"Occultists were once a thorn in the side of the gods, commanding deviant powers that actually threatened them and their rule. Symbols of them were discarded in the Painted World, and you would certainly count after this perk. Your nature is now aligned with the occult. Your attacks both unarmed and weapon based are especially effective against entities that have some form of divinity, making you the perfect kind of warrior for hunting them. Your black power gets mightier with your loathing of the divinity you’re targeting and manifests itself as twisted magical power. When purchased with Writhing Bile, the slime you produce and the flames it gives off when set it aflame share this occult property."

You gain years’ worth of martial training in the monks’ school of martial arts. You’re not quite a master, but you’re an expert with your hands, feet, and polearms. In addition, your martial arts, not just the ones learned here, have gained a supernatural quality to them.

483,,200,Ninjutsu & Tools,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Modus ,"But there are also more directly supernatural, even borderline magical, techniques that are taught as well, this being the three main ninjutsu which you have mastered. Bloodsmoke allows you to scatter your victim’s blood and turn it into a heavy red smoke; perfect for a quick escape or a confusion to take advantage of. Puppeteer allows you take control of your victims just as they die but their spirit has yet to abandon their bodies. They will treat you as an ally and help you in any way possible so long as you maintain concentration. Bestowal allows you to wreath your weapon in the blood of your victim, increasing its reach up to triple the length of the weapon. The blood itself is only as sharp as the weapon it was bestowed upon.

And just as their sorrow and despair summoned the Frenzied Flame you have learned to hone eldritch powers of all kinds through such twisted emotions. Malign spirits become easier to summon, fireballs of Frenzied Flame swell in intensity-supernatural powers of all kinds become more unpredictable yet powerful when you pour your resentment into them, though never in a way that harms you. As a final boon, not only are you capable of spreading madness through a hard look, a scream or a similar social gesture but it and similar abilities are more infectious than usual. Gather enough resentment, and even inhuman beings could be wracked with madness or whole crowds sent into foaming fits."
485,,200,Magmatic Magician,Elden Ring,Modus ,"The ancient hexes of Gelmir are somewhat limited in application compared to many schools of magic in these lands-and yet when he rediscovered them, Praetor Rykard was able to put them to practical use by channelling the magma of Mt. Gelmir. And with this, it seems that like him you too made a study of the lost hexes that has given you a great arsenal of similar magics. From firing condensed lumps of magma that erupt after a short delay, to surges of molten rock scouring all near you or flumes of lava there is little more than weighty, searing destruction to the tradition you have mastered. But your capacity to innovate new spells for it is considerable, and you have developed a few personalised spells related to this school. Perhaps like Rykard, you too can summon searing spirits that leave trails of destruction in their wake?"
486,,200,Against The Rot,Elden Ring,Modus ,"Malenia scorned the Rot and all those who sought to worship her because of it, while her brother strove beyond the Golden Order itself to cure her condition. Yours is a martial talent with the holy power of the Erdtree, being able to imbue your weapons and armour with it for various blessings-yet while this is a limited talent, your true gift is the ability to ensure this and similar holy abilities remain pristine even should you be infected with corruptive forces such as the Scarlet Rot. You have also been given a blessing that provides great resistance against the Erdtree’s light and similar holy power. With the Haligtree misshapen Miquella’s cause may be a fleeting fantasy, but you are well equipped to defend it to the bitter end."
487,,200,Servant of Death,Elden Ring,Modus ,"Ah, what could have driven you to covet such a heretical force? There is a sorcery in these lands that does not draw on glintstone-but rather, the dread forces of death that have become heretical and undesired by nearly all in the Lands Between. And yet, you are both talented and experienced in this most unhale of sorceries. You know how to strike the earth, and raise up explosions of ghostflame-the pallid force kept by the Deathbirds in a time before the Erdtree. You can also summon hordes of vengeful spirits to swarm your enemies, cinders of ancient death hexes raked from the fires of ghostflame. And last but not least, like Fia you have a couple nasty surprises in the form of custom death sorceries that channel the power of death into more specific, unique effects-and great skill at innovating new ones. Like her, you could conjure mists that inflict death’s sickening blight on a specific type of being. Or perhaps one of your spells grants command over the wandering undead?"
488,,200,Dragon Communion,Elden Ring,Modus ,"The practice of dragon communion is a primal practice, founded in the sacrificial devouring of dragon hearts in order to create the likeness of the dragons as elemental breath attacks, claw swipes and tail slashes-with an eye for greater transformations later on. Marika herself decreed that the worship of the Erdtree did not conflict with idolizing the ancient dragons, and so it is the difficulty of advancing of hunting and slaying dragons rather than persecution that has mainly hindered it’s spread.

You are no mere neophyte. For years you have followed the path of Dragon Communion, and can be considered experienced in it. Not only are you better versed at challenging the mighty dragons than most warriors, but along with a wide arsenal of basic dragon-summoning based techniques-and a handful of some truly unique dragon’s breath attacks. In future worlds, even the hearts of dragons alien to this world will confer similar benefits proportionate to their overall power."
489,,200,Reclaimer of Runes and Ashes,Elden Ring,Modus ,"Faintly sparkling motes of light carrying the power of life itself and blessed by the Erdtree, runes are nourishment that through slow absorption develop all aspects of a Tarnished to greater heights. A fragment of Grace clings to you, permitting you to claim Runes from those you slay even in future worlds-and even if you yourself are not a Tarnished. This perk is free for all backgrounds for the duration of the jump.

Consider Runes to be a sort of life energy closely bound to but not strictly speaking part of the soul, which with the aid of a Finger Maiden (or perhaps, similarly powerful being or force capable of manipulating spiritual energy) can be used to increase your strengths and abilities-or be removed from your body and traded away. Particularly powerful individuals possess Remembrances- mystical records of light produced by the Erdtree which can be used to forge items, spells, or Ashes of War: Unique signature fighting moves used by truly accomplished warriors and other figures of legend, more akin to transcendent martial techniques than the sorcery and incantations of this world. Divine ones on par with the demigods of this world or even Empyreans may even have Great Runes of their own: Runes that embody their core divine traits.

For an extra 200 CP you may toggle on the propagation of Runes and Ashes of War in future worlds. All living things-including cosmic beings and gods-will generate a certain amount of Runes, the process become as natural metaphysically intrinsic to the local realm of existence you’re in as it is in the Lands Between. Likewise, the remains of those with martial techniques of great power will manifest that can be used to relearn them. By your investment here you yourself have somehow obtained the ability to extract for yourself strength from these Runes. While spiritually or divinely sensitive beings may be able to figure out a way, as a unique ability by taking someone’s hand and concentration for a moment you may grant them the ability to gather runes from those they slay. Beware: This gift, once given, cannot be easily taken back."
490,,200,Mudblood Pride,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Modus,"​Someone needs to bring those idiotic, illogical wizards into the modern
age! And you’re just the Jumper for it. You have the skills to inflict great change upon a society,
for its betterment or worse. You can get age old traditions to be discarded, ancient biases
forgotten, new methods and ways of doing things adopted at a truly ludicrous pace, everything
up to and including getting new laws passed and government policies changed in record time.
Wherever possible, you will be able to do it peacefully, with debate and logic. But you will also
always know when it’s just not possible, and have a decent grasp of the violent methods thus
needed."
491,,200,Non-verbal Speciality,Harry Potter,Modus ,"You have an uncanny, natural knack for silent spells. While most students will have to wait till 6th year to even attempt nonverbal spells for you they are as simple as doing the spell aloud would be."
492,,200,Dubious Reputation,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Modus ,You actually learned the Dark Arts while at school rather than that defence rubbish. As such you can cast the so called Unforgivable Curses with ease and a great deal of power behind them as well as turn dead bodies into shambling undead inferi.
493,,200,Mistcaller,MtG - Ixalan,Modus ,"A common yet useful magical talent of the merfolk, you are capable of manipulating water both to create jets and geysers as well as to form a shrouding vapor mist, making it difficult to track you or fight you for most combatants."
494,,200,Vineshaper Mystic,MtG - Ixalan,Modus ,"The River Heralds are in tune with the flora and the earth of Ixalan, as the Sun Empire are in tune with the beasts, and as such a basic expression of this innate ability, you can utilize the mana of the world around to manipulate plantlife around you, bending it to your will and reinforcing it to do some true damage to your foes. "
495,,200,Primordial Shackling ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus ,"The elements form the basic building blocks of reality, and any who seek to master magic would do well to understand their intricacies. You’ve mastered the use of elemental magics, and can easily shape raw mana into minor elemental forces even without the use of pre-defined spells. Furthermore, you find that handling other types of elemental powers, from Elemental Blasts to disrupt opposing spells to the summoning of Air or Water Elementals, is considerably easier for you. Any magical costs for such effects, be they based on Shandalar spells or other forms of magic, are somewhat reduced, and the resulting effects are more powerful than they otherwise would have been."
496,,200,ADDENDUM ,MtG - Ravnica,Modus ,"Other people tend to rush things, casting their spells as soon as possible, or waiting until the very last second before making a move. But you know that there’s a time and place for every spell, and often, it is simply patience that is needed to make something more effective. If you spend time on something, it tends to work a lot better, sometimes even granting additional effects."
497,,200,Channel ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Modus ,"Traditionally, Channeling is the style of magic used by those who possess contracts with Kami, allowing the powers and abilities of the Kami to flow through you and into the world. However, there is a secondary aspect to it that not everyone knows about, a technique of last resort if you would. By purposefully breaking this connection, you can instead cast an entirely different spell than you were preparing. For the most part, this does not actually require a connection to a Kami - it can work with anything, from ordinary spells to a connection to a land, but they do need to be of high enough quality to be used. You have both the skills needed to make use of this emergency technique, and to determine what is and is not a valid target for using it with only a few moments of study."
498,,200,The Colors of the Past ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Modus ,"While most individuals of an ecclesial persuasion usually fall under the domain of the Order of Jukai, there is one subgroup that does not. The Living Histories of Kamigawa, whom have tales of epic battles from years past and entries from the personal writings of some of Kamigawa’s most famous heroes and villains alike carved and painted into their skin. You share this with them, having recorded some of those same stories upon your body in the form of a hundred different tattoos, each one representing a different story of years gone by that you have memorized. Through the arts of song and dance, you can bring these stories to life, acting out entire plays and epic tales so that all watching might learn from the past in the same way you have. And, as you might imagine, being able to summon up spirits and shades in the form of Kamigawa’s greatest heroes and villains, and the magnificent powers they once wielded, can be truly frightening in battle."
499,,200,A Colorful Assault,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Modus ,"Not all Samurai and Warriors are equal. Not all are trained the same, armed the same, offered the same opportunities in life. A human soldier of the Empire who went to school for three years and a nezumi who has spent a decade in the sewers practicing their swordsmanship on the foul creatures down there are two very different creatures - and a Jukaian might be given the offer to learn the original form of Bushido, not the modified and standardized version used by almost everyone in this day and age. The specifics of this option are determined by both yourself and by your faction - within reason, you may use it to grant yourself any special ability or clever trick that a common Samurai or Warrior might be able to develop. Perhaps that Nezumi learned to twist his magics in such a way that he could mimic the fighting styles of his foes and allies, or perhaps a Soratami might have somehow learned to use shields and other defensive items as their primary weapon. You may play with this, but only so far. "
500,,200,Powdermage ,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus ,"Kithkin use a lot of powders and dusts to perform their spellcraft, which in turn necessitates a lot of containers - urns, jars, lockets, and pouches. Theirs is an alchemical kind of magic, inextricably linked to their innovation. They build flying steeds that are part bird, part pottery, defying the wind with powers sources from a big collection of jars and urns, they trap others in oblivion rings with circles of fine particles, and even nurse their own back to health with inscribed patterns made from specially-prepared dust laid out in a circle.
 
You are now exceptionally skilled at this, feeling at home with kithkin alchemy and knowing
just which powders to mix and grind up to get the effects you want... and the right containers to carry without overburdening yourself with too much excess weight. You could also be considered a remarkable potter too, if you wanted to create your own jars and urns."
501,,200,Druidic Tradition,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Druids are cultivators of nature and casters of faith. They hold close ties to the world around them and in turn the world around them gives them power. This makes them especially in tune with Green Mana and you can choose two magical arts associated with Green Mana, some examples are: Enchanters, Animists, Physical Enhancement and giving form to animal spirits. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who specialize in the same field. In addition this method of magic lets you cultivate the land around you and the Mana within you by improving what is already there. As such with time and effort you can help a land grow, increasing the amount of Mana it can produce. The same can be done to your spirit, allowing you to slowly turn your body into a powerful producer of Mana through meditation and understanding of the world around you."
502,,200,Improvised Spellcasting ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Screw all the formal learning, studying and practice. When you move as much as you do, what you need is to make spells on the fly. This comes with exceeding ease to you. Being able to devise spells within your skill set when you need them, where as other Planeswalkers might need an hour, days, weeks or months to think the spell over. You won’t be able to make a mind control spell as a Pyromancer for example but you may be able to change the fire you control into a sword made of plasma covering your hand to block swords.

Unfortunately, this spontaneous spell creation comes with some drawbacks that are proportional in severity to the amount of time you would need to understand the spell. These drawbacks could manifest in different ways depending on the spell in question such as a loss of fine control, reduced damage, increased Mana cost or damage to self. A fire spell that would only take an hour to perfect for example, may leave some minor burns, while a fire spell that would take months to understand may end up blasting off an arm and a leg in addition to damaging your sanity. Thankfully, you have a full awareness of the cost of attempting a spell before you are ready. Such is the price of adaptability, besides if you live through the conflict you can always fix the spell up later when you get around to it."
503,,200,Shamanistic Practices ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Shamans are those who spend years of practice and hunting for lore to learn magic like wizards. Unlike wizards which focus on a more studious nature, shamans use emotions and strength of will to bridge the gap of intellect and understanding. Due to this, they also have some connections with the elements and the spirits. You can choose two magical arts associated with Red Mana, some examples are: Pyromancy, Electromancy, Geomancy, Animism and Physical Enhancement usually involving speed, among many others. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who specialize in the same field. In addition this method of magic lets you tribute physical items in order to give your spells more Mana in the short term or form bonds with spirits."
504,,200,Warlock Rituals ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Witches and Warlocks gain their power primarily from consulting with dark beings of great power. While they can learn spells from study, they tend to take shortcuts by contracting and gaining power that way. Through some powerful rituals you can choose two magical arts associated with Black Mana, some examples are: Sangromancy, Necromancy, bringing nightmares into existence, Hexmagic, Demonologists, Shadow Magic, Death Magic and many more. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who are specialists in that area of magic. In addition, you are able to more easily get intact with powerful entities as your experience with dark rituals aids you, they will also be more willing to offer you less steep prices for what you ask for but something like becoming eternally young and beautiful still comes with a very hefty price."
505,,200,Wizardly Studies ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Wizards are those who spend years in academies, studying texts and calculating magical formulas. Their intellect bolsters their work and they tend to devise spells as they progress in their research. Due to your studies you can choose three magical arts associated with Blue Mana, some examples are: Cryomancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, Chronomancy, Precognitives, Psychometrists, Mental Magic, Illusionists, Arcanists and many more. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who are specialists in that area of magic. Unlike other magical traditions this one has no additional benefits."
506,,200,Cleric Schooling ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Modus ,"Clerics are those who let faith and prayer influence their spellcasting. Not entirely separated from formal schooling they understand the principles by which spells work but also bolster them with their prayers and the prayers of others. Due to your faith you can choose two magical arts associated with White Mana, some examples are: Lithomancy, Hieromancy, Shield Magic, Light Magic, Healing Magic, Purification, and Aethermancy which is the prevention or inhibiting of summoning. In the fields you choose, you become a gifted prodigy who is able to learn spells within these fields faster than other Planeswalkers, barring those who are specialists in that area of magic. The prayers of others can aid you in your spellcasting letting the combined faith of your chants increase the power of a spell, in addition you would be able to recognize divinity on sight."
507,,200,Perpetual Motion ,Warbreaker,Modus ,"Did you know you can Awaken a wooden wheel or gear with a command to turn? And it will keep going, forever or until it has rotted and worn away? Well, when you Awaken something, the Breath settles in a little different, strengthening and reinforcing the structure. Your wheels will turn and Lifeless walk forever or until violence stops them, immune to daily wear and tear and much harder to destroy."
508,,200,Aborkineticism,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus ,"The ability to make plants grow faster by talking to them, though the plants you affect will only grow within the confines of what is natural for them. Expressly cannot be used for combat.

Boosted: Chlorokinesis: Through the power of your True Name, your magic has bloomed into something greater. Where before you could merely accelerate the growth of plants, now you may control them with your mind. Substituting magical energy for water, nutrients, sunlight, and time, you can force plants to grow to monstrous sizes, far surpassing what they would normally grow to, and make them move as an animal might. You could turn daffodils into tentacle-like vines, or make peach trees grow fruit the size of bowling balls. Unlike the less advanced version, this power can be used in battle.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
509,,200,"Earth, Water, Wind, And Fire",BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Modus ,"If two wielded swords, then what did the other four wield? Well, one was a fist fighter, one wielded a wand that created matter, another and infinitely long chain, all made by Nine. Nine herself relied on her own magical talents, and an oversized fire elemental. But this isn’t about weapons. See, of those four heroes, three of them knew what’s known as alchemy. Strictly speaking it’s the art of improving things -material objects, the body, even the soul. Making them more perfect. However, it also represents a certain level of control over the world around you. Stomping your feet and creating an earthen barrier. Clapping your hands and creating an explosion. Roaring and summoning a small hurricane. More spiritual uses require invocations and reagents, but simply moving matter around needs only a simple gesture."
510,,200,Daoist Arts,Campione,Modus ,"An Asian form of spellcasting, based on the Feng Shui, Astrology, and other traditional Asian beliefs and centered in the manipulation of qi. Doubling as a type of martial art, it gives the practitioners several advantages that other mages lack, including the ability to cast spells with a set of movements instead of words and manipulating qi (life force) for a myriad of effects. You start with a great grasp of the basics and some advanced techniques, your talent being enough to master this art in a few years of practice."
511,,200,Flower of Chivalry,Campione,Modus ,"You have come a long way in your training, always holding code of chivalry in your mind and actions, you became able to apply it without doubt or complications even in a grey world like this. You possess the heart of a lion which never backs down, the leadership of a true captain, the mind of a great strategist and the luck required in finding a worthy master to serve and gain greater glory for you both. Truly you are what all other knights aspire to be. It’s not only your heart which holds strong, but also your mastery over magic and swordsmanship is now equal to any Great Knight."
512,,200,Active Skills,Fate/Extella,Modus ,"A new method of battle for the powerful Servants, Active Skills are an allowance of the Moon Cell that translates the special powers, spells and skills of a Servant into repeatedly usable, no cost abilities. A blast of light from a holy sword, a barrage of magical spells or a special martial arts technique- all able to be instantly executed and without normal energy costs. Only four Active Skills can be contained in one Servant at a time, requiring a period of rest from battle to change them out, but otherwise almost any ability can be made into this form. The limitation is that Active Skills have a cooldown timer before they can be used again, more powerful Active Skills compared to your base level of ability requiring longer times.

Only three kinds of things are limited from being turned into an Active Skill. Your most powerful abilities, such as the complete release of a Noble Phantasm, and things with extremely high and unique costs, such as requiring the sacrifice of a Noble Phantasm or large portion of your own life to use. Finally, anything that would take more than a few seconds will be invalid for Active Skill use, like magical rituals. "
513,,200,Little Echidna,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Modus ,"Life has so much potential, especially when it’s guided by a knowing hand. For you, the magic that
alters the living is practically in your genes. You’ve got the ability to morph, change and twist the
bodies of living things, simply pouring magical energy in while thinking of the desired changes. Mutating and making others into monsters is almost as easy as breathing, turning humans into
piggies permanently is just the start of what you can do. Shapeshifting yourself and others and
cursing others into extremely powerful monsters with enough energy are your staples but you can
learn to take your innate ability and twist it towards controlling your creations, as well as other
beings, or enchanting your effects into food or drink. It’s even possible for you to learn to create new
life, though that may turn out to be a long term goal. Your innate ability is quite great and while the
energy costs can be significant, they’ll be easier to manage the more comprehensive your
knowledge of the biology you are twisting is, and you’ll find yourself with no small amount of talent
with magic that deals with biological manipulation as well, though this natural capability of yours
usually results in much more effective creations for the energy you put in compared to normal spell
equivalents."
514,,200,Sage Arts,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Modus,"Devils and demons have powers many and varied, chief among them the arts of magic and curses. In
their journeys, the many sages of these lands have found methods to counter these evil powers, even turn them back against the sinful creatures. You’ve studied at their homes and learned the
ways of countering magic and magical abilities. It’s taught you how to create wards that can block all
but the strongest of spells, harmlessly dissipating the magic, or reflecting them back against the
caster. Wards for locations, to act as shields or enchanted onto people and objects to cover them
completely. A sword imbued with such powerful anti-magic could sunder and destroy magical tools
if it damaged them, causing spells to unravel with a stab, while a person so enchanted would find
themselves largely immune to most magical effects. Undoing these effects is a simple matter and
with some further practice, your control over these tools against magic might grow to the point of
forcefully taking control of hostile magic, rather than merely dispelling it and tearing apart their
arcane works."
515,,200,Divine Spells,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"They call it a blessing from God, a sign that this persecuted religion is meant for something more. The miracles you can perform are wonders to these ordinary people, healing them with a touch or
bringing life to rotting crops. But in truth, you are using magecraft without realisation or training. Activating magical circuits and channeling the energy into spells comes naturally, like breathing or
walking to newborn calves. Self study and making progress without teachers is easy, especially when
you use this magical ability to perform things seen as Abrahamic miracles. While your power is
limited, this too can grow in times when your flock has need or you fight an opponent of your faith, to potentially many times your normal level if the need is truly dire and the situation recalls one
from your holy stories."
516,,200,Shinano Priestess,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus ,"For the less wholesome gods and monsters that make their sacred homes in Japan, a ninja clan can
often act as the perfect subjects. Some clans find themselves bound to ancient spirits, responsible
for providing many of their special abilities, in exchange for their own devotion. As part of the clan, you were taught as a priest or priestess to handle these spirits through holy witchcraft. While you
are far from a powerful witch like Tamamo no Mae and of little use in combat, your training has
given you a wealth of experience in handling spirits. You know many spells and rituals to calm and
appease even powerful divine spirits, as well as allowing the summoning and control of lesser
creatures. Spirits of all kinds often feel favourable to you, especially strong with those associated
with darkness or other unwholesome concepts related to the ninja’s way of life. A fortunate
priestess may even gain blessings from these gods, if they prove their devotion. "
517,,200,Origami Witch,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"A simple art turned deadly in your hands. Years of experience in folding paper has certainly made
you a master at creating even the most complex origami shapes, your skill growing to the point that
it began to mix with your magical energy, turning into something much more dangerous. You can easily use magic to shape paper into a wide variety of forms, imbued with varying effects. Creating
origami familiars from paper, dangerous enough to scythe through human soldiers, is a ground-level
effect. Creating powerful shields from overlapping paper flowers, flight through origami wings, patterns that strengthen existing spells or apply curse-like debuffs to those pierced by the paper
cranes are all possible. While your main skill lies with direct paper spells, you will also find it much
more possible to place magical effects onto paper for use with your magic. Researching some form
of Onmyoudo or runic spells could prove especially potent. "
518,,200,Sybil,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Modus,"You have an innate and instinctive connection to death and the dead. This
gives you certain natural insights into supernatural phenomena related to them, such as
ghosts or blood sacrifice. You also automatically know when you are in a graveyard. The
benefits of this start out subtle, but with training they could develop into a formidable
form of magecraft that allows the invocation of Heroic and Divine Spirits, though causing
true possession by such beings would require an amount of magical energy that could
not realistically be acquired by a modern mage. Still, projecting them upon yourself to
borrow their powers is a potent form of thaumaturgy in its own right. In future worlds you
may use this magecraft to invoke local heroes and gods in addition to those from the
Nasuverse."
519,,200,Salamander Skin Glove ,Kara no Kyokai,Modus,"A starter tool that helps even the most amateurish of beginners with their magecraft studies. It’s one of Touko’s creations, made so that even someone without any magic circuits can start to gather a little magical energy and learn to make use of it through the glove. Even on a proper Magus, it’d be helpful, as the glove is attuned to one Element and makes it noticeably easier to control spells within that Element. The default is fire, hence the Salamander name, but you can have it refocus onto a different one when you buy the tool.
"
520,,200,Traditional Practices ,Libriomancer,Modus,"You have been classically trained in ancient spellcraft. Your magic is more refined, being built on a long tradition of magic users working to improve your magical field. You need less energy to cast spells than most magic users, are able to do magic more frequently and with a shorter casting time. You may also engage in “cooperative” magic with other magic users, making more difficult spells easier for everyone involved and accomplishing feats of magic impossible by a lone spellcaster. (Note: this does not grant you access to magic, simply altering the potential of existing magics you purchase here)
"
521,,200,Cantrip Master ,Young Justice,Modus,"Your mastery of magic has made you very flexible and versatile in the mystic arts, and you can now modify and alter the basic spells in your repertoire. This allows you to do things like changing how a spell is delivered; for example, turning a projectile spell into a spell delivered with a touch. In addition, you can choose where your spells will appear from, so long as it’s within ten meters of yourself, as well as what direction they will go. If you choose to make a spell have an area of effect or a burst effect, it will only be able to affect an area of ten meters in any direction. In addition, if a spell is actually described as simple or as a cantrip in setting, but still has some sort of limit or cost on using it, your mastery of cantrips has made it so you can cast those spells for free.
"
522,,200,Atlantean Sorcery ,Young Justice,Modus,"You’re experienced with Atlantean sorcery, allowing you to manipulate water, using it to blast your foes, create waves, and shield yourself. You can also create solid constructs with your water, as well as generate electricity from your body. Advanced practitioners can do even more, such as shooting and creating ice. Comes with free Water-Bearers. "
523,,200,Aerokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Aerokinesis allows the user to create and manipulate the air, allowing them to push and pull objects and enemies with air currents and create certain weather phenomena, such as twisters or tornadoes. Skilled users can use this ability to fly."
524,,200,Lore of Nehekhara ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Modus,"The magic unique to Nehekharan Priests. The powers of the desert and its gods, heat and the sun and the dead things that reside in the desert, all these fall under the Lore of Nehekhara. A wizard versed in it could draw all the water from a man’s body by desiccation, unleash blasts of biting and tearing sand or boiling heat, enhance his warriors with many protective spells and buffing magics or, of course, raise and control the dead. More than any other, the Lore of Nehekhara has incredible powers to be gained over the dead, with great wizards being able to raise thousands upon thousands of undead warriors on their own. There is a vast amount of power to be discovered in this lore, especially around the dead or in the desert.

Purchasing this option grants you a fair amount of knowledge and training in this magic, enough that you could competently cast many low level spells and even some of middling power, as well as have a wide range of knowledge on Nehekharan legend and rituals. Liches gain this option for free and gain much more out of it, having had decades of training under other wizards in the magic.
"
525,,200,Wings of Darkness ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Modus,"Like mermaids, you have magical songs of your own. However, unlike the sweet songs of the ocean, your songs are tainted with darkness and corruption. Good-aligned victims who hear the song suffer incredible pain. In addition, the songs may have other effects, such as drawing listeners into a hypnotized trance or making them dance uncontrollably.
"
526,,200,Elemental Evocation ,Generic MG,Modus,"Giving offense, defense, and crowd control in one package, you have the ability to manipulate and generate one element, like fire or metal. This starts with fairly basic manipulations - reshaping, splitting, merging - and a limited amount that can be generated or controlled -approximately a ball big enough to fit yourself in. Time and practice will allow for more complex manipulations, a broader category of what you can manipulate, and greater generation of your element.

Still, your element will have one area (offense, defense, or crowd control) that is comparable to the dedicated package, with the other areas starting weaker.
"
527,,200,Whittling Away the Time ,Golden Sky Stories,Modus,"Time seems to fly whenever you’re having fun doesn’t it? One moment it seems like you just started, and the next it’s already over. To be honest, it seems that the older you get – or rather, the more experienced you get – the quicker everything seems to move along.

For a brief period of time, you can accelerate any actions you are performing, whether it is casting a spell, or just reading a book. This extends to even group activities as well, affecting all of your allies involved.
"
528,,200,Tylwyth Teg Wards ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know how to set up mystical wards linked to plants around you. These wards can have a lot of different effects, from magnetizing together or chilling metal items to enhancing plant growth to setting traps to redirecting people away from an area. Experimenting with different plants may let you develop new kinds of wards.
"
529,,200,Gnome Spells ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know some various spells that only Gnomes can use. For instance, you can change the size (shrinking/growing) of up to 6 willing subjects (this can include yourself) or 1 unwilling target. You can also create or destroy up to 10 gallons of any liquid. In addition, you can change the warmth level of up to 6 willing individuals or 1 single unwilling target; this causes their body’s temperature to drastically rise or drop."
530,,200,Queen ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"Or to be more specific, a Witch Queen. You are now a Queen for whatever species you chose for your background (Card, Chessman, whatever specific type of Animal you chose, etc.). Don’t let your raised status inflate your ego too much, though: there are plenty of queens in Wonderland, sometimes more than necessary, and they don’t always tolerate rivals for the crown. Being Queen does not change your gender (unless you want it to).
"
531,,200,Cleric ,Wonderland no More,Modus,"Your magic comes from miracles of faith, for you reverently follow one of several religions common in Wonderland. The magic you can perform with this specialization depends on how much you uphold the tenets of your chosen religion. Upholding the tenets of your faith will strengthen your power as a cleric, while performing things considered sins by that religion will inhibit your use of that kind of magic). You can be faithful to one of several religions, including the Church of Alice, which believes that Alice created Wonderland through her imagination. Some people (Chessmen) take a literal view of the scriptures (the Alice books), while Cards and Animals have a more reformed view. Alternatively, you can be a Dinahist (an offshoot sect that reveres Alice’s beloved cat as second to only Alice herself), or part of the Cult of th Black Kitten, a death cult that worships the infamous, naughty Black Kitten who caused mischief during Alice’s travels through the Looking Glass. The other major religion centers around the Spirit of Conflict, whose scriptures focus on the honor of combat between the Red and White Chessmen.

532,,200,ICE MAGIC ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"You have the basics of Ice Magic, tapping into the cold spirit of Kislev and allowing you to safely freeze enemies solid with a touch, create blades of ice and cause chunks of ice to fall from the sky and batter your enemies. Your body temperature can also drop to extreme lows without any adverse effect on its functions.

While Ice Witches are revered, unfortunately, it is prophesied that a male with ice magic will one day destroy Kislev itself so male mages in general are distrusted and male ice wizards are unheard of/executed.

The Ogre mages are capable of learning how to harness the Lore of Beasts, Lore of Death or the Lore of Heavens. For each purchase of this perk you learn skilled proficiency in one of these Lores.

You were taught and trained under the legendary Azhag the Slaughterer in the Lore of Death, and whilst you maintained your connection to the Great Green the Wind of Death are willing to serve you, though you’ve only just barely tapped into this power. This can allow you to tap into the very beginnings of the Lore of Death.

537,,200,"Stop, Drop, and Roll ",Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Modus,"It is one thing to start a fire with your mind, but another thing to put one out. Most Bright Wizards must be coerced or even threatened into doing so. Luckily, your master taught you how to control your raging heart long before you learned even a single spell as an apprentice. Your control over your fiery spells is such that you may instantly cease the effect of any magical flame you have created with but a thought, regardless of how unruly it would normally be. Moreover, you may contest enemy spellcasters for control of the flames they unleash, and should your will prove stronger you may snuff these flames or turn them backward as well."
538,,200,Prime Reagent ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Modus,"Aethyr is the Prime Reagent, which reacts to all substances and may alter all substances through interaction with them. Aethyr, of course, is Magic, and a Gold Wizard’s experiments with it are never done. Like any other Gold Wizard, your fine control over magic is incredible - you are able to introduce merely the tiniest amounts of Aethyric power to a substance, simply to see if the substance will react consistently to it. What is more, you are able to do so in the manner necessary for experimentation, in precisely the same amount and precisely the same way each and every time. There will surely be other uses for your ability to wield magic so subtly, but you will always find this fine control helpful in the laboratory.

539,,200,Touch of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Modus,"Tzeentch’s way of battle is almost always indirect, many battles won before they were even thought of by those who’d intended to fight them. However, there are times where the lesser beings will make things difficult, so you will need to sully your hands. Once per day, you may use the Winds of Magic that you can muster, or any other magical source such as your mana, to make a very small scale attack against a single foe that totally bypasses physical armor and gets at the fool on the inside. Depending on the amount used, you could rupture internal organs with a flick by erasing the tiniest bits of flesh in their bodies.

...Or, should you require something for off the battlefield, you may use the exact same method to affect a person’s mind. On a small expenditure, you can implant ideas into other people, making them assume the idea came from them. On a large one, you can almost warp the mind, causing them to follow an order to the end or even fill them with a false sense of hope. Keep in mind that all of this can only be done after physical contact is made, no matter how small.

It is a Lore, fittingly, with excellent spells that fit any role you could need on a battlefield. Slaying hordes? Fiery Convocation. Smiting a single target? Soul Quench. Buffing the troops? Hand of Glory. Ruining your enemy’s favorite magic toy? Arcane Unforgiving. Additionally, as an Asur caster of this Lore you receive an escalating, magical, defensive screen while continuing to cast spells from this Lore."
541,,200,Omni-Disciplinary Mage ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Modus,"While it certainly isn’t overly talked about, given the prevalence of the auspiciousness of High Magic, the Asur Mages have access to every other common Lore of magic. Yes indeed, odd as it may be to think of a noble High Elf utilizing the Lore of Shadows, or Death, you can certainly do so if the Qhaysh is truly not to your liking. Furthermore, from here onwards you will have unilateral access to every avenue of magic you encounter that is not restricted by something like race, or otherwise secret.

Thief’s Aura: Once per day, when intending to commit theft against someone’s person, you may bump into them. If your spiritual power is more than theirs is, they will automatically drop small items of small worth. Things like bombs, identification cards, and rupees(or other money) which you can quickly snatch up. This aura will not work against an adversary’s weapons, or armor or things of significant power.

Wizzrobe Wyrdness:  Like a wizard in classic attire, with heavy robes and wide-brimmed hats. You have the ability to hide your features when in a robe with magic, making it seem like your face is just pitch blackness with white eyes and summoning of a white beard to complete the ensemble. The Wizzrobes have three magical disciplines by this time, Fire, Ice, and pure magic attacks. But their greatest ability is the ability to suck out force gems from their opponents to recharge their magic reserves- albeit at a very low rate. After this jump, this becomes being able to suck out any magic-based energy source from an enemy to replenish your own magical reserves. They also have a peculiar ability to summon Stalfos, by firing a homing sphere of white light that breaks into three empowered Stalfos when it hits an enemy. When these stalfos are defeated they live on as floating skulls for a minute more as they gain temporary immunity to physical and magical attacks. All of these abilities are held in a Spellbook that you will learn these abilities by the end of this jump. You may not reach the heights of the Sages, Vaati, or the Maidens alone with this- but you’d have a good chance of mastering the minimum capabilities required for becoming one of their apprentices. You get a free set of wizzrobes as well."
545,,200,The Magic Touch ,Hyrule Warriors,Modus,"Magic is incredibly prevalent among the more powerful enemies and allies you’ll meet during your stay. As an up and coming Sorcerer or Sorceress yourself, it’d be silly to be without it, now wouldn’t it?

The magic of this world is capable of quite a few things and feats. The most basic application is transforming magic into one of a few elements like light, darkness, fire, lightning or water as examples to combat enemies or for normal utility. 

Magic is also capable of enhancing objects or manipulating magical objects and things. This can be used to reinforce an object’s toughness, animate things such as commanding the pages of a magic tome to fly out at your direction, willing magical relics to activate and work on command and so on. 

Lastly, magic is able to summon familiar objects or people from far away, as well as conjure objects out of thin air. Conjuration is quite difficult without intimate familiarity in what you’re trying to fabricate however, more so if you want some form of permanence in it. 

Magic runs off of stamina and knowledge for the most part, with greater feats being more taxing. While the basic principles of magic are bundled into the Sorcerer/Sorceress origin, this perk allows you to leap ahead with your knowledge in elemental manipulation and master an element of your choice.

546,,200,A Song For The Ages ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"As it turns out, Nayru is actually a really great singer. Like, woodland creatures come out and gather around to hear her sing. And then don’t run away when normal people show up to listen as well. Seriously, this is some disney princess level stuff. But, beyond just having the perfect voice for song and several heaps of talent at singing, you also have a semi-unique skill. See, the songs that are supposed to be played on the Harp of Ages in order to control its power? Nayru can use those songs without the harp. You can now pull this off with any magical instrument, not just Nayru’s harp. Now, in order to pull this off you do need a level of familiarity with it, maybe permission from its owner, but after that? Go wild and please don’t break time.

547,,200,Zelda’s Lullaby ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"You may not think that such a simple skill could ever be of use to a god or someone chosen by a god, but as it turns out, music is something favored by them as a password of sorts. As such, you are now a half decent composer and musician, able to play damn near any song after hearing it only once or twice, as well as write your own with minimal difficulty. But, even more importantly, you’re able to use that music as a channel to cast magic, or to cast a spell on a delay such that it would wait a thousand years for someone to finish the song before activating properly. Using a song in such a manner requires quite a bit of magic, something you have now, but you won’t be doing this on any regular basis.
"
548,,200,Spirit Warrior ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"Or perhaps a more traditional usage of magic might appeal to you more than the fancier methods above? However it came about, you’ve managed to learn a handful of magical techniques. Three of them, to be precise. The first is a barrier, a defensive technique meant to defend. The strength of the shield depends on how much magic you use, meaning it can potentially stand up to the Demon Lord himself, if only for a time. The second is a simple ‘bomb’ technique, creating a ball of energy that explodes with a great deal of force after a moment or two - or a second or two. The last is a Sheikah technique, using magical power to enhance one’s physical strength. Punch harder to make your foes go down... Or run away faster. And of course to power these you have a modicum of magical energy, though not enough for prolonged combat.
"
549,,200,Shouldn’t That Have Exploded? ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"Magic used against you is slightly more cohesive than it should be. Not enough to do any additional damage, but just enough that you might be able to deflect it. It does require that the magic be projectile in nature, but with a little bit of timing, those spells could explode in their own users’ faces. Keep in mind though, they could potentially bounce it BACK, and that it will eventually explode at some point in the ensuing tennis match. Also, beams are much much harder to deflect than an ordinary - well, I say ordinary but this is magic we speak of - projectile.

550,,200,Magical Instrument ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Modus,"An instrument of some kind that enables you to use the various magical melodies of Hyrule. However, you cannot use any time travel melodies. This restriction doesn't go away after you leave the jump."
551,,200,Public Magic ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"While sorcerers don’t have the fear Paradox like mages, attempt to perform magic in front of nonbelievers is somewhat more difficult. Not so for you. For one reason or another, your linear magic is not penalized by mortal observation, nor does it become more dangerous."
552,,200,Precise Words,TES: Dovah,Modus,"The power of the Thu'um can be a dangerous thing, one that
strikes down friends and foes alike. Yet, after much meditation and experimentation, you
have come to avoid that issue all together. You can now control exactly what your Voice
affects, and what it doesn't. A wave of Unrelenting Force reducing a man to mush, yet
leaving the thin walls behind completely untouched. Call upon a furious Storm in the
middle of a city of thousands, and no innocents will be struck by its lightning.

Requires Thu'um to purchase."
553,,200,Emotional,TES: Magic,Modus,"One of the cornerstones of the Illusion spells are those that
manipulate the emotions of your targets. Whether they inspire dread or courage in your
targets, they’re very useful for those who desire to face combat with an indirect
approach. Your emotion spells have some additional effects on your targets, like the
fear spells improving a target’s speed, or bravery spells improving their durability. This is toggleable. You also know every illusion spell."
554,,200,Sea Folk ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"When the Sea Elves were cast out from the Aldmer, they retreated to Pyandonea, an island hidden behind magical mist. Due to this aquatic environment, not only are you a skilled sailor, but you are trained to utilize water magic, which is rarely remembered by the mainland races."
555,,200,Winter Folk ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"The inhabitants of Skyrim long before the Nords migrated from Atmora, there was a reason they were called the Snow Elves. You share their immunity to frost, as well as your frost spells being much more potent at only half the cost. Any frost enchantments you place will also be twice as powerful."
556,,200,You're Blue Now ,Undertale,Modus,"That's my Attack! You have the ability to control an opponent's personal gravity. With a single purchase, you can force a floating or flying opponent down to the ground, removing their ability to fly (but not their ability to jump). However, your magical attacks must now accommodate this, becoming patterned to force them through an obstacle course they must jump over to avoid your attacks. You can only use this on one foe at a time, but you can switch between targets freely."
557,,200,It's Not Easy Being Green ,Undertale,Modus,"When you're Green, you can't run away! Unless your opponents learn to face danger head-on, they won't last a second against you! You have the ability to root an opponent in place. They won't be able to move an inch from where they stand- But they will also gain an impenetrable magic shield that covers 90 degrees in front of them, and they can rotate freely. The answer to this limitation, of course, is to attack from all sides! While your opponent is in this state, you can rapid-fire attacks from all sides, and even attacks that circle around to the opposite side they appear to be coming from! The only caveat is that the attack must be able to be blocked- You can't actually attack from multiple sides at once. You can only affect one foe at a time with this technique."
558,,200,Elemental Reaction ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"When you entered into this world, a little of this world entered into you. It has left your abilities changed in a small but significant way; the phenomena of elemental reactions has permeated throughout the rest of your abilities. When utilising the elements with your powers they are liable to react in much the same way as in this world. If you were to mix the powers of fire and lightning, rather than just being shocked and burned, these two elements would react most explosively. Similarly, should you mix something like Ice and Water, you would find the freezing power of the ice magnifying manyfold. Who knows what reactions might be generated as you visit new worlds and gain command over entirely different elements?"
559,,200,Innate Connection ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"Visions are what allow mortal men the ability to use the elemental powers of Teyvat. Yet despite this supposedly steadfast rule, there are those who are able to use this power without any kind of focus. The most obvious example of such a person would be the Traveler, though as a world traveler they are something of an anomaly. As a world traveler yourself, your nature allows you to use the power of Teyvat without the need of a focus. In other worlds and jumps too, you will find that you do not require some kind focus such as wand or staff to use your magic. It is simply part of who you are."
560,,200,Magic ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"Not only Mages can perform magic. Well, okay, only mages can, because a mage is a magic-wielder. Point is, even if you didn’t take the origin, you’re now a part of the club! Now you too can wield the forces of the universe. Dark Magic is available to all, Primal Magic is difficult for humans to learn, but rewarding."
561,,200,Skill Beyond Belief ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"An elf is perfection, at least according to Elves. Everything they do or make is just a little better. By taking this, your blows land more precisely, your handicrafts are more elegant, your designs more refined, and magic, above all else, becomes precise and flexible for each spell to encompass a wide variety of functions, from snuffing a single candle to bowling people over in a gale."
562,,200,Is it possible to learn this power? Not from the protagonist. ,World Seed,Modus,"With the upcoming changes in the world, or even just by playing Neolife, you’re undoubtedly going to come into the possession of many new skills and abilities. But is it really the strength of his powers that defines a man? No, it is how he uses said powers. Well, using them better is mainly to get even more powerful, but you get the gist. And with this perk you get it even more.

Using your abilities to their fullest potential is child’s play to you, and you can easily use several abilities you have in tandem to amplify their strength beyond what might be expected of them. What’s more, you also have a talent at coming up with entirely new techniques and ways to use any powers you have for most any situation you can think of. If you have the Fire affinity, you won’t even need to think for a second before realizing that you can also use it to pull fire mana out of an object to freeze it, and having to shoot your enemies with twenty variations of elemental beams will be a thing of the past. You also possess the mental faculties to actually question how your powers work, and if you ever used shadow magic, you would surely recognize that it could only work if a separate shadow realm existed. So rest assured, as with these gifts you’ll never need a divine intervention to actually use the vast power you have gained."
563,,200,Nature Natural,World Seed,Modus,"To raise an Affinity can be harder than it sounds. The required steps to do so are to send out your mana to connect to an element, attuning your mana to match said element as closely as possible, and then cycling it by pulling just a little bit of mana from the element and assimilating it with your own. Even “finding” the mana of an affinity besides the main seven elements can be extremely hard. Gravity and Time might be all around you, but it’s not easy at all to pick them out of the all the mana types swirling around you. In this kind of endeavor though, you’ve got a bit of a leg up on others.
You have an “affinity” of sorts for cultivating affinities - or rather, integrating yourself with, studying, and manipulating nature. With a bit of meditation and some time, you can easily identify whatever there is in your surroundings, even obscure mana types such as Order or Chaos that would normally be nigh-impossible to cultivate without finding a major source of them first. Even cultivating Time mana anywhere you want would be possible for you, though quite a bit slower than if you were near a large source of it, such as by speeding your personal time up by a few million times through the attraction of time mana, considering how spread out it is over the universe. Still, just the fact that you are able to do so at all without resorting to methods like that could make a few people jealous.
Once you have an affinity, you’ll also find it easier to manipulate its element, make it seemingly moving on its own volition to follow your commands, and having to use less mana to control it. And don’t think that this skill is limited to helping you with Druid skills like World Casting or training affinities. A Mage could just as easily study nature to come up with highly efficient spells imitating it, and a Rogue would find it helping make their illusions seem more natural and difficult to see through. It’ll help you with all other abilities that work with or through nature as well."
564,,200,Runic Spell Innovator ,World Seed,Modus,"Considering that one simply needs to combine the runes for “Blast” and “Fire” to make a fireball, or do the same with the “Reinforce” and “Mind” runes to create a basic spell to protect against mind altering effects, one might think that runic magic is incredibly easy. Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over it, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing “hello world” and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience.Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it’s bashing someone’s head in with the “Force” rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach."
565,,200,How I Learned To Love The Bomb ,Konosuba,Modus,"That spell just feels so good. You can’t resist using it over and over. It might not be the best spell for the situation but you can’t force yourself to even learn any other. Thankfully, you need not suffer without benefit. For you, magic feels good to use. A pleasure on a physical, emotional and even spiritual level that calms and satisfies you. But when you wish, you can deepen this enjoyment for specific spells. By forcibly creating a growing addiction to a single spell, heightening the pleasure you receive, you can make that spell easier and better. The more addicted you are to it, the greater its power will become and the easier it’ll be for you to use. If you became obsessed enough to base major portions of your life around a single spell, you could see yourself getting many times the normal power from it and able to cast it ten times as much as normal, the costs have decreased so much. Be careful however as this perk provides no way to get out of these addictions and you’ll need to break them the old fashioned way, though do note that doing so will also remove the benefits."
566,,200,Rod of Explosions ,Konosuba,Modus,"Now that you have your familiar, you need your proper implement for magic use. You now have a wand or staff that is best suited for a specific kind of magic of your choice. It can be as specific as the Explosion spell from this world or as broad as any kind of necromancy magic. The more specific, the better the boost this implement will give to the power of the spell when you use it to cast that magic. A single spell could be three or even four times as good but an entire field of magic might only be ten percent again as strong as normal. The implement can be as fancy or simple as you like too."

568,,300,The Return of Osiris,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Modus,"Decades ago, the Board’s Chairman claimed that human history can
be divided into three sections, called the Aeons of Isis, Osiris, and Horus. Each age inevitably
overcomes the one before it. His occult principles concur, but you’re proof it’s not that simple. So
long as you remain rooted in the Aeon of Osiris, which is to say so long as you reject nihilism
and moral relativism, you will assuredly defeat the Aeon of Horus’s forces, in much the same
way that they ought to overcome you. Furthermore, you can directly damage the coming age by
defeating its champions, forestalling and perhaps even driving back the supposed future, which
has already arrived. And once you have torn down their achievements, you can often build them
up again, twice as grand, and far more righteous. In future worlds, you may similarly reverse
such metaphysical progression, or perhaps degradation, regardless of the momentum behind it."

natural ability as a wolfbrother is far more advanced and far stronger.
You have already fully mastered the Wolf dream, being

he chooses, manipulating light and air to render himself undetectable in
any way, manipulating the environment around him to attack or restrain
enemies, moving fast enough to fly miles into the sky in moments,
hardening his body to avoid taking damage from attacks, etc. The only
limits on his power are that he cannot heal himself, and he cannot revive
the dead. This also grants you the ability of Shifting, allowing you to
teleport freely throughout the world of dreams, and also instantly shift
back into the real world and vice versa. This allows you to effectively
teleport throughout the physical plane by instantly shifting to
Tel'aran'rhiod, shifting to a different location there, and then shifting
back into the physical plane. You can forcefully take others into the

572,,300,Magnet Release,Naruto,Modus,"This Kekkei Genkai allows its user to generate a magnetic force that can manipulate any conductive material. This is done by producing an alternating magnetic field which induces a current into the material, causing it to generate its own magnetic field. The most common application of Magnet Release is imbuing your chakra into different fine particulates--sand, iron dust, or gold dust--to telekinetically control. This has an incredibly wide array of applications: defenses strong enough to tank blows from the likes of pre-Ragnarok Thor, tunneling into the earth to surprise foes, binding enemies, or leveraging sheer force to bury forests under meters of sand. You're not limited to sand or iron dust either; by coming into physical contact with conductive other conductive materials, such as swords or shuriken, you'd be able to control them, too. "
573,,300,Lava Release,Naruto,Modus,"A combination of fire and earth, this Kekkei Genkai is a tad different compared to others as this bloodline manifests in different forms. One is molten rock, the second is a form of acidic mud which basically looks like brown dirt, the third is quicklime which is corrosive, the fourth is vulcanised rubber, and the final form is volcanic ash. Unlike others, you can use all of these forms at will.
"
574,,300,Ice Release,Naruto,Modus,"This bloodline from Kiri allows for the manipulation of snow and ice, either by using pre-existing snow or by creating it outright. This bloodline requires both Water and Wind elemental natures. Beyond merely creating ice, the user can produce ice mirrors that they can enter and travel between, planting ice particles onto a person causing them to freeze to death, making ice dragons, and more. Unlike normal ice, the ice produced by this bloodline  is greatly resistant to melting by fire. An Ice Release user can also voluntarily lower the temperature of their surroundings even to the point of causing snow to fall. They can also lower their own body temperature."
575,,300,Crystal Release,Naruto,Modus,"As its name suggests, this bloodline allows the user to convert any matter into crystal whether it’s the ground beneath their feet, the moisture that hangs in the air, or the person standing next to them. The user's manipulation of these crystals are almost absolute, being able to take on nearly any shape, and the scale of some techniques can encompass small forests. Also, if desired the target can be crystallised down to the cellular level, preventing them from being uncrystallised without the user's aid. 

The weakness of this bloodline is that it is susceptible to lightning and energy-based attacks, it cannot crystallise pure energy so chakra, fire, lightning, and similar phenomena are immune to this ability’s effects, and a certain sound wave can break the crystals apart. The colour of your crystals is up to you. Earth Release is a component of Crystal Release.
"
576,,300,Steel Release,Naruto,Modus,"This bloodline allows the user to use their chakra to generate an extremely strong steel-like metal. This can manifest in two ways, one defensive and one offensive. The first application allows the user to convert their flesh into black metal, granting a defense nearly impervious to physical attacks. The second application is to generate metal weapons from the user’s chakra, to either be wielded normally or launched at an opponent at high speed."

Beings that can control the weather, change their form, or even nudge the course of destiny to obtain a desired outcome. This perk manifests as innate knowledge and influence over a domain. While ordinary mortals may only be able to display preternatural competence and relatively minor direct influence over their domain, beings with more innate power get increasingly more out of this even at the same purchase level.
Choose a domain; this can be almost anything: a general or specific skill, an element of nature, or a narrow concept. At a purchase of 300cp you would have this as a minor domain, wielding influence and power enough to astonish any being at your level, able to weaken or strengthen others within your concept, influence fate, perform mystical and conceptual acts related to the domain, or wield your element outright. A mortal with a domain over fire could provide substantial warmth on the coldest peaks of Everest, light buildings and large bonfires with a wave of the hand, ""consume"" an entire banquet for a hundred men in moments, or burn an enemy into ash. If of electricity, they would be able to power a small neighborhood of devices or call down a lightning bolt upon your enemy. A mortal with a minor domain over a kingdom would have a divine right to rule that land that no one could deny.

But here and now, you feel like all your thoughts have become...clear. You've silenced any dissent in and around yourself, and have attained a lethal focus. Your body moves faster, strikes reach further, and everything you could do before feels less stifled under a deluge of warring thoughts.

When you change between two different dress spheres, time stops for a second. You’ve stumbled upon a strange quirk, whenever you alternate between casting magic and skills from wholly different systems, time seems to freeze for a second. Unfortunately, this seems to have no effect if you’re casting two different skills simultaneously. If you’re quick enough, you might be able to actually exploit that second you get...perhaps to fire off another spell or shift your location?"
584,,300,Privileged,Gods of Blood and Powder,Modus,"Privileged are the standard types of real sorcerers you will find in this world. They can accomplish all kinds of magic feats by manipulating the Else. They reach with one hand into the Else and pull raw magic out and use the other hand to manipulate it for various effects, most commonly to create and manipulate the 5 elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Aether and most matter that is composed of those elements in various ways like creating and casting fireballs, storms and ice shards, throwing boulders, call down lightning and erecting force fields of hardened air, but they can also to create minor illusions (looking like someone else or making fake fire) create powerful wards, enchantments and fields, on rare occasions heal people and twist biology to create monsters like the Wardens etc. Most Privileged are limited in their range and most of their spells have a range of less than a half mile. Privileged are allergic to gunpowder and unable to see gunpowder with the third eye, or manipulate it in any way. If you look with your third eye a knacked is a lantern a Privileged is a bonfire. You will get a set of Privileged gloves, which will never break, burn or get lost for free. You will need this to cast magic, else your hands will burn from the inside out when reaching into the Else."
585,,300,Powder Mage,Gods of Blood and Powder,Modus,"You are now one of the Powder Mages, also called the Marked. Powder mages have multiple abilities related to gunpowder. They can sense the location and exact amount of blackpowder for up to 300 feet, and can ignite that blackpowder with a thought at a distance, or stop the powder from igniting. They can redirect the energy of ignited blackpowder for various effects such as giving more power to a single bullet to let it fly farther or penetrate deeper, but also to influence bullets mid-flight, giving it more power again to shoot farther, nudge or completely redirect them. A trained powder mage will be expected to put a bullet clean through a Privileged’s head at a 1 mile distance. Energy from blackpowder reactions can also be channeled into objects other than bullets, like an enemy's arm, shattering it. Highly trained powder mages can easily channel and guide the energy of a whole barrel of blackpowder and in extreme situations even of 5 barrels. After Ingesting or snorting blackpowder, mages enter a so-called “powder trance” where they become far tougher, stronger, faster, more pain resistant and more alert with greatly enhanced senses. Beware of consuming too much powder for a longer period of time, since this is very dangerous. Blackpowder is highly addictive for powder mages. After too much powder a Marked can go powder blind Going powder blind could see any of the mages dizzy, disoriented,unconscious, or even dead. Another word of caution: Gold in your blood makes you lose your power as long as it remains in there, a fact used by enemies to subdue mages."
586,,300,AonDor,Elantris,Modus,"Arguably the most well known Invested Art on Sel, AonDor was the name given to the brand of spellcraft used by the Elantrians to accomplish their most incredible feats. By drawing distinct symbols, either in the air or on another material, Elantrians had the power to create a wide arrange of effects, from crafting illusions and healing injuries to conjuring great gouts of fire or crossing large distances in an instant. All that was required was that the user be Elantrian and that they understand the Aons, the precise symbols that governed AonDor. More like a modern programming language than a written script, the versatility of the Aons was matched only by their intricacy.

Of course, AonDor could only be used by the Elantrians, and so you have now joined their illustrious ranks and been transformed by the Shaod. Marked by their brilliant white hair and glowing, slightly metallic skin, an Elantrian is constantly renewed by the power of the Dor. Elantrians have superior strength and speed than their pre-transformation selves, as well as increased insight and mental abilities. The Dor also grants them incredible healing, allowing them to recover even from fatal injuries, such as decapitation. So long as they continue to take in Investiture, an Elantrian under normal circumstances is functionally immortal.

Unfortunately, these are not normal circumstances. Something is wrong with the Dor, and in recent years, those taken by the Shaod have become wretched-looking shadows of the once proud Elantrians. But perhaps there is a way to break this curse? See the Reod drawback and the Notes section for more details."

Each hero has a great deal of power left to unlock and the process of Ascension is the method to do so. By offering up rare materials and a large amount of magical energy in crystallised form, you can force a being to Ascend to the next stage of being for them. This increases their maximum power to allow them to grow more, changes their appearance to show the upgrade and also unlocks a new ability or power for them such as new Skills for Servants. This process can be done many times, even beyond the normal limit of 4 for you, but each one requires progressively more difficult to obtain ingredients and exponentially more massive amounts of magical energy to support the transformation. New abilities are also only obtained at every second Ascension after the first. You can use the Ascension process on yourself or non-Servant beings as well. "

Swords with very long blades may count as spears, allowing what would normally be a Saber class Servant to become a Lancer class Servant. Water manipulated to take on the shape of fire may be treated as fire, burning those it touches.

If you are an arcanotechnician, you get the Sorcerer Perk without the extra boost of this perk. "
595,,300,Reenactment of Mystery(Hunting Renegade),Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Let us speak now, of magecraft.

Simply put, if an end result is achievable through scientific means, then magecraft is a process which creates that outcome using supernatural means. Fundamentally it is the reenactment of preexisting phenomena through the circulation of life energy and magical energy through the magus’ body, their implements or their familiars. In order to attune to the Mysteries attuned to the Akashic Records and reproduce their phenomena, mages use Thaumaturgical Foundations-systems straddling the line between scholarship and religion to derive theories (e.g. “Alchemy is how the world works, therefore I can instantly exchange something for something else using the spell Flash Air. A spoon for a fork, for example) shaped by mankind as a whole’s collective understanding of reality, however accurate it is.

Thus, magecraft is fundamentally at a disadvantage to entities or phenomena with higher Mystery due to being an imperfect replica of similar concepts, and diminishes in power when a significant part of the human population becomes aware of it due to greater human awareness “diluting” the same source of Mystery. More information about Magecraft can be found in the notes.

Barring truly overwhelming fonts of magical energy or preparation, battles between mages tend to be decided by mystical compatibility and strategic conservation of resources rather than superior firepower though as with all things in this world, there are always exceptions. Brute force can be a form of compatibility on its own.

Somehow, you too have the ability to practice magecraft. This purchase determines how good you are at in terms of knowledge and practical implementation. You may select any form of magecraft still in existence in the current era of the setting, from the Japanese Shugendō which combines Buddhism and mountain worship into unique techniques themed around transforming into a tengu by arriving at Hell, to Alchemy which studies control over the flow of bodies, life and matter. Either the Clock Tower’s western foundation which seeks to transform base matter into gold (and to extend the metaphor, a human being into an entity comparable to God) or that of the Alchemists of Atlas. Who, based on Egyptian metallurgy, prefer to focus on the pure conversion of phenomena as well as the prediction-and in some cases, actualisation-of the future. And a particularly unique case greatly decreasing the usual limitations of magic circuits by focusing their grandest efforts on the creation of uniquely powerful items or entities.

Not only are your educational basis rock solid and your knowledge raised to that of a fully-fledged young adult magus, but your sheer talent for magecraft is worthy of the Magus Association’s coveted title Grand. Not only has whatever application of magic you favour risen to a level uncommon even at the heights of mage society, but your practical applications of knowledge have expanded to cover a wide array of basis. Fighting a magecraft battle all night and losing would leave you merely winded, not on the brink of unconsciousness, and capable of beating a hasty retreat on foot given the chance. If you are not a rising star of magus society, you are surely one of its most feared heretics. You are a magical renaissance (wo)man who is not only familiar with most forms of magecraft preserved by the Association, but capable of tweaking and innovating on them-perhaps making a barrier of magical energy able to follow a specific person around and attack others on command when it used to be able to only guard a specific location, for example."
596,,300,Bardsong,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"The power of music and dance truly encapsulates the skill of a Bard. You’ve learned to harmonize your voice and movements to your allies or enemies. Beyond the ability to evoke intended emotions in a crowd, you are able to restore health and increase defenses of your allies, or confuse your foes, lull them to slumber, and more. While other bards must be content with the localized power of their voice, your talent continues to grow.

The wine purple ball will break open on impact and release a wide cloud of heavily alcoholic fumes. Those caught in the vapors will suffer the slow drain of their vitality akin to poisoning.

Perhaps he thought it to you, as you are now a Master of the Ultimate Martial Arts yourself. Simply by using this Style Qin managed to throw Ares and kill Chi You and do things like deflect the energy of an attack back to their opponent so believe me when I say that it truly lives up to its name."

By chanting words to bring your desires to the forefront of your mind, you can create effects like shields to summons to even teleportation. With experimentation there's bound to be different effects and entirely new spells you can accomplish if you work for it. It should be noted that this magic has a massive amount of variety and uses, but if someone interrupts your chanting the spell fails."
602,,300,Down Special Defence!(Reflect),Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have mastered a useful defensive technique.

Reflect – You are able to adopt a special stance, or perform a specific action (such as a kick or a flourish of a cape), which allows you to reflect projectiles back where they came from. Regardless of the chosen method, the time period for which you are reflecting cannot extend past a few moments. After this, you will be open to projectiles and cannot reflect again for a brief amount of time. Further, the action you take for this reflection technique is always the same, allowing it to be seen through with repeated use. You will be unable to reflect some powerful attacks from enemies far beyond your ability to handle. For example, an average Fighter would not be able to counter Galeem’s universe destroying beams of light.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you are able to extend the time you are reflecting indefinitely, as long as you continue to perform your chosen action. You will be unable to perform techniques other than the reflection as long you maintain it in this way."
603,,300,Down Special Defence!(Dodge Counter),Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have mastered a useful defensive technique.

Dodge Counter - You are able to adopt a special stance, preparing yourself to dodge. When you would be hit by an attack whilst in this stance, you will automatically dodge the attack. However, you may only remain in your dodging stance for a few moments, after which you will be open to attack and unable to adopt your dodging stance again for a brief amount of time. Further, the stance you take for this dodge technique is always the same, allowing it to be seen through with repeated use.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you may add an additional element to your dodge, making it a true counterattack. For example, you could automatically perform a close-range attack of your own after the dodge. The power of your counterattack will always be slightly more than that of the attack you would have received. Alternatively, your dodge could gain the effect of causing nearby enemies to slow down for a few moments. Whilst you may be able to dodge some powerful attacks from enemies far beyond your ability to handle, any counterattack elements on these dodges will fail. For example, an average Fighter would not be able to counterattack Galeem’s universe destroying beams of light. "

Explosion, kinetic energy, really anything can be absorbed and converted by you. You are able to contain and control your powers so that you do not need any technological aid, and with some practice you will even be able to use these powers to fly. The blasts of electricity you can create, while extremely powerful, tend to not be effective on those with extreme durability, as a young Viltrumite would be able to survive you and a veteran would barely feel a tickle. You are weak to crushing attacks and your powers could potentially overload and turn off if you try to absorb something on the level of a nuke in a second. Your powers overloading does not directly deal damage to you but they turn off for a few minutes and ‘reboot’."

An Illusion witch could create multiple duplicates, a healer could repair dozens of minor injuries, or a Plant witch could grow fields of garden variety vegetables.

610,,300,Sorcerous Schooling,Marvel Magic,Modus,"You've had some basic tutoring in magic, granting you enough skill to throw around some spells. Magic is capable of an incredibly wide range of effects, accomplished through an equally diverse number of methods that can range from simply willing something to happen to sacrificing a virgin while chanting a poem as the planets align in a once-in-a-millenia event. However, the principles of most human magic falls under the Three Fold Path, devised by Agomotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme. The Three Fold Path involves drawing power from three primary sources for different effects.

The first of these sources is a sorcerer's personal reserves of magic, called Ego-Centric Magic or Arcanum Ego. One's own life and soul. The amount of power a mortal sorcerer can siphon from themselves without causing harm is relatively limited, but the advantage is that such power can be easily directed by will alone. As a result, the primary use of tapping into one's personal is utilizing various psychic powers. Peering into the minds of others or hypnotizing them with a glance is possible as is exerting one's will on physical objects or prying your spirit from your body to project into the Astral Plane. As a relative beginner in the Art, your strength in these powers will be fairly weak, but can be greatly improved with the right training. And do not think that just because these abilities are weak that they are not useful.

The second source of magic is called Eco-Centric Magic or Arcanum Eco. This magic involves invoking the ambient mystical power of the dimension the sorcerer is currently in, usually through ritual, gesture, or incantation. This encompasses everything from simply drawing magic from the air to tapping into the leylines that cross the worlds. The effects that can be created by utilizing this type of magic is varied – perhaps infinitely so. Everything from conjuring and controlling the elements of nature to eldritch blasts and shields to transforming a man into a frog is possible so long as one knows the proper spells to do so. However, as these spells draw upon the energies inherent to a certain dimension and as such will often be less effective or not function correctly when a sorcerer finds themself in a different world. In addition, though these magicks are varied and powerful, there is a limit to the amount of power a sorcerer can gather and channel without the aid of artifacts or other powers.

Which brings us to the third source of power available to those who walk the Three Fold Path, that of Exo-Centric Magic or Arcanum Exo. This method draws upon mystical beings or forces that dwell in other dimensions, known as the Principalities and Powers. A dangerous and advanced form of magic to those who have not mastered sorcery, but also a potent one. To invoke such a source of power, one must know precise and complicated gestures and incantations which will open a line of contact with the being or force in question after which one may channel to magical power gained into a desired effect. This could be an effect of its own or it could be used to simply enhance another spell, though for either the effect is often flexible, allowing the sorcerer to manipulate it to their will. Such power, however, does not come without due cost. By calling upon these otherworldly sources of powers, one accrues a mystical debt to the being in question, which they may one day come to collect...

Gods and Demons may also use any of these sources, but themselves have greater personal reserves than a mortal sorcerer, which they can invoke to more potent magic comparable to that of Eco or Exo Centric magic, depending on their own power."
611,,300,Dual Frost Mastery ,Dial,Modus,"You have acquired the extraordinary cryokinetic abilities of Luna Snow, granting you control over both dark ice and light ice. With your powers, you can manipulate and create ice of two distinct natures: dark and light. You have complete command over dark ice, capable of shaping it into various forms and unleashing its devastating power. The dark ice holds an inherent malevolence, capable of inflicting horrific damage upon your enemies. You can generate icy projectiles, construct icy barriers, and create icy constructs imbued with a dark aura that can freeze and shatter objects upon contact. Your control over dark ice allows you to manipulate it with precision, granting you an advantage in combat and tactical situations.

In addition to dark ice, you possess the ability to control light ice. This unique form of ice carries a healing and regenerative quality. By channeling your power, you can create light ice that soothes and mends wounds. When touching others with your light ice, you can accelerate the healing process, mending injuries and rejuvenating their vitality. The light ice can provide relief, restore stamina, and promote overall wellness. With your mastery of both dark ice and light ice, you can seamlessly alternate between offensive and defensive strategies, adapting to any situation. You possess an innate understanding of the properties and limits of your ice powers, allowing you to utilize them to their fullest potential. Demonstrate your cryokinetic abilities and become a formidable force on the battlefield, freezing your enemies with dark ice while offering healing and restoration with the power of light ice."
612,,300,Shaman,X-Men the Claremont Years,Modus,"You possess the magical skills and abilities of a Native American shaman/medicine man from these comics. You are able to imbue spirit sticks to help fight Death itself (if you possess the ability to fight Death itself), spirit sight to see magical effects, and a middling skill in sorcery capable of capturing souls to fuel your sorcery, sealing demonic bears, projecting your spirit form into the astral plane, or opening portals to other dimensions. This won’t make you a match for Doctor Strange, or for Limbo Sorcery in a hell dimension or even necessarily in a magical one, but you have some capabilities as a sorcerer.

Alternatively you can have some other form of shamanic practices; perhaps African, Australian, or the Druidic practices of Britain. The overall power of the choice remains the same, roughly equivalent to Forge if he was more willing to use his powers, but the nature and thematics may differ. If you selected Australian magic, for example, you’d likely be well versed in the nature and magic of the dream time, and if you selected African you might share Storm’s mystical ability to sense life.

On that final note for a mere -100 CP, you may instead merely get a reinforcement to your magical energy, enough to let you interact with the sorcerous but no skill or ability as a mage yourself, and the ability to sense life energy and magic. Much like Storm has demonstrated during this time."

Buying this allows you to use it in conjunction with your magic, allowing for faster incantations and preventing others from understanding them. In addition, you also gain a high level of proficiency with spell interception, allowing you to disrupt a remote controlled golem, split weapons with magic flowing through them in half, and cast people in magical flight down, among others. Incantations go much faster now, and you’ll be tongue-tied less often."
616,,300,Musician,Shovel Knight,Modus,You can read and play music perfectly. Does not affect your ability to create it. May be able to buff and debuff others at the cost of mana.
617,,300,Enlightenment,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"You have somehow brought your body, mind, and soul far closer together than they normally would be and have realized that they are one and the same in some ways. This closeness of your three aspects has made it so that where one improves, so do the other two. Training your physical body will also improve on your mind and soul, improving the quality of your soul will improve on your mind and body, and learning and exercising your mind will find your body and soul growing in turn.

Additionally, you are not subject to any sort of ceiling or cap on your growth, always able to find a way to improve in some way, shape, or form. While you may still find diminishing returns, the rate at which such returns diminish will be much less than they otherwise would have been."
618,,300,Transmutation,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"One of the more energetic forms of alchemy, you are able to use symbolic ritual circles to perform Transmutations, an accelerated form of the alchemical processes you can otherwise use. This is largely based on the circle’s construction and your own ability to visualize the final result, including the composition of the materials necessary, though practice can help develop this ability. With a lot of practice, you could, for example, use your arms formed into a ring as a transmutation circle in place of needing to draw a circle.

If you have the Living Alchemy perk, you can use this perk to perform transmutations that fuse two creatures to create a Chimera. This also allows you to heal using the Living Alchemy perk or with your transmutation circles."
619,,300,Living Alchemy,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"You are able to perform certain alchemical processes on living beings, allowing you to take attributes from one creature and apply them to another in order to create what is known as a Chimera. This can even be used on yourself. Given a considerable amount of time and effort, you apply traits from non-creatures such as copper or a lantern, gaining qualities of the object in question or apply the traits to non-creatures. At the highest level, you can imbue supernatural effects into the Chimera to give them some supernatural qualities of their own. 

If you have the Potioncraft perk, you can store these qualities in potion form to create elixirs that offer a permanent benefit of some variety when consumed."
620,,300,Rubedo – The Red Art,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"You are practiced in the unifying Red Art of Rubedo. Rubedo associates with the concepts of unity and harmony, granting the ability to attune and harmonize various concepts and traits together in order to form magical effects, keep balance between opposing forces, and interact with the spiritual as if it were physical in nature. This also allows for the combining of various things, and can be used to combine objects, spells, effects, forces, and even magics to create something new and more powerful. These fusions start out temporary, but with enough practice can be made permanent. See Notes for More Details."
621,,300,Citrinitas – The Yellow Art,Generic Alchemist,Modus,"You are practiced in the refining Yellow Art of Citrinitas. Citinitas associates with the concept of transformation, able to reshape and alter the material of a physical object or being in some manner, from keeping a blade sharp through its use to changing one’s own face to healing wounds. You can also use it to augment or enhance qualities within an object or individual (yourself included) temporarily, bringing out or hiding features, removing or adding impurities into something or someone, or speeding or slowing certain effects or conditions, proportionally increasing or decreasing the effects, respectively. See Notes for More Details."
622,,300,Overcharge,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Modus,"At the cost of extra MP and less fine control, your magic can become much stronger, having a larger range and area-of-effect, and being much more likely to punch through defenses. "
623,,300,Dragon Soul ,King Arthur ,Modus,"You have the soul of a dragon, or at least people seem to think that now. Aside from the cool factor this gives you a greatly increased aptitude for magic of all kinds and, even if only slight, the respect of dragons. Allowing you to talk to even the most haughty of flying lizards without them immediately trying to kill you."
624,,300,Refined Spellcasting,The Dresden Files,Modus,"When I say power isn't everything, there's a reason. Some spellcasters can do a hell of a lot with very little, and you're one of them. Your spellcasting is more energy-efficient, more focused, and a hell of a lot more finely controlled; you throw around laser beams when even wizards would be wasting power on torrents of flame. This is especially good at enhancing your thaumaturgical skills as well; it's not just easier for you to make symbolic links, but you're also better at making small-scale changes do exactly what you want them to when you get to the big-scale effects."
625,,300,Faith’s Reward,Demon's Souls,Modus,When one has faith miracles can happen. Your dedication and faith has allowed for you to understand the blessings of God and as such improved their potency. Due to your dedication your will has been improved and miracles cost less when used.
626,,300,Faithful Incantation,Elden Ring,Modus,"The faithful of the Golden Order hold the pious in high esteem, for it is they who are best able to harness the blessings of the Erdtree-among other forces. And you are saintly and well-endowed with faith enough that whatever you believe in, there is a calmness of thought and purpose that sets you above the rest of your kind. In the context of combat though, this means that you are widely versed in incantations of your choice by the standards of your kind-and those you know are far more effective than in the hands of most. And like the arcane staves prized by sorcerers, some weapons too reward the pious with greater effectiveness on the battlefield. This is not to say you are wilfully ignorant or blind to other worldviews-indeed, your mind is gifted with a great deal of philosophical and abstract reflection that strengthens, not weakens, your faith. And while it may come with little useful knowledge beyond the tenants of that faith, it does make you a gifted orator and speaker as well-whether by captivating others with the surety of your convictions, or articulating compelling arguments for your cause."
627,,300,The Many Arts of War,Elden Ring,Modus,"Any warrior in this day and age should get used to fighting with spear, sword, and just about every weapon outside their preferred one if they’re in it to survive for the long run. But there is a gulf between a jack of all trades and a master of all that you personify. Not only are you even more hardened by war than a typical specimen of your kind, but you have a gift for inventing signature moves and techniques-those which the Tarnished would treasure as Ashes of War used to infuse weapons they wield with the uncanny skill and deadly prowess of other warriors. It is more than an astonishing combat genius and hand-eye coordination that lets you develop flourishing slashes or mighty smashes that can turn the tables on an equally experienced warrior-you’re also gifted at creating and using spells with a martial bent to them, or adding any magical effects you can manifest to weapons of your own-from blood magic to the flames of the giants. To cap it all, you’re also a gifted strategist and tactician with the gumption to lead an army through some of the most hellish wars of the Shattering."
628,,300,Demigod(800),Elden Ring,Modus,"You are no longer mortal. By some twist in your ancestry, you are a demigod-an equal to most of the legendary fingers that ruled this world as Marika’s children. As for precisely how so, by default it is assumed that humans were either counted among those that were part of Godfrey and Marika’s lineage, or Radagon and Marika’s lineage. However, while the circumstances are vague other possibilities exist. There were other powers the Erdtree had to overcome in long war to become the embodiment of order, and perhaps like the mysterious patron of the dragons or the black moon, yours blessed you while maintaining a far more passive role in your life than the Erdtree. Or perhaps one of the Greater Will’s mistakes was leaving a shard of the shattered Elden Ring to bind with you. Within reason, feel free to justify the terms and conditions of your demigodhood.

Your soul carries a Great Rune: A spiritual fragment of the Elden Ring (or a comparable power) that grants you immense physical, spiritual and mystical power. Exactly how those traits are allocated may depend on your temperament and training, and are reflected in the unique Great Rune you bear. But to use Morgott, a demigod of no particular note other than his unbreakable loyalty, with no particular specialisation you may leap over small buildings and remain unscathed by falls off tall towers. In combat your basic blows alone shatter stone, and where others require incantations or sorcery to channel the energy of the Erdtree (or other divine beings) you can infuse your blows and weapons with its energy to augment their damage, or even channel it into manifested weapons and techniques. Though you may still be cut and bleed, the divine vitality of the Erdtree sustains you-granting you an endurance for damage more comparable to monsters of legend than nearly all living men, biological immortality and allowing you to resurrect as Tarnished do without relying on a specific Site of Grace. Each such resurrection may still be taxing and it may be possible to exhaust you into final dissolution, but doing so is a legendary quest in itself for most in this world. But your physical traits pale in comparison to your mystical ones. With the same gravity magics others use to hurl small, localised meteorites with diligent study and training from an experienced tutor you could arrest the movements of the stars in the sky. Others among your peers have invented new schools of magic by communing with strange gods, and in the case of Godwyn wielded the taboo power of death as lightning with ferocity great enough to fell dragons-and precision enough to spare one’s life.

Such is the case for 500 CP, at least. For 800 CP however, you may be something more than a demigod: A true Empyrean, a nascent god akin to Marika with the innate power to forge a new Order-a series of principles and laws that will shape the cosmos, akin to how the Golden Order defined the age Marika ruled. Though physically there is comparatively little difference between you and other demigods, your mystical powers are potent enough to be considered a prodigy among their kind. Even before her apotheosis, Malenia’s Great Rune nourished her health with each wound she inflicted on her enemies. As for Ranni the Witch, simply put her magic is great enough that she can smite Tarnished capable of overcoming all but the greatest divine beings and most unrivalled champions in this world with a thought-and create a completely functional simulacrum of her mother Rennala. Though she seldom exerts such power overtly enough to rate its effectiveness, it seems even she had her limits- for she sought a weapon of terrible power before challenging one of the Two Fingers and their forces, a battle which left her artificial body in seeming disarray. As the abduction of Miquella by Mohg proved, even an Empyrean is not untouchable.

But what truly sets you apart is the potential to bring a different Order to the world and reigning over it as Marika once did. Though you have not achieved full apotheosis, you are quite close to it-just as Malenia was on the cusp of doing so with a third and final blossoming. The process is ill-defined, though it appears Miquella wished to grow a new Erdtree while once her fate was untethered Ranni had to leave for the stars to find her order-which involves returning the black moon to the sky. While technically nothing would prevent you from seeking the throne of Elden Lord and it would likely be an adventure of even greater scope, you have the opportunity to define a new Order on your own terms. What manner of god would be content with merely inheriting the legacy of another?

Requires Demigod(500)(Elden Ring) to Purchase"
629,,300,Dragon Cultist ,Elden Ring,Modus,"When Marika declared that reverence for the ancient dragons was not in contradiction with reverence for the Erdtree, some knightly orders engaged in the worship of those ancient beings who ruled in the age before the Erdtree. It seems you are one of them, for you are gifted and experienced in the incantations of their kind. From calling localised storms or cascades of red lightning in emulation of the ancient dragons, to summoning massive weapons imbued with their power or blasting yourself with their lightning to be empowered, your faith has rewarded you greatly. Moreover, dragons and draconic beings in general find you quite agreeable and attractive in demeanour, and are quick to reciprocate devotion shown towards them. It’s no exaggeration to say one in human guise might fall in love with you after some time together. And by embedding this twist of fate in your history, in future worlds you will be able to develop new miracles based on the dragons you befriend or revere, though as a general rule the power of the dragon corresponds to the power of the incantation."
630,,300,Godskin Inheritor,Elden Ring,Modus,"From a young age, you were cradled in the sacred cloth of the Godskin Apostles-made from supple skin sewn together. Thus were you given the blessings of the Gloam-Eyed Queen, and reared to become the death of the gods themselves. Though the true font of Destined Death has been sealed away, and with it your potential to slay the gods, you retain a measure of control over the black flame that derives from it. Through a series of incantations you can summon weapons or simply conjure plumes of scourging flame against your foes-or reinforce yourself against various attacks. You may discover other uses of the deadly flame with careful study. In addition to this, as a skilled seamster of skin your flaying rites have permitted you to assimilate a degree of inhuman (or whatever you are) physiology, granting you uncanny feats of strength, endurance and dexterity. Your bizarre joints let you wield seemingly asymmetric weapons with such uncanny skill while a traditional blade moves faster than the eye can follow in your hand, and like rubber your flesh can pulse, expand and bend flexibly with speed enough to slam hardened warriors aside-and agility enough to whirl around the battlefield without disorientation. Even with the loss of your patron, there is a reason why few remain willing to root out your kind once and for all."
631,,300,Keeper of Flame ,Elden Ring,Modus,"It matters not if you were one of the Fire Monks in truth, the order of those charged to watch over the Giant’s Flame only to fall into worshipping it. Or merely one trained in their ways, or perhaps cursed by Marika to tend the flame. Great power over the incantations that evoke and command flame is yours now, letting you raise great pillars of flame with gesture or unleash the dread flame of the fell god as a volatile orb. Beyond that, you are extremely resistant to fire to the point you can ignite yourself using mundane flames with little more than superficial damage-and it is cleansing to you, driving out mystical impurities, poisons or disease faster than many medicines. While lessened against magical flames, you’re still far more resistant than most to their ravages. Finally, you are an expert craftsman in creating weapons, armour and even vehicles incorporating the visage of the Fell God of the giants to create artifacts imbued with the flame’s fierce power. From shields that can double as firearms to handheld cannons and autonomous mobile chariots bearing the faces of giants, the temptation of fire within you expresses itself well in both creation and destruction."
632,,300,Eternal Legacy,Elden Ring,Modus,"Three in number are the Eternal Cities, each a refuge for those banished for heresy against the Golden Order. While all are emptied after the Shattering, whether by scholarship or inheritance you’ve retained a wealth of knowledge about their deeds and forbidden discoveries-and you have the excellent patience and memory needed to accurately recall it all. These include the knowledge to manufacture artifacts capable of concealing one fromthe divine’s gaze or disrupting their influence. You are also highly gifted and talented in night sorceries that call on the power of darkness-often in ways highly suited for assassination-ranging from concealment of the body and blade, to launching shards or comets shrouded in umbral power, to creating voids that draw in sorceries and incantations.

But your greatest gift is creating, rebirthing and shaping life in various ways with a combination of magical skill and forbidden knowledge. Creating golem- like creatures or artificial lifeforms is old hat to you; you can create the silvery substrate needed to give life to slime-like Silver Tears and form-emulating Mimic Tears, or repair and bind existing versions of such entities. It goes without saying that you are also able to work this substrate into weapons, granting them a flowing quality. And with greater preparation, magical energy and suitable stock you can create beings of astounding power like the massive Dragonkin soldiers. Changing peasants into lions or bears into men is within your power, so long as they are willing or otherwise unable to physically resist. Who knows what strange and terrible beings you could make, with enough time and effort?

Also, somehow you can domesticate ants and similar beings as pack animals."
633,,300,Spellwright ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"As you may recall from earlier, most spells are stored in specially-prepared runestones, gems, carved talismans and other such forms of storage media when not in use by a mage. Crafting such trinkets by inscribing spells you know is not a trivial task, and this process can take a long time to learn - let alone master. Nonetheless, it is a critical skill for those seeking to trade in magic or expand their repertoire of spells... and now, you too possess it. For the 100CP version of this Perk, you gain the ability to make copies of any Shandalar spell you know, using a wide variety of different techniques. The process takes time, magical power, raw materials and arcane reagents, with the exact difficulty depending on the power and complexity of whatever spell you seek to craft. That said, you are guaranteed to find the kind of suitable reagents or materials that are necessary for the creation of an inscribed spell in any future worlds you might find yourself in. For a total of 300CP, this ability is further enhanced. Not only can you now copy any of your known Shandalar spells, but you also gain the power to convert magical effects from other systems of magic into variants that can be used with Shandalar’s style of magic... as well as, potentially, the reverse. Perhaps you know of certain arcane rituals or potent magical artifacts that might come in useful when powered with the might that comes with wielding mana?"
634,,300,Neoteric,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"Neoterics are sorcerers who were never taught how to harness magic into the existing disciplines, so they simply created their own. This has manifested in two different ways. First, there were some who created original versions of magic. Second, there were those who copied existing disciplines but without certain weaknesses present in the original versions. Taking this CAN manifest in a unique magic, but when taken with pre-existing magic, this will act as a modifier for any magic you have purchased here, effectively removing certain weaknesses and vulnerabilities. For example, when taken with Teleportation, a Neoteric could prove capable of ignoring sigils and defenses that prevent teleportation, or simply perform teleportation at a dramatically reduced cost or strain. An example of a new discipline is the power of Cadaverous Gant, who is able to declare any fixed location to be his home, and while inside, he cannot be killed and can manipulate the place to be however he wishes it to be. For more than one discipline, you’ll have to buy this magic multiple times."
635,,300,Elemental ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"A fairly common powerset, this branch of magic allows you to manipulate the four classical elements in a limited fashion. You can create fire by generating friction, which can be used to conjure throwable fireballs. You can also manipulate existing flames. With air magic, you can use the displacement of the air around you to create powerful pressurized blasts capable of ripping through solid walls. Water can be used to control the atmospheric moisture in your immediate vicinity or manipulate existing bodies of water. Earth magic possesses only a single technique; turning the user into a nigh-indestructible statue. This self-petrification can last an indeterminate amount of time, ranging from minutes to centuries, with the user having no control over the duration."
636,,300,Advanced Elemental ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"More advanced and diverse applications of the standard Elemental toolkit. Where before you could use fire magic to throw fireballs, now you can envelop your body in flames and throw streams of it like a flamethrower. Wind magic can be used to create whirlwinds, deprive people of their oxygen, and read disturbances in the air as a kind of sixth sense. Water magic can be used to casually walk on water and shape it into deadly weapons. Earth magic can now be used to manipulate the ground itself, causing tunnels to cave in, sensing underground objects by extending your mind into the earth, or even creating an imperfect version of the Tunneling magic.

Boosted: Mevolent: With the capstone booster, your command of the Elemental magics is now on par with one of the greatest sorcerers of all time, enhancing both the precision and scale of your magic. Your command over fire is such that you can shape flames into plasma cutters, or command conflagrations that span entire towns. Your command over wind is such that you could take the air inside a person’s lungs and throat and use it to blow them up from the inside. You can also use the power of the wind to fly freely and indefinitely, moving at incredibly high speeds. Your mastery of water magic enables you to draw water from inside the bodies of living beings, desiccating them in an instant. You can also command the water within your body to enhance your physical strength and heal your wounds. And your mastery of earth magic grants you the ability to reshape the world around you on a whim, drawing small mountains out of the earth and using your mind to hurl horse-sized boulders with careless ease.

637,,300,Electrokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Electrokinesis allows the user to manipulate existing sources of electricity, such as power plants or storm clouds, as well as create a small amount of electricity themselves. This can be used to fry most electronics, as well as your enemies.
"
638,,300,Pyrokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Pyrokinesis allows the user to create and manipulate fire and heat, allowing them to throw fireballs and greatly increase the ambient temperature. The user is also immune to fire and most forms of heat; not to the point of being able to fly through the sun, but they could fly much closer than most spacecraft.
"
639,,300,Deviceless ,Lyrical Nanoha,Modus,"Device? Who needs one of those? While you won’t have the calculations and aid of said Device, you know how to use the magic of this world by hand alone, and have a talent for doing so. You might have a harder time against someone using an advanced enough Device, and by-hand magic can be a little more costly in mana, but you don’t have to worry about being caught off guard without your gear anytime soon.
"
640,,300,Conniving Corruptor ,Generic MG,Modus,"Rather than going for a direct approach, you go for the sneaky approach. This package covers destruction of magical effects, as well as hostile manipulation of magical effects. Turn a summon against its creator, or just cause a forcefield to fall apart. Put in the time and practice and be able to pick magical locks, or spoof the identification systems on artifacts.

With decades of practice towards one goal, you could alter the type of energy someone has or alter the way their mind works.
"
641,,300,Siren’s Song ,Peter Pan,Modus,"The voice of a mermaid is beyond measure, and can make men jump off sharp rocks to hear the melody up close. Your voice and song is especially gifted for a mermaid, and you can enchant the hearts of victims with but a few verses. You gain extra power under the moonlight, and it is said that those who hear the mermaids’ song under the moon will follow the song to the source and do anything the mermaids wish, never to be seen again. With particularly weak-minded saps, you can completely mesmerize them and implant suggestions in their brain that they will believe that they thought up themselves. Furthermore, mermaid songs at night often contain potent curses that vary between the victims; pirates hallucinate and see old enemies, birds and other flying beings start flying upside down as they lose their sense of up and down, and fairies transform into bats. For the magic to take effect, the victims must be able to hear the song; if they are able to avoid hearing it, they won’t be ensnared. The range of the song depends on the acoustics, but at most has at most the radius of half a mile. Also, the strength of the effect is split between all listeners, and therefore dilutes with a large audience. On the other hand, every voice added to the chorus strengthens the song’s power, and moonlight strengthens the magic night effects. Also, since mermaid songs are never dampened by water or storm, the songs will retain their full intensity even at the bottom of the sea or in the middle of a hurricane.
"
642,,300,Mage ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"You are able to wield the powers of magic, shaping it and sending it to rain ruin down on your foes or succour your allies. In this world though, you drawn power from the winds of magic, and while they always blow, sometimes they blow enough for you to cast spells enough to shatter mountains, sometimes you will struggle to light a candle.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or platemail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.
"
643,,300,Wraff of da Godz! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"This magic is extremely unique in the fact it is harnessed by Orc and Goblin Shamans not from the winds of Magic, but from the power of a Waaagh! itself and the individuals within it. The magic channelled by Goblin Shamans and Orc Shamans, is very different however (Little Waaagh! and Big Waaagh! respectively). Orc magic mainly stomps on, punches, shoots at, and generally is rather violent towards the enemy. Goblin magic, however, is far sneakier, tricking and enfeebling the foe and making Orc and Goblin soldiers better, occasionally resorting to a few offensive damage spells."
644,,300,Lich Wards ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"You know how to create and use the magic wards that John Darling (now called the Lich Boy) uses to guard his secret lair. Unlike the Tylwyth Teg which are attuned to nature, these wards are more cut-and-dry, academic-style magic, though still capable of manipulating the elements. Effects from these runes/glyphs when triggered include but are not limited to: negating all magic in the area, causing fire (under daylight) or necrotic (under moonlight) damage, teleporting people away, and dropping the temperature to below freezing. With this perk, you also gain the ability to more easily build structures into surfaces that would otherwise be difficult, such as a dungeon under a sandy beach."
645,,300,Magnifying Magic ,Undertale,Modus,"Your magic is exceptionally potent- Even compared to other monsters. All of your magic abilities purchased in this jump are amplified by this perk twofold, to the point where even your basic White Magic attacks are complex and capable of causing potent damage to a potential foe. Even magic purchased outside of this jump is slightly amplified by this ability, if only in raw power. In addition, movement-restricting magic becomes much more potent.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires You’re Blue Now - Undertale first.)

With You're Blue Now, you can manipulate your opponent's gravity based on your perspective- You can force them to the ground, send them flying up in the air, or careening to the left or right. While this technique is potent, it does have a maximum range of around 10 meters, at which point your opponent just lands on the air as if it were a solid surface. It's also very draining and can exhaust the user quickly if overused.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires It’s Not Easy Being Green - Undertale first.)

With It's Not Easy Being Green, your opponent gains two independent shields they must manipulate- And your ability to output attacks doubles. You may now attack from two directions at once, forcing your opponent to concentrate on two avenues of attack instead of just one.

(CG Note: The next part of this perk requires Purple Suits You - Undertale first.)

With Purple Suits You, your opponent's movement is further restricted to the intersections and vertices of your web- Attempting to move along the web instead zips them to the next intersection. Use this to your advantage and set up traps for them."
646,,300,In all Forms​ (25%) ,Persona 4,Modus,"You have gained power over this world, allowing you to use 25% of your [powers that could only be used in certain conditions] (such as only being available in the Cognitive World) in any situation. Each purchase will boost the percent of the conditional power by 15% (up to 100%). In other worlds this would mean you could do things like still access some (or potentially all, if you bought this enough times) of your magical powers even in an anti-magic or null-magic zone."
647,,400,Barrelmancy,Baldur's Gate 3,Modus,"Also called cratemancy, boxmancy and chestmancy, this is a forbidden art that can only
be learned with getting extremely familiar with the games made by Larian Studios. Luckily for
you are already a master of it. Usage of barrels, crates, chests, boxes, tanks and any kind of
containers as weapons of untold destruction has been made available to you.
First of all, you will find that you can stuff a lot more things than you normally would
inside of these storage units, around triple give or take, and they can even contain more
hazardous stuff without any repercussions to its constructed material and to people carrying
them. This doesn’t grant them improved durability against outside forces mind you. Now the
combined weight of this units are normally quite heavy, but they only become half as heavy for

you to lift and move. Meaning that if these units were to be dropped on someone’s head, they
would hurt quite badly. Also, this makes them a decent choice for carrying stuff around.
This perk doesn’t just end there, oh boy you’d be in for a surprise. Second application
for this perk is that any barrels, tanks or similar objects that hold specifically explosive stuff can
be perceived as just a normal décor, when placed by you to their intended destinations. You
could store a barrel filled up to its lid with smokepowder and place it near someone you want
gone. They won’t get suspicious about it, not in the slightest bit. Oh, but do keep in mind that,
this doesn’t immediately end the hostilities between you and them. They keep on being hostile
even if you place these containers, just so they don’t notice it if they are explosive or not, and
they don’t become hostile to you if they were passive in the first place. Oh, and containers
explode deals way more damage than they should have, around %50 to %100 more effective or
so depending on the quality of the explosives.
Third and final application is even more creative in usage. You could stack crates and
boxes on top of each other almost indefinitely and with no trouble. Climbing these crate towers
are not challenging to you in the slightest. Any ranged attacks that are made from these towers
against enemies on a lower ground than you are a sure hit for you. It isn’t guaranteed to bypass
all of their armor and hurt them, but it will strike true regardless. While you are standing on top
of them, these containers are nearly immune to all forms of damage. Only attacks of extreme
potency (say a disintegrate spell aimed right at the tower) can destroy only portions of it. Have
fun now."
648,,400,Improved Innate Magic,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Modus,"Magic has costs, and even the smallest spells can
quickly drain your Zeon, leaving you empty. No more. Spells of sufficiently low cost can be cast
without touching your reserves, the Flow of Souls washing through your body, and shaping itself
with the barest hint of your will. Though any mage eventually learns to cast the lesser spells
without calling upon their reserves, the spells you can cast without cost are twice the strength of
theirs."

great numbers of them to you. Heal a sword-wound before it’s been fully-made. Your
animal form may be no larger than an elephant. If your animal form is smaller than
this, you may transform into a single instance of this size. If your animal form is
smaller than a human, you may transform into a number of them whose total mass

for those actively imposed by an enemy. This does not guarantee success and will not make the
impossible possible, only that you do everything at your absolute best condition, time and place. For
example, you would always cast a spell at your full power and with a full incantation, even if you
were in an area that weakened your magic and did not have the time to do an incantation, though a

It would suck if your powers, abilities, and weapons also discriminated; I would dare say that it might be a bit hypocritical of those gifts. So, your powers don't discriminate unless you want them to do so per their normal function. Have a spell that can only resurrect or heal humans? Now it will bring back dogs, cats, dinosaurs, elves, robots, even gods if they are within your realms of power, whatever else you want to include within a category.

removed from the cycle. The source of much of the Quincy’s woes with the Shinigami but also quite
neglected in study. Could not this basic trait be expanded or mastered further? Having taken up this
task, you found much greater control over the purifying powers of Heilig Pfeil. Not only are you now
able to control this destructive aspect of your natural Quincy power, limiting it to no longer cause
soul death, you can also spread it to other abilities or attacks you use. Your Quincy energy can easily
suffuse and empower your bare hands, makeshift weapons or unrelated magic. Not only does this
confer the soul destroying properties, it allows for easy spiritual empowerment. It’s not even
impossible to teach other Quincy this control, perhaps opening a path to peace most have

671,,400,Quincy Magic,Bleach,Modus,"The Quincy have their own magic, far more developed than the brutish Hollows yet not as long lived
as the Shinigami’s system. Instead, the Quincy have played to their strengths, relying on purity and
external power. Their direct spells represent the former, as Quincy spells are largely made and
perform best with the most straightforward effects. A spell to attack is designed to disintegrate, annihilate or destroy utterly. A defending spell is a pure shield of light, with all power directed to a great shield. Light and power are the core tools and you work well with them, being an
accomplished expert with the style. You’re well taught, with two dozen spells or so for both offense
and defense, with a smattering of what supporting magic the Quincy have created. You’ll find them
most useful in direct intentions. But Quincy magic is more than just holy light. Perhaps the most useful part is their ability to store
and condense Reiryoku, into not just containers known as Ginto but also weapons like the deadly
Seele Schneider blades. You’re a more than capable craftsmen with these blessed tools and can use
Ginto to greatly increases the power of many spiritual spells or techniques. With a little tinkering, you might even find ways to apply the principles of Ginto tubes to other magics you perform, storing and boosting power. A little antiquated, modern Quincy generally rely on their own direct power, but both spells and magical tools are more than powerful enough to aid even a Stern Ritter in combat."
672,,400,Wonder Wiped,Bleach,Modus,"An adaptation to one’s opponent is a terribly Hollow thing to have. Predators and cowards both,
leaving a foe weak before a fight is often far preferable to matching and surpassing them in power. A
unique ability developed in your body that allowed you to seal away aspects of an opponents power,
in return for a sealing of parts of yourself. By temporarily limiting access to an ability or trait you
possess, you can prevent an opponent from accessing an ability of choice. A powerful Zanpakuto
could be sealed away forcibly, unable to release, at the cost of a great deal of your energy and
perhaps several physical or mental abilities. The use of an arm or your senses. While raw Reiryoku is
the simplest measure to compare, it isn’t terribly useful against those more powerful than you. Sealing away other aspects, even things as vital as memory, reason or intelligence can vastly increase your sealing ability. Even the Captain Commander’s own Ryujin Jakka was sealed beyond his ability
with enough sacrifices. Once you lift the seal on the opponent, or they die, your own sealed
sacrifices also return. "
673,,400,The Visionary,Bleach,Modus,"The power of imagination. The user has the power to turn fantasy into reality, manifesting their imagination onto the world. This can create, alter and even destroy. New sapient
life brought into existence, an opponent’s bones turned into cookie bread, an annoying foe made to
suddenly experience every illness known to man at once in their late stages. The user can imagine
that they are healed of all wounds and it becomes true, imagine that they are in a different location
and move there. If the wielder has not enough power, spiritually or with the ‘force of imagination’ then they can simply create a clone of themselves, who then contributes their own imaginary force. However, there are critical weaknesses to this ability. The first is that it generally requires constant
attention for changes that are actively in effect. Without at least a small amount of focus, many
changes will revert in time. Living beings may fade away, summoned elements dissipate into the air
and enhancements to your body revert. Effects as a result of an imaginary construct do note fade, such as damage or death dealt by a fictional lifeform or the healed wounds you imagined. Secondly, this Schrift makes no differences between what you imagine to use with the Schrift and
what you don’t. Anything imagined will be made reality, if it is within your imaginary power, even your own death. It may be possible to de-activate the Schrift and avoid this constant threat, but the
result would be the de-activation of all current imaginations. Finally, the Visionary is limited by your imagination. If you cannot clearly imagine it, you cannot work
with it. You might be able to increase your spiritual power to match a terrifying foe but forgetting to
increase your body’s durability or being simply unable to comprehend such a body would leave you
weak or destroyed by your own newly gained spiritual power. Similarly, imaginary objects that
cannot be fully pictured will fail to form or, if imagined in a ineffective way, may just fall apart. While
you can make fantasy into reality, your creations and effects will be subject to reality. Things that
cannot exist in reality at all or in their current form tend to fall apart immediately.

a high degree of skill with the various racial techniques available only to Hollow energies, as well as
several variant techniques for each. The powerful Cero blast, the quicker Bala shots, the ranged
sensing Pesquisa, Garganta for travel, even the protective Negacion mostly used by Gillians by
instinct was developed into useful techniques. It’s likely you have a fair number of other spell-like
abilities similar to Kido or Quincy spells, if in fitting with a more Hollow theme. However, given the
lack of development in this field, it’s quite difficult to place mastery of these techniques on the same
level as mastery of Kido. But even the most magically inclined Hollow is well used to fighting with
tooth and claw. Most of what you know is at least combat viable, even things like Negacion turned to often
horrifying defensive use, and you can usually get a lot more power from already combat useful
techniques. You also possess a ‘trump card’ spell of sorts, a supreme version of an existing racial
magic. As simple as an overwhelmingly efficient Cero that, while physically draining to use, allows for
vastly magnified power to be unleashed. Or as complex as forming Negacion into threads of energy

incantation without losing much of their power, casting several Kido at once by speaking part of
each incantation in sequence, delaying kido spells and reciting incantations well in advance or even
empowering spells already cast by repeatedly reciting their words. You’re quite capable with all
these alterations and more, with the spells you know already. Applying them to newly learned magic
is usually a swift and simple process. This meta-magic styling has also taught you a often forgotten part of casting, which is the training to do so against primarily melee-using foes. You’ve got the training needed to capably contend with
similar skilled warriors in close range despite relying mostly on magic. Putting your spells to use at
the right time, using them to dodge swift blows and controlling the battlefield. It’s not a great

Aries/The Gigas: You focus your energies into your body, stimulating rapid growth. A single element of your body, perhaps your height, or your weight, or a single body part has grown by nearly half of its original state. Your appearance also adjusts slightly to suit your aesthetic preferences.

Taurus/Walker of the Wheel: The rudimentary elements of fire, water, wind, and earth become a part of your being, and you are more resistant to spells of those elements.

Gemini/The Death Seraph: You summon three pillars, each with a woman tied to it. While the wailing coming from the three women is hideous, they cannot be freed as they create a ritual ground. Ghouls emerge from this ritual ground until the women’s magickal strength give out not too long after being summoned.

Cancer/The Condemner: Tapping into the gravity around a specific area, you can concentrate it into the shape of a well. The well will steadily draw enemies and objects towards it and attempts to pin them in place. You can only maintain a single well, due to the inherent instability of the magick.

Leo/Bringer of Order: You’ve mastered the ability to meld physical and magickal forces together, incorporating a small element of both into your physical and magickal attacks. Though magickal barriers may still stop you, a small part of your blow seems to slip through.

Virgo/Fallen Angel: You gain a magic barrier of light that can block out some minor physical attacks. When it shatters, nearby enemies are blinded.

Libra/Judge-Sal: The air itself is under your control within a small area around you. As long as you channel the spell, you may shift the atmosphere in your small domain as you feel like. The more extreme the shift, the more energy it will require to change and maintain.

Scorpio/The Impure: You can pollute water by touching it, but the larger the body of water, the longer it will take to pollute it entirely.

Sagittarius/The Whisperer: You can peer into the surface level thoughts of a person you make eye contact with. Mostly this will be rather mundane details.

Capricorn/The Wroth: With a furious roar, you call down bolts of lightning to shower the immediate area around you. When you dedicate more magick to this, the bolts increase in size and frequency, but thankfully, they never strike you.

Aquarius/The Darkening Cloud: You can conjure monsoons at will. The size of the monsoon is dependent on how long you channel this for.

Pisces/The Corrupt: Once per day, you can dominate an individual to act out your command. This individual may attempt to resist this – but success is dependent on how strong they are. Does not work on individuals stronger than you.

Any being connected to you via soul or mind that is aware of this connection can transmit their emotions and thoughts through to you, as a form of telepathy, but the main portion of this power is allowing you to take the emotions they send to strengthen you in various ways. Take their rage to increase your strength, happiness for speed, sadness for durability, with various other emotions producing other potential boosts and effects for you. You can, of course, prevent a being from using this connection for their own ends, so you have no worry of being possessed or corrupted using this.

You may force this connection if you’re aware of them and they aren’t of you to gain an emergency powerup with whatever emotions they’re feeling at the moment, at the cost of them potentially learning about you and the connection with the chance increasing the more liberally you use it.

This perk brings a similar sense of epicness to your life, improving to at least some degree all other perks in this Jump as you fight harder, sing better, see deeper and craft better items.

More, it adds some more... abstract qualities. An ordinary warrior cannot batter a howling storm into submission, or punch someone so hard cows give virgin birth hundreds of miles away. But with this perk, you can. It’s a new and altogether more legendary way of seeing and interacting with the world."
689,,400,Rebound,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Your elemental shields are more powerful than others, strong enough not only to hold up to enemy assaults but to send some of their power back at the one who cast it. If an enemy launches an elemental spell at you while your elemental shields are up the damage you would have received rebounds harming the caster. This will not send all of the damage back to them however, merely a portion.

690,,400,Targetted Geomancy,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"Normally the spells of a geomancer are only avle to be cast upon themselves or their loupon for the effects of the spell to radiate out from them, you however have achieved a bit more freedom in your understanding of geomancy. You have the ability cast your geomantic spells upon any person, creature, or object and have the effects radiate out from it in a bubble around it a few meters in diameter. Spells cast this way do not have quite as much power as if you had cast them via a loupon or upon yourself however this opens your utility of use up by a large amount. No longer do you have to place a loupon just behind a monster and hope it doesn’t run outside of the aoe, now you can target the creature itself and watch as it drags a bubble of enfeebling, crippling magic along with it.

Taking the art of dancer magic and bending what you know of other systems you can now cast spells completely through the use of dance, dance a samba buff your friends, perform a flourish to harm your foe, and maybe perhaps one day you may dance a dance that scorches the land. Spells to buff others are much easier to perform as dances often requiring a few simple steps however spells cast from other systems in this way often scale in complexity with the power of the spell."
692,,400,Cost of a Calling,Final Fantasy XI,Modus,"The Avatars of the elements in Vanadiel are part of this world but do not directly take part on their own, due to their dreamlike qualities they require the aid of a summoner to manifest in this world and show a fraction of their awesome might, unfortunately the amount of mana required is staggering both in the original summoning and in the steady trickle of mana that is required to sustain them while they continue to manifest. However there are ways to get around this steady stream of mana, normal summoners would try to minimize this with equipment in an effort to keep their avatars present for longer. You however have a much easier time of it, after the intitial summoning all of your summoned beings require only half the amount to keep their manifestations as they normally would."

Spells to buff others are much easier to play as tunes often requiring a few simple notes however spells cast from other systems in this way often scale in complexity with the power of the spell."
694,,400,Briah(Fourth),Dies Irae,Modus,"Eventually, you will reach the Briah stage and unlock your Creation Figment. This is a unique power that matches your deepest desire, as that is what is being projected onto the world around you. Summoned with a chant a few sentences long, this power will be decided in the following section. You will be able to freely choose what your power is and it may grow in strength over time as you gain more souls, the following section simply decides the limits you may operate within for that choice. Do note that while the strength of your power will grow with your Ewigkeit, the actual abilities it possesses will not change or have new powers added through this growth, save for if you reach the Atziluth stage. 

Type
There are two types of powers. Hegemony/Hadou and Transcendence/Gudou. Hegemony powers come from people whose desires are focused on the world around them. A man who wished to experience one perfect moment forever would be a Hegemony type and might gain the ability to slow or even stop time. Hegemony powers are thus those that are directed towards the world around the user. Transcendence powers come from those whose deepest desires are focused on themselves and what they can do. A boy who wished to never be touched might gain the power to be faster than any opponent. These powers are those that alter the self or internal of the user. Hegemony types are the most likely to become Gods, given they naturally trend towards being more ambitious, but Hegemony Gods cannot co-exist with any other God of the same type. Choose whichever type most fits your own deepest desire. 

Levels
What your power can do is up to you, within the limits of your Type, but how much it can do will be decided here. Not all powers are equal and there are some who possess greater Creation Figments than those stronger than them. A girl who can create and control fire can’t be said to have a power equal with a man who can kill anything he touches that has a history. The below levels will indicate the breadth and depth of the power you can choose. 

Fourth
The final level, allowing your power to now cover multiple innately powerful effects at once. Only a single example of this level exists, Reinhard Heydrich’s own Briah. Named Gladsheimr, its effects will be described below to detail the level of power this option grants. This power allowed Reinhard to summon a golden castle the size of a city wherever he pleased, the mere act of summoning tearing out and feeding to him the souls of any mundane man for several kilometres around the castle. Reinhard is aware of and can control every inch of the castle if he focuses on it and the castle distorts distance and focus on those around it, making it nigh-impossible to get to unless Reinhard allows it. The castle itself is able to teleport to almost any location in the multiverse, allowing the user to use it as transit to any place he wishes or to simply detach himself and the castle to be outside of reality. The castle may transform into a gigantic skeleton that towers over even mountains, with its foot falls generating greater energy than any earthquake in the past 70 years and possessing laser attacks that can wipe out entire countries at once. Anyone killed within the castle or by the users’ relic will be made into a part of Reinhard’s Legion, granting him all of their memories, knowledge and powers. He is also able to summon them as Einherjar, loyal warriors to fight alongside him and whom cannot die. Even if their bodies and souls are destroyed, they will reappear a few hours later in the castle or instantly if Reinhard focuses on them. His Einherjar are every bit as strong as they were in life, possessing all the equipment and knowledge they did and may even grow stronger over time, but are forcibly bent to be loyal to his will unless he desires otherwise. 

This is the level of power that this option allows you to create.

Rather than expend all your resources on casting one big spell, why not just let a smaller spell grow over time to be what you need? Your magic now becomes greater as time passes, growing stronger and better rather than weakening and rotting away. It won’t make spells that have limited durations last forever but those that would naturally decay over time and use would no longer do so, nor is there any upper limit to how great a spell might eventually become. Given the timeframes this works on, don’t expect to see significant increases on anything less than a timescale of months to years. It’s for the long term planners, not the wild beasts of battle. "

You are able to take techniques from one discipline and apply them to a similar discipline without any loss in effectiveness, even if it seemingly should not make sense. Take the Iaido arts of kendo and utilise them with a guillotine that extends from your arm, using yourself as the sheath in this case. Take the techniques to forge a sword and apply them to building or armour construction with every bit as much effectiveness. You are able to apply these differing ideas to differing disciplines so long as they are in the same general field and have them work out."
697,,400,Nabong Needle Ryu,The God of High School Jump,Modus,"Created by Na Bong-Chim, this style is weaponised acupuncture, fighting using the pressure points of the enemy and yourself. Working with both needles and bare fingers, the user can weaken his opponents, stop their bodies from functioning right or cause paralysis, cause massive internal damage with light pokes and manipulate the body’s functions such as stopping blood flow or making the enemies body explode from the inside out. The art also focuses on how the user can enhance their own body. Thus it can neutralise incoming techniques that rely on pressure points or similar parts, stop the user’s ability to feel pain, boosting their strength and speed greatly and allowing them to fight under even heavy wounds to their body and the greatest technique of the Nabong Ryu- the removal of the body’s limiters. By releasing a certain point in the brain, this technique multiplies the physical powers and life energy that their body can output but at the cost of immense rebound damage to their body once the limiter removal runs out. To use this technique requires the consumption of a Sage Pill, a mystical fruit from the Sage Realm, something that threatens the lives of even a human on the level of The Six, as it was only meant for the consumption of Demons and Gods."
698,,400,Heavenly Arts,The God of High School Jump,Modus,"A supernatural martial art created by the demons of the Sage Realm. The Heavenly Arts has a heavy focus on Ki techniques, with very little in the way of close combat despite its status as a Martial Art, seeming almost more like magical spells. Ki blasts, techniques to create and manipulate the various elements, teleportation and techniques to create shields and wards are examples of what the Heavenly Arts can do in combination with your life energy."
699,,400,"Sphere in One Hand, Sphere in Another",Final Fantasy X,Modus,"As it stands, there’s so little that is known about the dress spheres that there’s no way of telling whether they are being wielded properly – and what they are truly capable of. But you’ve had first-hand experience at using them, and you should know very well that there’s always room for improvement.

Rather than being limited to the power of a single dress sphere, you can use two of them simultaneously, mixing and matching the abilities of both. Do note that hybridizing abilities like this will likely result in a weakened outcome. You can’t seriously expect everything to mix well can you?"
700,,400,Celestial Mirror,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"Long ago, it was believed that seven luminaries possessed weapons which were peerless in their respective categories. Though the legends themselves have been lost to time, the weapons still exist – as does a method to obtain them. But power never comes without a sacrifice or two...

You possess the ability to enhance your weapon to a remarkable degree, by allowing them to absorb experience and grow naturally. However, to facilitate this growth, not only will the strength of your weapon decrease while it is growing, the power of its effects will also decrease. Naturally as you may have suspected, the only way for a weapon to gain experience is to emerge victorious from a fight...you have a long road ahead of you Guardian. It’s probably best to start with some easy fiends.

You can return your weapon to full strength at any time, but its growth will stop while in this state."
701,,400,Understand Your Powers ,Chainsaw Man,Modus,"You can’t just swing your weapons around, you’ve gotta apply yourself! You know this well, often finding new ways to utilize your abilities that others would think impossible or impractical. If you’d think it’d work that way, it probably will. Not only does this make you more creative, it actually expands the possibilities your abilities have within a sorta reasonable limit. You might be able to use your chainsaw arm’s chains to grapple even if you couldn’t control it before, or propel yourself with a contact explosion ability in a way that’d be physically impossible or just impractical."
702,,400,New Founder,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"While you might not be quite the sort of genius the Three Founders of the Grail System were, you're no slouch in the ritual department. Making rituals is a breeze for you and those you personally make often turn out to be half again as good as you'd expect. It's dealing with stuff that already exists where you come into your own. Loopholes, tricks and abuses of the system just seem to pop up in your mind whenever you're working with a magical ritual someone else has created. Every now and then, you'll even find yourself being led to loopholes you had no way of knowing about, stuff that needed knowledge you couldn't have had till then. It's nothing to worry about. "
703,,400,The Family Art        ,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"The true wealth of every Magus family is their magecraft specialisation. The discipline of magecraft that they have spent generations researching, studying, experimenting on and utilising. It's your inheritance or perhaps, your spoils of war or thievery. However you came to possess the knowledge, you have a few decades of training in a magic specialisation of your choice, enough to make you an expert, if human, user of the art, something along the lines of Rin with her gems, though you are still many years from being a master. Maybe you'll even make a breakthrough that surprises those vaunted masters. A list of canon and suggested non canon specialisations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times. 

Magus Heir origin takers get a free version of this perk for one specialisation of their choice. This free perk is much weaker than the above, giving only a few years training in the chosen discipline, not much more then is needed to understand and use the basic functions and concepts of what you picked.

704,,400,Magical Modifiers,Elantris,Modus,"The different magics of Sel are more like languages than anything else. To reproduce an effect, one simply needs to know the corresponding symbol. Unfortunately, this can make certain spells feel standardized and rigid. Thankfully, you’ve learned to speak this language with a bit more nuance. Like Raoden and ShaiLu, you’ve discovered how to modify the script of your spells to increase either your potency or precision. You can’t do both at once, but you’ll be far more versatile than the vast majority of your fellow practitioners. Whether you’re conjuring fire to light a candle or blast down a wall, you know how to adjust your magical constructions to fulfill their intended purpose. Following your time on Sel, you’ll find yourself able to apply similar modifiers to systems of magic you have access to, expanding the parameters of normal spells to fit new situations."
705,,400,Reliance ,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"At some point, you travel and live with the same people for so long that you might as well refer to yourselves as a single coherent unit. That bond that you had forged with your companions before may as well become an unbreakable foundation now. Whether in battle or outside of battle, you’re there for each other.

In battle, the presence of all of you together is enough to warp reality a little. That Eidolon that could devour hundreds? You’ll stand a fighting chance against him. Maybe the outcome won’t change, but at least you’ll get a shot as long as you’re with your party. Should you wish it; any damage you take will be evenly split between all your companions present. Additionally, should you wish it; you can pool your magic banks together as one and cast spells freely.

Outside of battle, you can freely teleport yourself to a companion in need of help, or call a companion to you if you need help. The teleport drains a substantial amount of energy dependent on the distance traveled. When there’s a friend in need – you’ll be there, even if it means getting there completely exhausted and in dire need for sleep. After all, that’s what friends are for right?"
706,,400,Doublecasting ,Final Fantasy IX,Modus,"Mass producing Black Mages gives any army a convenient advantage in terms of expendable magic resources – but if each mage can only cast one spell at a time, eventually one does have to consider: “Does this extra Black Mage cost so much more that we can’t afford it – even if it means an extra spell?” But what if a Black Mage could cast an equivalent of two spells each?Would that not instantly double an army’s firepower?

After working out some bugs, some of the later Black Mage models were able to consistently fire off doppelgangers of spells they cast. You too, will be able to do the same thing. The doppelganger still costs a small portion of energy and has a somewhat weakened effect, but the second spell will fire off nearly instantly without consideration for cooldown."

708,,400,"Fire, Brimstone, and Fervor",Cult of the Lamb,Modus,"The magic of this world, known by its inhabitants as curses, is now yours to wield. Manifested from fervor, an ethereal substance generated by one’s conviction to their beliefs. Fervor is passively regenerated over time so long as one’s faith holds strong, and the fervor of others can be torn from their cooling corpses and used to power one’s own curses. This perk conveys the ability to use this magic, but true mastery will come with practice."
709,,400,Blood of the Lamb,Cult of the Lamb,Modus,"Power requires sacrifice! A core tenet of all those guided by ambition. Perhaps however, you may take it more literally than most. From now forward, any powers or skills you possess can be augmented temporarily by sacrifice. The nature of this sacrifice is mutable, and anything you can think to give can be given so long as it is something important to you. Precious memories, blood from your veins, even people you hold dear. For that which exists in the physical world, you must be the willing hand that executes your will, taking the knife to the throats of your loved ones and destroying or forsaking your possessions. For more ethereal matters such as memories or powers, so long as you are resolute and certain in your intent, you will find them fading from you. Regardless, anything you choose to sacrifice can never be reclaimed. The more you care about what you lose, the more power it will bestow, and the longer it shall remain with you. Melting your coins to slag may grant you enough strength to see your next swing with a weapon shearing through armor, while slitting the throat of your beloved would see you capable of destroying a small army singlehandedly."
710,,400,Devoid of Ego: Clothing of Convictions,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"Normally, the thought of renouncing a Commandment, or taking a small Commandment, is not something that any individual would even consider. That is because the Vow taken in a Commandment is a declaration from the individual to the World, an expression of their deepest convictions and thoughts engraved on the Avesta. As such, renouncing a Commandment or taking them lightly would be as renouncing one’s core ideals or just taking these strong beliefs lightly.

It is a thought that normally only the hollow Man-Eating Demons would be able to practice. While you don’t require to be as devoid of regular emotions as they are, you are able to take their same approach to Commandments, and as such you are able to take Hollow Clothing Commandments. That is, you can take small-scale and temporary Commandments in exchange for lesser effects.

These include vows such as renouncing your sight for a few moments in order to gain a short- scale future sight or vowing not to move for the next three minutes in order to gain teleportation for a minute. These Commandments will never be able to reach the potency of a punishing Commandment that completely directs the life of a person, but they grant a great variety to someone’s arsenal for just small inconveniences. 

In future worlds, whenever you can gain a power based on your convictions and ideals, you will also be able to take temporary and lesser powers by ‘dressing’ yourself under limited and hollow ideals."
711,,400,Original Mystic: Primitive Power,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"Appreciation for an opponent’s power and talent, regardless of their side, is a common trait among the warriors of the Evil side. And what better way to show your respect for an enemy’s style than through pure imitation? You have a natural talent for analyzing and dissecting the techniques of your enemies after crossing blades just for a few minutes, before being able to start to reproduce them on your own. It may not be a perfect reproduction, but when it comes just to pure combat styles, and disregarding actual supernatural abilities, you are able to take them apart and assimilate them into your own style as easy as you walk."
712,,400,Heretic Yazata: Glitching Technique,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"Sometimes, in order to shorten the gap between those powerful Daeva, one needs to get a little unconventional. And you are a master when it comes to creating and performing unexpected, and usually extremely dangerous, combinations of powers and items. Some may call you a madman, but no one may deny the results you bring. You can forcibly mix two or more abilities that were not meant to work together, creating a new technique with devastating results.

Some examples of these are the techniques developed by the Jet-Black Warrior, Magsarion: Using several blessings of defense, which increases your weight, and teleportation, which basically makes it,so you move through distance in no time, to turn yourself into a human-shaped cannonball that can destroy a mountain. Forcibly transmitting an excessive regeneration via combining several blessings of regeneration and offense, so your enemy’s regeneration gets overwhelmed, and they begin to collapse. And many other combinations that you will be able to come up with in no time using your own unique abilities.

While these techniques may be seen as suicidal by most, you also have a knack for finding ways to ignore the more lethal or even debilitating damage from them, albeit you may not be able to always escape unscratched, and this is usually limited for yourself."
713,,400,Commandment: Vow(Greater),Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"The basis of most supernatural abilities in the First Heaven, the Commandment appears as a self-imposed limitation taken before the Avesta. It is a declaration against the world that reflects the warrior’s personality and ideology. By swearing to God to live in a certain way, you receive a boon in exchange.

The nature of this boon varies greatly, since in the end it is up to the Truth to determine such a thing. Normally, a very restrictive bond would result in a greater power. Things such as vowing to always achieve victory, refusing any kind of companionship and living in solitude, or always fighting any being that establishes mutual recognition with one’s full strength. But there are other factors that may influence this result, such as the person’s own disposition and ideals. For example, a gentle being who took a vow of solitude would see a greater boon than those who are loners by nature. But also, those with great wills will see their Commandments also bear great results if it matches their nature, such as someone with a massive thirst for battle limiting themselves to not take any action that isn’t related to killing after establishing mutual recognition when another. And lastly, there is the own opinion of the Truth herself, who may grant better boons if she simply sees fit to do so, whether as part of her own plans or simply due to her own amusement or personal opinions of the person in fact.

The vow you take is very important, because breaking it will incur a divine punishment. When this break is unintentional, this may result in your death via divine punishment, enforced by the Law of the Truth. But when this breakthrough of your Commandment results from a willing act, an event known as Forced Falling Down occurs, in which the breaker is forced to switch sides, resulting in a change of personality and power, almost always for the worse.

While this indeed a dire thing, it is not as if most Commandments don’t have loopholes around their limitations. For example, Quinn’s Commandment makes her follow the orders of others to be able to act, and she cannot stop following other people’s orders. But the orders she receives are ranked in importance, so she can disregard someone’s orders as long as it is to fulfill a higher duty. Samrukh was also able to replace her lost limbs with prosthetics without violating her ‘do not heal yourself’ commandment.

There is also the possibility for those who have outgrown the Law of this universe itself to rebel against the punishment and outright ignore it, or even use brute force to warp reality in a way that allows for breakthrough of one’s commandment without incurring in divine punishment, such as the usage of the Power of Ego to maintain multiple contradictory commandments as some Daeva do. Albeit, this last effect is something that even the most powerful Daeva struggle with, resulting at best in just pushing the line of what’s acceptable before a willing breakthrough rather than outright denying the punishment. Only those who are stronger than God or have the capability to replace her can actively ignore the punishment. Albeit, doing so means rebelling against the Truth and may incur in her wrath, being stricken via other means than a forceful Fall when that it is not possible.

It is possible to take Commandments of limited duration, or which are active just until a condition is fulfilled. But this topic is purely academic stuff for almost everyone in the cosmos, usually no one would do this, nor could, for that matter. Commandments are strong beliefs and iron-clad held convictions, pridefully sworn as a particular way to face the world. It is impossible to replace them on a whim, as one would their clothing, unless one’s mentality and personality was hollow enough that they may not even be called human to begin with.

Since everyone is required to take a commandment as part of reading deep enough into the Avesta, you too have gained yours. The exact wording of the Commandment is up to you, as well as its restrictions. Here you have two options: You may take whatever you have gained via this jump, with the exceptions of the ‘Star Spirit’ and ‘Will of the King’ purchases, and have it be a result of your boon, at no cost at all. It is not such a strange occurrence, even if it is the result of a single Commandment. Individuals Nahid or Vararam have proven that a single Commandment can result in a large amount of powers and boons. But if you like to, you may have actually taken multiple Commandments in the way that some powerful Daeva, or the heretic Yazata Magsarion, have done.

The other option is to pay 200 CP and receive a Commandment similar to that gained by Quinn, Spenta Mainyu or Zaurid’s original Commandment. Basically, you get a boost in power by following a certain limitation but gain no real special powers from that. For 400 CP instead, you may decide to instead create Commandments with more exotic results, like those of Munsarrat’s second Commandment, Mashyana or Ferdows, but you may not take anything that it’s already a perk in this jump, as those are the result of very special circumstances, nor an effect that it’s stronger than the 600 CP perks. You can see examples of Commandments in the Notes section.

Again, you may decide to purchase multiple Commandments here.

Other abilities and items may interact with Commandments, further increasing their power if the compatibility is right. This is especially true with abilities related to your own will, like the Power of Ego that the Daeva wield.

Once this jump ends, you may decide to stop being bound by your Commandment(s) in exchange for losing any potential boon that they may grant at will, no longer bound by the Avesta. You may decide to activate them again at the start of the next jump. This only applies to any abilities not derived from the perks that you purchase below. Breaking your Commandment won’t deprive you of your abilities, but will incur in divine punishment during your time here.

For example you would be able to do something seen as impossible in the Naruto world and seal even the Juubi into an appropriately sized and prepared container, though it would be difficult even with help. Interestingly this compounds with any other sealing knowledge or skills you have allowing you to combined and enhance the different magics with each other meaning you could quite literally be in the Naruto world with this and Fuuinjutsu mastery and casually seal away powerful beings like the Biju on your own with just some preperation."
720,,400,Sniping Witch,Kurohime,Modus,"Summoning a creature takes magical energy. Maintaining that summon also takes energy. And the further away you are from your summons, the more difficult they are to maintain. For this reason, sniping is exceedingly rare among witches... but not impossible. You have the raw magical power and the magical skill needed to maintain a spell from half a mile away, and the accuracy to actually hit your target at such ranges."
721,,400,Psychic Powers,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Modus,"You have somehow learned a variety of psychic powers, originating from the Mother series. You can use the following techniques: 2 Offensive PSI (such as PK Flash, PK Freeze, and PK Fire) of your choice, 1 Assist PSI (such as PSI Magnet), and 1 other PSI power of your choice (such as Teleport, PSI Shield, or PK Thunder). These techniques are all in line with an average Fighter’s Special. On top of this, you have a number of telekinetic grabs and psychic energy pulses, which you can easily incorporate into your fighting style.

You are able to pull off these techniques regularly without any trouble. In addition, you have gained PK Starstorm, allowing you to call down a shower of meteors on your foes. This technique is far more taxing, and using it more than once in a fight is unlikely."
722,,400,Aura,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Modus,"Like Lucario, you have learned to harness the power of Aura.

By focusing, you are able to see the innate aura of all living beings. You will be able to see this aura even through walls or other obstructions, allowing you to spot those who attempt to hide. By reading this aura, you can gain a vague understanding of the individual in question. You could learn roughly whether they are a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ sort of person, and whether they are hostile towards you or not.

Beyond this, you are able to employ your aura for the purposes of combat. You can enhance your physical strikes with your aura, and if you are capable of firing off projectile attacks, you can choose to fire off your aura as energy in the same way. You are also capable of firing a very powerful beam attack using your aura, known as an Aura Storm. Doing so is extremely taxing, making it unlikely that you will be able to this this technique more than once in a fight.

Finally, the power of your aura-related combat techniques increases in relation to the amount of physical damage you have currently sustained. If you have the Percentage System perk (or similar effect), this applies to your percentage whilst the perk (or effect) is active."
723,,400,Cooldowns are for Chumps,Miraculous Ladybug,Modus,"You are not going to allow your abilities to stop working just because you used them. Abilities with cooldowns of less than 1 year are halved. As an adult with a Miraculous, you’d have to seriously overwork that thing to not be able to use its power anymore. Allows a child to use their Miraculous twice per transformation, although their detransformation would come sooner than normal if they did."
724,,400,Superpowers(400),Miraculous Ladybug,Modus,"What’s with this obsession with the French kids? There are other superheroes and villains in the Miraculous universe with their own powers. Pick from each price tier to get superpowers. Can be purchased multiple times for different powers:

300: Technopathy (touch-range), Aerokinesis, Door Portal Creation, Magic Hot Dog Creation (powers granted by hot dogs are random and not very powerful)

725,,400,Custom Technique(400),Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"If none of the above options appeal to you, you can always make your own technique. Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects. A situational cursed technique or one with a lot of limitations would likely only be 200 CP, for example, while one with overwhelming power and versatility would be 800 CP.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
726,,400,Contractual Re-Creation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You’re able to use your cursed energy to re-create anything written on a contract you’re in physical contact with. This is most frequently used on receipts, allowing you to produce whatever they act as proof of purchase for. The receipts do have to be genuine, but so long as you have one there’s almost no limit to what can be re-created, from knives to trucks to entire houses. Any objects re-created using this can also act like shikigami, allowing you to give them simple commands. A set of knives, for instance, could be ordered to fly towards an opponent, though when used like this they disappear once the command has been completed. Of course, you can also just use them normally, such as by dropping a house on someone from above. You’re not just limited to physical objects, either: services can also be re-created. A receipt for a three-day stay at a traditional inn, for instance, would replenish your stamina, leaving you just as refreshed as if you had spent that time there.

This technique is activated by the user applying their cursed energy to a receipt, which causes it to burn. As such, each receipt can only be used once. This also makes water a natural enemy of this technique – both because it inhibits the burning process, but also because it can cause the ink to run, rendering the receipt unusable."
727,,400,Ice Formation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You have the ability to create and manipulate ice with your cursed energy to great effect. Just with its most basic usages, you could send out a cloud of icy mist with a wave of your hand, freezing an entire group of combatants solid before they can even react. Even if one of their arms happened to not get trapped, the ice’s strength is such that even a special grade cursed spirit would struggle to free themselves if caught. Freezing entire streets solid with one high-powered blast, mentally controlling icicles and sending them flying towards your foes from all directions, and creating building-sized blocks of ice and suspending them in the air are all possible.

The only real flaw to this technique, other than its natural enemy of high temperatures, is that it tends to require a fair bit of focus to maintain the ice it summons. Lose your concentration, such as by taking too much damage, and the ice will crumble pretty quickly."
728,,400,Auspicious Beasts Summon,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"By covering your face, such as with a ski mask, you gain the ability to summon four different auspicious beasts, each with their own specialties: Kaichi, Reiki, Kirin, and Ryu.

The first, Kaichi, takes the form of a conical, hand-sized horn covered in dark, spiralling patterns. It functions primarily as a projectile that not just flies at great speeds but also homes in on its target, drastically redirecting itself in mid-flight if needs be, disappearing once it hits them. It’s powerful enough to tear through a towering, building-sized cursed spirit with a single shot, or rip a good chunk out of someone’s arm even with a glancing blow.

The second, Reiki, takes the form of a decent amount of water that coats the user’s body, and can be controlled with your cursed energy. It can be used for mobility, coating the user’s feet to let them slide along the ground with much more speed and grace than usual, as well as for defence by cushioning incoming blows. Other effects besides may also be possible.

The third, Kirin, has an unknown form but a known effect. It secretes a drug directly into the user’s brain, completely blocking any pain they might feel and making them feel as if they’re in their best condition for as long as the technique lasts . It comes with the drawback of causing the user to experience a nasty crash once the drug’s effects wear off, though.

The final, Ryu, is currently unknown in both its form and ability, though it is likely to be the most directly powerful of the four. Given that its name refers to a Chinese dragon, however, it likely has effects related to them. You may decide on the exact nature of Ryu, so long as it falls within the general power level of the above beasts."
729,,400,Projection Sorcery,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"A rather complex ability, you’re capable of using Projection Sorcery. Similar to how a standard animation runs at 24 frames per second, upon activating this technique you divide the next second into 24 ‘frames’ using your field of view as the ‘camera’ these frames are filmed from – in other words, you decide on a series of 24 predetermined actions you’ll take in that second, then carry them out without deviating from them. Notably, however, these predetermined actions can defy the laws of physics and trajectories to an extent, allowing you to act in excess of your usual physical abilities. While you won’t be any stronger or tougher, you can use this to become far faster and more agile, potentially moving with such speeds that even special grade cursed spirits can’t follow your movements, and allowing you to become one of the very fastest around.

This technique can also be used offensively, too – while under the effects of Projection Sorcery, anything you touch is forced to operate under the same 24 FPS rule as you. If they violate this rule, they become trapped within a 2D animation frame where they last stood for one second. In this state, they’re completely immobile and unable to defend themselves, though any attack on them will free them from it.

There are several weaknesses to Projection Sorcery. The first is that the user cannot excessively violate the laws of physics and trajectories when using this technique – doing so will end with them being trapped within an animation frame for a second. There is also an upper limit to how much one can accelerate when activating the cursed technique, but this can be mitigated by keeping Projection Sorcery active, allowing speed to continuously build. In addition, as mentioned before the movements taken must be decided in advance, and cannot be adjusted if circumstances happen to change in that second."
730,,400,Blood Manipulation ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You’re able to use cursed energy to control your own blood with great versatility. For example, using the extension technique known as Flowing Red Scale, a user is capable of adjusting their body temperature, pulse rate, red blood cell count, and the composition of their blood in order to vastly increase their physical abilities, enough to disappear from someone’s sight in the blink of an eye. The blood outside of your body can be controlled too, such as by coating an arrow in it to let you change its trajectory in mid-flight. As such, Blood Manipulation is more than capable of being used at all ranges. 

Of course, there are also more directly offensive uses of Blood Manipulation. Forming a net out of one’s blood to restrain an opponent, creating spinning disc-shaped projectiles to slice others apart from afar, producing shields of blood to protect yourself from blows, or shaping blood into a knife and rotating it at high speeds to enhance its cutting ability are all possible uses. The most potent, however, is likely Piercing Blood: by condensing one’s blood as much as possible until it becomes a tiny bead then clapping it between one’s hands, the user can fire their blood in a straight line at velocities exceeding the speed of sound.

Despite its power and versatility, the greatest weakness of Blood Manipulation lies in its medium. To counteract the blood loss this technique incurs, users often carry around blood packs or prepare blood-coated weapons in advance. With great skill, users can recycle any blood they use and bring it back into their body, though this expends a lot of energy."
731,,400,Healer ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"Cursed energy is capable of great many things, but it does have its limitations. As an innately negative form of energy, it is impossible to use it to heal oneself or others in its base form, for instance. Yet there is a way around this: a method known as reverse cursed technique. By multiplying cursed energy against itself, it instead becomes a ‘positive’ form of energy, and thus can be used to heal. While this sounds simple, it’s a rather complex thing in practice, with many talented sorcerers being unable to grasp the process.

You, however, don’t struggle with this at all, being a true master of reverse cursed technique. The most obvious benefit this gives you is the ability to heal yourself as well as others through physical contact. Though you may leave some scars behind for more serious wounds, with this you’re capable of healing anything from cuts and bruises to slit throats and missing limbs. The more severe the injury and the faster you wish to heal it, however, the more energy will be required, and there are certain things that are more difficult to cure. Poisons, for example, take a lot of concentrated effort to neutralise, and damage to the soul cannot be healed at all.

This is only one use of reverse cursed technique, though: significantly, it can also be used in conjunction with one’s cursed technique. By powering one’s cursed technique using the positive energy generated through reverse cursed technique, its effect becomes reversed. A technique that pulled people closer would be made to repel them, while one that weakened gravity in an area would amplify it instead. While any user of reverse cursed technique would be able to use this, purchasing this perk allows you to apply this reversal of effects to any other supernatural powers you may possess."
732,,400,Strange Energy,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"For most sorcerers, cursed energy on its own isn’t anything particularly special – it’s just the thing they use to enhance their physical abilities and fuel their cursed techniques. A very rare few, however, are born with energy that possesses unusual traits, unique to the individual. While not inherently more powerful, these properties are difficult for normal sorcerers to deal with, making it a potentially significant advantage in combat depending on how it is used.

Now, your energy, too, has something rather unusual about it, a trait that sets it apart from the norm. This can be almost anything: perhaps your energy has an edge to it, allowing it to cut even when using bludgeoning attacks and being significantly more painful to get hit by than normal. Or maybe it has the properties of electricity, allowing you to shock your opponents with your blows, or perhaps even creating arcs of lightning with enough practice and control. While this doesn’t make your cursed energy directly stronger, it’s worth noting that reinforcing one’s body with cursed energy, the usual means of protecting against cursed energy-based attacks, is far less effective against defending against these traits than it is normal energy. Furthermore, you also gain a high level of resistance to whatever your trait may be: the aforementioned cursed energy with electrical properties would allow its user to shrug off lightning bolts without much issue, for example."
733,,400,Premium Hearts,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Humans are capable of some pretty crazy things in this world, even without the help of genetic enhancements or Materia. A skilled enough martial artist could stand their ground against a genetically enhanced superhuman and stand a decent chance of winning, should they stay on their toes. You have taken this to heart and have focused purely on your physical strength and speed, letting you punch much harder and do death-defying acrobatics on reflex. These abilities will grow with you and you start off a master of a self-made (or taught) martial arts style that complements your chosen fighting style in Still More Fighting as well as giving you skill in wielding magic in tandem with your martial arts almost seamlessly. Just be warned: While you're definitely a lot stronger and more skilled with your fists like this, you're not really much more durable. If you were physically frail beforehand, you will still be fairly easy to knock out from a well-placed attack from the aforementioned superhuman. 

How does this make you stronger but not much tougher? Don't worry about it."
734,,400,Adopted Persona,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"It's no secret people look up to their heroes, or even their friends. Sometimes you wish you could be as skilled as them in a particular area or even become them, if your sense of identity were so badly wounded. For better or worse you have taken this idea to heart, for when you become close to someone or work with an individual for a long period of time, your mind will subtly pick up on their mannerisms and abilities. Being a close friend to a skilled swordsman would let you learn how to wield a blade in the same style several times as quickly, eventually being able to wield their signature weapon with the same amount of ease. You might even take on some aspects of their personality, such as their confidence or even their identity, doing a convincing imitation of who or what you see them as.

Note that you can't learn abilities from this chosen idol if you lacked the capability for it in the first place, it has to be something you can be taught or learn yourself. You will only ever take as many aspects from them as you desire, so if you just want to learn their skills without changing your personality any, that works fine. You may only have one 'idol' to learn from at a time, but you retain whatever you learn from previous ones. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, isn't it?"
735,,400,Daybreak and Nightfall ,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"The Solari are the most powerful faction on Mount Targon, while the Lunari are considered an heretic sect. They receive power from sunlight and moonlight respectively, being empowered while their respective light shine brighter. Of course, you know full well that the light of the Moon is nothing more than the reflected light of the Sun , so the power the Solari and Lunari worship are one and the same. So, not only you’re empowered both by sunlight and moonlight, but all your Perks that interact with Sun and Moon now can use them interchangeably. You’re at your full power only at noon? Full moon will do the trick. You’re a werewolf? Enjoy the daylight enhancing your bestial power."
736,,400,Void Influence,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"The war with Icathia had terrible consequences, like the Darkin War, but for the people of Shurima, the presence of the Void is the worst one. Its insidious presence seeps under the sand, letting monsters both small and big to reach Runeterra. You now possess a part of the power of the Void. How exactly you wield it it’s a your discretion. Maybe you can generate violet blades that eat magic, or emit a powerful beam capable of suppressing the mind of your opponent, or maybe you simply command hordes of lesser Voidling to do your bidding. You just have one of these powers, but with time you could develop more."
737,,400,It’s in the Blood ,Fairy Fencer F,Modus,Fascinating. The blood of the Vile God has matured within you. Nurtured by your inner darkness. The most basic gift is a staggering increase in the Dark Attribute. Except that barely scratches the surface. Your blood is alive with the power of a Dark Divine. This increases all of your stats by a substantial amount the more you give into the Darkness. Those with weaker minds can be easily bent to your will either through honeyed words or force. However this will take practice.
738,,400,Unique Ability,Fairy Fencer F,Modus,"It has been said that Fencers possess other gifts besides what’s given by their Fairy partners. Every Fencer has a special talent that is theirs alone. Whether it be to go full Shonen and grow stronger, gain a powerful barrier, analyze the strengths/weaknesses of others, or even terrify enemies into dying instantly. Now you have an ability that is unique to you and you alone. Please fanwank responsibly. (Excludes alternate forms)"
739,,400,Magic,Inheritance Cycle,Modus,"You can wield the powers of Magic, granting you the dual powers of psychic combat and semantic mysticism. By speaking ""The Ancient Language"" you can cause changes to happen in the world, conforming to the words you state. This power is fueled by your physical energy however, and to do something with magic takes as much energy as doing it via the mundane method, it simply happens faster or more conveniently. At first you must spell out exactly what you want to happen, but as you grow more experienced with Magic you can do more with smaller sentences. You must still find someone to learn from if you wish to expand your vocabulary beyond the basics."
740,,400,Saint or Sinner,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"Blessed by the Heavens above, you’ve become a Saintly Saber. Holy power is infused into your very being, granting a powerful attribute of such to any attacks you make. It gives access to all kinds of religious abilities, from healing with a touch to the production of sacred relics and warding against evil beings. Though many of the powers can seem moderately useful on their own, one stands above the rest. The Revelations sent from the Heavens to you act as a guidance to your goals, giving you a general idea of what the best path to take to achieve what you want will be. Though details are usually light and it places heavy emphasis on you succeeding in the tasks you undertake, it lets you grasp victory even when knowing almost nothing of the overall situation. Some might even say it’s a terrible way to excuse a Saint winning a war they had no right to, so they could hand the victory to an idiot hero.

Alternatively, a darker path can be taken. Instead of the holiness of a Saint, you can spit on Heavens offer and become a fallen paladin. Though you lose access to the Revelations, your other abilities will invert to an unholy theme. Where the Saint heals, you harm. Cursed tools are easy to produce and the kind or naive can easily be lured with your magics. Rather than the blind faith of a Revelation, you instead gain power over all Dragons. Able to command any dragonkind you encounter, provided they are not significantly beyond your power, quickly gathering armies of wyverns if enough of the race are present. 

Sabers like this are...fairly self-explanatory. The Saints act like Saints and the Sinners act like Sinners. The degree to which they fit can vary. Sometimes a Saintly Saber can be much scarier than the worst Sinner and sometimes the Sinning Sabers can reveal a rather embarrassing fascination with all things Japanese, contrary to their supposed dark villainy. "
741,,400,Riding EX,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"Truth can only be obtained from focus. Discard all other distractions. Motorbikes? Too slow. Horsies? Too smelly. Feet? Too landbound. Only a spaceship can take you where you need to go. Though some Sabers may lay claim to the skill of Riding, your version applies to only one kind of vehicle. You’ve mastered the spacelanes like no other before, able to push space-ships of any kind to outright impossible feats. Getting a cruiser to run twice as fast is just a matter of taking the wheel yourself. When you really put the effort in, you can make spaceships enter warp speed even if they don’t actually have a warp drive. The more of a heap of flying junk the ship is, the crazier you’ll be able to get with your Riding too.

If you want, you can also change this from ‘spaceships’ into another specific class of thing that you can Ride. Bikes, cars, horses, people, so on. The same rules will apply, with your impossible skills getting more so as your mount gets crappier."
742,,400,A Saber is a Saber,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"The art to wielding the blade. Most Sabers are at least competent in some sort of sword fighting or other knightly martial art and thankfully, you’re now no different. From the years of training as squire to a Knight, a life as a marauding bandit or some other profession, you’ve become a fairly deadly combatant. Where your skills come from largely direct what your skills actually do. A knight might be good with sword and lance and horseback riding, whereas a bandit performs better with axe and dagger and guerrilla tactics. 

For 400,000 points instead, you can upgrade your talents to the level of proper mastery. Not only are you a peerless example of your way of battle in mundane terms, you’ve become able to perform supernatural feats resulting from pure skill. Often, this just means slicing harder and faster and sharper than you have any physical right too but sometimes it can manifest in magical spell-like effects. A Samurai might learn to leap almost outside of reality itself to appear before a foe, whereas a Knight could learn to shield themselves against the normally unblockable."
743,,400,Noble House ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Modus,"You are a descendant of one of the Three Noble Houses of Schicksal: House Apocalypse, House Schariac, or House Kaslana. Each House has its own benefits, besides the absolute immunity to Honkai that you have, and the connections that your family has. These benefits vary from house to house.

★ Apocalypse: You have an immense business acumen, and a high affinity with technology and science. This allows you to maximize your talents with technology and science by also allowing you to have enough capability in finance to easily fund any projects you may want to fund without incurring any losses.
★ Kaslana: You have a highly superhuman body, being capable of near-effortlessly denting steel, and can outrun fast-moving cars. You also have the innate ability to reinforce any armaments you may have, strengthening your weapons in proportion to your own strength, so that you never really break them.
★ Schariac: You have an immense affinity for generating and manipulating Honkai energy. You can effortlessly produce and control about 10 Honkai Reactors worth of Honkai energy, and can train this up to ludicrous amounts extremely easily. Your control over this energy is virtually perfect, and you can also convert it into any type of energy, and vice versa, being able to absorb other energies to manipulate extra amounts of energy beyond what you can generate.

744,,400,Book Learning,Library of Ruina V1.0,Modus,"Those books you like to collect now have a lot more purpose than just information. Now you can ""wield"" a book, temporarily granting perfect photographic knowledge of the contents within, and by using your imagination you can materialise the tools it describes. For example, a book about the standards of woodwork will temporarily grant the user hammers and saws when needed, and the user will have perfect application of the methods. The tools disappear once they leave the user's hand and once the book is unequipped, the unpracticed knowledge goes with it. Guns are capable of firing projectiles, but ammunition doesn't resupply until the owner sits down and goes through the motions of reloading."
745,,400,Focused Strength,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Adrenaline and training together under a focused mind can produce incredible results. They can allow a frail old man to punch through a massive log or allow individuals to push aside their normal limits when the need arises. You’ve mastered a controlled version of this technique and can kick your body into overdrive for short periods of time. This works best when you have a single goal on your mind to focus on, like protecting someone from the danger of a crumbling house by holding it up on your own for a few minutes, but can be used less effectively in other situations. Your muscles will pay the price for such exertions later. Still, it seems a small price to pay for the ability to suplex a train."
746,,400,A Being Split In Two,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Espers are endowed with a lot of magical power. More than even the most trained of Magi are capable of controlling. Stuffing even half of it into a Human body and then giving them no idea what is happening to them can be stressful, to say the least. Some feel as if they are tearing completely apart. But you’ve learned how to handle disparate energies coursing through your body. This extends beyond your natural Esper abilities and can help you control such influences gained from other worlds. With time, training, and experimentation, you will be able to forge links between the different magical pools you have, allowing you to draw on them to fuel each other. Like a cascading cavern pool, each flowing into the next."
747,,400,Curses Great and Small,God Of War (2018),Modus,"Odin is rather infamous for his curses, from his trapping Mimir in his tree to his curses against the Valkyries and Freya all of them have been terrible in some way. With this perk you have a talent for casting and creating curses that have a tendency to stick until death and sometimes beyond that as well. However there are factors that determine how strong the curse is and how long it will last. The strength of the curse, the strength of your target, and your personal strength. If you wanted to curse a mortal with bad luck while being as strong as a mortal yourself then it would last for a few weeks if you wanted it to. But if you wanted to curse a mortal with bad luck while being a god as strong as Odin, then the curse could last for as long as you desire even if they were brought back from the dead. However if you wanted to imitate Odin and curse someone like Freya to never be able to kill another living being, even in self defense, then you would not only have to be as strong as Odin is, minimum, but you would also have to weaken your target first (like how Freya lost her Valkyrie wings) and would likely need some regents to strengthen your curse."
748,,400,Consequences to Killing a God!,God Of War (2018),Modus,"Well there normally are, but not as much in your case. Back in ancient Greece almost every time Kratos killed a god some kind of disaster struck the land. This won’t happen for you, much like Heimdell’s or Odin’s death when you kill a god there will not be any greater repercussions on the world, though you may still make enemies by doing so. Even killing a being who represents a concept won’t have any large consequences, though if a prophecy or something similar dictates that their death will herald the end this perk doesn’t stop that. This perk is toggleable if you want there to be consequences"

You now have the ability to create potions that can bring life back to a severed head, while also having the skill to simultaneously place a curse on the head to never speak a certain truth all within the presence of an experienced god. You can create traps with natural magic that are strong enough to temporarily bind greater gods and can revive the corpses of beings while allowing them to retain their full power."

754,,400,Holy Orders ,Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"There is more than one faction at play for the future of both mankind and the planet. While the Mages’ Association hoards Mystery like a dragon rotting upon it’s hoard, there is a hidden side to the Roman Catholic Church which seeks the destruction of all things deemed heretical-and remains embroiled in an uneasy truce with the Mages’ Association as something like a mediator for the spats between individual mages. Not only armed with powerful artifacts and assistance from strange bedfellow, but the church’s teachings and holy words allow their priests to use Sacraments: Magecraft in all but name with a particular focus on exorcising spirits, purging unnatural influences, soothing and perceiving emotional states, and reinforcing the body-among other methods, many of which can counter even the formidable magecraft employed by the heads of magus families.

Whether or not you are officially registered as an Executor of the church, through either a hellish regimen of combat training believed impossible by the general public or some unnatural quirk of your biology as well as the gift of Sacraments you have become a potent weapon for the glory of God and mankind against the depredations of the supernatural. Your peer, Eiri Fumizuka, possess such divine skill with the sword he once destroyed the body of the Fifth True Magic’s former wielder with a single slash-and in the present, the lone witness to that feat is still unsure who would win in a fight to the death. Similar to him, your priestly training also have a piercing insight into the nuances of human nature and how to cut to the heart of most emotional turmoil. Perhaps it would be worth catching up with him while he’s in town. Or perhaps not, given his sharp tongue. But other possibilities such as similar skill in a barehanded martial art that surpasses modern understanding, augmentation by Sacrament-enhanced cybernetics or even a bloodline of unnatural origin used in service of God also exist, so long as they are all roughly in the same ballpark."
755,,400,Reenactment of Mystery(Mysterious Witch),Witch on the Holy Night,Modus,"Let us speak now, of magecraft.

Simply put, if an end result is achievable through scientific means, then magecraft is a process which creates that outcome using supernatural means. Fundamentally it is the reenactment of preexisting phenomena through the circulation of life energy and magical energy through the magus’ body, their implements or their familiars. In order to attune to the Mysteries attuned to the Akashic Records and reproduce their phenomena, mages use Thaumaturgical Foundations-systems straddling the line between scholarship and religion to derive theories (e.g. “Alchemy is how the world works, therefore I can instantly exchange something for something else using the spell Flash Air. A spoon for a fork, for example) shaped by mankind as a whole’s collective understanding of reality, however accurate it is.

Thus, magecraft is fundamentally at a disadvantage to entities or phenomena with higher Mystery due to being an imperfect replica of similar concepts, and diminishes in power when a significant part of the human population becomes aware of it due to greater human awareness “diluting” the same source of Mystery. More information about Magecraft can be found in the notes.

Barring truly overwhelming fonts of magical energy or preparation, battles between mages tend to be decided by mystical compatibility and strategic conservation of resources rather than superior firepower though as with all things in this world, there are always exceptions. Brute force can be a form of compatibility on its own.

Somehow, you too have the ability to practice magecraft. This purchase determines how good you are at in terms of knowledge and practical implementation. You may select any form of magecraft still in existence in the current era of the setting, from the Japanese Shugendō which combines Buddhism and mountain worship into unique techniques themed around transforming into a tengu by arriving at Hell, to Alchemy which studies control over the flow of bodies, life and matter. Either the Clock Tower’s western foundation which seeks to transform base matter into gold (and to extend the metaphor, a human being into an entity comparable to God) or that of the Alchemists of Atlas. Who, based on Egyptian metallurgy, prefer to focus on the pure conversion of phenomena as well as the prediction-and in some cases, actualisation-of the future. And a particularly unique case greatly decreasing the usual limitations of magic circuits by focusing their grandest efforts on the creation of uniquely powerful items or entities.

There are those with talent. And there are those with hard work. And then, there are beings of inhuman mentality such as you forged through regimens that the ignorant would call inhumane and magi would call nothing short of wondrous. From the moment you were born, your life was planned for you to become a magus. From the time you’ve been able to read you’ve had your nose in a book of magecraft, and every aspect of your life has revolved around its history and practice. At the age of 16, you stand at the pinnacle of your craft as one trained to inherit a legacy spanning generations, both rich in troves of magecraft lore and capable of disassembling even the luminaries of the Clock Tower in magecraft battles based on magecraft alone. Conjuring entities that upend the laws of reality along a certain theme such as “fairytales” to reshape entire buildings to your desires, bringing down destruction capable of levelling a town or magically sealing someone inside a tiny bottle are examples of what you are capable of. All that’s left is experimentation. An idle amusement for one who already knows every meaningful discovery found by prior generations."
756,,400,The Expectation for the Meaning of Existence,Library of Ruina,Modus,"A few notable members of the Library used to be much grander, a certain Color Fixer, an Arbiter who now only wields echoes of her power, and a man who has lost everything. Eventually, each in turn was able to reclaim a fuller measure of their power, and even progress onwards despite their bodies being mere imitations of the light. If you were to find yourself in a similar situation, wounded, broken, out of practice and out of power, you’d still eventually find your way back to the peak you once sat upon. Even if the power was not your own, and you’ve truly lost the right to wield it, you could eventually forge the Light into a reasonable facsimile of it, though a notably lesser one."
757,,400,Age is Power,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"These kids run around thinking that you’re somehow not able to keep up with them? Shows what they know. Your physical and mental prime doesn’t diminish as you get older, in fact, it seems that the older you get, the more acute your senses and abilities become. So what if you’ve practically raised your allies and are over twice their age? If they think that’ll slow you down, you’ll show those whippersnappers just what they have to look forward to."
758,,400,Funeral In The Mirror ,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"Oh, the protagonists of this world. The blessed ones. Always getting helped by others, finding random masters to grant them new skills, or even pulling new powers outta nowhere. So tiring. So unjust. Let us balance the scales, shall we? Once every ten years, you can ‘lock-on’ a target of your choosing, the only restriction is that they must be a ‘hero’, ‘protagonist’ or something close enough to those. Now, everytime those blasted beings gain a new power, you will also gain access to something similar. It might not be the exact same, nor synergise perfectly with all your other powers like a protagonist would. But it will be in the same tier. Every time they win a new power up, you will also gain one, ensuring that you’re never left in the dust. Now, the ball is in your court, may the most skilled and smart win the fight."
759,,400,Roar From Inside,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"The flow of magic and inner power flows inside oneself like a river, because of that, many train to increase the pressure, while others just try to learn how to use what they have with the utmost efficiency. You as well, have learned a way to take advantage of this knowledge by gathering and compressing your inner powers to archive an attack or transformation. In your newly unlocked state you become several times stronger and able to access new abilities based on your lineage and abilities, much like Akeno’s Fallen Angel mode, or Koneko’s Shirone transformation. Of course, you can use this for a simple attack or technique that hit several times stronger than your usual hits."
760,,400,Last Convergence Point,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"There are many weapons, skills, abilities, bloodlines, sacred gears, and more in this world, and yet – you can rarely find those powers truly working together, merging into new strengths. Sure, you might find someone using different powers in tandem, perhaps even at the same time. But to truly have them become one, an even greater power that goes beyond common sense? That’s rarer. It’s the kind of ability that would allow Issei and Vali to achieve several different and greater heights by combining their Balance Breaker with their other advantages. Unlike them, you aren’t being handheld by your Sacred Gear, but rather have the natural ability to combine several of your different advantages into a singular power that are several times exponentially increased in power. Matching them at will. Combining what would normally be separate sources of power, such as the power of an Evil Piece, a Sacred Gear, and a temporary spell could create a level of effect many times more effective that simply using them at the same time, perhaps even creating a whole new branch that you can work with. Synchronizing and forcefully harmonizing abilities that are opposite to each other is also possible if a bit draining until you get accustomed to it."
761,,400,Usurpation of Divinity,God of War,Modus,"There are consequences to killing a god, true, but also invaluable opportunities. Should you manage to kill a god, or a similar divine being, you are capable of taking their power for yourself, making one of their Domains yours. This will grant you a whole host of new abilities, or strengthen your already existing ones. Additionally, there will be no negative side-effects from your murder of the divine, at least as far as the functioning of the natural world is concerned."
762,,400,Memory Repository,Lobotomy Corporation,Modus,"A memory repository imprint is left in your subconscious at the start of the jump, and a temporary one made every sixth day. Any E.G.O developed or information gathered will be retained. The time that is lost is still calculated as part of your ten year stay. Anyone you wish may keep their memory intact.

Requires Retry to Purchase"
763,,400,Above All Alignment ,Final Fantasy II,Modus,"You’re perfectly capable of altering what you would call your alignment, and how things are picked up by others. This allows you to, should you attempt to enter the afterlife, choose which direction you’d like to go, no matter how horrible of a person you might be. In addition, items that are restricted to alignment hold no such issue for you. You are above such mortal perceptions of such a thing."
764,,400,Counterfeiter ,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"In this world of fading mystery, it is the norm that rituals go forgotten and pieces of magecraft get lost. This is truly inconvenient when there are so many amazing things in this world that could be used for a few laughs. How fortunate is the world to have a genius of your caliber working on bringing back some of these.

When you observe any mystical effect, ritual or construction, you become able to create a partial reproduction of it. It may take more effort than the original took to build, and it certainly won’t be perfect if you lack the original materials and circumstances of its construction, but you can make it be ‘close enough’ for most effects. Depending on the effect you are after, it may still take a lot of time and resources, but something like observing the Fuyuki Holy Grail War once and then reproducing it several decades later is certainly possible to you, even if you never have the opportunity to fully study the Greater Holy Grail."
765,,400,Share the Burden,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"Whether due to your own genius, or just by learning the technique from a great teacher, you have learned of a method similar to the one developed by Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald during the Fourth Holy Grail War. That is, you can share the Master rights with other magi, not only at least partly freeing you from the burden of your Servant, but, also allowing them to increase in power as they can draw more mana. With this method, you can choose whether or not to also share one or all the Command Seals within your peers. Doing that would normally decrease the potency of the Command Seal, but in exchange, you may spread the number of uses of this potent trump card your team may invoke. However, sharing too much may put you in danger, as any kind of betrayal to this pact may return you potentially deadly feedback.

In future jumps, with enough study and effort, you may be able to share similar conditions like the Master rights with other people."
766,,400,Greater Spirit        ,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Modus,"Sufficiently ancient spirits sometimes have authority over one aspect of nature or another. Somehow you have been granted authority over a season. This grants you a number of abilities thematically related to the season; it is with practice that you will find the extent of this ability.

If you have the Nature's Blessing perk, you possess this authority through your bonded spirit, and will find these abilities much easier to use while you are in the form of the spirit as the spirit has had time to master the abilities and guide their use.

If you have the Spirit Mate perk, that spirit will have authority over the opposite season you do. (i.e. Spring and Fall, or Summer and Winter)"
767,,400,Heart of Dragon,Final Fantasy I,Modus,"Discipline your thoughts! Fear and doubt are merely poisons of the mind, ones you’ve gained a considerable immunity towards. After a moment’s concentration, you may enter a stoic state of ‘emptiness’, letting you focus on a singular task after calming all emotion, greatly increasing your competence at said task. This also has the benefit of letting you completely shut out illusions or attempts to control your mind, making you impossible to sway until you see fit to leave this state of mind."
768,,400,Third Party Open Source,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Modus,"You are able to alter and customize the internal mechanisms of your system to a degree in line with using the settings menu and in each jump your system will integrate components from that Jump setting.

Boosted: Open Quests

You are able to submit a reward amount in order to set up Quests both for you and for anyone
else temporarily allowing them access to the Quest Log aspect of the system which will aid them until they have completed the task at which point they will lose access to the quest log and receive the reward.

Boosted: Open Shop

Every day your shop is updated nothing will be removed from its previous purchasable list
unless you specifically remove it or purchase it. Each day's update has a chance to include anything from any jump you have ever visited or the materials required to replicate it.

769,,400,Elemental Magic,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Modus,"You now have an innate connection to one of the following elements: Fire, Lava, Earth, Plants, Water, Ice, Wind or Electricity. This choice allows you to innately control the magic of that element. This Perk can be taken multiple times gaining an additional elemental magic with each purchase after the first.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
770,,400,Aptitude for Slaughter,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Modus,"How many times have humans died by their fellow men using guns and weapons of destruction? Or caused the deaths of countless animals with their machines of fire and steel? But there has to be someone who excels at causing death. That someone is now you.

Your aptitude for killing humans allows you to expertly use any manmade weapon or gun of your era. Not only that but your weapons become several times more powerful when used by you, multiple times so when used against humans. It is overdue for them isn’t it?

Alternatively you may instead gain the same kind of aptitude but for animals instead, allowing you to manipulate and exert control over haired beasts, giving you much more power in efforts of taming or dominating animals. If you buy this Perk a second time (still Discounted for Spirits) you may gain both effects.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
771,,400,Thy Soul To Take ,Godbound,Modus,"Through sheer divine power, you are able to function as a sort of rogue psychopomp. You can sense the cycle of life and death intuitively, down to individual lives, and by pulling on them like threads whisk souls from their rightful destination to one of your choice. It would take power equal to the least of angels to do so effectively to a human population, as it is one of their chief goals to prevent humanity from ever rising from death. Such a grasp of the natural order also makes it easy for you to tilt those on the brink one way or the other, whether by sundering hordes of undead through giving them true eternal rest or preventing a loyal minion from passing on by shoving his soul back into his body long enough to repair it. With great experience and power you may ripen vast fields of crops in an instant, quell greater undead into an eternal slumber and engage in more esoteric transmutations. Someday by your power alone, you may bless others with the cleansing and transcendence that Hell no longer provides."
772,,400,Psychic Powers,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have somehow learned a variety of psychic powers, originating from the Mother series. You can use the following techniques: 2 Offensive PSI (such as PK Flash, PK Freeze, and PK Fire) of your choice, 1 Assist PSI (such as PSI Magnet), and 1 other PSI power of your choice (such as Teleport, PSI Shield, or PK Thunder). These techniques are all in line with an average Fighter’s Special. On top of this, you have a number of telekinetic grabs and psychic energy pulses, which you can easily incorporate into your fighting style.

You are able to pull off these techniques regularly without any trouble. In addition, you have gained PK Starstorm, allowing you to call down a shower of meteors on your foes. This technique is far more taxing, and using it more than once in a fight is unlikely."
773,,400,Power Copy,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have gained the ability to copy the powers of others.

The exact method you use to copy a power is up to you. An example might be swallowing your target, like Kirby. Whatever method you design for yourself, it must take the form of an extended grapple of some sort, which can be broken by those strong enough to do so. Which power you get from your target is up to you, but once you have chosen it, you may only copy that same power from the target in the future. You will only ever gain a single power each time you use this.

When you copy a power, you also undertake some change in your appearance to signify this. This might be a change of clothes, an additional article of clothing (such as a hat), or some kind of marking on your face or body, in the vein of the appearance of your target. Whatever it is, it must be enough for someone familiar with your target to recognize that your appearance has taken on traits of your target. This change in appearance never gives you anything extra beyond the power you have copied.

You may only have a single copied power at a time, and must lose what you have in order to copy something else. You can lose the power you have copied if you are hit hard enough, and you may also voluntarily choose to get rid of it."
774,,400,Magic System,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have access to a magic system, either a generic one, or if you prefer you may choose a system appearing in Super Smash Bros., such as Final Fantasy’s system, or Dragon Quest’s system.

Regardless of what you choose, it operates under a resource pool system, such as MP. This is the case even if the system you chose did not originally do this. You have a very small pool to begin with, only capable of 3 or 4 spells before completely emptying. The pool refills slowly over time, and can be increased via training.

To start with, you have two weak elemental spells, and a single support spell. You may learn additional spells over time, but the power, number and variety of your spells is capped at a level comparable to that displayed by Hero in Smash."
775,,400,Comeback!,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"You have access to a unique ability, designed to turn the tide when you are behind. Choose one of the following options:

• The more damaged or injured you are, the more powerful your attacks become. If you have the Percentage System perk, this applies to your percentage whilst the perk is active.
• You have an internal ‘meter’ of sorts. When you take damage, it fills. You may also concentrate fully on raising the meter to make it fill, but doing so makes you unable to attack or useful any other techniques that require your concentration. When this meter maxes out, your next attack becomes far more powerful than normal, and becomes capable of launching your opponents if it was not already able to. The meter is then reset. If you wait too long without attacking, you lose the powerful attack, and the meter resets.
• You have an internal ‘meter’ of sorts. When you are losing a fight, it will slowly fill. You may also take a special guarding stance. Taking damage in this stance will fill the meter, and the stance will reduce the amount of damage you would otherwise have taken. When this meter maxes out, you automatically go into a state of mental clarity. In this state, techniques that would tax your mind or body are far easier for you to use. This state lasts around a minute, then the meter resets.
• You have access to a “Rage Mode”, which activates when you are significantly damaged whilst in battle. If you have the Percentage System perk, this applies when you reach 100% whilst the perk is active. When active, a red-coloured aura will emanate from your body. While in Rage, all of your attacks become noticeably more powerful, though not to quite the same degree as can be achieved using the first option whilst extremely damaged. This damage boost is at a fixed rate. Additionally, you are able to use one of your techniques or attacks as a ‘Rage Drive’, allowing it to be performed with significantly more power than you would normally be able to. You are limited to a single Rage Drive, and using it will cause your Rage aura (and damage boost) to disappear. Your Rage will also prematurely end if you continue to take large amounts of damage, or if your current battle comes to a close. Once your Rage has ended, it cannot be accessed again until your next battle, or until your death, whichever comes first."
776,,400,Merged Magic,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Modus,"You are now able to combine multiple spells into a single casting allowing the resulting spell to
be stronger than the sum of their parts. Using this you could combine similar spells to magnify
their effect or cast spells with different benefits such as a stunning spell with a shield breaker in
order to cast a spell with both effects which could break through a protego and then stun the
target. Initially you could only use this perk to combine two spells, however with training and
practice you could combine any number of spells even if they come from different forms of
magic from alternate worlds."
777,,400,Blue Wizard,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Modus,"You possess a magical power which allows you to make your magical energy mimic that of
other magical creatures. This means that whenever you experience the magic or the magical
abilities of magical creatures you can copy them and use them as if they were natural to you as
they were to them. When you use these magic abilities you will initially do them the same way
you experienced them but with time and experience you will be able to fine tune them towards
how you want to use them."
778,,400,Dark Arts,Wizarding World,Modus,"Others may call you evil, some may call you foolish, but you know full well the truth of the world. There is power to be found in the knowledge that so many others would shun and deride for the simple sin of being harmful to their fragile sensibilities. Power that you have sought and power that you have obtained. The power of the Dark Arts.

The Dark Arts has once been described to be an ever shifting and mutable branch of magic, a magic that, much like the Hydra of myth, is eternal, unable to ever truly be erased. There is truth to such words because for as long you live, so too shall the Dark Arts. Dark magic flows through your veins almost as if it were blood itself, permeating even your magic so that every spell you cast can become a cursed thing, inflicting wounds that cannot be healed without either the appropriate counter- curse or extensive amounts of healing magic. Even when healed, your spells shall leave behind grievous scars, ensuring that any foe you wound shall never look the same.

But greater and darker spells are far from the extent of your newfound capabilities. With your affinity to the Dark Arts, you take them in as a man underneath the desert sun drinks water from an oasis, learning and mastering them far faster than your contemporaries. In only a decade, you could come to stand in the same league as Voldemort himself in this regard."
779,,400,Pride of Uagadou,Wizarding World,Modus,"Wands are primarily a European invention and as useful and mighty as it may be, there are times when it can be too restricting. And while the wand has been adopted by people in places where wandless magic was the norm, they have not forgotten their roots. And if your newfound skills in the art are any indication, neither have you.

As above, your skill in magic is enough that you no longer need a wand. With a simple wave of your hands, you can cast a spell as well as any other. Even better, if we’re being entirely honest. After all, not a lot of people are quite so skilled in magic. Of course, despite your prowess, your wand is not useless. In fact, thanks to your new skills, you’ve learned how to channel your magic into your wand far more precisely than before, ensuring your spells are further enhanced by a wand than it would normally be."
780,,400,Modification & Creation,Wizarding World,Modus,"Spells are nifty and all, but it is all just so... restricting. Magic is meant to be used for more than just premade spells and rituals. Magic is mighty and should never be bound by the laws and whims of mankind. The greatest wizards and witches of history understood this lesson all too well.  And most importantly, that is where these new skills of yours come in. Whenever it comes to spellwork and their like, you find yourself excelling in their modification and creation. 

With your knowledge, you could already make sure that something as simple as your basic Shield Charm, originally meant to protect only you, can be used to instead protect a certain area, person or even knock down any foes near you as you call upon it. With a bit of experimentation, you could add new effects to spells such as the Disarming Charm, the Summoning Charm, and even the Unforgivable Curses. Of course, the more similar your planned modifications are, the easier and quicker it will be to implement them.

But most importantly, beyond modification, you are now the type of witch or wizard who is more than capable of creating their own unique spells. But be warned. Spell creation is a dangerous thing. More than a few wizards and witches have lost their lives through careless experimentation and creation. And yet, you will find the rewards to be well worth the risks."
781,,400,Ancient Magic ,Wizarding World,Modus,"Magic is much like knowledge. Over the years, it is only natural for magic to become lost to the sands of time, to never again be learnt by the likes of ordinary witches and wizards. But you, you are certainly the farthest possible from ordinary. Like few others before you, the potential to manipulate ancient magic is now within your grasp. With it, you will soon be capable of magic beyond the pale. Bringing forth rain and life to an entire valley suffering from the harshest drought shall be the least of what you can do.

But the keyword here is potential. In this budding state of yours, all you can do for now is simply the detection of traces of ancient magic and then use said magic to perform devastating attacks against your foes. And though your newfound abilities have bolstered even the growth of what others may call regular magic, that is not even close to where your limits lie.

To truly reach your new limits, you must find ways to learn, people to teach you, and records to study. Do not think that this shall be an easy task. Depending on when you begin your journey, it could be centuries since ancient magic was last wielded."
782,,400,Accidental Magic,Wizarding World,Modus,"As children, witches and wizards are prone to bouts of accidental and uncontrolled magic, often to help themselves in dangerous and precarious situations, other times occurring during periods of severe emotional distress. Either way, such magic often fades by the time they grow up, disappearing almost entirely by the time one reaches their teenage years. But not you. For some strange reason, in times of severe distress, your magic flares up, responding against danger automatically.

Sometimes, it’ll simply teleport you out of danger, almost as if you apparated somewhere nearby. In other times, you’ll push away whatever’s causing you distress with a small wave of force. Regardless, this is quite the useful boon, especially if you find yourself pushed on the backfoot. Of course, it would be best not to rely on this so much. Against someone far above you, all this shall do is keep you alive long enough to spot an escape route. In such times, it’ll be up to you to go the rest of the way."
783,,400,"For Every Curse, A Cursed Blessing ",Elden Ring - Limgrave,Modus,"They see these gifts bestowed upon you as a curse, that which was seen as a most glorious blessing in the age before. If such a crucial part of you is seen as a curse, then you shall gladly spread these curses to all. You are a master of curses, capable of defiling the body, mind and souls of your victims to such an extent that it will affect even their children, and their children’s children. The exact nature of these curses are dependent upon what you wish to inflict upon them, and limited only in the power at your disposal."
784,,400,Necessary Substitutions,Disney’s Cinderella,Modus,"If you need horses but don’t have them, what are you to do? Substitute them with mice, obviously. When you don’t have exactly what you need, you can make substitutions without a drop in quality. However the further away from what you require, the more likely you are to fail. A phoenix feather could be replaced with a dragon’s scale or a griffin feather without too much strife. But a chicken feather probably won’t get you more than a mess."
785,,400,Constellation Power,Wizard 101,Modus,"One’s connection to the stars is usually an innately personal thing, and so Astral spells can only be cast on the user. Not so for you, who understands the connections between the stars as well as the stars themselves. You may now cast any Star School spell on any target you wish. Additionally, if two or more allies have the same Aura spell up, you may use the sympathetic connection between them to form a Constellation Aura, which will provide a minor but noticeable increase to the power of the Auras that comprise it, growing more powerful the more Auras are connected."
786,,400,Vampiric Spirit        ,Wizard 101,Modus,"The foul energy of Death may be Life’s polar opposite, but like all two sided coins both have certain commonalities. Death energy is not as good at healing living creatures as Life is, but it can still do so, usually to someone else’s detriment. You have refined this power to a razor’s edge, and now any attack you perform will restore some vitality to you, up to half of the damage done to an enemy returned as healing to you. You may also directly siphon lifeforce from an enemy without an attack, if with significantly reduced potency, which induces a deep lethargy in the target."
787,,400,"A Balance, Unwound",Wizard 101,Modus,"You have been judged, your soul found in balance, and as a consequence you have received a blessing of power. Perhaps uniquely amongst balance mages, or perhaps not, you may refract out the elements bound into your balanced and untyped magics, resulting in a storm of chaotic elemental power that crashes over your foes from even the most minor of balanced spells, gaining in strength and power the more distinct “elements” you have personally come across in your realm wanderings. You may toggle this perk as you desire."
788,,400,Blended Casting,The Owl House,Modus,"Combining schools of magic is punishable by petrification! It also produces incredibly potent effects. I wonder if those two facts are related? You are one of the few witches who can mix different forms of magic and produce useful effects. This is how Eda and Lilith pull off more esoteric spells, like conjuring animated earthworks or sending people inside a person’s mindscape. Like those masters, you can turn disparate forms of magic to your advantage with unmatched versatility! You still have to understand each school of magic you work with, but weaving two or more kinds of magic together will come naturally. This also allows you to combine and coordinate magics from other worlds to enhanced effect!"
789,,400,The Deal Maker,Disney Princess,Modus,"Your magic is greatly enhanced when you strike a deal with someone. The person you make the deal with must be aware that they are making a deal, and what the terms of the deal are. You can also use magic to place a limit on the deal, and if that limit is broken, you can invoke a curse. Example: Trade a princess's voice for giving her functional legs, attach a limit of three days to the spell unless she get's true loves kiss."
790,,400,Shimabara Arts,Hellsing,Modus,"In a world where the powers of good and evil so often clash, there remains more to be seen in the land between. Powers of a mystical nature thrive in the far corners of the world, one such example being the martial arts that mix with mysticism and spiritual arts to create supernaturally deadly techniques. Yumiko of Iscariot has mastered the Shimabara Battouryu, at least in her Yumie state, which includes not only a level of sword wielding not usually seen outside of fanciful movies but outright super-human powers, such as the ability to move and cut as a flash of blue light. 

You yourself have mastered a martial style that reaches into the supernatural in such a way, along with possessing a body trained to fight on a similar playing field as an artificial vampire. Cutting a bullet out of the air or slamming bodily through solid brick walls is the least required to defeat a vampire with merely martial arts."
791,,400,Voodoo Magic,Pirates of the Caribbean,Modus,"The magic of voudun is in your blood. You know a number of rituals, and can understand the rules of the strange magic of the sea. The summoning of maelstroms and the curiosities of finding islands that can’t be found are just matters of a few spells. With sufficient practice and sacrifice, you can even raise the dead, though beware; all magic has a cost, and the sea hates to give back what it takes."
792,,400,Player Guidance,WRECK-IT RALPH,Modus,"With a few moments of effort, you can surrender control of your body to a “Player”, with a focus on completing some specific tasks or goal. The Player will be highly skilled and can make full use of all of your abilities, but while they are controlling you, they will focus only on the task at hand, ignoring anything else, and they aren’t perfect, so it is possible for them to make mistakes and get you injured. You can end this state at will, and it will end automatically when the set task is complete."
793,,400,Magical Ability,Encanto,Modus,"You have a magical ability that is unique to you that is in line with the members of the Madrigal Family in strength and scope. The Madrigal family members' magic is listed in the notes section under each member's information.

794,,400,Hellfire        ,Disney Villains Victorious,Modus,"The power that Villains and Kings draw upon is a dark one indeed. It manifests in many ways - superhuman strength and toughness, an almost hypnotic charisma, the ability to weave powerful black magic, or transformation into beasts of might and magic such as the infamous Maleficent’s dragon form. However it manifests, you can tap into this dark strength to increase your magical, mental or physical prowess by a frightening amount - but at a cost. As you draw upon this power, your mind will be wracked with the raw urges of villainy, wearing down at your sanity and self-control. Abusing this constantly will see that, without resisting this downward slope, you’ll begin to value inflicting cruelty or malice above anything else, even your own life as hatred and spite flow through you without regard for the consequences."
795,,400,Higitus Figitus        ,Disney Villains Victorious,Modus,"Magic’s real, don’t you know? Not that diabolical power the Kings use, either. Magic, the art of working wonders. You’ve got a touch of it with you now, you can use the particular whimsical magic that this land was known for once...the kind of thing that animates furniture, or make a young child’s wish come true, or turns the tides in a show of fireworks and sparks. It’s a fantastical power, but it’s an art, not a science. It just as much relies on heart and song as it does on knowing the chants. Unfortunately, one of the few people who could teach the art proper is either gone or biding his time...so you’ll have to figure out the specifics on your own."
796,,400,Arcane Talents,Bloodborne: Covenants,Modus,"Long has the arcane been out of the reach of mankind, only now harnessed due to the nature of the eldritch being slowly, maddeningly uncovered. Your insights has left you with a nearly unparalleled mastery of arcane energy, at least compared to humans, capable of mimicking the effects of the Blacksky Eye, Augur of Ebrietas and A Call Beyond without any aid. You can even learn to create usable phantasms that can be influenced to produce certain effects, like mimicking spells you know."
797,,400,Doctors Without Dimensions,Marvel Magic,Modus,"See, here's the thing about being a sorcerer: You deal in a lot of strange things in a lot of strange places. You even sometimes find yourself on other worlds. While this is neat and all, if you've been paying attention you'll remember how I mentioned that some spells don't function correctly outside of the dimension you learned them in without extra training. Well now you no longer have to worry about that.

For you, it seems magic really is just magic, despite all the subtle and not-so-subtle differences in the energies. When you cast a spell, so long as there actually is enough magical energy to fuel it, it'll function correctly. For the most part. You'll never have to worry about incompatibility of the ambient energy of different dimensions or whether the magical energy used by one system of magic will function with another, but if you try to push this too far, there could be... unpredictable results. Who knows what would happen if you tried to use magic of pure order to power a spell of chaos or tried to channel holy energy into raising a legion of the damned?"
798,,400,Black Sorceress Supreme ,Dial,Modus,"With this perk, you gain the powers of the Black Queen, Selene Gallio. You inherit her mastery over dark magic, becoming a formidable sorceress. You possess a deep understanding of the arcane arts, allowing you to manipulate and channel dark energies to your will. Your command over dark sorcery grants you the ability to cast powerful spells and curses, harnessing the forces of the occult to shape reality according to your desires. Through your dark sorcery, you can conjure eldritch forces and unleash devastating energy blasts that can obliterate your enemies. You have the power to manipulate shadows, bending them to your will to conceal yourself, create illusions, or ensnare and immobilize your adversaries.

Your connection to the forces of darkness grants you the ability to communicate with spirits and harness their otherworldly powers. You can commune with the dead, channel their energy, and even summon spectral entities to aid you in battle. Your mastery over necromancy allows you to tap into the life force of others, draining their vitality to rejuvenate yourself. This ability grants you longevity, as you can sustain yourself by absorbing the life force of others. Through this process, you can heal your own wounds and replenish your energy, making you incredibly resilient in the face of adversity."
799,,400,Wizard,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Modus,"What if a Wizard from Harry Potter somehow found themselves in the MCU? Well, now you get to find out. You may choose if you are a Canonical Harry Potter Wizard equal to Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald, or if you are a Fanfic level Master of Death Wizard. You have all the expected items necessary."
800,,400,Great Protector Empowerment ,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Modus,"You have been empowered by the Great Protector and have thus gained access to a portion of its powers, enhancing several of your physical attributes including strength, durability, speed and agility as well as being able to freely manipulate air and water. This empowerment has become a part of yourself, making it permanent and disconnected from the Great Protector. You have also mastered the martial art of Ta Lo."
801,,400,Enlightenment,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Modus,"The language of the Mystic Arts is as old as civilization, my friend. The sorcerers of antiquity called the usage of this language ""spells"", but if that word offends your modern sensibility, you can call it 'programs', the source code that shapes reality. Your eyes have been opened, a sight beyond your sight. With it, you may draw from the energies of the Multiverse itself to conjure spells, make magic! This magic is not like the energies of the Asgardians who treat it as another science. No, infinite possibilities exist if you allow yourself to see them, and you are taking the first steps towards those possibilities. It will be an arduous task to move past being a beginner, and no doubt you will be noticed as you pursue your studies. But you have opened your mind... and the wonders of magic will be yours to explore."
802,,400,Blades Are Worthless In The Face Of A Loki Sorcery ,Loki,Modus,"Knives might look nice, but they’re rather useless as they clatter to the floor when your neck’s being snapped. You aren’t so limited, and instead focused your time and effort on mastering magical abilities. This applies to any form of sorcery you possess or learn to harness, allowing you to make solid illusions when you would have normally been limited to insubstantial ones, or creating portals through space to any locations you are familiar with. This focus has vastly increased both your finesse and raw power when it comes to any form of sorcery."
803,,400,Matter Manipulation,Marvel Primal,Modus,"The most versatile power of the Starbrand, you can transmute and reshape matter, to the point of conjuring small living things, or raising a seawall in moments."
804,,400,Ossomancy,Marvel Primal,Modus,"The major thing separating the First Rider from his successors is his power to animate and control the bones of the dead, from forming a whip of spines to raising a skeletal army. This power is now yours."
805,,400,Elemental(400),World War Hulk,Modus,"You can now bend the very elements to your will. Whether it’s lighting, fire, or, wind you can wield this element as if it was a part of you. For 400cp your mastery of your element is equal to that of Storm and the Human Torch. "
806,,400,Why Do You Tremble,Marvel Noir,Modus,"You have no need to. Not when being put to a supernatural test of your morality or worthiness, at least. While normal human means of judging someone’s morality - by observing their actions that is - still work on you, supernatural or super science ones that scan your mind, soul, or somehow review your worth will always come up with you being considered worthy and ‘passing’. If a spider god looks into your soul it will find you worthy, regardless of your actual morality."
807,,400,Sorcerous Skills,Heroes Reborn,Modus,"You have been trained in the working and use of magic. Things like walking through walls, transferring your consciousness into an animal, teleporting people, transforming someone into a tree, recognizing and breaking enchantments, and so forth. You know a great deal of magic and the mystical arts, limited largely by your mystical power, the more power you have the more feats of magic you can perform. Of course your skill is not without limits and some things may be beyond it; you’re not Doctor Strange, but if you could equal Loki’s power you could equal his magic as well."
808,,400,Cutting Loose         ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Modus,"It’s no secret that Thor holds back when he’s fighting, most people other than Tony Stark realize this. But few realize just how much power he has when he really cuts loose. This perk doesn’t give you the raw power of Thor, but you’ll be able to really cut loose now.

You now possess a mental dimmer switch for your own powers and capabilities, easily reducing them even all the way down to normal human levels; this dimmer switch is about restraining your full potential, it won’t let you turn off limitations, weaknesses, or vulnerabilities. While this can help you avoid collateral damage, it does more than that. See what’s important is when you stop holding back. When you restrain yourself it seems like you build up a sort of charge, and the longer and more habitually you hold back even in the face of danger and threats the bigger this charge will become. And when you fully cut loose this charge is released, pushing you above what would be your normal levels of abilities. If you usually held back the power to make continent spanning storms to merely something like a city, you might manage to briefly make a world spanning one.

This full release is draining however. You are pushing yourself to and well beyond your normal maximum exertion, forcing out your energy in a short burst of beyond peak performance. But when you need the power it can be well worth it."
809,,400,White Witch,Amalgam Comics,Modus,"By speaking backwards, you can alter probability, causing massively unlikely events to occur via chaos magic. Speaking backwards comes quite naturally to you."
810,,400,Cosmic Host,Avengers Vs X-Men,Modus,"Everyone’s born with the potential to be special in them. Some people’s potential is just a little more cosmic than others. You for example, have the potential to be an exceptional container for all sorts of cosmic things. Power sources, entities, forces or objects of a cosmic nature just find you all too fitting. Not only are you exceptionally good at containing cosmic power or entities or objects, letting you easily handle much more than most people can store with far less problems and drawbacks, you also appear to attract such things to you. It won’t happen without reason or action on your part but if you and a few groups of other people are all standing around an exploding cosmic entity that sends fragments of itself into those around it, you’ve got a very high chance of getting one of those fragments and a small chance of more than one too. This all said, while the downsides are reduced and you can fit a lot in you, neither of these are perfect. You’ll find yourself far less influenced emotionally than others might be but you’ll still be affected in some way and while you can store a lot more than most, don’t try stuffing multiple cosmic power sources down your throat without seeing if it’ll be too much for you first. "
811,,400,The Star Brand,Marvel Cosmic,Modus,"A strange explosive event known as a White Event, that may or may not have killed everyone around you, has blessed you with the powers of the Star Brand. Possessing the Star Brand marks you as a protector of worlds. You have superhuman strength and nigh invulnerability, you can fly at FTL outside of an atmosphere and faster than sound in one. You can manipulate matter and energy at a quantum level and discharge powerful energy blasts that at their absolute maximum can shatter planets. When enraged you can temporarily assume a form of pure cosmic energy that enhances your abilities. You also have a cosmic awareness that can give you a general sense of when people are producing irregularities on a cosmic scale."
812,,400,Cryokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Chill out; you bring cold and frost wherever you go, and can shoot cold energy that freezes even the air and will leave your enemies in the cold. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
813,,400,Chlorokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Nature’s wrath at your fingertips; you can control and rapidly grow plant life, causing trees and brambles to block, bind, and batter your foes. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
814,,400,Electrokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"You’re like a bolt of lightning; you can control and harness the power of electricity to fry your enemies, and can utilize a small amount of bioelectricity when actual electricity isn’t available. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
815,,400,Audiokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Feel the vibrations; you’ve learned to amplify and dampen sound, allowing you to scream or clap loud enough to cause internal bleeding, or quieting nearby noises. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
816,,400,Hydrokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Water dances at your request, rising up to bind your enemies or batter them into submission. The purer the water, the quicker and more precise your control, and with experience your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
817,,400,Geokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"The earth moves at your command, launching rocks with great force or causing small, localized quakes around you. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect."
818,,400,Pyrokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"Fire follows your word, and you can spontaneously create flames or enlarge or smother existing flames. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect. "
819,,400,Aerokinesis,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Modus,"You can bend the air to your will, creating small whirlwinds, using the wind to throw off the aim of your enemies, and launching air with enough force to cause cuts and bruises or throw your enemies off their feet. With experience, your control will become more precise and have a greater area of effect. "
820,,400,Air Specialization - Pressurebending,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"You have learned a unique form of Airbending invented right before the Genocide, utilizing a combination of wind and movement of air to create areas of extremely highly pressure. By preventing these areas from equalizing by surrounding it in a shell of high-speed wind, the pressure within these shells causes the air within to act as if it was solid, effectively letting you create short-lived objects. This art can also be used to create extreme low- pressure zones, and if you master it, you may even be able to create true vacuums.

821,,400,Earth Specialization - Metalbending,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Modus,"Long thought to be impossible, you are able to sense and Bend the tiniest impurities of earth within metal, target them, and use them to bend the metal itself. Though much more difficult than Earthbending, mastery of this art will enable you to move and shape metal objects as you please, tearing through solid steel like it was tissue paper or tossing tanks like childrens' toys. However, as an Earthbending specialty, this will only work on metals with impurities; completely pure metal will forever be out of your ability to control.

822,,400,Marrying the Magics,Fate/Zero,Modus,"In your studies of magic, your research led you to discover a unique ability. You are able to alter the rules or any spell or ritual in a single way. That is, you can allow others to take on any costs associated with the magic alongside you. This may not be forced on others, they must willingly accept the costs alongside you, but once a willing partner is found, it allows you to split or share the costs in whatever fractions you both agree on. Wish to share the cost between two people, each with half the energy? Sure. Want to have another person take the entire burden? Long as they agree."
823,,400,Mystic Eyes ,Fate,Modus,"Well, you have Special Eyes after all don't you? You've now got the chance to pick one of the
following mystic eyes, though they may take some time to get use to. Just make sure you get the right brand, yeah?
-Binding
These eyes allow the user to cast a fairly strong suggestion spell with just eye contact. However this effect can be negated by running mana or energy though ones own body. 
-Charm 
These mystic eyes are very similar to the facial mark was once possessed by Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. It distorts the targets perceptions, so that they view the user as incredibly attractive and sexually appealing. 
-Flame
These eyes are capable of igniting the point the wielder is looking at, or, with some strain, producing a gout of fire from the users eyes. 
-Illusion
These eyes are able to place the target under an illusion with but a passing meeting of the eyes. However, it can only create an illusion that covers one of the senses at first, though you may
eventually get up to all 5 senses at a time. They are draining to use for long periods or with multiple targets however."
824,,400,High Speed Incantations ,Fate,Modus,"A rare and much sought after skill, one possessed by the Blue herself. This skill allows you to cast Magecraft incantations in half the time, regardless of their length or complexity, while retaining the full power of the spell. "
825,,400,Intercept Spells,Toaruverse,Modus,Waiting for the opponent to finish their incantations is very stupid but you can find that many people in this world and beyond still do it but not you. When any of your opponents try cast a spells you immediately know how to counter it even before they manage to say the first words either by hijacking the spell formula and causing the magic to go berserk to hurt your opponents or outright cancel it along with ability to predict when your opponents would try to cast a spell. This also applies to any kind of magic or abilities that needed time and incantations to be used.
826,,400,The True Hybrid,Toaruverse,Modus,Being able to use both Esper ability and Magic is very awesome but using even one of those powers damage you is not a very nice feeling. Unlike certain someone your modification is complete and successful making the first true hybrid user of Magic and Esper ability this allows you to use both Esper ability and Magic without receiving any nasty side-effects. This also gives you protection and immunity to the abilities or powers that you have that gives a nasty side-effect even when used correctly and perfectly. This also allows you to use or combine two or more incompatible systems or energies without problem should you acquire them in the future. This allows you to take both Magic System and Esper Ability
827,,400,Dark Dreams,Darkest Dungeon ,Modus,"“Great adversity has a beauty- it is the fire that tempers.” It is no surprise that even the realm of sleep is not a comfort in this place. Some are more tormented than others, and while a feathery pillow or a prayer of penance is enough to leave others snug in bed some nightmares were meant to be slain, not appeased. When sleeping, you may choose to transport yourself and up to three others into your mind to confront the troubles facing you, in the form of twisted, nightmarish creatures. The injuries you face here are real enough- though “dying” will merely leave you nearly dead in reality- and the burden on your own mind at playing host to such fiends will be great. But should your party defeat the apparitions you will all reap great rewards, feeling a renewed sense of purpose that lessens the burden of fighting the real monsters while also strengthening the body for a time. And littered around the bedding or fading campfire will be arcane treasures reminiscent of the nightmares you slew, lost artifacts returned to you with new and strange powers, and other suitable gifts of arms and armor that can be made of use to you or your comrades."
828,,400,Mystical Moonlight ,Bayonetta,Modus,"The night time is scary to many people, and not just because of the darkness. It's because of what could be inside that darkness... the horrors and demonic forces that could lay within. The moonlight itself does nothing to damper this fear, for it is a cursed light... except for you. You are empowered by the moonlight whenever you bask in its kind light, gaining wallwalking and your magical abilities increasing along with a greater control over shadow and shapeshifting. You may even bless weapons with these aspects, allowing the darkness to spread. The Shadow Remains Cast."
829,,400,Luminous Sunshine,Bayonetta,Modus,"A thing lately is that 'holy' is involved with light. 'Holy' is also associated with fire. You now embody these very aspects, being empowered by the sun whenever you are in its golden rays. Along with noticeably enhanced magical ability and wallwalking, you gain a greater control over abilities relating to light and fire along with a few spells relating to them... and can even bless weapons with these aspects, so that the darkness can be burned away. Let There Be Light."
830,,400,Wuju Style,League of Legends ,Modus,"A graceful martial art famed throughout Ionia, Wuju Style focuses on speed and agility over brute power. You can use your ki to heal your wounds by meditating, and you can also focus it into pure speed- You can strike many times in a second, and by focusing your energy on pure speed you can move so fast you're barely perceptible to the naked eye and impossible to slow."
831,,400,Wyrd Knowledge,A Throne of Glass,Modus,"Wyrdmarks are the oldest and greatest power in existence. Not truly magic, this ancient runic language underlies all of reality, there seems to be almost no limits on what they can achieve, so long as you know the proper marks. They are a neutral and potent power, able to achieve great good, and great evil. Wyrdmarks allow their wielders to summon and speak to the spirits of the dead, see into and travel between worlds/dimensions, create wards, summon or banish monsters from other dimensions, heal, and even more. Wyrdmarks are usually cast by writing them on a surface and then activating them with fresh blood from a living being. You however have a fluency both verbal and written with wyrdmarks on the level Nehemia Ytger, able to cast the marks using nothing but their names and some of your stamina. You possess an encyclopaedic knowledge of these marks and are so fluent in them that you can actively use them in combat. Able to cast by simply tracing the marks in the air or speaking their names, along with a bit of willpower. With some practice you can even learn how to use magic or other powers you possess, if you possess any, to power the activation of the marks instead of your blood or stamina. Wyrdmarks have been shown to potentially be able to resurrect the dead, although that sort of behaviour draws the attention of greater beings who do not appreciate their lessers messing with the natural order of things."
832,,400,Breath of Death,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"A new and terrifying form of breath. Your life Wyrm Familiar can now Breath Change into the Petrification, Insanity, and Instant Death breath-types, with accompanying changes to the Wyrm Familiar spell you are capable of casting.

Requires Wyrm Familiar(Super Dragon Sword) and Breath Change(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase "
833,,400,Was This your Card?,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"Now this is something else. You are capable of making a retaliatory attack against anyone who casts a spell or has a positive status effect put on them in battle. This attack, if successful, has a moderate chance of allowing you to cast the spell that was just “stolen” by that attack for the rest of the battle, or remove the beneficial status effect and place it on yourself."
834,,400,Vermaximum,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You have reached the extent of what has been archived of both White and Black magic, with any further lessons requiring a visit to Rasputin himself…You are capable of wielding White Magic in such proficiency that you are capable of casting Revive, as well as removing magical status effects such as Frog and Curse. Speaking of which, your Black Magic knowledge allows you to inflict basic magical status effects such as Poison and Confusion, as well as the second tier of elemental attack spells."
835,,400,As Above,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"Your Magnum Opus. Quite simply, this magical theory allows you to “invert” the logic of a spell - revival spells become the Instant Death status effect spell, damaging spells become healing, and so on. If the spell has multiple axes on which it can be inverted, you can choose such: perhaps you transform a air attack spell into an earth spell. Or maintain it’s Air aspect and make it a heal instead."
836,,400,Inscription,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"It is not enough to merely retell the same stories. You must forge new ones. You are capable of now “Fusing” Archives into entirely new skills, taking elements of both to create something new. Often, these new skills will be weaker, but they can become new and unprecedented fusions of previous abilities. Being original, these fused abilities are permanently usable, though their component skills can no longer be Relived.

837,,400,Kill the Lights,Super Dragon Sword,Modus,"You can’t be caught off your game, if you want to win the bounty hunting game. You have the capability of modifying your weapons to inflict the “Life/Magic/Power Break” status effects - a curse-like effect that reduces their maximum stamina, damage capacity, and magical potential with each successive strike. This curse wears off at the end of combat, but there shouldn’t be an end that doesn’t end with their death, if you’re doing it right."
838,,400,Magic,King Arthur ,Modus,"A Rare power within this world with only 1 in 10000 normal humans having the power allowing it's user to bring things into being using Pure willpower and the stamina of the caster. Throwing fire balls, constructing a sword, making it rain, all basic powers that can be acquired easily, but a wizard isn't an unlimited battery of power, more complicated spells take more power and are therefore harder to use. That said with enough willpower and energy there are very few things you couldn't achieve."
839,,400,Shaman  ,King Arthur ,Modus,"People seek power in many different ways and forms. Some pray to gods, some sacrifice to demons, and some even risk speaking to fairies. You however look to nature and it's guardian spirits. These mysterious beings are almost everywhere and are a good source of information. Information however is not the only thing these beings gift you. You may call upon their power to revert organic beings to their original state, healing them from even the most grievous wounds. Among other things they've also granted you the ability to create barriers, usually in the shape of a box or wall though with practice and a little creativity they can take the shape of almost anything. The final gift that the guardians have given you is a special technique. If you draw a circle with a hole in the middle, fill it with water, and place an emerald in the middle of it, any unnatural creatures will be trapped inside. The seal is indefinite but can be destroyed from the outside, which will then release the creature inside. These three gifts while powerful were made to protect nature. So while you may use them however you want, when you use them with the intention of protecting nature they receive a small boost in power."
840,,400,Exceptional ,Dresden Files,Modus,"There is more to magic than just having power and casting spells or making potions. Beyond what everyone can do, there’s all the things that can be used to rise above the crowd, to be... well, exceptional. Some are born with the stuff, others have to get it the hard way.

You have such a thing yourself now. Maybe you’re simply absurdly powerful, as far beyond Harry Dresden as he is beyond ordinary wizards. Maybe you have unbelievably good control over your magic, being able to multitask and multicast like the Archive or the most effective, skilled of Wizards out there.

Could be that you’re just brilliant at making enchanted items or potions to obscene, insane degrees. Or perhaps you have something like Mortimer Lindquist’s ability with spirits, or Listens-to-Wind’s talents, only exaggerated to extreme levels. This can even take the form of a contract with some Nevernever entity providing you something like Summer or Winter magic, a demon giving you Hellfire or an Angel allowing you to use Soulfire.

Long story short, this is a major magical ability that enhances your magical skills directly in depth and scope, especially since you can develop it far beyond what you get to start with. If you buy it without being a wizard it would make you a minor power all by itself.

Needless to say, this can be bought as many times as you want.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
841,,400,Troll Magic,Frozen,Modus,"The secret magics of the trolls are now yours to command. You won’t be freezing over kingdoms with this but it should still prove to be useful enough. You can heal others to a degree, such as healing serious bodily wounds or significantly weakening powerful curses on people, and alter memories precisely such as changing what one object appeared to be in someone’s memory of a specific event, though this does take time to do these memory changes, especially for larger scale ones."
842,,400,"""Fire and Frost"" ",Dark Souls 3,Modus,"The Pontiff Sulyvahn left the Painted World long ago, and discovered a profaned flame that lit an ambition for power in the young sorcerer’s heart. Becoming a confidant of the royal family of Lothric, he became the first of the scholars of the Grand Archives and conducted research on a variety of subjects and ancient magics. Now as one of the most powerful sorcerers in this world he wields a flaming, profaned greatsword in one hand, and another greatsword that supposedly channels the power of the moon in the other- yet is tinged with Dark deeper than any moon. In much the same way, Sister Friede holds the power of both frost and dark flame within her. These energies are contradictory to each other- or antagonistic at the very least- yet neither has difficulty wielding their chosen weapons or sorceries. You, too, have discovered the art of wielding multiple magics and energies at the same time, which has a few benefits- namely, that your contradictory powers no longer contradict each other. Wield fire in one hand and ice in the other, or the power of the occult and the power of the gods at the same time. Second of all, you will find that you are able to “buff” your weapons with magical energies that you possess, without the use of catalyst; these “buffs” are longer lasting than the spells other clerics, wizards, and pyromancers wield, and will usually last through even a prolonged battle without needing to be reapplied. If purchased with “Magical Attunement” your deeper connection to magic will allow you to take this a step further, allowing you to use your weapons as a catalyst for casting magic. It is possible that, with time, you will even develop techniques that utilize your weapon and sorceries to create shockwaves of energy when you strike, or even for you to project your slices as cutting waves of magic."
843,,400,"""Twisted Faith""",Dark Souls 3,Modus,"Archdeacon McDonnell, Aldritch's staunchest supporter, heralded the twisting of Aldritch's Faithful and their faith into something profane. He delighted in their slowly stagnating souls, for to him it represented the glorious bedrock of the world. By purchasing this, your once pure faith has been twisted into something strange and powerful. You may channel the strength of your beliefs not only into Miracles, as is holy and natural, but also soul born powers such as Sorcery. Ordinarily, long periods of study and a strong mind would be needed to cast such spells to their fullest potential, but by believing in your own ability to cast a spell, you can bridge these gaps. The more complex and powerful the spell, and the less you know of how to perform it, the more taxing it is on your body and soul however. If ""Miracles"" was purchased, your twisted faith has warped your soul into something dark and heavy, and imparts these properties on Sorcery and other powers of the soul. Additionally, you have gained great affinity for ""Deep"" Miracles and Sorceries. Knowledge of how to perform basic spells and Miracles aligned with ""The Deep"" such as the ""Deep Soul"" Sorcery (which projects dark, heavy human dregs) or the ""Gnaw"" Miracle (which summons a small swarm of flesh eating insects) has been granted as well."
844,,400,“Lord Splinter”,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Gwyn split his lord soul, linked to light, many times during his reign. Large chunks were given to the likes of Archduke Seath and the Four Kings of New Londo. All gods carry some shred of his light within them though. You have a larger piece of the original Lord Soul, a nice splinter instead of some scraping. As a result, you have a special affinity for Miracles associated with Gwyn and his children, as well as elemental abilities relating to Light and Lightning. Even without prior knowledge of miracles, you should be able to pick them up with natural talent, especially lightning spear Miracles. Passively, you can also bestow your weapons and armor with arcing electrical might that grows in potency with the power of your soul or summon piercing rays of light."
845,,400,Bloodborne,Bloodborne,Modus,"“Before the healing church was founded, there was a man named Laurence. Laurence, a scholar of Byrgenwerth, had the same ambition of ascendance as his fellow scholars. The only difference was the desired path, one placing faith in the power of the old blood. 

Laurence never found the means to evolve by way of blood, never uncovering the hidden depths of the old blood’s miraculous qualities. In you, is a trait unseen in this world, one you alone will acquire if you so choose to pay appropriately; a trait that awakens latent potential in your blood. 

The effects of Bloodborne are variable and many depending on the kind of blood you possess. As a hunter however, no matter what other choices you made, you will find your innate abilities relating to Blood Bullets to be vastly improved.

Instead of being limited to a hand full of bullets at a time, you could make four times as many. Instead of just bullets, you could make caltrops and knives that could handle combat. Instead of just the creation of objects, you can enhance weaponry, extending the edges of blades or faces of hammers. 

The Bloodborne trait also enhances your latent healing qualities somewhat, Good Hunter. It is nothing you would notice day to day, but you will recover lost blood far faster. The losses incurred from making blood bullets may be healed up in a matter of minutes with no external aid.

If you have some other form of special quality in your blood, even something small, previously hidden or dormant facets of those qualities will come to the surface. It is because of that power, that Bloodborne acts as a ‘Booster.’ 

As a ‘Booster,’ Bloodborne will unlock new powers relating to any Tier 3 Talents you purchased. Those of ‘Vileblood’ may gain near magical qualities relating to their forbidden blood, while those with ‘Beast’s Strength’ could gain more wretched traits. For full details, see the ‘Notes’ section at the bottom.”"
846,,400,Stormcaller,Elden Ring,Modus,"So much of Stormveil’s history and culture have been lost, that few remember there’s a martial power to be found in the tempests blowing throughout it. You are not just an exception, but a prodigious talent when it comes to developing new fighting techniques worthy of being passed down as Ashes of War that command and channel the wind. From spinning your weapon to create surrounding blasts of air powerful enough to cut through armour, to forming a wall of wind by swinging your shield that can deflect arrows or blades, to creating a localised cyclone with a stomp your power over the wind is the mark of a true warrior. Finally, you are also able to forge weapons and armour with similar powers-and are gifted at replicating enchantments similar to the fierce winds you direct. With great effort and study, you might be able to forge a weapon such as the Serpent-Hunter capable of projecting a blade of wind (or light) capable of shearing through particularly resilient foes’ hides."
847,,400,Kinjalli’s Caller,MtG - Ixalan,Modus,"The Sun Empire has always opposed the forces of the night, so their mastery of sunlight itself has allowed them to use it as a flexible tool - capable of using the light of a sun as a magical forcefield - allowing for binding, shielding, and striking with both shields and lashes of solid sunlight."
848,,400,Power of the Gods,MtG - Amonkhet,Modus,"You stand above and beyond mere mortals, in more ways than one. While magical improvement is hard won for mortal mages, for you it really is as simple as applying more power. By channeling extra mana into said abilities, you may proportionally enhance them. Proportional to what you’re capable of doing with that energy, that is. This operates even better when used to boost more advanced spells and mightier abilities, particularly those of divine or holy origins and natures, which ensures pursuing power the normal way will always be more efficient, but this ability allows you to improve with no upper limit. A spell to hurl a fireball could be made to fly further, burn hotter, and burn a larger area with extra mana. A spell normally applied via physical touch can be made to affect a distant target, or even multiple targets. Your magic can be made harder to counter and harder to resist. You can similarly augment your other supernatural abilities as well as items, even those from other worlds, though if they are fueled by power pools other than mana then you must use an appropriate type of energy. Those that do not require such fuel at all can be enhanced with mana, or with spiritual or magical energies from their home settings."
849,,400,Seasonal Spellcraft,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"The natural magics of the Wilds tend to manifest in some notable ways, one of the most common is magic reflecting the cycles of nature - day and night for one, but another is the four seasons. You have the blessing of one of the seasons - Spring granting nature magic that allows for you to control vines and tall grass and coax mana from natural growth, Summer granting heat-generation as well as allowing you to have yourself or others enter a ‘blood haze’ berserk trance, Fall giving the ability to conjure feasts, manipulate and change the colors of leaves as well as the summoning of spirits and scarecrow constructs, with Winter finally giving you snow and ice creation.

May be purchased multiple times."
850,,400,Frogify,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"The archetypal faerie ability, and one favored by witches quite as well. You are capable of casting a spell that transforms something into a different form, often a human into an animal, but there are stories of those who transform animals into human or faerie forms...While it’s possible for willpower alone to shake off ‘permanent’ transformations, those with ways to transform back (such as by giving a long apology or true love’s kiss) are much harder to resist, with more ‘tangible’ cures being harder to resist even for powerful loremages."
851,,400,Anaba Shamanism ,MtG - Homelands,Modus,"Trained by a remote tribe of minotaurs free from the influence of any other societies, you have been taught of their ancestral arts. That of the spirit crafters, in tune with the spirits of their ancestors and keepers of the stories that have been passed down the tribe through the generations. Using their techniques you may speak with the spirits, use ashes for divination, foretell the future in your dreams, and beseech the ancestral spirits for greater boons. 

And the more direct magic of the shamans, in tune with the weather and the mana of the mountains. Where the spirit crafter works with the ancestor spirits, the shaman is much more involved with talking with storms. They lead the tribe in ceremonies, and learn secrets from wind spirits. And like every true shaman, you have gained the ability to call lightning down upon your enemies and control the powers of the storm with your magic."
852,,400,Temporal Adept ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"Time is a fickle and unpredictable thing - just because most people do not directly sense it beyond ‘then’ and ‘now’ does not mean there is far more lurking beneath the surface... Blue magic is one of the only styles that regularly involves itself with the manipulation of time, and you are a true master of such magics and abilities. From the most basic ‘Unsummon’ effects to unmake ongoing magical effects on up to magical maelstroms that rewind time across an entire battlefield, you will find that casting and developing spells harnessing this potent resource is much easier for you. Your talents also allow you to detect anyone else’s alterations to the timeline, and though you might need to investigate to learn more details, you’ll usually be able to figure out what was changed and where the source of the disruption is - not to mention how to undo the effects."
853,,400,Manifestation ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"The volatile nature of mana means that even the effects of spells that are considered ‘Permanent’ are not truly so. Though long-lasting to the point a battle will be long over before a spell collapses, very few mages are capable of sustaining a spell indefinitely once cast. Those who try quickly falter under the mental and arcane strain the attempt would inevitably involve. But that is not to say it’s impossible entirely. Rather, converting the semi-temporary effects of, for example, a summoned creature into a truly permanent magical servant or bodyguard is possible with sufficient time, effort and mana. You have learned this process as well, and can now convert any spell you know into such a permanent state. Doing so will require lengthy rituals and vast amounts of power even for the most basic spells, and you’ll rarely be able to do so without at least several days of preparation. However, the investment can be very worthwhile - being able to start a mage-duel with a White Knight, Hypnotic Specter or Mana Flare enchantment to bolster you can be a major advantage compared to starting with nothing, for example.

Do note, however - once made permanent such ‘spells’ will only partially lose their innate nature as a magical effect. They retain their vulnerability to effects that might otherwise affect them, including those reliant on their nature as a magical spell (such as a Control Magic spell). These permanent copies will not automatically reform once destroyed any more than their temporary variants do, and each must be made anew if lost in battle or otherwise destroyed - they cannot be ‘re-cast’ like their original, temporary blueprints can be. That said, there is no limit to how many you may craft: you do not ‘lose’ the original spell, merely using it as a blueprint for the creation of your permanent creature, artifact, enchantment, or whatever else you decide to manifest."
854,,400,REPLICATE ,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"Why cast only one spell when you could cast two? Lots of mages find it difficult to cast two spells simultaneously. It’s harder to focus, you’re more likely to miss, all sorts of problems can occur. But multitasking is child’s play for the Izzet, so why should spells be any different? You find it much easier to cast multiple spells at once, whether they be the same spell or different ones."
855,,400,TRANSMUTE,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"Adaptability is key for mages, particularly ones involved in dubious business. You need to be able to change what you’re doing on the fly. If you have another spell of similar power to one you have prepared, or even one you’ve already cast, you can swap them out at-will. This changes the spell entirely, utterly confusing anyone trying to prepare for one spell and finding a totally different spell heading at them. This won’t work if the two spells aren’t of a similar power level."
856,,400,Research Matters,MtG - New Phyrexia,Modus,"The arcane and the divine are no different from the studies of metal and flesh- as the Core Augur researches them to further what he has called the Great Synthesis, so too do you have gained insights into them, and broadened your horizons. You now find it much easier to combine different fields of study, such as necromancy and divine magic, or pyromancy and phyrexian grafts, into a single project to carry out- something like a corpse animated by white or red mana, or a graft that allows for easy use of pyromancy."
857,,400,The Way Of The World,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Modus,"All across Kamigawa, reaching from the depths of the spirit realm into the furthest corners of the mortal realm, there are more enchantments woven into the world than there are stars in the sky. Portions of the world that are so soaked in magic they’re less of a place and more of a person, and the thousand and one sagas that the Living Historians have attempted to memorize. Thanks to your own training in these arts, you will find that your own affinity for these forms of widespread magics is vastly enhanced, allowing you to simultaneously cast those same spells for less energy and enhance those of your allies - there are more than a few people and beings in this day and age that have traded away their flesh for something better, magic that seeps so far into them they almost cease to be a mortal. Magic that you can latch onto, and empower."
858,,400,Kanji Magic ,MtG - Kamigawa,Modus,"Kanji are somewhat like Kami, weirdly enough, in that they represent things and concepts. When given power through both their innate symbolism and Mana a proper Kanji Mage could do things like bind a Kami’s powers into the written symbols, create massive wards able to house blizzards in a single location, alter the targets of curses and spells, as well as many other things. You have both an innate talent for the use of Kanji Magic as well as it’s teachings, allowing you to figure it out and even maybe teach it to others.

Kanji Magic is limited by some odd things though. Like with many languages, Kanji has it own personal forms of syntax and grammar, and this is reflected in the use of the magic. Basically if you don’t know WHAT to say you can’t get the effect you want. In addition, Kanji Magic is fueled by Mana and symbolic meaning held innately within it’s medium of writing. The life- blood of a mage is a strong default, able to reflect a killing blow back upon the murderer, but something rare and powerful like a princesses tears would net much greater results for less mana, like sealing a Blizzard Kami’s Powers into yourself so that you can use them for a while."
859,,400,Treefolk Magic,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"Treefolk character and roles are largely determined by their plant species. Ash, birch, oak, rowan, and black poplar all have different roles in treefolk society. And aside from their appearance and build, the biggest signifier of this is the magic they wield. Each species of tree has their own type of treefolk magic and though technically nothing prevents them from learning other types, they tend to stick to the tree lore they are most suited to.

And suited to it you are, talented and knowledgeable in the magical lore of the treefolk, with the benefit of decades of education by the elders of your birth-grove. Depending on your species of tree, this can take different forms. Whether you are an expert at summoning magic like the mysterious rowans, the dark and poisonous magic of yew trees, or even the obscure shamanistic magic used by the black poplar Doran to turn the natural durability of treefolk into their greatest advantage. Should you wish to, you may purchase this multiple times at a discount to learn additional styles of treefolk magic."
860,,400,Ferry Magic ,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"What most denizens of Lorwyn call ""ferry magic"" is indeed magical, a gift from an ancient merrow who had mastered the art of manipulating water. These days, the magic is so much a part of the merrow as a people that its use feels natural as breathing, even to a novice.

But it is the ability to shape water into functional and beautiful forms that separated the ferrymen from the fry. Experienced ferrymen can create elaborate ferries of shapewater, holding it in these magically-solid forms for as long as necessary for whatever journey they’ve been hired to perform. Along with a practical tricks like shapewater breathing masks or bubbles of air for any landwalkers you’re taking down into the depths.

With your skill at these tideshaping arts you would be one of the more talented ferrymen if you ever decided to ply your trade on the rivers, and your swimming expertise does not lag behind. You could swim faster than most landwalkers could ever move by combining your movements with tideshaping, and effortlessly maintain balance with deft maneuvering through dueling currents, even as you enter the exact point in the river's tumultuous course where they meet. An art most merrow never needed to perfect, but one that was key to the ferryman's manipulation of the currents of magic."
861,,400,Swamp Magic,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"Now, the Boggarts might not have been the smartest or the most learned, but they still have a certain kind of ingenuity to them. A skill of improvisation that allows them to come up with magic as disgusting as it is deadly, and as the newest shaman of your warren, your skills are counted amongst the evidence of this. Launching stinking balls of fodder at their enemies, or burning tar for that extra crispy experience. Though such spontaneous magic, as impromptu as the weaponry they cobble together, is hardly the greatest use of boggart magic. Through the practice of weirding magic, shamans can split an existing boggart in two, both the right and left sides of the creature turning into new boggarts to swell the warren's ranks. They only need half a brain anyway.

But perhaps the most interesting of boggart magics ties into their beliefs of life and death. Unafraid of death in their shenanigans, boggarts believe they will be reincarnated as newborns if their curiosity gets out of hand. Usage of these mystical boggart birth rites allows you to reincarnate fallen warren mates as squalling newborns, primarily so they might tell you what they saw and felt in the beyond. You could even set up a rite in advance to bring yourself back from death, though such a feat would only work once a decade and still leaves you a helpless newborn. Not the best way to find new sensations. Maybe only try it once."
862,,400,Vinebreeder ,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"Elfish magic is the magic of the forest, wielded by the druids of the Blessed Nation to improve, cultivate, and if necessary, rearrange nature. You could serve the hunting packs as a battle druid. Launching dark green energy to kill a dozen fearies in an instant, drying them to twigs before they have time to squeal, or using greater magic to deal with larger pests. But your more impressive talent lies with vinebreeding, the complicated practice of intermingling magical, thorny nettlevines with living creatures, producing living works of art that can be easily controlled like puppets. Elves used these vinebred beasts and warriors to help them secure their position of power in the world. The mere threat that those who opposed the elves risked becoming vinebred themselves was one of the reasons, perhaps the main reason, that the elves ruled most of Lorwyn.

If you wished, you could accept the embrace of the nettlevines yourself. Covering your body in a complicated network of nettlevines below your robes, shielding your chest with a breastplate of wood, and improving your strength and speed and focus immensely. Normally the use of the parasitic plant would shorten your lifespan to a matter of months, but with your skill the affliction is more of a symbiotic partnership."
863,,400,Sangromancy,MtG - Innistrad,Modus,"A condition of the blood, they call that which makes vampires into vampires. And as such they are quite skilled in magics of the blood. With this you gain the dark powers to utilize blood. To steal the life from others, to bestow long lasting curses, and to seize control of the minds of others for yourself."
864,,400,Awakened Savant ,Warbreaker,Modus,"When you hold a lot of Investiture for any real length of time, it changes you. You make much more efficient use of Breath, not enough to do with one Breath the work of twenty, but maybe to do the work of twenty Breath with only fifteen. Besides this, the peripheral benefits of each Heightening never fade below the level of Breath you purchased here, so you can keep that perfect pitch even as a Drab."
865,,400,Ruler of the Elements ,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Modus,"Every baleful beastie needs to command control of it’s enviroment. The great icey birds of prey near the mountains; beasts capable of calling down horrific blizzards with a beat of their wings. The legendary Sirens controlling the water with the pulse and melody of their song. You can now count yourself among these beasts who have tremendous control over an element. (This can only be a traditional element, not something like Space, Time, or the Stars. Something like storms would be OK.)"
866,,400,Master of Rat-narok ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Modus,"Among the Four Heavenly Generals in Barbarossa’s service, the abilities of the one known as Rotter might be the least suited for combat, especially when his peers include a nigh-unkillable living suit of armour and a world-class assassin. That’s not to say his powers are useless, though – far from it, as you’ll be able to see for yourself now that you have a similar powerset to him. You have an incredibly powerful bond with rats, allowing you to mentally communicate with any of these vermin within a mile radius and perceive the world through their senses. Though this obviously makes you a spymaster without peer, you’re also able to command rats with your thoughts, potentially directing swarms numbering in the thousands with remarkably fine control.

Strangely, a bit disgustingly too, you can also use this ability to fuse with large swarms of rats, taking on a new form of an enormous, monstrous rat. The rats you fused with act almost as a shell surrounding your actual body, which is hidden away at this form’s core, ensuring that any attacks that fail to make penetrate to the core don’t actually harm you, but instead kills the component rats instead. On top of this increased survivability, taking on this transformation also grants you enhanced strength, enough to send a man flying through a stone pillar (though not enough to stand up to an assimilated Household Vessel user), and a tail coated with a lethal venom that rapidly eats away at any flesh it is exposed to."
867,,400,Freak Show,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Modus,"The Sham Lash of Parthevia are a bit of an unusual bunch, especially seeing how many of their members seem to be poorly-adjusted, borderline psychopathic child soldiers. But it’s not just mental eccentricities that their members possess, but physical ones too. Two of their assassins in particular, Mahad and Vittel, have some rather extraordinary biological quirks – quirks which you too can possess.

You may now choose between having incredible strength or inhuman reach. By choosing the former, you seem to have gained superhuman physical power, your muscles becoming capable of bulking up and becoming denser in response to adversity, allowing you to tunnel through solid stone with your bare hands as if it were paper even if you were only of average strength beforehand. Though staying ‘bulked up’ for too long can be tiring, you’ll be able to train to retain this superhuman strength for longer. If you choose the latter option instead, your limbs become capable of extending to incredible lengths, entangling and constricting your foes or swinging them like whips that can slice through marble pillars.

You may purchase this perk a total of twice, choosing a different option each time."
868,,400,Magoi Manipulator ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Modus,"It’s not very well known around here, but Magicians aren’t the only people who are capable of wielding Magoi. There exists a small tribe known as the Yambala Gladiators who have learned how to manipulate the Magoi in their own body to an extent, and it seems you have learned this skill too. Unlike magic, Magoi Manipulation is a fair bit more limited, only able to affect oneself, the items you’re holding, or somebody you’re touching, but that’s not to say it isn’t a versatile power. On the contrary, Magoi Manipulation has been shown to be able to achieve a variety of effects, such as counteracting magic others have cast on you, covering a weapon in a layer of your Magoi to make it supernaturally sharp and durable, or being able to diagnose someone’s illnesses through physical contact and perform some minor healing. It’s even been shown that this power allows one to master their Metal Vessel with a great deal more ease.

However, Magoi Manipulation is not without its risks. Since it uses the Magoi, and thus life force, found within one’s own body, overuse can lead to exhaustion, internal bleeding, or even death."
869,,400,Eyes on the World ,Magi: Alma Torran,Modus,"As some of the great scholars have recently discovered, the world is made up of many dimensions, layered upon each other like sheets of paper. Most people can only perceive one of these dimensions - the ‘physical world’ – and will remain blissfully unaware the others and how they affect reality, such as the invisible and nigh- inaccessible ‘spirit world’ where Ill Ilah and the Rukh reside. A few individuals, however, have figured out how to see one more dimension aside of the physical world. Namely, the ‘vector world’ where the laws of physics exist. And it just so happens that you are one of them.

Being able to see the vector world grants you an innate and effortless understanding of the movements and vectors of anything you see. For example, if you saw an arrow flying through the air, you could instantly know exactly the forces acting on it, from its rate of acceleration to the air resistance and gravity acting on it, to flawlessly predict its arc, where it would land, and whether anything would interfere with its flight. With this kind of knowledge, you could easily come to wield the vector magic that was previously the domain of Solomon alone, allowing you to manipulate the fundamental forces of the world to redirect everything from bolts of lightning to gravity with a flick of your wrist."
870,,400,Power of Order,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Modus,"The Power of Order is a strange one, almost completely at odds with the rest of the world. Just as the Black Beast brought more magic into the world, the Power of Order exists to cancel and erase that magic. In a sense, it’s an anti magical power. However, that’s not quite right. In effect, it’s anti everything. In this world, there are people who can touch and interfere with fate and destiny - and the wielder of this power can interfere with them. As for what powers this, well it seems to be your strength of character. The more determined you are, the more confident, the more sure that what you’re doing is just and true, the more powerful you become. Also of note, with a bit of practice and effort you’ll be able to create an odd crystal material which radiates this power."
871,,400,Magical Corruption,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Modus ,"A good enough wizard doesn’t stop at mastering his own magic, he even masters the magic of those
around him, a lesson you’ve taken to heart over the years. You’re exceptionally good at detecting
and altering active magical effects, even extremely complex and long term ones like a Holy Grail War, allowing you to achieve normally impossible things for that system by adding more energy and
making your changes or change the target or purpose of the effect, along with other effects. Altering
the target of an attack spell in flight, changing the process of a magical war ritual or interfering with
a summoning spell to use it to summon someone you prefer instead of the original target. You’ve
got very quick reflexes with this, which does help with using it in combat, but complex changes are
likely to require longer rituals that may take hours or days and making alterations to large systems can be horrendously expensive. All the more worth it in the end and just switching the targets of
simple combat spells is quite manageable."
872,,400,Formulation,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Modus ,"The world is a wonder of mathematics, a wonder laid bare to your eyes. The formulas of the world
are to you like the light in the air is to other beings, something you naturally perceive and
understand. Anything that could be called a formula, you find yourself very quickly and easily
comprehending, from complex mathematical equations to esoteric subjects like magic or magecraft
spells, and once you have comprehended something, you find it possible and often quite easy to
restore it from a damaged or partial state, even to alter that formula should you have enough
knowledge about it. Taking an existing spell and changing parts of it or even upgrading it is possible
should you have a wide enough knowledge base in the magical field. It makes magic quite easy to
learn and makes knowing magic already a lot more dangerous. "
873,,400,Mystic Eyes,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Modus ,"It is through the eyes that the soul’s power is made manifest. Some eyes show that power a lot more
strongly than others. You possess a pair of very high class Mystic Eyes, equal to the ones that
Medusa has in her human form, that are capable of a incredibly powerful magical effect transmitted
through sight. It can be as classic as petrifying anything seen or forcibly bending to your will anyone
that looks into your eyes to as advanced as granting you powerful sight-based telekinesis or letting
you cast your spells through sight. Whatever you choose, it is extremely difficult for others to resist
the effects and even those with potent magical resistance still likely feel a reduced effect instead of
nothing. Your eyes will grow in power as your magical power does as well and it is possible to learn
new techniques, such as expanding the effect of your eyes into a bounded field around you or
embedding the effect into the eyes of others for a short time, with enough practice. Given the
magical nature, you can also choose what your eyes look like."
874,,400,Counter Vessel,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Modus,"Simple peasant girls can’t change the world. It’s mostly true. But Jeanne was not just a peasant girl and now, you might not be just that either. For whatever reason, from the suitability of your physical form to your goals to just your cute features, you are widely seen as a viable vessel for the greater powers and forces of any world you are in. Not referring to just powerful heroes and villains but intelligent forces such as the Counter Force in this world. While this gives you their attention, the benefits do not come freely beyond that. Should you have need of power, the Counter Force and perhaps others later on, will offer immense empowerment with conditions. At least if your goals should align. Fighting for humanity’s progression against those that would see it degrade or stagnate would certainly motivate the Counter Force to empower you and your allies. The conditions of the deals you make are usually quite fair, granting you their power until you complete their goals and not requiring your soul or eternal service, though betraying such immense forces is still a foolhardy idea. "
875,,400,Simple Purity,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Modus,"As one continues to journey towards enlightenment, they learn many secrets about the world. These
truths hold power, more than as just wisdom and warnings like the uneducated might believe. They
come to affect your very being and begin to transform you into something greater. To describe it as
simply better would be inaccurate, as it is more like you begin to shine with something beyond this
world and yet entirely a part of it in ways normal men cannot comprehend. This feeling about you
results in those around you naturally coming to believe that you are a saviour, a being who brings
great change and goodwill in his wake. It affects those who would act as heroes on a much deeper
level, their very beings rebelling when they try to act against one who would save this world, causing
them to take severe downgrades in their overall power and ability to act against you when they try
to do so, feeling as if they are but a child before a wise old king.
 
This change has also brought new knowledge to you, teaching many ancient arts to manipulate the
Truths that you have learned. Gestures, trances and holy phrases that cause action on the world, harming the spirits of others deeply with Truths they cannot integrate, healing your own form with
simple meditation or bringing the weight of a mountain down on the ones who would halt your
passage. The Sutras gain power, regardless of whatever magical energy you have, and this power is
enough to harm or bind down even powerful demigods and divine spirits. They may find that their
own immoralities in this world only make your sacred arts more powerful against them, while the
scale of your Enlightenment will increase these powers equally. "
876,,400,Onmyouji,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"Among the most structured and ancient styles of magic in Japan is the Onmoyuji’s work. This
Japanese magecraft is a mix of science and occultism, containing both many ordinary spellworkings
but focusing primarily on working with tools and charms. Most famous are the paper charms and familiars that a Onymouji can easily create, imbuing them with magic long term to achieve a wide
variety of goals. Wards, enchantment or cursing of others, creating powerful Shikigami warriors and
more. You are a master of these arts, with a above average amount of magical energy to channel
into them. However, an Onmyouji finds that raw power is worth less than skill and materials, as you
can potentially do battle and seal even a great youkai like Tamamo no Mae despite lacking in power
with the right set up. Onmyoudo performs superbly well with preparation, seeing rituals of
incredible power becoming much easier than many other magecraft forms.

In particular, you are familiar with the secret technique of Life Continuation. With this, you are able
to engrave your very being onto your Shikigami, making them as much a part of you as your original
body. Your human form being destroyed hardly matters when a thousand paper familiars hold your
essence still, allowing you to control them all at once. "
877,,400,Witch,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"Distrusted and feared, a witch is a dangerous sort of spell caster. Relying on a system separate from
the ordinary models used by most magi, witchcraft holds many strange spells and abilities, giving it a
unwholesome reputation through much of Japan. Though no grand witch are you, you’ve been
changed into quite a powerful spellcaster with this option. You have access and a great deal of
training in the system of Witchcraft, a magic casting system that functions without counting as magic
when it comes to things like Magic Resistance or anti-magical fields. Witchcraft is performed using
physical motions with one’s body and the energy within you and around you, best suited towards
indirect means of interacting with the world. Curses, seals, increasing the power of allies and
applying disadvantages to the enemy, manipulating the spirits of nature and even imbuing power
into your physical movements for powerful blows. Even with the ill-suited nature of witchcraft
towards combat, you can cast spells that can bring down a fortress. It just might often be a
confluence of misfortune, evil spirits summoned, raging weather and weakened foundations that
you do it with, instead of a single massive attack spell. Witchcraft allows for very subtle workings, often able to bypass most forms of magic detection, and will prove exceptionally useful for
influencing the minds and hearts of living beings. Obtaining influence, status and power over others
is what witches have been accused of using magic for for good reason. "
878,,400,Druid,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Modus,"The magic of the wilds runs deeply in this land, such that a druid is perhaps better known than an
ordinary magus. The druidic magecrafts involve dealing with nature, the spirits and beasts of the
land, even the creation and summoning of avatars of the divine beings found in this natural expanse. From your childhood, you had an innate connection to the natural world around you that allowed
you to easily bond with beasts and spirits, which has been further supported by an extensive
education as a Druid. You are the match of a exceptional druid magic user like Fionn mac Cumhaill or
Cu Chulainn, possessing a very large amount of magical energy and a great deal of knowledge to put
it to use. Summoning hordes of relatively strong creatures to support you, turning a forest against
your enemies trapped within, creating something as magnificent as the great Wickerman. You won’t
have the power nor breadth of a master of Runes but you are notable in your own right and you’ll
find that barring rituals to communicate with and obtain the alliance of major natural spirits or
forces, your spells are much faster than what a Rune Magic user might normally use."
879,,400,Voice of the World,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Modus,"As one sees the world through their mind’s eye, they may also become able to command the world
through the voice of their soul. Something even more primal than the unified speech of mankind, the Voice that you now speak with is something entwined with the very heart of the World. The
simplest use of your Voice allows you to communicate with and understand animals, plants and even
the dirt you walk on or the air that you breathe. Should you put more force into your words, you can
command the world, moving the air to create tornadoes of force or asking the earth to rise into the
shape of great fortifications.

Pouring forth your heart and roaring or singing with your Voice would allow you to shake the
heavens and split the seas, even warp the localised laws of physics itself. As your overall power
grows, your presence in the World shall grow as well and what you can accomplish with your Voice
will raise to match."
880,,400,The First Poison,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Modus,"Ah, poison. The greatest of the classics when it comes to assassination. So many uses, so many
flavors. There have been many masters of the art of poison over the course of history but few
possess quite the natural ability for it that you do. You possess innate supernatural abilities when it
comes to poison and surprisingly broad for what some may consider a limited concept. You have the
power to apply the concept of ‘poison’ to anything connected to your being, even in a very loose
sense. This allows you to deliver poisons with a touch, infuse any spell you cast with poison, even fill
the atmosphere for some distance around you with poison. Perhaps you could even poison the
magic and spirit of anyone that tried to touch you through supernatural means.

And what poisons can you use? There are few limits. You can easily produce any kind of poison that
exists in the mundane world and reproduce any supernatural poison you have come near before. It
is even possible for you to mix poisons you are aware of together and create entirely new
concoctions. Whatever poisons you choose, you will find that they pierce through any specific
resistance to poison that a target may have, affecting them even if they should be immune or
otherwise impossible to poison, though those of great constitution or healing powers can still get
through. With focus, you can even shape your poison into physical objects such as chains or blades, which you can control as if by telekinesis. The final aspect of yours powers is that you may summon
creatures and monsters associated with poison to aid you, though these are temporary and are very
tiring to create if they are much stronger than you."
881,,400,Man of the Spirits,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Modus,"After many years of training, you finally managed to master the spiritual arts of the Shaman, learning
the ways to control and bind and summon all sorts of spirits. The shamanic training primarily focuses
on the various spirits of the world, such as those in nature or those connected to families and people, and allows you to search out these things, summon them to you, bind them to your commands or
even enact strange rituals to temporarily combine with them. Your skills are such that even powerful
spirits such as the Coyote or the ancestral spirits of entire nations can be summoned by you, beings
that threaten entire armies. Outside of just spirits, your training as a Shaman makes you a highly
capable Magus as well. Your stores of prana are fairly extensive, hours of magical battle would not
tire you, and you are skilled in elemental magecraft and the more generalised common forms. At the
very least, you can knock over a building in a single spell."
882,,400,Rites and Sacrament ,Tsukihime,Modus,"Where did you find such knowledge, Jumper? From a past life, perhaps...? It’s unusual for the Church to make use of spells, but you’ve managed to utilize a few inspired by an unknown source. These spells include the Cremation Rite, which will cause a weapon so enchanted with it to make a target burst into flames upon impact, the Internment Rite which causes a target to change to stone, the Mummification Rite which desiccates the target once they are pierced, and for some odd reason, an Excarnation Rite that summons a horde of angry crows to attack the target. In addition, this knowledge comes with the basics of how to make similar one-use enchantments for weapons, letting you perhaps create similar effects of your own after some practice.
"
883,,400,Water Master ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Modus,"Unlike Mermaids, which depend on song for their powers, your control over water is more innate, and does not require song or magical reserves to be activated. You can summon typhoons by spinning in place, manifest water dragons that spout like geysers, or shoot ice from your hands, among other possibilities. You generally start with a specific specialty of your choice and can only extend to other types of water magic in time, but your magic is still rather versatile and can be activated and manipulated at your own will. With enough power, you can even call forth tsunami-level tidal waves, or split the ocean in half to create waterfalls.
"
884,,400,Geokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Geokinesis allows the user to control and manipulate the earth, and includes the abilities to change its composition and density, turning rock to dirt or sand as well as allowing the user to throw large boulders and even temporarily allowing small amounts of earth to become lighter than air, allowing it to be “levitated”. The amount of earth the user can control increases with experience.
"
885,,400,Four Seasons of Life ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have control over life force. You could manipulate the four seasons, bringing summer, winter, autumn or spring as you desire, open doors on the backs of creatures which leads into a private realm where you can send life energy to any door you wish no matter the distance in the real world, and awaken inanimate objects and turn them into living creatures by creating doors on their backs and pouring life energy into it.
"
886,,400,Wind God ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You control the winds, from producing hurricane-force air currents to dispersing similar forces. You could level a city if you really exerted yourself, or more productively prevent it from being levelled by hurricane-force winds, tornadoes, and similar disasters. You can also easily listen to words carried on the wind, a useful ability should you wish to spy gather information.
"
887,,400,Bardic Music ,Libriomancer,Modus,"You are a bard. A rare class of magic user who can use music to change the world. Music is most useful for altering the mental state of others, making them calmer or more compliant to your will. Alternatively it could make someone more aggressive, or in some cases more clear headed (and arguably intelligent). If the subtle manipulation of emotions isn’t your style, perhaps you could default to the standard “blast them with unnatural vibrations” style of bardic music. Whatever you decide to do, the magic of music is sure to set you free.
"
888,,400,Real Magic ,DC Occult,Modus,"​This is where it starts to get interesting. You have training in how to use real magic, whether you have training in a specialized version such as the backwards magic that the Zatara family uses or a more generalized type, you're capable of some fun stuff. Teleporting, transmuting, energy blasts, etc. On a small scale, you're capable of just about anything if you have the energy and know the right spells.

You have roughly the same level of training and potential as Zatanna does.
"
889,,400,Talking Is a Free Action ,DC Occult,Modus,"​You know how sometimes people seem to be able to hold conversations or go on monologues during a short leap or cast spells to stop bullets after they leave the barrel of a gun? Well, now you can, too!

If you so choose, whenever you begin to speak, time will be compressed. This effect will not last indefinitely; maybe a paragraph or two can be exchanged in a single instant. Where this really shines is that you can cast any short, verbal spells effectively instantly, thereby eliminating a large weakness of many types of magic. This same effect will also be applied to anyone you are speaking to -- though they cannot use it to cast their spells, only to talk -- and attempting to somehow game this for uses other than talking or casting spells will end it.

Oh and no one will find this strange or even notice it unless they happen to be... aware of the true nature of reality
"
890,,400,Magic of the Light​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Modus,"The Gods above have granted a powerful magic upon their chosen. Holy magic, the magic of light, healing, and protection. This is the magic of Heroes. It’s small scale, better suited to strengthening the one who bears it than to massive acts of destruction, but do not think the second is impossible for those who call upon it. This divine strength has other benefits, however. You have been trained in these arts for five years, and you will find your spells more difficult to disrupt, even to the point that a Demon of Corruption cannot twist them away from you."
891,,400,"Blood, Death, and Demons​ ",A Practical Guide to Evil,Modus,"Blood magic, necromancy, and demon summoning. What fun. The magics of Praes are dark ones, appropriate to those in service to the Gods Below. Your knowledge of the ritual magic of Villains is amazing, allowing you to bleed out a few prisoners in order to keep a massive area growing bountiful food, letting you call powerful demons with little risk to yourself, or forge powerful pacts with the greatest among them, allowing you to single-handedly turn the flow of entire battles. You have five years of training in these magics, and your spells are stronger, and can grow stronger still with sacrifices, either of blood, or of your own defenses.
"
892,,400,Bloody Curse ,Valkyrie Profile,Modus,"For creatures without any, the Undead seem to have quite an affinity for blood. You could just consume it for a weaker version of soul eating, but it has so many more uses. You can summon and manipulate it, use it to cast spells, or even cause it to explode. Because of its magical nature, this blood is much harder and sharper when solidified or put under high enough pressure than it has any right to, somehow equaling divine weapons in cutting power, and the energy its releases equal to that of magic. Flying sickles of blood, a quickly traced ritual circle, or an exploding geyser of blood are just a few uses of this power, and the inventive will discover many more.
"
893,,400,Circular Advantages​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Modus,"You’re good at manipulating the Circle of Interactions to screw over your opponents. Not only can you easily figure out what sorts of magic your opponents are using, but also what kinds of magic will best disrupt it. In fact, you’ll find that the Circle remains in effect even outside of jump when you wish it! Your arcane magic disrupts divine which snuffs out fey, which devours infernal, which scatters arcane. Furthermore, you can learn spells to not just negate but consume the appropriate magics, feeding on divine spells to enhance the raw power of your own arcane ones, for example. In worlds that aren’t so kind as to have these arbitrary distinctions, Divine is if granted by a god, Fey is nature, Infernal is demonic, and Arcane is everything else.
"
894,,400,As Long As You Mean It ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Modus,"You don’t have time to waste to make long chants during a fight in the battlefield. There are many other things to worry about, and long chants shouldn’t be one of them. Actually diverting your attention to reading something for a long chant can be deadly in the battlefield. Luckily, though, you don’t have to worry about that. As long as your words carry the spirit of the chant, you can easily substitute any long chants for ceremonies or spells for a few time-cutting short phrases. Also helps if you’re poor at memorization."
895,,400,I Can Do It By Myself! ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Modus,"You’ve been spending that time fighting for giant Vertexes by yourself, you don’t need other heroes to fight by your side. In fact, all you need is your sword or some other similarly shaped weapon or object to act as a fellow hero when sealing. And now you possess this skill in other ceremonies or spells. You need multiple people in any ceremony or to help you cast a spell? Not anymore! You can do it by yourself! All you need is a sword or some other sword-sized object to hurl down to act as another person to fulfill the requirement of multiple people needed. Of course...a typical sword can’t provide for the power of friendship or love. Or magic if there’s no magic inside the weapon."
896,,400,Rune Magic ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Modus,"Runes are a type of Magecraft that originated in Scandinavia during the Age of the Gods. They work through inscribing symbols that realize mysteries accordingly with the meaning that they represent. For example Ehwaz is a Rune of Hardening that when inscribed on gloves gives them durability greater than tungsten steel and can enhance the strength of the person wearing them, for further examples of Runes look in the notes.

Ansuz: A Rune that makes fire spread over a target.
Ath nGabla: A Runic spell that locks the caster and their target into a death match that cannot be stopped unless one of them dies.
Berkano: A tracking Rune.
Ehwaz: A Rune of Hardening.
Kenaz: A Rune that enhances it’s users' sight.
A number of unnamed Runes: also exist including: One that can erase memories, a speed enhancing Rune and Runes that can be used to create a perimeter alarm.

There’s probably more but they aren’t mentioned in canon so feel free to use others as long as they don’t outstrip the others."
897,,400,Gravity Magic ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Modus,You know thaumaturgy involving the manipulation of gravity. You can use this to alter how gravity affects a single target changing the magnitude and direction of the force. With twenty circuits you can reduce the force of gravity to survive a hundred metre fall easily. Further practise and more magical power will increase the magnitude of the force you can control.
898,,400,Crest Specialist ,Dog Days,Modus,"You are an expert at wielding the power of the crest, many could say you are one of the best in the kingdom. This boosts your crest ability all the way to level three, letting you launch large scale attacks that can devastate entire acres at once. You still have much to potentially learn, one day being able to slice a watchtower in half with wind alone, but that is a ways off."
899,,400,I Curse You ,Dog Days,Modus,"Even in this colour and happy world, there is a smudge of darkness. This smudge is the power of curses. Vile magics made by evil beings. You can now use this foul magic, at a level equivalent to a novice level three crest user. This magics can be used to corrupt the innocent or inflict great pain. The greatest of these curses would even allow you to kill beings in areas where deaths are not normally possible. This is the equivalent to black magic."
900,,400,Elemental’s Secret ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Modus,"You will have power over the Wu Xing elements – Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water. Each ability has a lot of potential by themselves, but shine brightest when creatively used together to manipulate the world all around you. Alternatively, some magicians have opted to focus on one element in particular while ignoring the rest to give themselves an exponential boost for that particular element when compared to one with a jack of all trades approach. This magic also allows for you to invoke and manipulate the power of the sun and the moon, further empowering your abilities.
"
901,,400,Foxball ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"A relic of earlier times, a Foxball is an old way Kitsune used to allow new members of their kind to practice magic. It’s a big ball of fluff with a pit similar to a bean inside that contains all the magical essence of a Kitsune. Anyone who holds it can easily cast spells that normally only elder youkai could, in addition holding it blesses you with constant low-level good fortune and the ability to see through magical disguises. Not to be confused with a large ball of mould that grew in the back of your warehouse.
"
902,,400,Talent ,Peter Pan,Modus,"Each fairy is born with an innate talent that defines her role in Neverland and what sort of magic she has. If you do not buy a talent, you will get a lot of strange looks from your fellow fairies. The power of the talent is proportional to your size. It is possible to teach your talent(s) to others, though it will take quite some time for them to learn anything more than minor little tricks (it’s easier when you are teaching people with innate affinity for your talent); in turn, you might be able to learn a couple things from other talents, but not nearly as much as you would with it as your talent. Also, your control over your talent is enhanced with the One Feeling at a Time perk. Shoot the Birdie! lets you take leadership over people who specialize in/practice your talent.

Fairies can either purchase a talent of their choice from the list with a discount on the price or, for free, roll a 1d9 to determine their talent. In the case that you roll a 9, you instead get a common talent such as laundry or table-setting; you will become highly skilled in your respective talents and now find the activity highly relaxing and blissful, but your abilities are more mundane than the rare talents offered below. You may purchase more than one talent if you wish. When purchasing additional talents, you need not roll; you can simply select the talent(s) you want for the discounted price.

Other backgrounds can purchase a talent for the full price, but they must roll a 1d9 to determine which talent they receive. When purchasing additional talents, you need not roll; you can simply select the talent(s) you want.

1. Tinker- Tinkers are master craftsmen and women when they put their mind to it, and can make priceless works out of mere scraps. Interestingly, the trade of the tinkers requires them to work with iron often, yet they have no issue with the metal. While all Neverland fairies are immune to iron’s effects on the fae, after the jump you will be immune to any negative mystical effects that iron might have on you, as well as any other metals that affect fairies. In addition, your talent gives you increased skill at finding utility in almost any material you obtain, even scraps thrown away as trash by others.

2. Animal- You can speak to any small animal in its native tongue and sense their emotions, allowing you to understand its condition and its needs. Therefore, you are responsible for looking after the smaller animals throughout Neverland. Like the animals you tend, you have a heightened sense of smell and hearing, and are a good tracker. In addition, animals know many shortcuts and hidden passageways that you can access and gain safe passage through. The talent also gives you increased skill in teaching/domesticating wild animals and finding good uses for their special skills (without harming them).

3. Garden- You can sense the needs of plants and imbue them with magic to grow. By producing just a speck of pixie dust, you can make a plant grow and blossom instantly. Moreover, just by examining a plant you can identify its key qualities and needs. You are also able to train small bugs such as worms and bees to help take care of your plants. Plus, you have a good sense of balance – which will come in handy when you need to carry half a dozen berries on your head.

4. Water- You have control over water, alter it between solid, gaseous, and liquid states, and form it into various animal shapes or even into fountains. You can send special messages in bubbles that only pop open to reveal the message for the intended recipient. In addition, you can find hidden sources of water. Being filled with so much water in their hearts, water fairies tend to cry whenever they feel strong emotions, whether happy or sad. You also know the “language of water” to communicate to a degree with any bit of water, which may enhance other water abilities you have (see Ocean Secrets).

5. Kitchen- Technically, the kitchen talents are subdivided among over 25 individual talents ranging from baking to scullery, but you have a knack for kitchens in general. And for fairies, given their small size and the lack of modern amenities in Neverland, chefs are greatly valued for their ability to make delicious foods from almost anything. You have not only increased ability at finding useful ingredients, but you can produce tasty replicas of normal recipes using any available resources – even if it shouldn’t make sense to be able to make pastries solely from things you collected from a nearby tree, but somehow you can; this does not apply when the food being replicated consists of just one primary ingredient, such as roast chicken or corn on the cob. Furthermore, you have an instinctual knowledge of existing cuisines and cooking techniques for your location, though it’s always good to experiment. Also, as you make the foods with magic, you can often bless your masterpieces with special enhancements.

6. Light- All fairies are surrounded by light, but you are one of the brightest. Fortunately, such is the source of your power, and you can control the light around you accordingly. You can bend and move light around as you desire, and even create rainbows with the help of water fairies. You can also enhance yourself with light, such as turning yourself bright red to burn through things in your path (it works better when you’re mad). You can temporarily imbue individuals with light as well (this is normally limited to fireflies, but feel free to experiment). The strength of your light magic depends on the phase of the moon, being the brightest when the moon is full; even so, your power over light is still fairly strong even at the lowest phase of the moon. On a related note, you are born with an innate understanding of the stars in the sky, improving your interactions with stars if you also took Star-Talker. Said to have “bright” personalities, light fairies are energetic perfectionists who enjoy the spotlight quite literally.

7. Wind- You have power over the wind, and can produce anything from breezes to mini-tornadoes – and full- sized tornadoes once you get to a human’s size. The wind also gives you enhanced speed; considering that even normal fairies, ever-filled with boundless energy, can open every drawer and turn every pocket inside-out in a bedroom by the time you’ve read this far into the sentence, a wind fairy can fly as fast as the quickest wind, such that you can reach subsonic speeds.

8. Art- You are constantly inspired to produce various works of art, but your greatest strength lies in painting. For you, painting is not merely a physical skill, but a magical one, as you can literally determine the color of things by painting them. Any change you make to a target’s color becomes its true, permanent color unless you use a new paint. The colors will also enhance certain traits and strengths of the subject depending on the symbolism; for instance, blue embodies depth and stability, while orange represents joy and excitement. And if the colors should belong on something else, it can become that thing; for instance, painting stripes on a horse makes it a zebra, and painting a dome brown or white could turn it into an earthy hill or an igloo respectively. This ability also allows you to change the seasons by painting leaves either green or orange; once you paint enough of them the same color, the world will conclude that it must be time for that season and change accordingly.
"
903,,400,Maid of the Sea ,Peter Pan,Modus,"Mermaids are spirits of the water, and thus have amazing control over the element. You can control whirlpools, summon floods, or sink ships in terrible storms with but a few airy gestures from your hand. Most of all, you are skilled with creating and controlling bubbles. You can trap victims in human-sized bubbles so that they can breathe underwater (until the bubble shrivels up), or even trap all of a victim’s laughter into a bubble for you to play with as you please (fun fact – did you know that without laughter in their heart, a person will eventually die?). Whenever you cry, all the water around you can erupt in a chaotic storm."
904,,400,She’s into Superstitions... ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Modus,"Black Cats and Voodoo dolls are your style. You have a set of minor rituals, which can handle any number of mundane tasks. Finding lost items, getting obtuse but always accurate fortunes, and otherwise being able to handle damn near anything that isn’t outright ‘magic’. Rule of thumb is, if sufficient amounts of dumb luck and coincidence could make it happen without it being undeniably “magic”, you can probably accomplish it. The main drawback is that you’ll have to use gross and bizarre materials or strange rituals, but other than that...it’s a pretty expansive set."
905,,400,Ritual Swapout ,Dragon Ball Super,Modus,"Prophecies, destiny, magical rituals and special ceremonies all usually have a fairly strict set of requirements. They tell you what is going to happen and what you need to make it happen. You’re able to buck the trend just a little and swap out a number of normally required things for similar but definitely different things. While you can only do it for one or two pieces of a ritual or prophecy, it can let you do what you’d normally be entirely unable to do. A ritual that requires five pure hearted super saiyans could make use of a still in the womb saiyan-human hybrid, regardless of it not having the ability to go super saiyan, not being a pure saiyan and its morality being unknown. A ritual that requires a specially prepared magical seal to complete the imprisonment of a demon could instead use a coupon sticker from your local supermarket.
"
906,,400,Gut Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Gut magic, also called Gastromancy, is the form of magic used by the ogre shamans known as Butchers and Slaughter-Masters. Gut magic simply relies on the caster, consuming the correct ingredients and speaking an incantation, if The Great Maw finds them worthy of its blessing it will give the caster and those in proximity to him or her some very powerful effects, though if the caster is unworthy the incantation will produce some less than satisfactory results, whether it be completely consuming the caster from inside out to some very powerful flatulence that even Nurgle would be impressed by.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work Spells.

The white wind of magic, Hysh is also called light, and casters able to channel it are incredibly skilled in exorcisms, their light banishing demons and shattering undead as well as shielding troops from their depredations. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The yellow wind of magic, called by men gold is the densest magic, and the easiest woven into metals. While it gives the power to cast spells that turn armor and weapons into molten metal it is most valuable for allowing the creation of enchanted weapons.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The green wind of magic, the Jade wind, called the Coils of Life is closely tied to nature, water and the flow of the natural essence of life through the world. The strength of Ghyran magic is generally affected by the seasons - it is most potent in spring and summer, and it declines during winter. Ghyran magic can be used in a wide range of spells - as well as giving vital energy and providing healing, it can be used to manipulate the natural environment and control water in all its forms.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The blue wind of Azyr is light and insubstantial, and after passing into the world from the Realm of Chaos it quickly dissipates into the upper portions of the heavens. Azyr is the Aethyr's metaphysical drive for inspiration and that which is out of reach. It is creativity and the desire to emote. Masters of Blue magic are diviners without equal, and true masters are able to manipulate the flow of events to come through ritual. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The grey wind of magic Ulgu is a mysterious wind, which spreads disorientation and confusion amongst those it touches. Masters of the Grey Wind tricks the foe into thinking they have been beset by terrible foes or slain by a mysterious floating sword. So convincing are these illusions, that the foe usually keels over and dies anyway. Only the swift-minded can see past these tricks. It is generally used to confuse and befuddle the foe and sap their will to fight. (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The purple wind of magic. The power of Shyish comes from the ending of things, the slow decline of the soul, and the certainty and terrible awe of death that all sentient creatures must face at some point. Strongest at times of transition such as dawn and dusk Shyish, also called death magic consists of powerful spells to cast down and destroy individuals, usually enemy commanders and champions. Necromancers able to master the purple wind will find their necromantic spells and rituals both quicker to cast and liable to cause far more damage to opponents.

The red wind of magic. Aqshy blows down from the north as a hot and searing wind. Temporal heat acts as a conduit for Aqshy, and so spells involving Aqshy almost always involve fire. It collects around open flames, volcanoes and dry deserts scorched by the sun. It is also attracted to wherever there is excitement and argument, courage and vehemence, since Aqshy is the Aethyric coalescence of passion in its widest possible sense. The magic of Fire is extremely destructive, compromising nearly exclusively of ""magical artillery"". (CG note: requires Mage - Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War.)"
914,,400,Mage Lord - Ghur,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Modus,"Through training or simply sheer talent you have risen to the rank of mage lord, and have gained the ability to perceive the hidden currents within the winds of magic, allowing you to specialise in one of the more esoteric spellcasting schools. 

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

The brown wind of magic is the coalescence of bestial spirit, the predator and the prey. It flows around the wild, untamed places, where the touch of civilisation has not yet been felt. It is a savage wind, as unreasoning as it is devoid of malice. In battle, it augments troops to become stronger and tougher, turning mediocre troops into fearsome warriors.

More advanced forms of undead are beyond you for now though, and there is a limit to the numbers of lesser undead you may command.

You may command a thousand skeletons or zombies per year you have been here.

This perk gives you a boost when fighting or defending against fairies or other magical beings, with an increased chance of dispelling or counterspelling magical effects. These powers are enhanced if you vocally express belief or disbelief in magical things.
"
917,,400,Wishing Well ,Neverland: The RPG,Modus,"If you drop an item down the well, a wish of yours can be granted. However, the level of the wish is directly proportional to the monetary value of, power of, and personal value placed on the item you drop into the well; for especially potent wishes, you’ll need something exceptionally powerful or valuable. Anything dropped into the well cannot be replaced. Items that would be replaced via jump fiat or similar means, or are nigh indestructible, will not grant you a wish if thrown into the well and will be simply spat back out.

918,,400,Food Backlash ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"Usually a weakness of Wonderland chefs, you can use the chaotic whimsies of Wonderland to your advantage as a weapon by causing food/ingredients around you to act...strangely. When the perk is active, food and/or ingredients within 25 feet of you has a high chance of succumbing to Wonderland-style craziness. The food/ingredient might explode into confetti, object to being eaten by fighting back or running away screaming, etc. Even if the food/ingredient seems unchanged on the outside, its internal properties will chaotically morph, causing it to have unusual effects on eaters. However, while you can selectively determine which foods/ingredients are affected by the perk, you can’t control the actual changes to the food/ingredients, which are determined randomly."
919,,400,A Queen’s Magic ,Wonderland No More,Modus,"A Witch Queen’s magic is cast by her displaying the elegance of a queen. Your magic becomes more powerful when you perform actions befitting a monarch (dressing like royalty, sitting on a throne, daintily fanning yourself, reading a royal proclamation, crying “Off with their heads!”, etc.). Likewise, your mental attitude (having the persona of an elegant, superior ruler) enhances your magic’s effectiveness. You might even discover new spells/powers based on your queenly actions if you embrace them enough.
"
920,,400,CURSE AND GLAMOUR ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"Hags invoke the spirits to cast curses rather than using the more volatile winds of magic. You can sow madness, sickness and misfortune to those that displease you as well as banish or command any spirit your force of will is capable of overpowering. You may even take on the horrific aspect of the Ancient Widow granting you a form 8 ft tall with terrible claws, fangs, grey skin and glowing eyes. Unfortunately, hags appear to prematurely age without use of magic so many learn to use glamours. Your own glamours (or any magic used to disguise your appearance) stand up to even the greatest scrutiny.

921,,400,Arcane Vassal ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Modus,"Not only are you a powerful wizard (and respected priest) in your own right but your allies may also cast their own magic through you allowing them to see through your eyes, sense your surroundings and use their magic from your position even if they are safely tucked behind a temple-city wall a vast distance away. They can also augment your magical power with their own if they wish to empower your spells.

922,,400,Telepathic Confabulation ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Modus,You are capable of seeing through the eyes of any allied spellcasters and can cast any magic you are capable of at full power through their body as if you were present on the battlefield with them. You may also use this technique to augment their magical power with your own allowing them greater power and scope for their own magic.
923,,400,Eshin Sorcerer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Modus,"The Art of the Silent Death was not the only secret brought back from Great Cathay and Nippon. Secrets of magic, locked and hidden so tightly and deeply within Eshin’s warrens, were returned. Eshin Sorcerers are versed in this “Lore of Stealth,” and are an asset kept so secret that only the Lords of Decay are allowed to even know they exist. The Grey Seer Priesthood brooks no challenge from the other clan’s magic-users, and Eshin would not have their weapons-crafters and mage-assassins killed for a grey one’s ego.

You bear the mark and potential of becoming an Eshin Sorcerer - and the power of the Lore of Stealth. Weapons and armor that bear your touch can be enchanted at will with all of the qualities that make a master assassin even deadlier: Blades forever bearing a toxic, envenomed edge; Armor and rags literally drenched in shadows that protect the wearer and shroud them in shade and secrecy; Or even cloaks that allow for teleportation from shadow to shadow, are but a few Eshin tools that can be created. Sorcerers are not limited to the act of tool-making, either - every spell in the Lore of Stealth can be just as easily applied to the user, turning the hidden rats into terrifying killers in their own right. After all, not just any skaven is allowed to become an Eshin Sorcerer.
"
924,,400,Arch-Sorcerer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Modus,"The servants of Tzeentch are more connected to the Winds of Magic than any other beings of the Gods. Whether others desire to admit it or not, the truth is the same: All magic comes from the realms of Chaos, and Tzeentch is the controller of magic. All other theories are simply fools attempting to deny being truly damned. For your dedication to Tzeentch, he will make you mighty indeed, for as magic is his, his magic is yours. You ability to use the Winds of Magic to your own ends is impressive, and you will come to find that your magical abilities from other jumps have been boosted greatly. Where one meddler of magic would cause a rapidly growing fire, you would cause a impressive maelstrom of fire that torches all it touches.
"
925,,400,Weapon Magic ,Hyrule Warriors,Modus,"It isn’t uncommon to find weapons imbued with magic in this world. Most everyone of importance you’ll see has an armament that has some sort of special abilities, and those warriors will display those abilities splendidly no matter their magical talent. 

With this perk you are able to harness and enhance the magic power of enchanted weapons. What does that mean? Well it varies based on the magic of the weapon. A common example is a weapon with an elemental enchantment allowing for simplistic elemental magic based on the weapon. 

Weapons with less straightforward abilities may exhibit unique capabilities however. Gauntlets that strengthen the wearer may allow for heightened strength or transmission of that strength over an area, while generic magical enhancement may work to emphasize odd traits of the tool with this perk.
"
926,,400,Heart Filled With Light ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Modus,"The light is strong within you, very strong indeed..While it does nothing against those who are just, this skill with light magic allows you to restrain and stun the wicked, with great effectiveness on those born of shadow or the living dead - being completely frozen by such a momentous light. If you were to truly harnessing the light of your soul, you could even bless weapons and arrows to carry the potential of the Arrows of Light, though reaching the level of the Master Sword’s ability to cut through darkness would take quite a bit of sagely knowledge to accomplish.
"
927,,400,Force of Nature ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Modus,"When Onox wrecked the troupe of performers, he didn’t actually do it with his actual weapon. Or his hands, feet, or anything like that. He called down a small hurricane and had it trash both their encampment and their defenses. Heck, he even threw it at Link when he tried to defend Din. In a similar manner, you now possess some form of magical might over one of the four major elements of Holodrum. Ice for winter, earth for spring, wind for fall, and fire for the summer. If you prefer, you can also choose a lesser level at all of them. No personal hurricanes if you do that however. Something to note is that this magic is very much a brute force thing - if you want a gentle breeze, or some ice cubes in your drink, you’d be better served by looking elsewhere.
"
928,,400,Divine Chaser ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"As much of a pain as it is, it seems that Link spent most of his journey one step behind Zelda, even when she wasn’t in danger. That may or may not have been the Goddesses plan, since said plan started a tad bit earlier than was intended. Either way, Link got quite good at tracking down his wayward girlfriend. With that in mind, when following in the footsteps of another, be they your lover or your foe, you begin to move faster and fight harder in order to catch up to them. If you had magic spells they too would be more effective, as would most everything else if only by a small amount. Of course, if you knowingly and willingly stop for some reason, then all of this built up energy and determination is wasted. You have no time for sidequests, your princess is in danger.
"
929,,400,Guardian Of The World ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"I feel I must apologize, because up until now I’ve been assuming you were a normal person. But instead it seems that you are a dragon - perhaps one of the three that guard the surface world, or a wind fish like Levias, the guardian of skyloft? Well, beyond the fact that you are simply a giant dragon, you now have a great deal of skill at elemental magic of your choice. Fire, lightning, and water are the three I would recommend as they correspond to one of the already existing dragons, or perhaps wind like Levias? If you truly wish for it you could also take ‘dream’ magic, but that would take tens of thousands of years to become actually useful, a level of skill you do not have. It should be noted that choosing to be a dragon still leaves you with hands, while Levias is much bigger but is basically a whale. Or you could forsake the form of a dragon, and simply take the associated skill and power.
"
930,,400,Cyclones ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"Much like the minor god Cyclos, you now possess the power of manipulating the wind. This is dependent upon your magic reserves, so nothing too big is going to be happening anytime soon, but in theory, if you have the power, you can do whatever you want. Realistically, using the Ballad of Gales more than once every few days will leave you utterly exhausted, though merely changing its direction is much simpler.
"
931,,400,Clutching Tight to Power ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"Sorcerers Awaken more often than anyone else, gaining access to the more powerful and more flexible Sphere magics true mages wield. Vampire clans that practice sorcery often seek sorcerers as prospective neonates. Unlike most transformations in the World of Darkness, when they do so they do not lose access to the linear magics they’ve worked so hard to acquire. With this perk, this trait extents to all your mystical powers, from this world and others. Your supernatural abilities and nature will never interfere with each other, and as an added bonus neither time nor disuse will erode your capabilities, nor can they be stripped from you or sealed away without your consent.
"
932,,400,Ritual Master ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"You know a lot about ritual magic. In fact, for every spell you know, you probably know at least one ritual version that is significantly more effective, albeit slower. These rituals may require specific reagents and circumstances to perform properly, and even the fastest will take at least ten minutes more than the normal spell.
"
933,,400,Soul Magic,TES: Magic,Modus,"Seen as a heretical and forbidden art, many forget that Mysticism
does involve spells that facilitate the interaction and manipulation of souls. Soul trapping
is the least of what you could do, with the potential to mend and cure the souls of any
damage or impurities they may have. Of course, should you try your hand at it, you
would have a great talent for the necromantic arts."
934,,400,Dual Casting ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"While some say that it would be best to have a spell in one hand and weapon in the other, there are advantages to only using magic. When you use both hands to cast a spell, it significantly lowers the amount of magicka it would have otherwise consumed, and makes the spell vastly more powerful."
935,,400,Earthbones ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"For as much as creation stole your divinity, and much of your power, you are still connected to the world, and that has some benefits. Through exerting your own willpower, you may reinforce or lessen the laws of reality in your area. This area will grow in scope the more you practice the ability, as well as how much you can affect these laws."
936,,400,Thu'um ,TES: Dovah,Modus,"The Storm Voice, a skill that made the ancient Nords a fearsome force
on the battlefield, it was the Dovah who originally possessed the ability. Such was their
inborn connection to this form of Tonal Magic that they could learn words instantly that
would have taken the most gifted mortals years to master. You know all of the
Shouts found within the time of Skyrim, and can even create new ones with time and
experimentation."
937,,400,Pure Magic ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"The magic of Teyvat is not something that needs dedicated teaching to learn to use. There are some arts that may require more knowledge to use proficiently, but simply wielding elemental power is an instinctive process. But even still, like with all things, there are some who are more talented, more adept at its use than others. You are one such person, to stand alongside the likes of Lisa or Albedo. Magic comes easily to you. Whatever magical path you walk, you will find it a simple and straight road. Perhaps this talent is one that pursues a less academic nature but rather one of pure power, akin to the likes of Beidou."
938,,400,A Focused Vision ,Genshin Impact,Modus,"A Vision is used to channel magic, but this does not mean that that magic can’t then be channelled into something else. You have a strong talent for infusing your tools with the magic that you wield. In the right hands, this can be used to terrifying effect. As the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing likes to think; even a hairpin can be turned into a dagger of unmatched sharpness once charged with Electro, capable of cutting through wood and bone and rock. The type of magic you channel will obviously have slightly different effects. Geo is naturally going to have a notably different use than Pyro."
939,,400,Free Caster ,Terraria,Modus,"All magic in Terraria requires some sort of focus or tool to use. At least, for most people, but not for you. When you use a magical tool or weapon, or when you see / are hit by magic yourself, you can learn how to recreate it without any sort of magical focus. It will take several exposures to do so, but once you have learned it, you can recreate the magic with nothing but a wave of your hand and your own Mana pool. This applies to magic in future Jumps as well."
940,,400,Soul Arts,World Seed,Modus,"he Soul - a part of the Aura that allows it to absorb memories and grow over time. As it is the liveliness that exists in all living things, not just sentient races possess souls, but animals and plants too. The only intelligent beings without souls are “mere” machines such as androids, for whom the only way to grow stronger is to upgrade their software and hardware, though they can be changed into Deus Ex or other machine races by granting them a soul. Which is something that you can now easily do, along with oh so many other things.
You see, levels and experience are simply an abstraction of the strength of someone’s soul. When you kill monsters or people, you take a small part of their souls, roughly five percent of it, which becomes the experience you gain. And when you learn new things or simply increase your stats through training, your soul also grows and gains experience. Though in the latter case, you wouldn’t gain stat points to spend after a certain point (about 1-2 stat points per level) as instead of using the growth of your soul as fuel to strengthen parts of yourself, your soul grew through said strengthening. So, another way to describe Soul Arts would be “Experience Control”.
You could, for example, revive a dead person in the 24h windows before their soul disappears, or hold their soul in place to use it for other things, but it would cost either you or the person experience. Beyond that, you can impart your own experience onto others, easily fight souls and soul-type creatures, guard your soul against attacks, or create Skill Shards. And if you were a slightly shadier kind of guy, you could absorb someone’s soul to gain their levels, memories, and skills. And, luckily enough for you, doing this won’t cause you to go mad or turn into a monster! If you don’t want to do that, though, there’s yet another avenue open to a Soul Artist for growing stronger.
You can instead pull the full soul out of a creature you killed, purify it of all its memories and personality, and gain vastly more experience than you would’ve otherwise gotten, though still less than if you had absorbed the whole thing. Another use of the same skill would be to purify a soul and then put it back into the creature’s body after healing it, to bring it back without any memories of its former life, becoming essentially a newborn baby. This is often how users of Soul Arts get powerful creatures as their pets, as they are able to easily tame them afterwards.
At this point, it should be clear to you that the power of this ability is truly limitless, the above skills just some examples: whether it is reading someone’s level with a glance by discerning the luminosity of their soul, putting a soul into an item to create a Growth Weapon, shedding your physical body and only living as a soul, or quite literally anything else to do with the soul, as long as you put in the practice, experiment enough, and get a lucky insight or two, you’ll be able to do it all. Even creating souls wholesale instead of having to use the soul essence of creatures you slay would become a possibility for you after reaching the lofty heights of the Legend rank and knowing everything there is to know about the nature of souls."
941,,400,Ability Creator ,World Seed,Modus,"Magic is a force that has certainly fascinated people since it was conceptualized in the annals of history. Now that Neolife exists and magic will soon come to thrive in the real world, is it a surprise that it will capture the hearts of many more? No, of course not. And it is this fascination that has brought an interesting revelation to light. Namely, that there is something more to magic than Arcane and Runic magic.

Those are called “unique” abilities people can develop. Each is essentially a new type of magic, and anyone can develop one if they have sufficient patience and imagination. Although this new magic can be powerful, it has to be developed manually, each new aspect to it added one at a time. That is what sets it apart from Arcane magic, where you can easily come up with new spells following the same concept. A few examples will be provided in the Notes.

Now, this wouldn’t allow you to just do something like the ability to use laser eyes from scratch. As mentioned above, each ability has to be developed block by block. It essentially lets you expand upon already existing abilities, bring them up to a new level, or make them branch out into entirely different areas. Extremely simple things like Aura Sight or enhancing your body in different ways would only require the ability to control mana and infusing it into the relevant body parts, but more powerful abilities would have stricter prerequisites and training regimes. If the ability you want to create involves an item, for example, you need to be completely familiar with its physical form, to the point where you could imagine it in its entirety in a split second, usually done by using a VR device to create it in a test world, and then slowly studying it, taking it apart and putting it together again and again, while also training with something like Origin magic to instantly create matter, starting with small and simple things, then working your way up. After all that is done, you would be able to create said item with a thought, instantly and reflexively, and be able to work on and enhance it further.

Now, that’s actually something anyone can do with some time, so it’s nothing all that special. What sets you apart from the masses is that you can do the same thing with anything in your arsenal. You are able to mix and match any amount of perks, abilities, skillsets or techniques to create something new, or propel them to new heights by stubbornly training. And no matter what your capabilities are, you will always know just how to advance them in any possible way, possessing a sort of instinctive knowledge of what your training should focus on."
942,,400,The Need For Big Booms ,Konosuba,Modus,"Once a day isn’t enough for you anymore. You have to feed the need inside you. Normally, we’d not be in the business of supporting such magical addictions but we’ll give you a little allowance. Be it limited casts per day or stuff with massive energy costs, we’ve got a solution to both. The first is that, once per day, you are able to cast a spell regardless of any energy costs it may have. Even if it costs as much as you have at full or more, you can get one standard use out free. Do note that this will only work with spells that have set energy costs. If something could be charged forever or works based on how much energy you put in, the best you’d get is the minimum energy use of that spell. The second way we’re encouraging you is the ability to pay large amounts of energy to cast spells that are normally usable only a few times per day. The more powerful the spell, the more energy you’ll need to pay and not all spells will be payable at your current strength."
943,,400,The Power In This Right Eye Of Mine ,Konosuba,Modus,"Some people are born with a talent for magic. Some people think that a little bit of extra skill is enough to call that a ‘talent’. You’re the sort of magical genius that even the Crimson Demons would need to admit was a true master in the making. Magic comes to you faster and better than it does any other. What might take others months to reach you can do in days, even the cost for learning magic skills reduced to fit you. Your magical power is greater too, thrice that of any normal magician your age. But unfortunately, not all magic is quite the same for you. Physical magic, things such as enhancing the body or otherwise doing purely physical effects on you, is unaffected by this increase. It doesn’t quite fit the lifestyle, you see."
944,,500,The Sound of Silence,Worm CYOA v17,Modus,"Hear that? Perhaps you didn’t. Sound and vibrations are yours to control. Among these abilities, is the power to generate and control shockwaves; you can generate shockwaves strong enough to send large cyborgs flying off their feet, or to destroy objects, to the point that you could easily collapse buildings with them. Alongside this, you can also manipulate or shatter things with acoustic resonance. You are also able to use vibrations for sensory purposes, such as with echolocation. This manipulation of vibrations also allows you to deafen or even remove sound and vibrations from you and your surroundings, rendering yourself and/or the environment silent."
945,,500,Dark Release,Naruto,Modus,"Dark Release allows the user to absorb and release chakra that they have taken from others. This includes both pure chakra and chakra-based attacks. The user can utilize their chakra or chakra absorbed from attacks to enhance either their own attacks or attacks that they have absorbed. Post-Jump, this will be able to do the same for all energy, such as magical or psionic energy.

This Kekkei Genkai normally manifests as a pair of overlapping diamonds, with chakra absorbed through the upper and released through the bottom. Additionally, the user can use their mouth to absorb chakra and make the technique's range larger. With this technique, they are able to completely remove the victim's chakra, potentially causing death. Absorbing chakra also allows the user to deconstruct and learn about the associated technique. If you wish, you can decide for the mark to not be present, though you will still only be able to use Dark Release through the hands and mouth.

949,,500,Low Magic,80s Sword and Sorcery,Modus,"Now we’re getting into the real powers of magic and sorcery. You possess a talent for a rather limited form of magic, chosen from those listed below. All such magic is rather tiring, and use in rapid succession is beyond you, though with training and increased skill or some greater magical power than this perk alone gives you, you may overcome this limitation.

● Flesh Changing: You possess the magic to change a person’s flesh and appearance. This is limited to humans into other humans, but you could change a man into a woman, or give yourself or another the appearance of another individual. With time and effort you may learn to apply this to other species, turning a bird into another bird, or changing the appearance of a snake, but don’t expect this to ever become full freeform animal shapeshifting or the like.

● Illusion: You possess the magic to fool a person’s senses. Or maybe it’s to create images? It is your choice when you select this perk whether you make illusions via affecting the target’s mind or by creating images that everyone can see, though with time you can learn to do the other, but your magic is the creation of false sounds and images. These illusions do not have any physical substance, though as you master them you might even be able to fool touch for a few moments in the weaker willed and less alert, and typically have a few flaws that help the attentive and clever to see through them, but you can create images to beguile your foes or simply to delight the senses.

● Projection: More draining than the above two choices, this magic allows you to project your image and your mind to a far away location. This projection is similar to an illusion in that it can be seen and heard, but has no physical substance and cannot directly interact with the world, but the range at which you can use this magic is far greater. It does require you to already be observing the location in some way - such as through a scrying pool or a security camera - or to be familiar with the place. With increasing mastery you could even use this projection to cast other magic through, though it would become far more tiring and the magic would likely be somewhat weaker in application.

● Teleportation: By far the most straining of the options here, this is the magic to transport yourself to another location instantaneously. Teleporting across a room is easier than teleporting across a country, and you might pull off teleporting across a room twice within a few minutes of each other, but the latter you might have to wait days to perform again and you’re probably not making it across the world. Of course this can change with greater magical power and skill. You might also learn to summon certain pre-prepared objects, or even to teleport others away, though both of these are beyond you as of now.

You may buy a second option for an additional (undiscounted) 100 CP, 2 additional options for an additional (undiscounted) 150 CP, or all options for an additional (undiscounted) 200 CP."
950,,500,Seasonal Maiden,RWBY,Modus,"Remnant is home to many myths and fairy tales. Some of which aren’t as fictitious as one may think. Have you ever heard the Tale of the Maidens for example? 4 Woman who were blessed by a Wizard with incredible magical power. Now you are a Maiden as well, by default one of the most powerful beings in the World. You may choose to either be a 5th maiden or replace an existing one. If you choose the later this will undoubtedly have repercussions on the Plot and earn you the ire of Cinder, but you will also be capable of opening the Vault associated with your Season (Spring-Mistral, Summer-Vacuo, Fall-Vale, Winter-Atlas), something you wouldn’t be able to do when the power comes ex nihilo. Normally the powers of a Maiden are restricted to... well a woman, but if you pay with CP we can handwave that issue. Good luck explaining that though.

Maiden powers are remnants of true magic that was gifted by the God of Darkness to humanity. This type of Magic is in its purest form only present in two people and in shattered parts in 4 woman. They seem to have taken a mind of their own after being given away by the Wizard. When used to their full potential your eyes burn with flames the colour of your iris. The true limitations are not completely known but at your disposal are things like Flight, manipulation of the elements like Fire, Wind, Lightning and Ice and even controlling the Weather with casual ease. You will start at a basic knowledge of your powers and need to train with them but in time you may become a fully realized Maiden with all the power that entails. That being said even a Maiden can fall by a particularly strong warrior or a well trained Team.

One more thing, in the event of your death the Maiden power would go on to the person that was last in your thoughts at the time of death. So make sure not to think of your killer okay?"

It cannot interfere with another Kwami’s magic, which mostly just means that any magical effect of a Miraculous or Kwami cannot be interacted with by the Sublimation-created power. Other than that it is only as limited as an akumatized ability could be, which is to say you won’t be able to run faster than the speed of light or punch planets open but otherwise just need to be creative and fanwank responsibly.

953,,500,Class Change,Final Fantasy I,Modus,"It is said that within the Citadel of Trials, the great Bahamut will award those who prove their worth with great power not seen by the common adventurers of this world. But that might take a little while or you’re not much of a saving the world type, so here’s a method to cut to the chase. You are starting with the mighty Class Change, a legendary upgrade to your existing Class that increases the power of your original training in the following ways:

Fighters become the mighty Knight, enhancing their already considerable strength, endurance, and ability to survive damage. In addition, they gain the ability to cast basic White Magic, giving them ways to support their comrades beyond being a heavy meatshield.

A Thief becomes the agile Ninja, not only becoming more faster and harder to hit, but also a bit more lucky when it comes to inflicting surprise damage on an enemy’s weak points or hiding in the shadows. They can also cast basic Black Magic, giving them more offensive options.

The Black Belt becomes a Master. While not gaining any spellcasting abilities or new additions to their arsenal, their ability to damage with their bare hands as well as withstanding attacks without the aid of armor increases dramatically. A lone Master could reasonable subdue a mighty dragon or a Fiend by their lonesome with nothing but bare-knuckle combat.

White Mages and Black Mages become White Wizards and Black Wizards respectively, giving them full access to their school of magic as well as increasing the potency of their spells and how much they can cast without needing rest or recovery.

Finally, the Red Mage becomes the Red Wizard. While still not having the ability to fully master either of their schools, they enjoy an all-round boost to their abilities as well as more spells to cast in either White or Black Magic.

Warriors of Light are destined to face the Citadel of Trials eventually, thus if you have chosen that path you and your three fellow Warriors receive the Class Change and its benefits for free. For all others, you may spend 500 points to apply the upgrade to yourself and any other companions you have imported or created in this jump.

954,,500,Bulletproof,Invincible,Modus,"Almost as fast as Red Rush, as strong as Invincible when he first got his powers, with durability almost on par with Omni Man himself, you have been empowered by esoteric energy in a similar way to the hero, Bulletproof. What this actually means is that you can fly, you are almost as fast as Red Rush himself, strong enough to shatter skyscrapers and break small mountains, and are far more durable than a young Viltrumite as well. Where a young Viltrumite would be killed by the force it takes to shatter a small mountain it would require Mt. Everest shattering levels of power to harm you."
955,,500,5 Leaf Grimoire,Black Clover,Modus,"Congratulations, you have gained a connection to a 5-leaf grimoire a grimoire bound to and infused with demonic mana. As it’s connected to a demon this allows the wielder to gain access to a unique and powerful for4m of magic. E.g. Kotodama magic, Gravity Magic and even Megicula’s Curse MagicFor Devils and Hybrids they gain this for free and yes other forms of magic can also be bought. This also enhances all other forms of magic you are capable of."

957,,500,Lightforce Manipulation,Dial,Modus,"With Lightforce Manipulation, you possess the extraordinary ability to harness and control the ethereal energy known as Lightforce, akin to the powers exhibited by beings like Dagger. This radiant energy will be at your command, granting you immense power over light and illumination. First and foremost, you can generate and project pure beams of intense light. These beams can serve as potent offensive weapons, capable of searing through objects and disorienting foes. You can adjust the intensity and focus of the light, allowing for precise targeting and control over the dispersion of its effects.

Furthermore, you have the power to create protective shields and barriers composed of brilliant light. These shields can absorb and deflect incoming attacks, providing you and your allies with a formidable defense against various forms of harm. Your mastery over light allows you to manipulate its properties, such as refraction and reflection, to create complex illusions and holographic projections, further enhancing your defensive capabilities. Additionally, your control over Lightforce extends to healing and purification. By channeling this radiant energy, you can mend wounds and injuries, accelerating the natural healing processes of yourself and others. The Lightforce possesses purifying properties, allowing you to cleanse toxins, diseases, and negative energy from individuals or environments.

As you delve deeper into your Lightforce abilities, you gain the power of light manipulation. You can shape and bend light, rendering yourself and others invisible or camouflaged in plain sight. This ability grants you unparalleled stealth and the ability to move undetected through shadows and darkness. You can also create blinding flashes of light to disorient opponents or create illusions to deceive and confuse. With your growing mastery over Lightforce, you can tap into the ambient light around you to restore your own energy and enhance your physical attributes. Your strength, speed, and agility are heightened when exposed to light, allowing you to perform extraordinary feats and outmaneuver your adversaries."
958,,500,The Darkforce ,Dial,Modus,"You possess unparalleled control over the enigmatic Darkforce, a primordial energy that exists in the shadows. Like beings such as Cloak and Blackout, you harness the power of this dark matter and bend it to your will. First and foremost, you gain the ability to summon and manipulate Darkforce constructs. With a mere thought, you can generate tendrils, portals, and fields of solidified Darkforce, allowing you to ensnare or shield yourself and others. These constructs can be shaped and directed according to your intentions, granting you incredible versatility in combat and manipulation of the environment.

Furthermore, you possess the power to manipulate darkness itself. You can shroud yourself in an impenetrable cloak of darkness, rendering yourself invisible to both sight and technology. This ability allows you to move undetected and strike from the shadows with lethal precision. You can also extend this darkness manipulation to create zones of darkness, plunging an area into pitch blackness and disorienting your foes. The Darkforce also grants you the power of teleportation through shadowy portals. You can traverse vast distances by stepping into one shadow and emerging from another, granting you unparalleled mobility and the element of surprise. Additionally, you can use these portals to manipulate space, creating pocket dimensions or even collapsing spaces to trap or disorient your adversaries.

As you delve deeper into the mysteries of the Darkforce, your mastery over its powers will only grow stronger. You can tap into the ambient dark energy in your surroundings to replenish your own energy and heal injuries. This connection to the Darkforce grants you enhanced strength, agility, and durability, further augmenting your already formidable abilities."
959,,500,Power of Throg(616)        ,Pet Avengers,Modus,"Or maybe you have the power of the 616 version of Throg. You’re still not as strong as Thor Odinson, but you could put down enemies which Angela and the Executioner struggled with, and are strong enough to defeat foes who managed to defeat Beta Ray Bill. You’re close enough to serve as a stand-in for Thor in a pinch. Like with the non-upgraded version this will get closer to the full power of Thor with additional upgrades. Behemoth or Apex+Dragon will place you at close to Thor’s own, and Behemoth+Dragon will see you actually edge him out if he lacks Mjolnir or if you possess a Worthy Sliver to focus your powers, you still won’t be as strong as the Hulk, but you could possibly shatter planets.

960,,500,"""Subtle Workings""",Dark Souls 3,Modus,"There are many schools of ‘magic’ in this world, with each coming from its own distinct source. Sorceries, Miracles, and Pyromancies are the three main ‘schools’ of magic, each deriving power from a different source- though there may be some overlap, thanks to the experimentation of the most brilliant and mad. Of course, overtime new forms of ‘magic’ have appeared belonging to each school. Sorceries, pyromancies, and even miracles have been discovered or created with Abyssal taint. Miracles not associated with the old gods of Anor Londo have popped up, pyromancies have spells that don’t strictly manipulate flame, and sorceries have numerous different sub-types, with branches that involve the manipulation of light, cold, crystals, dregs of Humanity, and even time itself. Unfortunately- even with the work of scholars and archivists- the subtler arts of magic are often the first to be lost. However, as an exceptionally well learned scholar, you are no stranger to the theories and logic behind these spells. While having preexisting knowledge of the above schools will help, the nature of your knowledge is largely non-violent, and won’t be directly useful in combat- requiring at least some preparation or materials beyond the mere memorization of spells at a bonfire. Examples of what this perk can do to start with include erecting magical barriers to ward buildings or laying minor curses, blessings, or enchantments on people or objects. With time to study and experiment you may discover new uses for your knowledge; and as the strength of your soul increases, so to will the strength of these magics. Your wards might become all but impenetrable, covering an entire valley and requiring a special token to pass, and your enchanted items might have powerful, even unique abilities when properly harnessed. Curses could become hereditary, or spread like a disease, while more positive works can make those you enhance into great champions or monsters. The development of new spells is possible, including ones that harness alternative sources such as the Profane Flame or the Dregs of Humanity, and you may even develop your own school of magic entirely. The sky is the limit here, but keep in mind that you’re just barely starting to scratch the surface."
961,,500,Demigod(500),Elden Ring,Modus,"You are no longer mortal. By some twist in your ancestry, you are a demigod-an equal to most of the legendary fingers that ruled this world as Marika’s children. As for precisely how so, by default it is assumed that humans were either counted among those that were part of Godfrey and Marika’s lineage, or Radagon and Marika’s lineage. However, while the circumstances are vague other possibilities exist. There were other powers the Erdtree had to overcome in long war to become the embodiment of order, and perhaps like the mysterious patron of the dragons or the black moon yours blessed you while maintaining a far more passive role in your life than the Erdtree. Or perhaps one of the Greater Will’s mistakes was leaving a shard of the shattered Elden Ring to bind with you. Within reason, feel free to justify the terms and conditions of your demigodhood.

Your soul carries a Great Rune: A spiritual fragment of the Elden Ring (or a comparable power) that grants you immense physical, spiritual and mystical power. Exactly how those traits are allocated may depend on your temperament and training, and are reflected in the unique Great Rune you bear. But to use Morgott, a demigod of no particular note other than his unbreakable loyalty, with no particular specialisation you may leap over small buildings and remain unscathed by falls off tall towers. In combat your basic blows alone shatter stone, and where others require incantations or sorcery to channel the energy of the Erdtree (or other divine beings) you can infuse your blows and weapons with its energy to augment their damage, or even channel it into manifested weapons and techniques. Though you may still be cut and bleed, the divine vitality of the Erdtree sustains you-granting you an endurance for damage more comparable to monsters of legend than nearly all living men, biological immortality and allowing you to resurrect as Tarnished do without relying on a specific Site of Grace. Each such resurrection may still be taxing and it may be possible to exhaust you into final dissolution, but doing so is a legendary quest in itself for most in this world. But your physical traits pale in comparison to your mystical ones. With the same gravity magics others use to hurl small, localised meteorites with diligent study and training from an experienced tutor you could arrest the movements of the stars in the sky. Others among your peers have invented new schools of magic by communing with strange gods, and in the case of Godwyn wielded the taboo power of death as lightning with ferocity great enough to fell dragons-and precision enough to spare one’s life."
962,,500,Wandless Magic,Harry Potter,Modus,You have a natural ability to do spells without a wand. For you it is no more difficult to learn spells in this manner and you need never worry about Expelliarmus (or your wand getting destroyed) again. Your natural finesse is such that this volatile sort of magic is as safe as any other and this accuracy serves to make spellcasting in general less likely to result in accidents.
963,,500,Warlock,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"A bit of a mixed bag, here. First off, you command a light-based magic that can paralyze your targets. You can also use this light to heal your wounds, create balls of energy that explode after a time delay, or just shoot your typical destructive energy blasts. Warlocks can also create Wretchlings, ghostly, decaying things that roam at night, they can also create illusions that can encompass an entire town. Second and more prominent is your ability to transform your mouth into a grisly, toothy abomination that can eat the souls of your victims. This allows you to absorb their magical energy to replenish your own. Two warlocks working together can open portals, with one on each side of the gate.

Boosted: Valkyrie Cain: When Valkyrie Cain lost her True Name, her magic changed dramatically, becoming closer to that used by Witches/Warlocks. Like her, you can now manipulate ‘white’ energy, allowing you to discharge this power in the form of white lightning. As your powers grow, you will become capable of feats that wouldn’t be out of place in a Sensitive, such as the ability to control thought, and to see the future, even gaining a measure of control over the speed and intensity of the visions. Unlike a Sensitive, your visions are often involuntary rather than intentional, and act on a more personal scale, while your ability to control thought is something closer to a Jedi Mind Trick than outright memory alteration. You are able to create shields around yourself and others, stronger than any sigil could provide. You can see magic within others, as well as their souls. Rather than simply being able to consume souls for power, now you can disperse them, effectively destroying them. You can also now replicate a magical effect or discipline and use it on yourself or just plainly use the magic itself(e.g. copying a healer’s ability to heal and using it to heal your own body or enhance a regenerative healing factor. Who knows what else you will be capable of in time.

Wraiths, mummies, vampires, wights, even with effort a great, rotting zombie dragon can be commanded, though those who retain the ability to think may not respond well to slavery. As well as commanding greater undead you gain access to the most terrible necromantic spells, able to slay entire towns and cities worth of people.

While those with this perk can wear magical and non-magical metal armour such as chainmail or plate mail, such equipment does make it much more difficult and much more tiring to work spells.

now Academy City’s eighth Level 5 esper or a Saint-equivalent magician, depending on which
Side you’re on. The details are complicated, but the short version is that you are now powerful
enough to act as a human nuclear deterrent. If you didn’t buy any powers here, you instead gain

967,,600,A Foot in Each Well,The Old Republic,Modus,"The Galaxy is replete with examples of those who have tried and failed
to find compromise between Light and Dark. You will never be one of
them. You can use the Light and Dark sides of the Force without
issue, and may ignore any or all effects of Dark side corruption, be they
physical or mental. Additionally, you gain both the Light and Dark side
versions of all purchases that vary by alignment, including Force Disciplines (pg 51) and their Legendary
Force Abilities (pg 52).
These abilities extend to other power you have or later acquire. You are able to mix normally incompatible
or mutually exclusive powers or sources of powers without adverse effects, and are resistant to corrupting
and/or addictive effects of any technique that might stray into the 'dark arts', so long as the power source
is not inherently corrupting or addicting itself. The corruption protection against techniques for other
power sources is not absolute, but the resistance is enough to keep you mentally and spiritually safe so

stories, old wives tales and bad rumours. From things as minor as cursing someone so that
masturbating often makes them go blind to things like stealing food from others resulting in
someone being attacked by gigantic hungry bears or making those who go off alone into the wilds be
beset by many wolves or perhaps even cursing someone that is very vain and overestimating of
themselves to be forced to deal with many trials that will test their ability to humble themselves, such as being presented with ‘magical’ clothes that are invisible to the idiotic observer. While what
you can accomplish with this Style is mostly limited only by the amount of research you put into
older tales, you are unable to enact any effect that would not be primarily a punishment for another
being, the summoned folktales will fade away quickly after carrying out their curse on the enemy
and no curse will result in the instant, unstoppable death of the target."
971,,600,Homo User,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Modus,"A homophone is a pair of words that sound the same as each other when spoken verbally but have
different meanings. To you, the meanings may not be so different, as you are able to swap things or
actions with their homophones. You could turn the hairs on someone’s head into hares that hop
away to their burrows. You could make someone being teased now be covered in teas. A noble sire, a ruler and leader, could be made into a despondent sigher, depressed and lost in themselves. A
town that has been razed to the ground could be raised back to what it once was. And what you
could do to a bunch of seamen is perhaps best left only hinted at. You are able to use any real world
language, that you have not made and as it was originally here without any additions through your
influence, as a basis for Homo User."

actions. By describing what you are doing in a great shout, such as yelling about how well you are
hurting someone in a fight, you’ll find that the effects of your actions are amplified up to five times
over depending on how loud you are. Similarly, you are able to minimize the effects of anything by
describing it in a whisper as it happens or is about to happen, reducing it to just a fifth of its’ normal
level of effect when talking at your quietest. As long as you can pay attention and keep talking, you
can reduce the power of your opponents’ attacks, increase the distance you travel with each step, empower your creations and much more. "
973,,600,Color of Beauty,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Modus,"You’re a painter of reality, in the most literal way. You control colour in all its shapes and forms and
can use it to produce a vast variety of effects. You can change colours on anything in the world and
thus give it effects based on those colours. Turning someone pink and you could remove any
scariness they might’ve had, turn them blue and their entire body will become one big bruise, make
them grey and they’ll become brittle and easy to break apart. You’re particularly good at changing
emotions with your colours too. The possibilities are nearly endless, as is your range of effect, but
you cannot outright kill with this with a single use, your colour changes do fade over time and you
require colours to exist to work at all, as you cannot add colour where there is none."

meta-story of the world you are in. You won’t stop magic from working but you will stop it from
breaking the established rules it works by. You won’t stop people from trying to do heroic sacrifices
for each other but you will make it every bit as lethal as it should be in real life, greatly reducing their
chances of surviving. The heroes won’t get saved by sudden Deus Ex Machina while you’re around, unless it is actually God or someone intervening on purpose. Main characters don’t have any special

abilities after a while, especially if you pick up new ones anywhere close to as quickly

You have the ability to fuse any skills, abilities and powers you have together, to
create new and powerful ones. These tend to be related to the themes and abilities of
the powers that went into the fusion, but not necessarily. Getting a strong enough
fire skill and combining it with similarly powerful skills for manipulating gravity and
light could allow you to create miniature stars, for example. Combine it with an aura
skill and you turn yourself into the star.
This also allows you to break them apart in specific ways, fuse parts of a skill to
another, and in general play with them to your heart’s content, not to mention come
up with new tricks and abilities for just about any given situation. You can do this to
whole styles, in time, freeform mixing and matching bits and styles from one skill
onto another, or lifting spells from one magic system to work via another... pretty
much anything you want, really.
Abilities used for fusion aren’t lost, nor do they have to belong to the same system or

978,,600,Að Vefa Örlög,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Modus,"Not content with simply knowing and being one with the tapestry of fate, you sought Wisdom for the sake of knowledge, cosmic secrets, and the ability to change it; you willingly hung yourself by the neck on a branch of Yggdrasil after piercing yourself with a weapon and peered downward towards the Well of Urd at the base of the World Tree; surviving in this state, teetering on the precipice between life and death for nine days and nights, until finally you were found worthy, embodying arts of fate, rune, magic and weaving with which you have now gained supernatural skill. 
While often used simply as a written language by mortals, the runes are truth, symbols that represent some of the most powerful forces in the cosmos. Each rune allows one who comprehends their mysteries to access, interact with, and influence the fundamental forces of the world that they represent. While Odin was initiated into runic knowledge by perceiving 18 runes, these do not represent all of the runes and Odin wields them very simplistically. Compared to the Norns, who delicately utilize the runes on a grand scale to weave fate for the nine realms in an intricate tapestry, Odin is like the first man to crudely discover fire and proceed to wage war with its strength. You now have the wisdom, knowledge, skills, and power of the three Norns and Odin in wielding the runes. You will also gain 18 of your own runes unknown and unknowable by even the Norns, unless you teach them, and the sisters may or may not be willing to pay a high price for the knowledge of even one such new rune. 
With this new knowledge you can use the Runes by chanting or writing them to heal emotional and bodily wounds, bind your enemies and render their weapons worthless, free yourself from constraints, put out fires, expose and banish practitioners of malevolent magic, protect those you favor in battle, wake the dead, create and preserve love, and perform many other feats like these.

To do this, the practitioner relies on various means to enter a trance and travel in spirit across the Nine Realms to accomplish their intended task. This can take the form of prophecies, blessings, or curses.
There are seiðr rituals for divination and clairvoyance; for seeking out the hidden, both in the secrets of the mind and in physical locations; for healing the sick; for bringing good luck; for controlling the weather; for calling game animals and fish. It can also be used for the opposite of these things – to curse an individual or an enterprise; to blight the land and make it barren; to induce illness; to tell false futures and thus to set their recipients on a road to disaster; to injure, maim and kill, in domestic disputes and especially in battle."

981,,600,Halo of Might,Bleach,Modus,"The core around which all Quincy powers originate is the ability to control spirit particles. The Reishi
that exists in all things, especially in the afterlife, is the most basic tool of the Quincy. Many Quincy
get distracted by specific techniques or unique powers unlocked in them by the King. Neglected thus,
is this core ability, when it remains the most versatile weapon you have access too. You’ve brought your skill with Reishi manipulation to mastery. It provides an enormous increase in
efficiency to most Quincy techniques, as you can easily pull far more energy from the air without
tiring yourself, and thus increases overall power. You find forming the Reishi to your will simple, allowing not only for permanent construction of solid objects but even for complex creations. Most
Quincy do not progress further than their Heilig Bogen’s solidification and sometimes basic shapes
like walls or stairs. You can create firearms, vehicles, even complex electronics and tools from pure white material. As tough and mighty as your spirit bow, it greatly broadens the potential applications
of spirit power. The peak of this mastery is the skill you have with Sklaverei. A rare talent even among the elite, normally accessible only in Vollstandig. You’ve learned to use it outside of that form in a lesser state, allowing you to absorb Reishi in both the air and even from other beings into yourself. Should the
difference in power be significant, you can effectively devour other spiritual beings and add their
powers to your own. The benefits fade with time, the Reishi eventually rejected as foreign, but every
foe can now present an increase in power if defeated. In your actual Vollstandig form, you’ll have
such power as to make Sklaverei a primary weapon, a deadly threat against even those of greater

says so is merely afraid that they lack the ability to go any further. You know the truth, the only truth
that matters, which is that science is all encompassing and without limitations or morality. You are
able to endlessly push the boundaries of your research further, continually able to make
improvements and new discoveries, even if only minute gains for years of study. There is no true end
to how far knowledge or skill can be taken, as long as you continue to grind away as the ages go by. Even if a feat appears physically impossible, that the science simply cannot progress to a greater scale, it is only a matter of time before you prove the nay-sayers wrong and find a way forward. And if you happened to do so with means others would consider unethical, it’ll only get easier. Science is unbound by petty morality, in the eyes of some scientists, and releasing those bonds from
your work will greatly increase your progress, even beyond reasonable measures. One could try to
study the Quincy with willing participation, slowly teasing out what secrets they know about their
own powers. Or one could dissect hundreds of them to obtain information not even they were
aware of, a slaughterhouse to support your hunger for knowledge."

The higher the stakes of the obstacle if not surpassed or the bigger the danger of the foe that requires countermeasures, the quicker you become. An invading army of Quincies that already toppled your faction once? You could accomplish years of research and production in just a few hours. A next day challenge from a rival scientist? The boost might only be a
a ten percent increase in speed. You need a need to get the speed. You’ll also see your efforts greatly increasing in effectiveness when you aim to create things as

species might exhibit half again as much power, whereas a living being created solely to counter a
single person’s powers at the cost of everything else? You could affect those of far greater power

and strength, as well as the ability to instantly negate any attack by focusing the Shunko energy in
equal amounts to the targeted point, a costly defence but one able to outright cancel both damaging
attacks and more esoteric magical effects. Each Shunko technique has a unique element associated with it, all with their own advantages. Wind, lightning and fire have all been seen so far. Wind is much easier to keep active for longer periods and enhances agility exceptionally, lightning grants even greater speed and thus attack power, fire
endowed the user with explosive attack power. Other elemental attributes are possible and
whatever your choice, you’ll be able to freely convert your Reiryoku into the element and control it
around you. It enables some devastating techniques and at your level of mastery, opens up a
uniquely powerful benefit fitting to your element. The rotating vortexes of a Wind Shunko might give
indefinitely recycle Reiatsu that allows the Shunko to remain permanently active, while Lightning
might focus into monstrously powerful final blasts of energy instead. Having reached a mastery of Shunko, you’ll find it far easier to combine magic and martial arts in the
future, both as a useful combat style that weaves the two together and in making entirely new
techniques or transformations based on combined principles from the differing styles."
985,,600,Number One,Bleach,Modus,"Potential, what a terrifying concept. In every human soul, there is the potential to change the world.
It may only be through little actions for some but for others, like you, your potential marks you as
someone with the destiny to make great changes. In regards to war and spiritual power and the
innate abilities of a race, as well as all things connected to these concepts, your potential is almost
infinite. Exceeding even Ichigo Kurosaki, you are able to make what might take most Shinigami decades or even centuries in just months of work.
In regards to unlocking your own hidden potential, discovering abilities not yet available rather than
furthering your mastery of existing powers, your potential grows to even greater extents. The result
is that you will extremely quickly, perhaps in just half a year, gain access and capable skill with most
of the racial abilities and techniques available to you. Progress beyond that will still be astonishingly
fast, unbelievable to all but a prodigy and threatening even then, but not quite so swift as before. "
986,,600,Bullshit the GM,With This Ring,Modus,"There are two ways that complex systems and objects come
into being: evolution and design. Both processes create general trends in their products. Your
innate supernatural powers gain the benefits of being evolved: robustness and flexibility. You
are incredibly capable at adapting your powers to different uses than what are considered
normal. Using enhanced hearing to learn echolocation is easy for you, as is using infrared vision
to learn to read emotions from someone’s body heat. With moderate difficulty, you could
leverage control over lightning into control over magnetism. With great difficulty you could
leverage control over electromagnetism into Unified Field Theory and gain control over all four
fundamental forces of nature. If your powers rely on a specific context, you’ll find the
requirements of that context are a little fuzzier than expected."
987,,600,Nature of the Soul,With This Ring,Modus,"You can now perceive the complex web of identity,
emotions, and arcane connections that form a person’s soul. Additionally, you have greater
understanding and control of your own soul, granting a slight boost of strength and control of
your magic, and a much greater boost in control of any domains or divine magic/abilities you
possess. With practice, you can learn to push your soul into mundane or magical artifacts either
to siphon strength from them, imbue them with power, make them into a part of your
expanded metaphysique for purposes of arcane sympathy or control, or directly struggle
against their own power or owner’s power to steal control of the item (though losing such a
conquest can have terrible consequences).
Most importantly, you can induce a divine awakening in mortal souls (including your own). While this does nothing on its own, an awakened mortal will, over time, grow into a New God, increasing the strength of their soul and

connecting to a Domain relevant to their skills and personality. Awakening a skilled mage could
lead to a New God of Magic. Awakening Green Arrow would lead to a New God of Archery.
Awakening a veteran Green Lantern could result in a New God of Will. A New God of Archery
could fire one arrow and simultaneously hit seven targets around a corner. A New God of Will
could match the Guardians of Oa. In addition to granting a domain and increased arcane power,
an Awakening will heal most injuries or arcane maladies, and elevate the subject to the ideal
status of their species. It will turn white Martians into red Martians and have similar effects on
other species with inherent biological or arcane castes. The rate at which a new New God grows
into his or her powers can be increased with exposure to raw arcane power. Additionally, while
a Fatherbox or sufficiently skilled New God could perform or teach this skill in the Jump, it does
so by forcing them to focus on one or a few specific aspects of their being, such as a skill,
power, or personality trait, and hinders them in gaining completely new skills or powers
unrelated to their domain. Purchasing this skill will allow those you empower to continue to
gain new skills/powers/facets of personality without issue and grow the power of their souls
without limit."
988,,600,Redefine Vicious,DC Comics,Modus,"Like a wounded animal, you’re at your most dangerous when you’re at your lowest. The more
you lose, the closer you come to complete and total failure, the stronger and more capable you
become until the war is finally won. Your drive to endure and to snatch victory from the jaws of
defeat push your talent and competence to their limits and beyond. At your peak you could take
on an army of metahumans, and beat them all with nothing but your equipment and your wits.
When you’ve lost everything you’ve ever loved and the whole world is against you, the world
better start running."
989,,600,Rubberbanding Competence,DC Comics,Modus,"Almost as if to make up for your lack of powers, your competence and capability scale with your
teammates and the threat you're facing. It’s not a sure win by any measure or something that
can let you overcome an insurmountable difference in power, but the skills and extra force to
your blows can make you surprisingly difficult to deal with as a prizefighting pugilist for
intergalactic warlords and cosmic sorcerers. If you’re infiltrating a spaceship together for
example, you might spontaneously figure out how to operate an alien computer’s interface or
pick up guerilla tactics to sneak around a patrol of cyborgs. On the other hand if you’re just
fighting crooks on the street (or other foes of similar stature to yourself) you’ll have to rely on
your own strength, and this effect is diminished the smaller the difference of power between
yourself, your teammates and your foes is."
990,,600,Transcendent Transformations,DC Comics,Modus,"With all the powerful forces coursing through this world, it would be a shame to be confined to a
certain level of power limited merely by your strength of arm or intellect. In you though, there’s a
unique potential. A capacity to take both superpower-granting energies, hyperdimensional
forces and even abstractions such as hope one step beyond what they should normally be
capable of. When you wield powers similar to those of this world to their limit, especially in
pursuit of an ideal or for your deepest desires, your heroic or villainous motivation causes these
powers to gradually evolve your body towards a higher state. The impossible becomes the
implausible, strains of all kinds become bearable and in general everything you thought about
your capabilities seems to be proven wrong when you really put everything on the line to wring
out every last drop of your power. At first, like the Flashes, you will be able to push back the
limits of your powers-breaking through the Speed Wall, outrunning death and perhaps one day
outrunning speed itself. But furthermore, inventing or exploiting transformations to ascend to a
higher state of being is much easier-especially when integrating a force you have so mastered.
It will still take time; not everyone was born to be the Waverider and the process that can
recreate Apex Predators has been sealed from all mortal knowledge, but the potential exists.
There is, after all, a reason why Libra simply reformed in Apokolips rather than exploding after
absorbing half the powers of the Justice League and a galaxy."
991,,600,Awakened Bloodline Limit,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Modus,"The kekkei genkai are anomalies found in the
DNA that allows their wielders to use unique techniques and usually passed down to
the wielder’s descendants. While some of them emerged naturally thanks to
mutations, many of them have some kind of connection with the Ōtsutsuki clan,
being wielded by Kaguya’s descendants, but these inherited gifts became diluted
and much weaker than their original versions, the kekkei mōra used by our clan. In a
few words, the kekkei genkai usually are just pale imitations of the kekkei mōra. For
example, the kekkei genkai version of Shikotsumyaku allows the user to manipulate
and control their own skeletal structure while the kekkei mōra not only allows it on a
greater degree, but also make their bones completely lethal to living beings, making
them to deteriorate and disintegrate at a molecular level after piercing them. You can
choose a kekkei genkai to receive its kekkei mōra version, gaining an incredibly high
power boost, new abilities and/or removing its limitations, on par with the power of
the All-Killing Ash Bones technique. It’s up to you to choose the specifics and
attributes of this kekkei mōra. For example, if you choose the Ketsuryūgan, your
Ketsuryūgan, as a kekkei mōra, would be able to easily enter into your targets’ minds
without any difficulty and its iron manipulation would become powerful enough to
control even solid iron at a molecular scale and not only liquid with a high iron
concentration, like blood, as well as being able to cause much more alterations and
mutations by manipulating blood within their bodies than just making them larger or
exploding them. You can’t choose kekkei mōra granted by other perks in this Jump
(like the Rinnegan, Sharingan, Rinne Sharingan, Byakugan and the Tenseigan) and
techniques that are classified as kekkei mōra. You can also choose to upgrade
elemental kekkei genkai. This can be purchased multiple times."
992,,600,Senju Clan,Naruto,Modus,"Similarly to the Uzumaki, the Senju possess an impressive physique, though it is marginally weaker. That's not all, however, as with this perk comes access to Wood Release: the kekkei genkai of Hashirama Senju. Regarded as the strongest shinobi in history (until the Fourth Shinobi War, that is), his power was largely derived from this unique release. Growing forests within seconds is just the beginning: the wood you use is strong enough to deflect Kurama's Tailed Beast Bombs (which can demolish mountain ranges) with nary a scratch, and you can sprout hundreds of flowers which emit a sleeping pollen so powerful that not even Tsunade could counteract it. Similarly to the Uzumaki's Adamantine Chains, the wood you use is capable of suppressing anything bound by it. The constructs created can range from a simple cage, to complete houses, to detailed costumes around the user, to a mountain sized wooden golem able to go toe-to-toe with a Tailed Beast. As long as the user has enough skill and chakra, they can create anything out of wood. One of the most versatile jutsu available is the Wood Clone Jutsu, which creates a duplicate that is capable of travelling far from the user, easily communicating with them and has the ability to merge with plants and trees on top of being able to use other jutsu. But that's nothing. While the Wood Golem may have the ability to tear through cities, and stand equal with our tallest skyscrapers, the true power of Wood Release is unlocked with Sage Mode: the True Several Thousand Hands. Such is the magnitude of this jutsu that even Mount Everest would be crushed underfoot, any single one of its thousand hands large enough to crush mountains in its grip."
993,,600,Will of Fire,Naruto,Modus,"Konoha is known for its Will of Fire, and now you embody that ideal with a Fire that burns especially bright. No amount of damage done to your body may squander your spirit. You could be too exhausted to move a limb but you’d still try to charge your enemy by pushing yourself with your chin. Your will is so powerful you could still fight after being knocked out cold. Your cut off head would probably try and bite your opponents’ ankles for a while before you actually died. Yes, you could literally push yourself beyond death with this, if only for a little while, to give allies some extra time to heal you. Be careful about taking things that far though. Even for someone with an unbreakable will, being dead is still dead, and if you aren’t resuscitated soon after crossing that line, you won’t be coming back."
994,,600,Heir to the throne,Cradle V1,Modus,"You are far and beyond the best of your siblings. Whatever they achieve it pales in comparison. Whatever quality your herald parent is searching for, she has found it you. Your ability to progress with your parents’ path is now doubled, and you are always seen as “noble” and “princely” no matter who you are in any jump."
995,,600,Experimenter,Cradle V1,Modus,"Much like the sacred artists of the dawn spring archive, your path to power is a bit more... fluid. You can now attempt to bind or copy techniques from wildly disparate paths to create a path never before seen anywhere else. This applies to any other mundane or magical martial art you know. You can also fuse them seamlessly into something that is unmistakably You."
996,,600,A Sword Carves Through,Cradle V1,Modus,"Every sacred artist will reach bottle necks, and a slowing of your growth when your young can be a death sentence for your future advancements. Now you will be able to bust through them if you attempt to engage with an internal fight within yourself to kickstart your understanding. This will take about a day max, and if you fail, you may try again after a day. After three failed tries, you must overcome the bottleneck normally."
997,,600,Playing With Jewels is Dangerous,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Modus,"As a wise and competent magus, you decided to play with the family jewels. Turns out it blew up in your face, creating a weird sort of portal between various alternate dimensions. Unlike another magus, in your case you didn’t leave some rip in the world that needed to be repaired, rather the rip was formed in the basis of your soul. You have gained the ability to copy things from alternate universes (within the jump universe you exist in, not between jump universes). You can now see all possible outcomes in 5 second bursts for 2 seconds into the future. This will not overwhelm your mind.

Boosted: Due to the rip in your soul, you’ve become effectively immune to anything that would otherwise touch or affect your soul. Your soul is now 100% immortal and absolute. You also get the ability to correct anything that has been misplaced through time travel or extra dimensional shenanigans. You could undo the entire world of Hollow Ataraxia if you wanted, undo any effects of time travel, or place people back in their original universes.

998,,600,Scribe,Egyptian Mythology,Modus,"The art of writing is Thoth’s gift to mortal humans, and you have learned well at his knee. You are fluent in three written Egyptian languages - hieroglyphics, hieratic and demotic – and your brushwork and penmanship are exquisite, as are the illustrations that your work may be decorated with. Yet this is not all that Thoth has gifted to you. As words of power spoken aloud may carry the heka of a priest or god, so too do the words written, carved or burned into a surface.

You may substitute any vocal art of magic for a written one; from brief words of might traced into the sand to lengthy incantations laid down on a scroll. The magic of your words may be triggered immediately on completing the writing of the script, or upon the words being read; but in either case, the magic held or being projected from your writing will last as long as the writing medium remains legible; for as long as the script on the mighty stones of monuments endure under the sun, buried kings are blessed with glory in heaven, and every grave robber fears to lay eyes on the curses of the dead."
999,,600,Supreme ,Marvel Zombies,Modus,"Maybe you could be the big wizard one day, Jumper. The Sorcerer Supreme. It’s true that anyone can learn magic just like any other skill. But it’s also true that there are some natural-born savants of the art - just like any other skill. You are one of them. If you need a comparison, you’re roughly on par with Stephen Strange in terms of your sheer aptitude for magic. From summoning creatures to mystic bolts to necromancy, all of it makes sense to you. Coupled with this natural finesse of yours is a prodigious amount of power - you’ve got much, much more magical power within your being, and can pull far more mystic energy from the universe to fuel your spells. While the world’s greatest sorcerers might have an edge in terms of knowledge, nobody can match the amount of magical force you can bring to bear. You could teleport to Antarctica and back, scry into other dimensions, project yourself into the dreams of others, invoke flame and lightning, and more - all with power beyond any sorcerer currently on the Earth (except for maybe Scarlet Witch. She’s a special case). You’ve got the concentration to focus on your spells and not bungle them halfway through casting, too.

This level of power and talent may extend to any future systems of magic that you may encounter, provided that they are learnable and not innate."
1000,,600,Nethicite Infusion ,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"You’ve learned how to forcibly introduce Nethicite into others. This empowers them, but it also corrupts them severely to have dangerous compulsive tendencies. Their appearance slowly leans towards an extreme - Very pale, very dark, etc.-

Subjects contaminated with Nethicite have been known to go into periods of blind homicidal rage when exposed to a severe dosage of magickal energy. Furthermore, attempts to integrate Nethicite into machinery has also led to unexpected reactions, in extreme quantities it appears the machines have gained some form of sentience.

Note that this ability lets you manipulate the Nethicite, but it does not create the Nethicite."
1001,,600,[CT0],Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"For the next minute or so, you infuse your body with a substantial portion of your magickal reserves. Consuming all of that, your body enters a state where you no longer need to consider the limitations of spellcasting or physical attacks. Cooldown, recoil, casting time and delay are momentarily annulled.

You can chain together attacks seamlessly during this time, and alternate between spells and attacks with no preparation. Take care however, as your body will be under a significant amount of stress – and once the magick is fully consumed, the backlash will paralyze you."
1002,,600,Zodiac Ascendance,Final Fantasy XII,Modus,"In recognition of one’s prowess under the blessing of their constellation, they become Ascendant, and the last star of their constellation springs to life.

Aries/Hellfire: A massive plume of fire erupts around you. Once per day, you may transform into pure fire, and can manipulate a body of fire equal to your size. Once the fire burns out completely, you return to your normal form.

Taurus/Tornado: A massive windstorm descends around you. Once per day, you may transform into pure wind, and can manipulate a storm lasting for ten minutes. The storm can be augmented by tossing spells into it.

Gemini/Mithuna: The time for judgment is at hand. Within the small area around you, life accelerates towards death, and those who linger rush towards their final fate. While the rate time turns forward is relative to your own magickal strength, the substantial cost of channelling remains the same throughout. Your opponent may attempt to resist this granted he is strong enough, but it is more likely that they will attempt to flee your sphere of influence. No amount of healing magic may turn back the hands of time, and with age comes frailty, weakness, and decay. You root yourself into the ground as you channel this, and remain rooted until shortly after it ends.

Cancer/Karka: Though it requires immense concentration on your part, you can forcefully compact space into a singularity. Enemies in close range are flung towards the singularity, which attempts to compress them in similar fashion. Of course, enemies may be strong enough to resist the pull, but the gravitational force will continue to tear away at them until they break free. Upon expending all of your energy, the singularity explodes, sending the survivors flying in all directions.

Leo/Gaia’s Wrath: With a blink and a nod, the earth erupts where you look upon it, and a torrent of lava shoots out like a jet. When your magickal reserves run dry, the earth closes up and returns to normal.

Virgo/Eschaton: A prayer to the sky is answered by a beam down from heaven. The light from the beam does not strike down a foe, but it erodes at their armour and strips them of their magickal energy steadily. Cease the prayer, and the beam ceases in kind.

Libra/Arbiter: With a snap of your fingers, you call forth a pair of Simulacrum, in the shape of an Archadian Judge. Created to do your bidding, they will obey your commands within reason. In combat, they are slow, but extremely durable and resistant – though they have an annoying tendency of knowing magick and preferring not to use it. In normal day to day, they prove to be excellent, if bulky, helpers. Two appears to be all your constellation is willing to provide.

Scorpio/Blight: An aura of venom is projected out from you. All living beings within fifteen meters of you are plagued with an escalating number of diseases. However, you channel this with your life force in addition to your arcane reserves.

Sagittarius/Martyr: A state of mind reflects the state of the body. Your wish to protect your allies manifests in your body taking the blows they would have otherwise taken. Focused in your desire to protect them, you freeze in place as this happens, reducing the impact of oncoming attacks. You must fully concentrate on this however, as a slip in concentration will break the spell entirely.

Capricorn/Judgment Bolt: It isn’t enough to simply call down lightning bolts. With one arm raised to the sky, you draw down a constant stream of lightning, sheathing yourself in its powerful glow. Your foes foolish enough to approach are shocked, and their slow projectiles are consumed by the lightning. Once your magick is drained however, the lightning dissipates.

Aquarius/Tsunami: A massive wave of water bursts up around you. Once per day, you may transform into pure water, and can manipulate a body of water equal to your size. Once the water dries up completely, you return to your normal form.

Pisces/Abyssal Celebrant: With a snap of your fingers, a destructive wave of ice spreads out, knocking back enemies it touches. The ice shifts, cracks, and moulds itself into the form of those it touched. These ice simulacrum mimic their originals and attack them selectively.

Aside from being a naturally more powerful example of your lineage, with your newly discovered abilities being manipulated as though you’ve been using them for years, your abilities will be far less tiring in general due to your high affinity towards them.

Can you do what it really takes? Can you handle what you’ll do, what you have done, in the end?

We shall see...

You are a master at gaslighting, mental torture and other forms of producing or amplifiing trauma from the most simple of methods, prodding and poking, saying insults in their face about their life and continue on as if nothing happened, as if you didn’t just say that and you’ll be so convincingly believable that they’ll think you didn’t say that, that it was all in their head even when it clearly wasn’t. Enflaming paranoia, making them think they’re their own worst enemy, piling on and on the troubles of their life until they think as though they can’t do anything, until this pain and grief starts taking over their life.

But the worst part is, you’re a master of making sure they can never break completely, that they’ll never see taking their own life as a viable method to get out of the pain and hurt of their existence, you can’t utilize their Otherself if the real self is dead after-all...

Deepening The Wound like this greatly increases the strength of their Otherself or other mental/soul-based powers at the cost of well... making them increasingly unstable as well.

Though you may forgo this aspect of the perk if your aim is to simply prolong their torture.

You may use this power for good, however it is much harder, pulling into their inner mental strength and empowering them and their Otherself to do the right thing or any other mental or soul-based equivalent power. Unfortunate as it is, but you probably don’t have enough time to use the ‘good’ version of this power unless you’ve some way to help, though they’ll also be much more stable in the end as well."

The magician Mathgen said he could throw all the mountains of Ireland down on their foes, and breathe life into the twelve chief mountains of Eire, that they rise and fight. The druid Figol promised to make it rain fire thrice a day, to steal two-thirds of the foes’ courage and strength, to wrack men and horses with plague, and bless the Dannan to gain strength and courage with every breath. The witches Bechulle and Dianan swore to raise a great host of every tree and stone to fight for Eire.

For instance imbuing a loupon with the cure spell would cause your loupon to send out a ring of powerful healing magic in all directions periodically while still having its normal effect of a bubble of magic that heals those within while imbuing it with the spell Blind would not only cause enemies within its bubble to be blinded, it would also send out a ring of powerful blinding magic that only effects foes periodicall with it as the epicenter.

This allows you to channel your magic through cards and bullets, if you choose to cast through your cards then their effects can be applied to your weapon upon the cards destruction while if you apply it to your bullets the effect will initiate upon impact.

In battle every life you take and every drop of blood spilled will heal your own body by a small amount, draining the enemies vitality as their lifeblood leaks from them you fight on, wading ever deeper into the thick of battle adding the cries souls of the damned to the demons you already have within.

These three attributes are embodied by the Three Commanders and now you have taken on a similar trait. You may choose one of the three above and find your powers imbued with that attribute overall. Choosing Power will multiply the strength of your attacks and powers ten times over from their normal height, choosing Speed will increase your own speed and the speed of your attacks tenfold each whilst choosing Accuracy will ensure that fate itself bends to ensure that the chance of your strikes missing is reduced to a mere one millionth of the normal chance for them to miss. You may not share the sheer, absolute depth that the Three themselves have yet your applications are far broader. "
1016,,600,Lower Case god,Dies Irae,Modus,"A unique being has appeared. Things such as you were normally considered leftovers, forgotten things from a long past age that humanity has no more use for. But a god is not easily erased from existence, even if you are not God himself. You were made to represent a specific concept of your choosing, something such as Darkness or Fire or Anger. You have immense powers over that concept, though the fading mystery from this world has taken much from you. So long as the concept that you chose continues to exist, so will you, even if you normally should have been killed. A god of darkness will exist so long as darkness does, whether it be physical shadows or the shadows within a man’s heart. Do note that certain affects that destroy all they touch or otherwise kill and bypass any defences can ignore this defence. You have immense control over your concept, able to control it in all its forms to accomplish mighty acts and even exert control over related things. A god of fire could summon an attack to vaporise an entire continent or send millions of people into homicidal rages by manipulating their fiery anger. A god of darkness could reflect any attack back through shadows, manipulate time or gravity to age people to dust in seconds or send the fear of darkness into a man’s mind to drive him mad. Your powers are great and they are broad even extending to allow you control instances of your chosen concept that are summoned or used by your enemies. You are not omnipotent however and you can be resisted, ignored or even crushed outright by those with enough power. You may be a match or even vastly outclass much of the LDO but attempting to take on the Gold himself would result in your swift death. Note that while you are given much leeway in what concept you choose to be a god of, picking particularly broad concepts will weaken the benefits you gain as your power is spread more thinly and you may not pick ‘Everything’ or similar things as a valid target."
1017,,600,Asura,The God of High School Jump,Modus,"Another terrifically powerful Charyeok, taking the form of one of the six armed, three faced Asura. The user may fire incredibly powerful energy beams from their mouths or turn these same beams into all direction shockwaves to strike at everyone around them with nothing more than a word. They may also absorb and then reflect attacks that are fired at the user, so long as those attacks are energy based instead of physical. There is a limit on the power of this absorption as anything too much stronger then you and Asura’s life energy combined will blow right through this ability. The user even gains the power to alter their body in minor ways, such as extending their fingers at great speeds to pierce opponents or being able to turn their heads all the way around to look behind themselves. Finally, Asura also grants its new partner the ability to control the minds of others through the user’s voice. Those with great willpower can resist this but a great deal of humanity will have no option but to follow every command of the wielder."
1018,,600,Nine Tails Guardian,The God of High School Jump,Modus,"The great Nine Tailed Fox, who was originally a Demon who became the bodyguard of the Jade Emperor through sheer determination, but was cast out from fear of its power. It’s hatred of the Gods turned it into the First Key, a being that can unseal the Taboo. The fox itself grants its bearer immensely increased physical abilities, enough that even at the most basic level of contracting the user cannot be perceived by ordinary humans because of their sheer speed. Incredible powers of pyrokinesis are also at the hands of the contractor, along with the ability to summon fire foxes of all different sizes in great numbers. As a Key, the Nine Tails is able to unseal the Taboo on all of humanity at once, regardless of their distance or presence on different dimensions, and could reseal it if the user so chooses. Activating this Charyeok turns the wielder’s hair white, their eyes yellow with red outlines and grants them seven tails made of fire. Perhaps you could unlock the last two tails with a direct contract?"
1019,,600,Lineal Descendant,The God of High School Jump,Modus,"A true descendant of a Charyeok, a being who can trace their ancestry back to the mythical being in question, is one who can draw out far more power than any other Charyeok user. Somehow, you count as the true descendant of any Charyeok or similar power you pick up, though only for the purposes of this perk. Your skill and power in using Charyeok of any kind is now on the level of The Six. An example of the power you can expect to have is Jeon Jae-San, the user of the Great Magician Charyeok. With this, he not only defended against the attacks of a Nephilim class God whilst the Taboo was still active but he also deconstructed the entirety of the United States Nuclear Arsenal that had been fired at him, turning it into a singular great missile that almost killed the Nephilim and he then teleported every living human within Seoul to several dozen kilometres away from the ensuing explosion, all in the span of a minute or so.

Not only are you a match for this great man’s raw power and skill with whichever Charyeok you have picked up but you are also, as a true descendant of the Charyeok you wield, able to enter Powerlenderization mode. In this mode you fuse with your Charyeok, gaining even greater power at the cost of a vast drain on your energy stores. You are certain to gain new abilities along with the increased power and you will be able to call the true forms of any National Treasures that you possess, greatly increasing the power that they hold. In time, you may learn how to maintain this form indefinitely but it is many years off to accomplish that feat.

Boosted: Why keep yourself to just a Charyeok and a Treasure? Within every blade, within every spirit is the potential for so much more. You are now able to perform Powerlenderization with any spirit that shares a connection with you and is willing. You are also able to call out the true appearance and power of any item that is not beholden to another person, just as if it were a National Treasure. Increasing the power of the item, or its effectiveness, and changing it to be more impressive looking.

1020,,600,Original Way,The God of High School Jump,Modus,"When humanity first joined the Heavenly War against the demons, they were weak and useless. It was only when the Gods granted the Humans a portion of their power, the original way of using Charyeok, that the humans became the near endless military force they were in those times. You are have the ability to make contracts like these with any being, gaining use of an imbued part of their power in return for favours or services of some kind, in the same way as a Charyeok works. Whilst convincing them to take the deal is up to you, once you have received the power, any harmful side effects that might come about from making use of it, such as the ones suffered by Humans making used of the Original Way of using Charyeok, will be greatly reduced. Using borrowed power that significantly ages you by decades might only add a year or two to your overall age.

Boosted: Being in a pact with you is good for the soul or so your Charyeok tell you. Any being in a contract with you treats you as an amplifier for their power. What they channel through you is massively increased in power, an increase that only grows the more powerful you are in comparison to that contracted being. Even if they were your equal or superior however, they would still see their power multiplied three or even four times over by using you as a channel.

1021,,600,Wayward Dreamers,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"The Fayth in the temples aren’t the only ones present in the world of Spira – and the art of conjuring Aeons isn’t a secret that that only Yevon possesses. But the Dark Aeon present in the world...there’s no telling whether they serve Yevon, or if they exist for a darker purpose.

They might be Aeons all the same, but the Dark Aeons not only seem to be stronger – they also seem to possess a far more distinct personality in comparison to the standard Aeon from the Fayth. You should probably hide the fact that you can corrupt summons to form these dark equivalents. The process is going to require sacrificing a substantial amount of magic as well as life force, but in return you can create a “Heretic” summon.

These summons are distinct – they not only possess a personality of their own, they’re also more powerful than their normal counterparts. Just don’t expect them to bend to your will so easily – giving a summoned spirit a will of its own isn’t always going to work in your favour. If you don’t consider things carefully before you push forward...you might find your own summon turning on you."
1022,,600,This is My Style,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"Anybody can kick a ball around. Most people in Spira can swim. It doesn’t take all that much to really play Blitzball, but when you’ve put in as much work as you have, you have the ability to take Blitzball and make it something great – something that people can recognize. This is your style, this is something for you to demonstrate to the world, a form of blitzball unique to you.

Whether you have fiery tackles, or a shot so strong it shoots people out of the ring like a projectile, or even shots that look like magic, you have the capacity to develop a style of Blitzball to be called your own and have people acknowledge as yours. Generally, this will be based on your most distinctive skills – and reflects in your shots, your tackles, your swimming style, how you align with teammates and so forth. Of course, if you use blitzball to fight, which some do, this will reflect on that as well.

Go forth, Ace, and show the world what you’re capable of."
1023,,600,The Grid,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"When you’re keeping track of improvements and training, it helps to have a solid foundation to work with – a system by which you can organize things. The people of Spira have adopted a system somewhat – it’s necessary when you’re dealing with things like spheres after all. You can keep track of it mentally, but with this you can steadily improve yourself with the use of spheres.

Normal spheres that enhance properties such as attack and defence won’t do much besides improve a parameter. But as you move on to more complicated spheres, you may be able to learn skills and such from the capabilities that the sphere possesses. Well – how you find these spheres, and how you decide to use them...that’s up to you. It’ll probably be handy if you have a method to create the spheres yourself though.

The further you develop, the more spheres you’ll need, the same goes for your companions, though you can help them improve with spheres with your ability. Maybe you should try experimenting with some dress spheres and see what happens?"
1024,,600,Overdrive!,Final Fantasy X,Modus,"There’ll come a time when your normal skills, your normal attacks just won’t be enough – there’ll be an enemy that requires something of the next level in order to be surpassed. Unfortunately, in a world like Spira – fighting is ultimately a necessity for survival...and frankly, you’re very likely to meet an enemy that may push you to pull out a trump card.

An “Overdrive” skill is a trump card of sorts – empowering a skill you already possess to the next level. The ritual to do so isn’t nearly as formal as you might think – it usually involves a very odd routine, something for you to decide – perhaps something to make the “Overdrive” personal to you...even if it results in very strange posing, or some bizarre dance. You’ll have a short span of ten seconds where you can perform this routine, but no other skill will have any effect during this time. Immediately afterwards though, you’ll find that the empowered skill will see a substantial increase in terms of its power and effect.

It isn’t called an Overdrive for nothing you know, but you won’t be able to charge Overdrives back to back – it takes a span of time in between."

Just by being born this way Nila was considered to be the strongest Privileged had seen in 600 years and Taniel was steeled and enhanced through his experience in a way that the god Adom considered him a Predii equivalent of a Powder mage.

This purchase will give you a straight power boost to your sorcerous abilities purchased here and enhance some abilities of yours but not really grant you new abilities or techniques.

1026,,600,Didn’t Bring a Blood Pack ,Chainsaw Man,Modus,"Requirements and upkeep on the level of drinking blood, sleeping, and it being a full moon are removed from any of your abilities of hellish/demonic origin (and reduced greatly on those that aren’t) as long as they’d be possible for you to fulfill otherwise within the current Jump’s world. If you still manage to fulfill the requirements after the perk does its work then the bonuses you get from them are improved half again and the perk develops. This development allows the perk to work for more and more non-hellish abilities and cover for larger and larger requirements. There is a limit to how well this perk works in a sort of theoretical storage that ticks down as you draw upon resources you don’t have. This “storage” increases in capacity as you use the ability and grow stronger. After that runs out you can choose for it to automatically draw resources from your warehouse/properties to satiate you without going through the normal process."
1027,,600,There Are Good Devils,Chainsaw Man,Modus,"What’s so great about being feared? You can pick one emotion this Jump’s perks and items are based on instead of fear. You still count as a devil of hellish origin regardless of what you pick. Post-Jump, you can pick one perk each Jump to swap an aspect of around. For example, you could opt for a perk that makes you stronger the faster you are to instead be faster the stronger. The end result can’t be inherently better by itself than what it was before and must be a direct equivalent to the original."
1028,,600,Wish Granting        ,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"The unique ability of the Einzbern family and one of the most powerful Sorcery Traits in the world. You've finally gained possession of it. This ability allows one to entirely bypass the need for skill or knowledge of magic, instead using the brute force method of expending vast amounts of magical energy to replace such things. In effect, it allows one to expend magical energy to achieve any possible effect desired. This is limited by the tremendously increased energy costs such effects have when compared to what casting the same effect with the skill and knowledge normally required would cost. These base costs are built on whatever magical system you possess and prefer to use for it, though note that Wish Granting cannot accomplish the completely impossible for your chosen system. If you were using Magecraft as a base, you would not be able to accomplish feats in the purview of True Magic, no matter how much magic you put in. Unlike the average user of this Sorcery Trait, it will apply to any form of magic you possess, rather than just be limited to what is used through your Magic Circuits.

Boosted: Wish Granting has now transformed to something much more like its namesake, the Holy Grail’s wish granting ability. Whilst still capable of all its base functions and capabilities, when being used at the request of an outside, autonomous source, the immense cost of using Wish Granting is severely lessened, thus making even large scale use of Wish Granting a feasible objective when the user is serving as a sort of genie in a lamp. The greater the influence the user has knowingly had over the request of some outsider, the less the cost of making the Wish will drop.

1029,,600,Average One,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"You're not just some ordinary magician. You're head and shoulders above each of your peers. Magic is like breathing to you. You can easily figure out the mechanics of magecraft you encounter, absorb magical knowledge twice as fast as any other student of your level, find making new spells to be the work of weeks or months instead of years and when you actually get down to casting, your magic is twice as strong as that of any of your peers, while only costing as much as you'd normally use without the boost. You've also got an affinity for the 5 elements. Fire, Earth, Water, Air and Ether. Any spells you use involved with these elements will be a fair bit more effective than usual as well as easier for you to learn. 

Boosted: Average One now makes you one of the foremost prodigies of the modern magical world. You possess thrice as much magical energy as anyone your age should and have a far easier time controlling any of the magical energy you channel. This is not just some quirk of fate however but the result of a Sorcery Trait. Blue Blood Magic Circuits, the innate ability of the mighty Bartholemoi, has come into your hands. Whether you are a lost child of that exalted family or a spiritual thief, the result is that you have thrice as much magical energy and twice as much control as you normally would.

A larger planet needs stronger protectors after all. The archives of old mention Eidolons in a form different than those we recognize them in now – surely, this is evolution at work.

You may select up to two summoned creatures. These summoned creatures will remember changes that occur to them while they are summoned, as though they had a template which changes with time. However, their physical form will never be shifted in such a dramatic fashion that they will look completely different from their original. These creatures can also learn skills beyond their fundamental capacity, but this takes a prodigiously long amount of time and effort. It is also generally limited to their same elemental composition.

But power comes at a price – and the ability to retain memories carries with it a large cost. Those creatures you have chosen to bestow this gift upon will remain conjured for less time than normal and cost more to summon."

Faith in this world is more than an idea, it exists as a quantifiable force that can be detected and in the case of the gods and of yourself, channeled. There is power in prayer, and those that pray to you grant you this power. Faith can be used to enhance the self beyond one’s physical limits, enhance any powers or abilities already utilized by the wielder, and grant inspiration, channeling divine power into mental acuity for a short time.

Apparently, it’s symbolic of their web of crime and influence, given that they are a Mafia family. That gives Angel Dust quite a few abilities, such as the capability to have up to six arms out, poison fangs, you get the idea. Or to put it differently: Your power can be shaped by the blood running through your veins, or similar connections at any rate. And you can use that to your advantage now. You may choose one character, though it can’t be an Overlord unless you have the Prince[ss] of Hell origin, to be somehow related to, be it literally by blood, being gifted a fragment of their power, or other means of your choosing, and gain a weaker copy of their abilities you can train up. Doing so though may take a while. "
1033,,600,Blue Magic,Final Fantasy VIII,Modus,"A curious and obscure ability, you've somehow picked up the ability to learn Blue Magic in your studies. The basic principle is that many monsters possess special magical techniques, often employed through a special body part or organ. You can, with a little research and a complete dissection, learn how these techniques work, and how you may replicate them yourself using magic. What this amounts to is the ability to copy a defeated being's (monster, animal, plant, sapient, etc.) single strongest technique, whether biological or magical in nature, by examining part of their dead body. While this ability has plenty of potential, the single biggest caveat is that these techniques are often true magic, and normal humans just aren't capable of casting true magic except during a Limit Break. This drawback will apply to any Blue Magic learned from creatures in the Final Fantasy 8 world. If you leave this world, however, any techniques learned from creatures outside of it will still function normally barring similar restrictions, no Limit Breaks needed. The best part, though, is that Blue Magic is entirely reproducible and teachable, and though it's quite an advanced subject, any of your students may eventually be taught to wield the techniques you've gained through its use as well, or even Blue Magic itself."
1034,,600,A System of Your Own ,Solo Leveling,Modus,"After being betrayed by his fellow Monarchs and Rulers alike, the Shadow Monarch sought the help of a powerful magician to help him reincarnate on Earth. What resulted from this collaboration was the magic power known as The System, a powerful ability that allows even the weakest Hunter, barely stronger than a human, to reach the level of the Shadow Monarch in just a few months, by gradually increasing the ‘Player’s’ stats and creating tailored dungeons to gain the more exotic and special sub-abilities of the Shadow Monarch.

In addition to that, the System was able to channel the Shadow Monarch’s magic to create a great variety of items to aid the Player, such as restorative potions or a great variety of weapons. The System also comes with an unlimited storage space in pocket dimension, or ‘Inventory’, where its Player can store all those items for later use, being held in stasis and perfectly preserved. However, one cannot store anything that would be larger than a regular human, nor anything that is fully alive. Sentient or possessed weapons and items are acceptable things to store in your inventory, though. All of these options are accessible through a variety of menus. Not only that, but the System also protects the user from various status effects, such as poisoning, making the user immune to such.

Whether due to the same Magician, or perhaps another entity, you have been bestowed with a very similar, yet more potent ability. While the original System was tailored to just the powers of the Shadow Monarch, the System that you have granted access to will instead be able to be attuned to any ability that you have access to.

Once an ability has been attuned to The System, any usage of your abilities will quickly increase their potency, as will do any kills you make using them, giving you experience and slowly ‘leveling’ you up. You will receive daily quests that will slowly but surely increase your stats, and as you get more proficient with these, you might even unlock sub-skills.

But perhaps its most powerful ability is the creation of personalized individual dungeons. These will draw from the environment and your own memories for their layouts, and the monsters in these dungeons will be taken as copies from either the local populations or from previous jumps. Defeating the bosses of these dungeons will grant you powerful items that will significantly increase said abilities' effectiveness, as well as special skills related to the ability attuned to.

However, you may only attune with a single ability at the time, although you may switch it with another at any time. No other beings will be recognized as Administrator of this System, so you don’t need to fear your abilities being hijacked like The Architect was able to do with Jin-Woo."
1035,,600,Arch-Demon: King of Evil,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"You have been chosen by the Truth to play one of the most important roles in this universe: to be one of the heads of the side of evil. That is, you have become part of the weird, violent and dysfunctional family that are the seven Arch-Demons! It seems that you have taken the place of the mysterious Aka Manah, as probably very few would notice the difference in such a case.

The Arch-Demons are the mightiest of the Daeva, beings to whom destroying planets is expected, and you now have that same kind of strength. Not only that, but being the summit of the individualist Daeva, any powers derived from your own will or that enhance yourself are multiplied in potency, such as the Power of Ego or most Commandments.

In this world, Dagravant of similar tendencies to yourself will flock to you, or even new ones will appear molded after your own themes to become your servants. While these aren’t close to a true Household, it wouldn’t do for a true King of Evil to go without minions.

Lastly, as one of the pillars of the Evil faction, whenever you destroy a large portion of the forces of Good, you will feel as if your own momentum in the universal war is increased, making your enemies have a harder time to reorganize and the forces of Evil prosper faster. However, as the Arch-Demons are singular existences compared to the collective mighty of the Wahman Yast, your effects are far less pronounced, needing a much larger kill count for a similar effect. 

In future worlds, you will keep the same effects of the rank of Arch-Demon, and will be invited to join a similar group if it exists."
1036,,600,The Hero’s Sword: Sensory of the White,Avesta of Black and White,Modus,"Maybe you were once selected to act as a vessel of Ahura Mazda, one of the two sensories of the Truth. Or perhaps, you are a sibling to Quinn, who was made from the corpse of the priestess of the same name and former vessel of Ahura Mazda. Whatever the case, you have gained several of the abilities of the Truth’s sensory for the Good side.

Similar to Quinn, you have the power to collect prayers. In order to accomplish this, you were turned into the equivalent of a telepathic radio platform of a cosmic range, allowing you to receive messages from anywhere in the universe, as well as relaying them or sending your own to any location. This also allows you to read the minds of others by touching them or their blood, even fully synchronizing with the five senses if the opposing party allows it. Be aware that some may resist this effect by their own power, or have a mentality so warped and alien that trying to understand them becomes impossible. Also, you can read memories.

As you gather these prayers, you are able to perform miracles in the same way that the great heroes could. Not only that, but you can also concentrate these prayers into those who gather around you, granting them temporary boosts that may allow exceptional Yatazas, assuming the forces of good are relevant enough at time, to fight against even Special Rank Daeva.

And for the last of your abilities, you are able to turn yourself into a sword, which would require a godly level of strength to be damaged, and thus could also be used to slay even the gods in the right hands.

Finally, due to your special nature, all of these gifts are not tied to the continued existence of the Truth, or her favor."
1037,,600,Hero’s Will,Fate/Grand Order,Modus,"So long as your will stays strong, so too will your body. The determination to protect your friends will last you out even if your body should be too weak to protect them still. Now your willpower can be used to power or empower your body or abilities, replacing the normal energy used and possibly even empowering it above the normal level of use. However, the greater the cost it would have been on your energy stores and the more power you put in above the normal level, the more strain it will put on your mind and body. Take too much strain on and you may find your mind, body or even soul to start to rip, rupture and tear. Continue to push yourself so far beyond your limits and even having a truly unbreakable will won’t prevent you from dying, though having such a will would allow you to go far, far further with this ability than most.

Boosted: Determination is the bread and butter of every hero. But there is so much more to heroism and life overall than just a steely gaze. Willpower is not the only source you can draw on to empower or power yourself. You are able to utilise every emotion you can feel at the moment, the stronger the emotion the more you can use it for. Much like with willpower however, this will strain you. It is possible to use multiple emotions at once but the amount of pain that would put you through may be too much to bear, provided it pushes you beyond your limits.

You can imbue any of your powers into your attacks to use them at range or combine their special effects with another method of delivery. A classic example would be combining the ability to create swords with a bullet to create swords from within the bodies of those shot by the bullet. Physical blows could be combined with elemental magic to grant them similar auras and even positive effects, such as healing magic, could be transferred through a quick smack or long ranged attack. A massive increase in adaptability for your methods of combat and abilities, it’s fitting for you Jumper.

It doesn’t matter if you hold a Longinus or belong to some ancient bloodline - what matters is that you fight for what you believe in and never give up. Your determination receives an astounding boost - despair and mind control find themselves trying to move a mountain against you, and your body refuses to stay down even if your bones have shattered like glass. Not only does this grit make you harder to put down, but you can apply your own hot-blooded willpower to your magical power, increasing its potency or destructive power with the roaring of your soul. An amateur making an elemental blast could overtake an entire squad of more experienced foes by surprise with such a thing, and with time and training, who knows what you’ll accomplish? One thing is certain - it’s not about what kind of weapon you wield, but the hand that wields it."
1043,,600,Idiot Hero,High School DxD,Modus,"You absolute madman. You may not be competent or knowledgeable in some areas, but you make up for it with tenacity that outright bends or breaks the rules of ‘how this is supposed to work’. The more insane or dangerous a stunt is - powering magic via fixation on large tracts of land, fighting an enemy with a plugged in toaster, or anything that’s horrendously at odds with the tone of your situation - the more likely that stunt is to succeed. This is enough that if you had, say, the magical power of the Red Dragon Emperor, you could manifest an actual deity based on a concept you really liked. You may not have that, but similar insanity is in your reach - it doesn’t guarantee success, but now as a plan 'stop the endless battle with the power of song, dance, and an army of squirrels' has a non-zero chance of success. This also applies to skills and powers, as the prior example will soon demonstrate in-universe - just note that this can’t always compensate for a lack of training or energy, or at least not for long."

Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects. A situational cursed technique or one with a lot of limitations would likely only be 200 CP, for example, while one with overwhelming power and versatility would be 800 CP.

1045,,600,Limitless,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"You’re can use Limitless, the cursed technique of the Gojo family. This, in short, is the ability to bring infinity into reality, which in practice functions as a form of space manipulation. In its most basic form, referred to as Infinity, this takes a layer of space surrounding the user’s body and extends it into infinity. Functioning similarly to Zeno’s paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, anything that approaches you gets caught in this space, slowing down as it gets closer until stopping entirely, never actually reaching you. This acts like an impenetrable forcefield surrounding you in practice, with any attacks sent your way being unable to actually hit you. There are some ways, however, to breach this defence: techniques or cursed tools that nullify cursed techniques, effects that bypass space entirely, and attacks that cannot miss, such as from a Domain Expansion, are all known examples.

Limitless isn’t restrained to being used defensively, however: it also has several potent offensive uses. Blue is the amplified form of Limitless, which acts as the ability to attract by manifesting negative distance into reality. The effects of this are broad: it can be used to pull things towards you, tear apart buildings brick by brick, or something as precise as crushing someone’s limbs by affecting several different parts of them with Blue. It doesn’t just have to pull things towards you, either – it can also be used to pull things towards a specific point in space, often manifesting as a blue orb of energy that functions like a black hole that can be moved at-will, or even to pull you towards a specific point in order to act as a form of high-speed movement.

There also exists an inverse form of Blue, known as Red, which requires mastery of reverse cursed technique in order to use. As Blue’s opposite, Red acts instead as the ability to repel. While used in a similar manner to Blue, Red is at least twice as powerful, and often takes the form of a small ball of blood red energy – a direct hit is more than enough to blow a large hole through most things it hits, or at the very least send a target flying for hundreds of metres with enough force to tear apart the entirety of their surroundings.

The most powerful form of Limitless is Hollow Technique: Purple, the fusion of Blue and Red. By combining attraction and repulsion, an imaginary mass is created in the form of a large ball of purple energy, then shot forth. The power of this cannot be understated: while it doesn’t literally erase anything it touches, it might as well do for most matter it comes into contact with, leaving only empty space in its wake. Only those standing at the absolute peak of this world in terms of power and skill, would be able to resist it, and even then not without serious injuries.

There are more uses of Limitless besides these. It can, for instance, be used to teleport the user and anything they’re touching long distances. It has been stated certain conditions are required for this to function, though unfortunately these are currently unknown. The main flaw of Limitless is its complexity: without also possessing the Six Eyes, it’s almost impossible to use effectively due to the immense precision and high energy costs required."
1046,,600,Living Disaster,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"Your cursed technique embodies some sort of natural disaster, letting you manipulate it with both great power and versatility. The known examples of this kind of technique include Jogo’s pyrokinesis, Hanami’s plant manipulation, and Dagon’s hydrokinesis.You may select one of the above, or choose something entirely different with a similar power level to the examples given below.

Jogo’s pyrokinetic abilities, for example, allowed him to create enormous blasts of flame from his hands capable of burning down vast areas and seriously wounding or killing grade 1 sorcerers. Aside from this, he was also capable of generating small volcanos to emerge from surfaces at a distance and violently erupt; producing fist-sized ‘Ember Insects’ while flew towards a target, attempted to sting them (to unknown effect), then exploded; and even creating an enormous flaming meteor capable of destroying much of Shibuya.

Hanami’s ability, on the other hand, allows for the creation and manipulation of plants with various special abilities. On the simpler end, this can be used to produce various wooden constructs: roots to entangle and throw enemies about; spikes of wood that emerge out of the ground; vast masses of roots the size of a large building; and balls of wood from which branches can emerge mid-flight to skewer those around it. On the more complex end, this can also be used to produce such things as a field of flowers that distracts and disorients those caught in it or buds that drain the cursed energy of whoever they latch onto."
1047,,600,King of Curses ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"During the Golden Age of Jujutsu, many sorcerers with power surpassing the vast majority of modern sorcerers called Japan home. There was one, though, who stood above all others as the undisputed strongest in history. Born with a disfigured body uniquely suited for jujutsu sorcery, unsurpassed reserves of cursed energy, and a cursed technique of incredible power, this innate talent alone put him on the path for greatness. You may not share these traits, but there is one area in which you’re his equal: your raw ability with jujutsu.

Due to a combination of natural talent and training, your skill with cursed energy is at the very peak of this world. From fluidly switching between different techniques of yours to using even the most complex of abilities, all of this comes effortlessly to you. Though you don’t have the precision nor efficiency granted by the Six Eyes, it wouldn’t be wrong to say your understanding of cursed energy would be on par with someone who possessed them.

This understanding extends further than just your own cursed energy, though: it also allows you great insight into how others use it, too. Just by witnessing a cursed technique in action you’re able to quickly determine how it functions after just a few moments, letting you figure out its potential strengths and weaknesses. Not only that, but so long as it’s not something innate to the individual, you’ll be able to copy any usage of cursed energy after witnessing it a few times. While you can’t copy cursed techniques with this, if you had the same cursed technique as someone else you’d certainly be able to copy any abilities they’ve developed for it, and if you witnessed someone using reverse cursed technique to heal a burned-out cursed technique, you’d soon be able to do the same even if you previously thought it impossible."
1048,,600,Flashing Black,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"A Black Flash is a rare phenomenon that all sorcerers are theoretically capable of, but few will ever achieve even once. When a sorcerer applies their cursed energy to a physical attack within a millionth of a second of the impact occurring, their energy becomes dyed black as it explodes outwards (hence the name). The results are dramatic: not only is the strength of the attack increased to the power of 2.5, it also causes the user to temporarily enter a state similar to ‘the zone’, where manipulating cursed energy becomes as easy as breathing. Naturally, this lets them operate at levels beyond their usual limits, at around 120% of their potential, and makes scoring consecutive Black Flashes far more likely.

While you’re not able to perform Black Flashes at-will, you have an incredible amount of skill and natural talent when it comes to manipulating your cursed energy. It would be incredibly simple to mislead your foes with your control, tricking them into thinking you’re doing something else with your energy until the very last moment, and your skill also makes any cursed techniques you possess a fair bit stronger, as you intuitively understand how to use your cursed energy in a more efficient manner. Of course, pulling off Black Flashes is much easier for you than most, to the point that they’re a pretty regular occurrence, and will only become more so with practice. And, in situations where you’re especially focused, such as a fight where your life is at significant risk, you’re practically guaranteed to pull off at least one.

The concept of Black Flashes may also be applied to any other supernatural energies you may possess, too."
1049,,600,Lone Ranger ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus,"Kokichi Muta, better known as Mechamaru, was born with a Heavenly Restriction: a condition where a sorcerer is born with a significant disadvantage compared to their peers, in exchange for great boons elsewhere. While some individuals’ Heavenly Restrictions grant them great physical abilities in exchange for abnormally low levels of cursed energy, his was quite the opposite. Instead of a powerful body, he was born with several missing limbs, and lived in constant pain. In exchange, he gained something no other sorcerer could possess: the ability to use his cursed technique over incredible ranges.

Somehow, though, you have achieved the same feat without having to sacrifice your physical condition in return. While they may not be any more powerful than before, the range of all of your techniques and supernatural abilities have been vastly increased. A technique that could only be used out to a maximum of a few hundred metres before, for instance, would now have a range that would allow you to use it anywhere in Japan with no loss in efficiency. Muta used this to great effect with his Puppet Manipulation technique, allowing him to puppeteer his cursed corpses as if he were right next to them while he remained in a bunker on the other side of the country.

Of course, there is something of a restriction to this, that being the limits of your own perception. While your range may extend for hundreds of miles in theory, if you can’t see something that far away it’s not exactly going to be easy to use your techniques on them. With some creativity, or perhaps a technique that comes with the ability to perceive things at a distance beyond what your own eyes can see, though, this shouldn’t be too much of an issue."
1050,,600,GENESIS,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Evolution becomes a much faster process when other species and living beings have done all of the legwork for you. The original Jenova didn't merely adopt the appearance of her victims' loved ones, but assimilated their beings into her own growing mass. Even Angeal, one of the top members of SOLDIER, exhibited this ability to an extent. By physically touching a living being, you may copy its genetic traits, DNA, and even memories into your own being, adding it to your own body and mind. Should you have some ability to change your appearance and shape, you may turn into a perfect double of that person or creature. Anything tied to the biological form of a living being can become all yours...a man could easily turn into a monster all on his lonesome, with this ability by itself."
1051,,600,The Planet Answers,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Completing the magic trifecta, there is magic that is simply leagues above and beyond even powerful Summon Materia. This is Ultimate Magic, which draws on the full power of the Planet itself or even the surrounding cosmos to bring about either salvation or ultimate destruction. You now have two ways you may invoke this powerful Magic. First, you must simply have enough energy to shift the cosmos to your will to unleash a devastating effect, whether calling down a moon-sized Meteor to kill the very Planet you're on or even pull your enemies into a dimension where a

Supernova is being unleashed. Needless to say, an ordinary human being isn't capable of this power without a fantastic amount of willpower and magical energy, and the destruction it unleashes is nothing short of breathtaking. You are able to create and eventually cast these awesome spells once you have the energy for it, starting with one of your choice: Something akin to Meteor, Supernova, or Holy. Interestingly, you're capable of this even if you normally depend on Materia to use magic in this world, though taking As Natural As Breathing makes it easier for you to learn and master.

The other method is that you may beseech a higher power for aid. A prayer made to the Lifestream could see the Planet itself moving to save both itself and the creatures living within it in its most dire hour, or unleash the great spell Holy that would cleanse the Planet of all threats to itself...whether an impending destructive force or a species actively trying to kill it. This is done at no personal cost to the user, but whether or not aid is given will depend on the disposition of the force you're calling on and how great your need is. A being or entity that is aligned to your interests or goals is more likely to answer you in a crisis than if you called one with no interest in your actions during a moment of mild danger. At the very least, your prayer WILL be heard by whatever you're calling out to, so long as it exists.

If you have 'Wisdom of the Ancients', you may turn any Ultimate Magic you know or have casted at least once into Materia that others can potentially use, though you may set the conditions needed for such to be done yourself. Even when made into Materia, these spells tend to be very draining and costly, but will be a little easier to accomplish otherwise."
1052,,600,As Natural As Breathing,Final Fantasy VII,Modus,"Well, if you weren't one of the surviving Cetra before, you certainly are now. You know that mention about humans not being able to use magic anymore? That's no longer an issue for you. Not only do you have a natural attunment to the Lifestream and magical energies, but you are able to use Magic and Summoning in this world without Materia. Since learning magic the old-fashioned way has been a dead art for several millennia, this is something you're going to have to figure out on your own. With some effort, you can recreate the effects of various Magic Materia on your lonesome, and eventually create your own spells entirely from scratch so long as they follow the same conventions. Combine electricity and ice magic to make a deadly combination spell? Do-able. Make a spell that makes you and your allies faster while healing you all at the same time? Certainly. Create illusions and unique charm effects? All plausible.

The fun doesn't stop there. Since Materia is just a helpful instruction manual in your hands, any spells you use from Materia enough times, you may eventually learn to cast even if you don't have it equipped anymore. Any special abilities or boosts gained from Materia or magical items will eventually become a permanent part of you, letting you retain special effects or use unique spells without needing to carry the Materia around. The mages of old may not be around anymore, but given enough time, you'll give them one hell of a comeback."
1053,,600,Temporal Mastery,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Icathia may not be anymore, but their magic remains... somewhat. Zilean, the Time Mage, is still around and kicking, apparently wading through time trying to find a way to prevent the Fall of Icathia. He’s not having much success, unfortunately. What matters is that now time magic is at your beck and call. Maybe you’re an unfortunate victim of his experiment, one of his students, or maybe you’re just born with it, but it doesn’t matter. Just be careful, because time magic is dangerous and unpredictable. It’s better if you train hard instead of trying something as ambitious as time travel. You wouldn’t want to accidentally fuck up the entire timeline and cause the destruction of Runeterra, would you?"
1054,,600,The Power of the Elements,Legends of Runeterra,Modus,"Ixtal is the home of elemental magic, and the people of Ixtal are masters of the practice to this day. You too now share the immense affinity with elemental magic that they possess. Even if you’re not a mage, you will still be able to infuse elemental power in any fighting style you desire. But you may ask, what kind of elemental power? After all, Earth Magic, Fire Magic and Water Magic all are forms of elemental power, no? Well, of course this Perks cover all of them. You may take some time to master all forms of elemental magic, but when you do, your power will be immense."
1055,,600,Intentional Magic,Inheritance Cycle,Modus,"Nonverbal magic here is ridiculously dangerous in that even the most powerful of magicians (if they know it at all) only use it for low risk spells, unfortunately those are also the smallest of spells. For you see the Ancient Language is not magic in and of itself but instead is a safety measure implemented by the Grey Folk. By using magic nonverbally, you are actually using magic directly with your will. It is faster and more flexible if you have the will and the focus to not be a walking disaster. Fortunately for you, you are now no longer bound by such limitations. You are capable of using magic for the highest level of spells using nothing but your pure will with no risk at all to yourself. You also gain the necessary focus for such a feat, as well a talent at nonverbal magic. This applies to all magics you learn from now on."
1056,,600,Foreigner Hunter,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Modus,"The very worst kind of Servant in the Universe are the Foreigners. Dirty, violent, out to corrupt good Servants and bring their strange customs into common practice. It’s the job of people like you to hunt down and exile these Evil Gods colloquially known as Foreigners. 

Your position as a Foreigner Hunter lets you track them down at vast ranges, slowly homing in on any Foreigners present in a galactic range. You’ll recognise them on sight and possess a powerful anti-foreigner attribute that causes your abilities to be much mightier against that class of being, several times over as strong. Your own defenses are similarly boosted, their eldritch corruption struggling to gain any purchase on you and their normal attacks greatly weakened. You can even cleanse the Foreigner taint from good citizens with a few moments of contact, freeing them from control or madness induced by the Outer beings. 

The most fearsome of your endowed abilities is Confiscation, the ability to acquire the Authority and power of any Foreigner or Evil God you lay low enough. Defeat is the usual requirement but once they’re on the ground, you can leave them powerless. Cuff ‘em and bring them back for a proper trial in the Servant Universe. Regulations say you’re not really allowed to use what you confiscate, since it will turn you into a Foreigner yourself and possibly corrupt the body, mind or spirit. Buuuut...it’s pretty cool, right?

These Sabers have a violent hatred for Foreigners, born from years of losing holiday hours after being called in for yet another hunt. They strongly opposed Outer God immigration into any native reality and take a fervent belief in the idea that all Lovecraftian entities should go back where they came from."
1057,,600,Ether Anchor,Honkai Impact 3rd,Modus,"Maybe it is a quirk of fate, or maybe you have actively interfered with bubble universes before, but the Ether Anchor has been sealed into your body, empowering you to great heights. You have a body that has reached the essence of perfection, making you extremely developed in a physical sense. You have a highly superhuman body, enough to casually toss around 18-wheeler trucks, survive attacks of a similar level, and move at extremely high, yet subsonic, speeds. You also have a limitless amount of physical stamina, and do not require sustenance, breathing, or sleep.

You do not excrete waste, either. As a side-effect of your developed physicality, you are also extremely good-looking (though these good-looks actually manifest as more of an effeminate kind of beauty, rather than ‘muscle-bound man’ type beauty). You also have an extremely high resistance to all supernatural energies, with all unwanted supernatural effects reducing to 1/100th of their original effect in your vicinity.

You also have an extremely high affinity for combat, learning and mastering combat techniques in the blink of an eye (figuratively, at least). Your talent in combat is great enough that, if you can figure out the basics behind a technique, you can essentially reverse-engineer someone’s fighting style and master it to the same extent as them (or to an even higher extent, with a bit of training) after fighting them for a few minutes.

And you have a similar affinity with all supernatural energies, with all of your energy pools being linked together into one massive pool that can be used for all of your energy-based abilities. Finally, any and all abilities you have that have cooldowns can have their cooldown cut in half per combat action taken, allowing you to near-instantly regain use of abilities that can only be used once per decade by just slashing and stabbing at the air a few times.

This is a Capstone Booster, meaning that the capstone perks of other Origins are boosted with this perk, with the specific boosts being noted alongside the perks"
1058,,600,Lore,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"A simple fact of the World of Balance is that Humans and Espers do not have a monopoly on magic. Monsters wield it both passively and actively in unique ways that few have bothered studying. Most people seem content to stay in their little slices of the world and cut down any monsters that try to bother them. But the mystery of this unique form of magic that monsters are capable of draws a few inquisitive minds. Especially from the ranks of the Magi. Those who take the time to understand that uniqueness learn now to use it themselves.

By allowing yourself to be stuck by the magic spells of monsters, you can learn how to cast them yourselves. Of course, you will need to survive to make use of your new knowledge. A problem made even tougher by the deadliness of some of their spells. You cannot simply witness the performance of monsters using their spells. Personal experience of the effect(s) is required to truly understand them."
1059,,600,Gamble,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Let the Magi have their flashy spells based on learning, effort, and understanding. That kind of magic is boring and predictable. It would be so much more fun if magic had an element of chance to it. A roll of the dice with much higher stakes than mere coins. With this in mind, you’ve tapped into a sort of wild, unpredictable magic based around luck and the power of money. The first effect is simple enough. You can dissolve money into a kind of magical energy that you can unleash upon your foes. The destructive force of this magical energy is directly proportional to how much you spend. Just a few coins will net you a slap on the cheek. Empty your pockets after a night of winning at the casinos and you just might kill a dragon in a single blow. [Note 4]

The second effect is more unpredictable. By giving yourself up to the whims of your luck, you can roll the dice and cause a random magical effect to be unleashed. Healing, elemental blasts, status ailments, even powerful death spells have a chance of appearing when you focus your mind and exert your will. Use caution when deciding to test your luck. Your unpredictable magic tends to want to help you, targeting enemies with destructive spells and allies with healing ones more often, but you won’t always come up aces. You might find yourself or your allies on the receiving end of a spell of lingering death or your enemies healed."
1060,,600,Rage,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Monsters powerful! Magic! Tough! Learn monster! Then you powerful! Instinct. Part berserking, part learned response. It’s the most powerful force driving animals and monsters alike. In this world, one can make the argument that instinct is interlaced with magic due to how many monsters display the ability to tap into it. Through your years of living so deeply immersed in instinct, you’ve learned how to tap into this powerful force at will. By giving yourself up to it you can mimic the abilities and magic of the monsters themselves.

Essentially, Rage is a Blue Magic that is learned by living with the monsters you want to mimic the abilities of for a short time. A week is usually more than enough, though extremely powerful monsters may require additional time. Once learned, you will be able to throw yourself into the “instinct” of that monster. Any passive magical effects surrounding the creature will affect you as well and you’ll be able to use any unique abilities of the monster. Giving yourself over to the instinct means that you won’t have as much control over your actions as normal, as your mind will become partially that of the monster’s for a time. But you will maintain enough control that you will not attack allies directly and will be able to snap yourself back out of it when you desire."
1061,,600,Blitz ,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"Of the more mystical arts that exist in the World of Balance, Master Duncan’s Blitz techniques firmly cross the line between martial and magical. The techniques are among his most carefully guarded secrets and Duncan does not teach them to others lightly. Even students who have dedicated a decade of their lives to training are sometimes found unworthy of the power of Blitz. Even if you did not train under Duncan himself, you have learned an art similar enough to be indistinguishable to the casual viewer.

You have learned how to harness the power of your own chi to perform acts that step outside what the physical body should be capable of with normal martial arts. So far you have only touched on basics, allowing you to emit bolts of pure energy or perform a flurry of super-fast blows given a moment to gather you strength. But given time to practice, or lots of battle experience, you will unlock many more mystical applications of your martial arts. You will even be able to create your own Blitz techniques, though doing so would take years of effort."
1062,,600,Geodancer,Final Fantasy VI,Modus,"There is a strange, unique magic to Moogles that is likely the reason the Espers show such interest in them. They are capable of communing with nature to a limited degree, drawing the innate magic of the world into themselves. The Moogles can feel this communion as a rhythm. The pulsing sensation of living magic courses through their bodies. And while others would likely have twisted this pulse to their own means, the Moogles understand that they should go along with the flow of nature rather than fighting it.

So they dance. They spin with the swirls of desert winds, bow low against the freezing cold of the northern mountains, and express their magic as they emulate nature itself. Each type of environment they commune with teaches them to recognize a unique pulse of magic. Even when they are far from that magical pulse, they can still tap into it once they know what to reach out for. It is not an overstatement to say that the more a Moogle travels, the more dangerous its magic can become.

You can also tap into these rhythms of life and dance to express their unique magic. While dancing you can even cause an illusion of the environment you’re channeling to appear around you. Exactly which magical spells you will tap into depend on the place itself, but they tend towards ones that target entire groups of enemies or allies. Blasts of wind, earthquakes, and healing fog banks are just the barest example of what you could learn."
1063,,600,Powerful Monk,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Modus,"Knowing how to curse or heal is all well and good, but the true enticement of sorcery is utility, at least to most people. Fortunately for you, you’ve had the opportunity to advance your magical abilities to the point that you’re one of the most learned priests in Jambu Dvipa. You do not gain particularly potent techniques with this, but you get a width of ability that matches the depth of any but the most powerful monks and priests in this world. So, let’s start with a few examples of the kind of spells, charms, and other rituals that you now have available.

You could conjure spirits to follow your commands, in order to obtain supernatural servants for short or long periods of time. Limited shapeshifting is also possible, such as turning a fallen wooden branch into a raging buffalo temporarily, or even turn invisible for a time. Perhaps you’d like to make obedient and strong golems by hand, or unlock any mundane lock (or chains or knots) that bar your path and restrict your movement. How about turning small objects into small swarms of wasps that follow your orders, or imbuing your magics into tattoos for a more lingering effect? And, should they not be too much stronger than you, you could even nullify protective sorceries for a time.

This is not an exhaustive list, of course, but do keep in mind that your abilities with just this are mostly utilitarian in nature, and don’t directly curse or bless people, per se. That said, your breadth of abilities make you unmatched to those without significant expertise on the negative or positive arts of magic (as explained in the Sei Dyam and Sei Khaw perks), and while they are not particularly potent spiritually speaking, they’ll be undoubtedly useful to you in nearly any situation."

With this purchase, you can guarantee that you’ll be able to obtain these same benefits even in future worlds. Of course, the benefits you gain from good karma are obviously dependent on being good, by a specific system of values, namely that of Thai Buddhist culture. Should you be virtuous enough, you’ll be able to perform miracles such as secreting an incredibly nutritious form of milk from your fingers (your hand’s fingers, for the perverts out there), glow with an intensity proportionate to your virtue, and deal more effectively with the evil and corrupt.

Of course, virtue accumulates over time. It’s not quite enough to be good, you have to be good for a prolonged period of time. Even just a few years would result in a significant change for the better for your fortune in general, however, as long as you keep it up and strictly abide by virtuous behavior. Of course, behaving in a bad manner will reduce your karma and fortune to nothing, and even strike you with misfortune if you keep up such sinful behavior. If you're bad enough, you may even sprout an entire Hell around your soul after death, designed to punish you for your sins. Lastly, you’ll be able to spread this karmic force in future worlds, if you wish to do so. The actual definition of good and bad behavior will be explained in the notes."

Well, you can claim that if you like, since your ally somehow picked up exactly the right antidote to the poison, they’ll manage to barely survive attacks that could fell someone moving at ten times the speed and cure you, giving you a boost of energy to break through the evil queen’s previously unsurpassed defences as she’s caught off-guard and mortally wound her before you and your ally both finally expire. Rather than just getting handed power-ups at random like a certain someone, this is more giving you the chance to accomplish your goal given the resources you have if you’re about to lose – even if by all intents and purposes you have lost - though in more extreme cases such as this it could be a pyrrhic victory. Even if you were killed in an instant, your corpse could mortally wound your attacker.

Boosted: Pyrrhic victories kind of suck if it turns out it was just winning the battle and not the war. Now, that’s not so much of a problem for you, since if you weren’t fighting alone what you accomplished would let those you were allied with finish the fight. Sure, you basically died killing the villain, but it was enough to let your allies avert doomsday. And yes, if you wanted to, this would essentially screw over any chance of the opponents getting a happy ending out of nowhere – bittersweet is what they’ll have to deal with at the absolute best.

1076,,600,SORCERY,CthulhuTech,Modus,"Anybody (who isn't a parapsychic) can attempt magic in the world of CthulhuTech. However, with this perk, you are exceptionally skilled at magic. Spells are rituals, often involving a ritually prepared place, candles, books, preperatory periods of fasting, and similar trappings. You start out knowing three spells, and can easily internalize any further spells you find. Also with this perk, you can take this world's magical power with you to future jumps.

In the Strange Aeon, most people are hypothetically capable of doing magic. Few have the training to do it. Even fewer have enough training and wisdom to do so safely. Ordinary people have about 9 Ruach (also called Orgone).  People replenish about 1 Ruach per hour of rest. Spells may have costs of 5 to 45, but this is managed with caster's assistants who can contribute to paying the cost. Each spell takes weeks to months to learn, and hours or days to cast. Learning spells can erode your sanity. 

There are five schools of magic: Enchantment, Protection, Scrying, Summoning, and Transmogrification.

Enchantment spells usually create (usually temporary) magical objects. Legality varies. Such spells include: Consecrate Arcane Space (casting preparation), Constitute Corporeal Restorative (healing balm), Constitute Powder of Ibn Ghazi (invisibility revealer), Imbue Glamour Lock (minor illusion), Craft Ring of Dreams (enter dreams), Craft Woeful Orb (defender drone), Craft Ruach Well (ruach battery), Craft Yog-Sothoth's Guard (temporary invulnerability), and Craft Weeping Orb (attack drone).

Protection spells generally protect things. They are usually legal. Protection spells include: Ward Against Sorcery (resist magic), Ward of Corporeal Protection (magical armor), Ward of Solitude (blocks scrying), Ward of Cool Spirit (calming area), Ward Against the Unseen (blocks telepathy), Ward of Seclusion (antiscry area), Ward Against the Summoned (block summoned), Ward Against the Unbidden (blocks outsiders), and Ward of Sanctuary (armor area).

Scrying spells grant the caster knowledge. Some are legal. Scrying spells include: Eldritch Faculties (astral senses), Perceive Etheric Resonance (scrying), Phantom Vision (far sight), Know Passion's Flame (read emotions), Contact Those Who Dwell Beyond (random outsider), Wisdom of Yog-Sothoth (future visions), Call Ancient Soul (temporary skill), Beyond the Wall (see dreams), and Commune with the Beyond (contact outsider).

Summoning spells generally bring creatures from other dimensions. All summoning spells are illegal. Summoning spells include: Beckon the Mystical Unborn (spy drone), Summon Familiar (sentient pet), Summon Fetch (lab assistant), Leash the Summoned (creature mindlink), Beckon Shade Corpus (raise zombie), Call Forth Gaunt (gargoyle creature), Summon Superior Fetch (stronger assistant), Call Forth Bakhi (vile harpy), and Call Forth N'athm (nightmare stalker).

Transmogrification spells change things, usually people. Harmful transmogrification spells are highly illegal. Transmogrification spells include: Degeneration (curse), Mend Flesh (heal), Thieve Visage (steal face), Beckon the Unexpressed (gender flip), Manipulate Passion (influence emotion), Purify Form (return body to natural state), Path of the Silver Cord (astral project), Curse of the Outsiders (instill taint), and Migrate Soul (body swap).

Even powerful spirits and legendary heroes could have their spiritual structure improved and their powers or artifacts enhanced by your tampering. More importantly, somehow you’ve used it to create a truly impressive form of immortality even by the standards of this world-one that almost approaches a True Magic. Even at Touko’s precocious age, she has made puppets so realistic that even if her body was burnt to ash and her soul destroyed, the puppet’s similarity to her would be so exact reality itself would retroactively register it as the true “her” and consider the previous Touko to have been the fake. As if her craft created a sort of quantum superposition for her existence. Last but not least, these skills of yours are potentially transferable to other supernatural powers, letting you develop other forms of simulacrum-based immortality-some of which may even be transferable to others. How do they work for means other than puppeteering? Isn’t the joy of discovery half the fun?"

All magecraft is a complex system trying to tap into that transcendental truth from many removes.

True Magic is a single concept that has carved a path directly to that truth. The actualisation of events impossible to reproduce in a certain era by humans or the planet itself, even given an infinite amount of time and resources, and a Mystery surpassing that of any modern mage. Feats such as time travel, resurrection and gathering enough energy to blast a hole straight through the planet may be difficult to accomplish with it for a human being-but NOT notionally impossible; even if True Magic cannot perform one of those feats at face value it can often use “loopholes” in reality such as by going back in time to rescue someone before they died rather than directly resurrecting their corpse. And somehow, you have become the inheritor of one such True Magic. More information about True Magic can be found in the notes

For 600 CP you have as much proficiency in it as Aoko Aozaki in this tale. That of a complete novice, one that has just attained it from either the original magician or a truly bizarre happenstance even by this world’s standards.

1080,,600,Colorful ,Library of Ruina,Modus,"Every city has its symbols, from the Stars reflected in the murky gutter sky, to the vibrant Colors that dance within it. Both inspire awe and envy in equal measure, as thousands dream of ascending to being a Star of the City or a Color Fixer, but know now that your dreams may begin where the ambitions of so many end, as you yourself have become a Color. To be a Color Fixer is to be truly free of the Associations and Offices binding most Fixers, for you have been recognized as having or granted skill and cunning in murder beyond compare. A true exemplar amongst the Color Fixers managed to kill Five Index Proxies and Three Messengers on her lonesome even before she came into possession of her signature weapon. And even a newly-crowned color was able to rip through a collection of Offices, Syndicates and even a chunk of one of the Fingers - such is their skill. But most of all each Color Fixer - you included - has a unique trait that grants them edge in combat. Whether it be something like the Blue Reverberation’s superhuman timing in blocking bullets and amplifying his carnage, the Purple Tear’s hyper-adaptive fighting style that rapidly grows in power or the Vermilion Cross’ extraordinary strength and ability to go into unstoppable rampages. Whatever you choose, many doors are open to you now. In other jumps the title of Color follows you with all the benefits it grants, namely that societal or organizational restrictions are much looser when it comes to you, and those of roughly lower strength are easily intimidated unless armed with numbers and plans to bridge the gap.

Boosted: EGO is a truly marvellous power, able to elevate most people to the level of some of the Wings’ more renowned enforcers, and nearly qualifying one for a color just by holding it. But as a Fixer, wearing only a single face, and wielding only a single power gets you targeted, your enemies analyizing your flaws, and eventually ending with you face down in an alley, your own weapons sticking out of your back. In an effort to counter this, you’ve internalized the principles of adaptability key to being a Fixer on a far more essential level than any other. Where other EGO users have a single form to their EGO, you can through meditation create a new definition to your existence, forming a new EGO with entirely separate abilities and appearance from your current one. This can’t make it take forms you don’t have the perks for, but it may be freely redefined within those limitations. Your battle armor and searing flames with the ability to nullify the strength of your foes swapped out for one that feeds on a far more cold rage, freezing and paralyzing your enemies as it strips away their capability for coherent thought, the mirror of your EGO reflecting your intentions in a different light. Once you’ve defined such a new EGO, swapping between it and your others is easy.

Though, perhaps, less so for you, someone who seems to have similar properties to its mysterious voice. You seem to have a real knack for pushing people to their limits. While this is still based on the information you have on them, when it comes to causing horrific degrees of mental stress, you’re great at pushing them until one of two things happen: They snap under your arguments, becoming monstrous Distortions, beings rooted in their own desires, which have boiled over to consume them body and soul. These twisted humans have powers and forms wrapped around their wishes. Or, they control their emotions and desires, reifying them into E.G.O equipment, powerful weapons formed of the same wishes, but focused. This may be slightly less deadly or versatile on average, but the control and, well, sanity more than make up for it. In future jumps, you’ll continue to be able to awaken others to their Inner Light, and moreover awaken similar abilities based on extremes of stress.

Boosted: You’ve somehow touched upon the light, sublimating into it  without losing your physical form, your EGO allowing you to maintain a body. The point is, your power reaches out to others with similar abilities, whispering in their ears in times of vulnerability, pushing them towards fulfilling your goals. While this is most prominently displayed with the Light and other systems involving connections to something more, it still works with anything as simple as ki, mana, or other energies, and scales in potency the more power you have stored. Beyond the whispers, this also serves to nudge uses of it in your favour ever so slightly, though once more, if you can amass a great enough power, perhaps you could make it nigh impossible to raise similar workings against you.

1082,,600,Life for Strength,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"Your experience has taught you the absolute limitations of your abilities, but more importantly: how to break them. By burning your own life force, you can remove those limits, temporarily pushing yourself several times more powerful than your body and talent would allow. Afterward, you will be physically drained, possibly worse, depending on how much further you have pushed yourself."
1083,,600,Geomantic Evolution,Final Fantasy IV,Modus,"The very existence of crystalline structure seems to call to you, and instinctively, you know that power lies within these creations. Whether they are naturally made, or machined, you can feel and use this power. With a small collection of randomly assorted crystals, you can create an array that will amplify your magic or psychic energies, allowing you to draw more power than you would otherwise. The more power each individual crystal has in your array, the greater the effects you can produce with them. With enough energy from them, such as eight crystals formed of magic itself, you could accelerate the very evolution of an entire planet, including its inhabitants. This will happen over time, perhaps generations, but with sufficiently powerful magical foci, this can happen far quicker.

You may use this to evolve your own abilities further, but you will find that the further along your evolution as a Jumper, the less effect this will have upon you.

To utilize the array’s full power, the recipient(s) must be within its perimeter. While it can still be used from a distance, for each average increment of diameter you are from its perimeter, its power will decrease by half. As such, larger arrays can transmit their power across distances far more easily. (Ex. With a four-kilometer array, if you are eight kilometers away from its edge, you will only receive 1⁄4 (1⁄2 * 1⁄2) of its normal energy)"

Not only that but without the necessary talent you might not even be able to reproduce the spells even with perfect calculations. This takes care of all those pesky things. You’re a living legend in what magic refers to, not only your spells need way less magic or equations than would normally need, but also, they hit with every inch of power that the originals would have if not even more with personal tweaks, not only that, but you’re naturally attuned to magic and thus can analyze, break down, learn and reproduce any magic system you encounter in record time. Thus, reproducing the abilities of other beings into magic that anyone can use, without a loss in power or increase in complexity and with time push them further than even natural users."
1085,,600,Irregulars Rebellion,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"That Issei guy could have a lot of less than common traits in battle, but one that would definitely stand out would be his ability to power up solely based on his obsession with women’s breasts. Something that went way beyond a passing fascination and instead became a fixation that powered and guided his growth. You as well, have something that’s similar at the core of it, not the breast fetish (probably) but the ability to bypass hard limitations and cut corners that were considered essential just by concentrating on something you feel strongly about. The same way Issei was able to converge his magic into being able to destroy the clothes of women (bypassing any armor and defenses) or talk directly to women’s breasts (don’t ask, please) which are very impressive once you take out the perverted angle, you can do similar feats as long as you have something you love or hate enough. A strength born from your very own heart, ...or fetishes."
1086,,600,Darkness Under The Sun,HighSchool DxD,Modus,"Slow and steady wins the race, you know that all too well. In fact, you might not have the explosive growth, or extra fast learning period of someone younger, but what you do have is a lack of limitations. Whilst many will find themselves in front of wall after wall showing their inherent limits, you just keep going on as always, gradually building up more and more power without any setbacks. Growing beyond what was thought possible, you have surpassed the natural limits and became able to keep doing so forevermore, not only power, but skills, techniques, magic, and whichever other abilities you happen to pick up. Only time can tell how strong you will become."

Among the few capable of such a feat, lies your name. Just like how Draig and Albion went from fire and poison to piercing, reflection, boost, and divide. The powers you develop will depend on both your fighting style and the experience you accumulate during time; the only secure thing is that they will have the potential to be as overwhelming as the powers of the Heavenly Dragons and that there won’t be an upper limit as to how many you can develop in your life."

1092,,600,It’s A Ritual In The End,Fate/Apocrypha,Modus,"The Greater Grail. A wish-granting device some might claim as omnipotent. A truly absurd vortex of energy attached to a powerful artifact able to summon Heroic Spirits into class vessels to perform a grand ritual, and capable of transforming the souls of Servants into such a humongous amount of energy that it could drill a path to the Root, or perhaps even activate the Third True Magic and materialize the souls of all humans on the Planet. It truly sounds like an unassailable divine object, doesn’t it? And yet it is not. It was the culmination of three powerful Magi families, the result of thousands of years of experimentation and refinement, and even the assistance of a user of True Magic. But, in the end, it was crafted by human hands. It is not perfect and immutable. With the right knowledge, and the right abilities, and the right tools, it can be modified. And you’ve learnt how. You have the right knowhow to modify the Greater Grail.

Things like tampering with the summonings to allow for non-Hassan Assassins, and Servants who may not be righteous heroes, or perhaps even change the connections between Master and Servant to allow you to set up dozens of specially crafted Homunculi to feed prana to your Servant instead of yourself, are things you know how to do. With sufficient power and will, you may even force the Greater Grail to grant you your wish early, even if not all the Servants are dead, like how Amakusa caused the Greater Grail to begin activating the True Magic despite the war not being over yet. Lastly, of course, is a decent level of talent at tampering with grand rituals in general. It might take some experimentation before you truly get the hang of it, but even world-spanning rituals would not be beyond your tampering if you possess enough resources."

But those laws, those long-standing traditions are not yours to obey. If you are the one to personally oust a leader from his position, then you may succeed that leader without any interference from any of his allies, even if a successor is named. Clearly, Satan wasn’t evil enough for Hell and the Emperor showed him who the true evil was, and you’ll do the same to whoever you dethrone. Booting out a Deity will allow you to also take over their domain, as you now rule what they previously had ruled."
1095,,600,Admiration of the Elders,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"During the election of the last Old Man of the Mountain, two candidates contested for the privilege of bearing the name of Hassan-i-Sabbah. One, the chosen leader, was one that developed a technique that allowed them to disguise themselves as dozens of persons, earning the title of ‘Hundred Faces’. The loser? A nameless fanatic with overflowing talent, who managed to study and copy the majority of the techniques of previous leaders in just a few years, but failed to make one of her own.

Said ‘zealot’ was mocked and ridiculed by her fellow assassins, who saw such a talent more of an insult to their elders than a blessing. Perhaps others will see things differently with you? For it seems that you also share her monstrous talent for copying the techniques of others, even those supernatural in nature. It is not even needed that you are taught or even witness them directly, just that you get a hand on a proper record, and that such a technique existed in the first place. Obviously, this will be a slow process, but even the techniques of most of the Hashshashin were able to be copied in just a few years."
1096,,600,Jumper Of Humanity         ,Fate/Strange Fake,Modus,"Heroic Spirits are naturally tied to humanity. They are the greatest of humanity, for better or for worse. Yet, some Heroic Spirits are more tied to humanity than others. Living calamities and heroes that have left a mark in the world so deep, that they become completely entangled with the progress of human civilization as a whole.

It seems that yours is one such case. Your Noble Phantasm, or should you lack one, your general powers, have become inexplicably linked with the current state of the human civilization, allowing you to draw from that progress to reshape and empower them.

For those more aligned with humanity, you could link your abilities with the creations of humanity. A Servant capable of creating weapons would be able to draw forth all the inventions that humanity has created until that era, paying the appropriate cost, and empower all of them with their own level of Mystery. Perhaps a martial artist would refine an unique style that draws upon all techniques developed by humanity, to a point that it is impossible to fight them with human techniques.

For those with more monstrous inclinations, instead human progress allows you to bring back more harm upon humanity. For example, your powers could be empowered by the concept of Calamity, allowing you to draw forth whatever humans deem as calamities. In ancient times, a calamity might be related to natural disasters, such as floods, plagues and earthquakes. But in more modern times, humanity has become a calamity unto itself, so the power of the harmful products of humanity such as pollution, mass industrialization or even the nuclear fires may be called upon.

Whatever it is, the more advanced the era of humanity you are, the more power you will be able to draw from this."

Items of power? Loads of money? A collector’s edition copy of Final Fantasy? If it’s what you’re looking for, you’ll sense it.

But your real power is in the ability to Steal items. You’re a skilled enough Thief you can steal from someone just by brushing against them for a brief second, taking an item from them regardless of how well-embedded it is on their person. Heavy suit of armor? Yoink! Magical weapon of legend? Yoink! A pocket universe?...erm, have fun carrying that if it unfolds in your hand. But you can take anything from someone’s person with a well-timed swipe, so long as you can survive close contact. Even better, those with weaker wills than you won’t even notice the item in question had been stolen until they attempt to use it themselves...and they’ll have to explain why they attended an important meeting without pants.

If you have not taken the Perk Core Class you may only take the generic NPC Class options from a list of those that you are compatible with.

1101,,600,Fairy Magic ,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Modus,"Fairy Magic is a type of nature magic rather than arcane magic and can be used for a wide variety of capabilities including creating things out of nothing, transforming things into new forms and altering an object's purpose. Though this magic is safe when used to aid or benefit others when this magic is used selfishly it can come with a terrible cost.

Boosted: Genie Magic 

You now have access to Genie Magic, one of the most powerful forms of magic that possesses ""phenomenal, cosmic power"", however this power comes with a price, you can only use Genie Magic to grant the wishes of others. To activate Genie Magic you must offer others a wish and state the rules of the wish such as no wishing for more wishes. You must then grant that wish regardless of how you feel about it but how you grant that wish is within your control. From this you can choose if the wish is granted in the spirit or the letter of the wish allowing you loopholes and twists within granting the wish as well as if the wish comes with a price thereby making it easier to grant.

This realization gave you the ability to create unbreakable contracts, nothing short of you or your death can release any fool willing to sign your contract. Over time you learned how to add things other than merely material wealth as the cost, things like magic, but the thing about magic is that one body can only generate so much before it gets bloated and slow, so you learned to turn others into your tiny power generators, they become little more than plants with sapience, writhing in agony whenever you draw upon the power you need.

Their new form depends on you, if you think a worm is the most pathetic thing possible then that will be what they resemble more, if you think a bug is even worse then they will resemble that more but they will still be immobile and incapable of speech.

As is obvious power gained from this is aligned with darkness and negativity, so anything fueled with this will have that, if you use it to give strength to someone then that person will be more prone to causing mayhem and destruction than saving the day and being the hero, if you use it to harm though? That will come Very easily, while doing the opposite will be very hard, since, you know, it is still your power, just tinged with the suffering of who knows how many people(whose negativity, such as desperation and depression at their new form or natural inclination to be evil, also adds to the darkness), yet it is still your power to do as you please."
1103,,600,Child of King Triton,The Little Mermaid,Modus,"You’re either one of Triton’s many daughters or perhaps his only son, but either way you have a special bloodline. First, you’re a royal of Atlantica with all the privileges that implies. Beauty, wealth, and a city of subjects to rule over. Second, this grants you some of Triton’s power; controlling the weather and the water, as well as being able to command sea creatures. You can summon storms that sink ships, turn calm waters into massive tidal waves, and rouse an army of sharks. With time and training you could command the entire ocean and control the weather of the entire planet, much like King Triton does - without the Trident. You are also - now and in future jumps - aligned with water magic/abilities automatically, and cannot be harmed by them."
1104,,600,The Warriors Within ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Modus,"All living jars stuff the flesh of the dead within themselves, hoping to draw upon their strength to supplement their own. The debate on whether or not it is true is irrelevant, for you are living proof that such a thing is possible. When you consume or stuff the flesh of others into yourself, you can temporarily draw upon their skills and experience. Though you may not be their physical equal, in time you would be a mighty warrior that none would dare look down upon.

Boosted: You have gone beyond internalizing the power of flesh, and find yourself capable of drawing out the strength of other mediums. By placing a fiery mixture within yourself, you could coat your body in flames harmful only to your enemies, or by consuming a healing tonic would see you healing the wounds of others with a simple touch. The possibilities are as endless as the Erdtree itself, though their effects are not as long lived.

1105,,600,“And so dawns the Age of the Jaguar” ,The Road to El Dorado,Modus,"Despite the conquistador’s talk of the locals being heathens, the Gods of this land are all too real Jumper... and they’ve bestowed a gift unto you. Being attuned to the Gods quite vividly, the only one who can match you in mysticism is the notorious Tzekel-Kan. By a wave of your hand and some words realistic illusions can sprout from the walls and the surroundings, tricking the eyes and minds of onlookers. With vast knowledge you are able to brew powerful elixirs that could allow you to bring giant statues to life, or let you peer into prophecies, and poison others. Such perception of the mystic arts lets you discern the potency and effects of spells and potions by scent alone."
1106,,600,Mahatma,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Modus,"On your journeys and with your studies you have achieved a level of arcane wisdom few ever dare to think possible. The like of knowledge that would terrify even other mages who may see you as heretical and want to silence you. But you heard the voices didn’t you? Perhaps you reached a higher being or your magical circuits simply are beyond those of all others. The how of your magical powers is a mystery but what is clear as day is the extent of your might. Powerful magecraft is yours to command, including the arts of summoning, runes, alchemy, formalcraft and black magics, covering many divergences. Your familiarity and affinity for ANY kind of magic is incredible, extending to worlds even beyond this one. As long as it falls under the umbrella of magic, it is something you can use and eventually, if you commit yourself to it, master. Even Baptism Rites or Magic exclusive to certain groups or beliefs are applicable. After all the way you see the world it all ties back to Mahatma. More ancient spells like those of old Egypt might be harder to use but that should not be a problem for a committed Occultist like yourself or is it?"
1107,,600,Bogatyr of the Fair Sun,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Modus,"The Sovereign of the Sun, Dobrynya Nikitich, was said to be a mighty young warrior, serving the Grand Prince of Kiev. His deeds are still spoken of in Bylina, where historical fact and fantasy ever so often meet. But now he may have an equal as your more than a match for even the mightiest Bogatyr. Your strength and speed is enough to go into battle against Dragons, though it is not a fight you would be guaranteed to win. Still the punishment of such a Beast you could endure, even hails of Bullets from Beasts designed to kill.

But of course what is a Hero without the skill to use their strength? Saving princesses and slaying Monsters just comes naturally to you. Some may think your claim of being able to do ‘Just About Anything’ isn’t entirely farfetched, as you are simply competent in whatever is needed, like say cheering up an ally, getting food, raising a spirit or even just fighting someone way out of your league. Now you can't DO anything, only do lots of things. You wouldn’t be able to destroy trees that simulate entire Worlds for example but you may just be able to put up a great fight against a single great Tyrant. Though at least you know what is truly impossible to you, just so you can bother trying for what you could somehow pull off.

But where you truly shine is on top of a mount. Your skill at Riding is legendary, far beyond what any human should be capable of. What it is you ride, be it a monster or a vehicle, ill maters. As long as you can count it as a form of transportation you can do just that with the kind of skill only a Hero of an Epic could replicate. Of course combat on top of your steed is also all but instinctual, perhaps even greater than it would be on foot. Lastly, thanks to your newfound connection to the Sun, entities or deities aligned with it are a little bit more fond of you and may even ask for your help on occasion."
1108,,600,Joke Character,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Modus,"Around you, power levels matter much less than they used to. You are able to compete with those who should be much stronger and faster than you are, and in many cases, pull off the upset win.

The effects of this perk are far from absolute. Firstly, a point comes where the gulf in power
between you and your foe is so great that this fails to work. Some things are too nonsensical to work even as a joke. Secondly, although power levels mean less to you, narrative importance suddenly means a lot more. The more ‘important’ a character is to the setting they belong to, the less of an effect this perk has. Jokes like these are more likely to anger the fans. Finally, the more often you rely on this perk, the more likely it is to fail. Repeating the same joke over and over is an easy way to kill it, after all.

You may toggle the effects on and off at will, in case you were in the mood for something more serious."
1109,,600,Dark Lord,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Modus,"​There is no such thing as Good or Evil, only Power and those too weak to
seek it. You know the truth of this, and you. are. not. weak! Magic is a great and wonderful thing,
and among its greatest uses is its breathtaking capacity for harm.
You know this, which is why you’re so good at this. You are one of the best at fighting with magic
in the world, period. Formal dueling, casual combat or just a magical brawl, you’re very, very
good at all three. More than just good, you’re utterly brilliant. Your reflexes, your breadth of
knowledge and just your sheer skill leaves the likes of Voldemort and Dumbledore gaping.
But more than conventionally used battle-magic, you have the gift of being able to turn any spell
into a combat spell. It might require creative application, or it may require some editing of the
spell’s wand movements or incantations or whatever, but you have an instinctive grasp for the
potential in combat of any spell, and know just how to bring it out to maximum effect.
In future world, this extends to all similar mystic or esoteric forces."
1110,,600,Merlin Returned,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Modus,"​There were ancient tales of your coming,
Jumper. Actually, wait, no. There weren’t. But there should have been. You were born to
greatness, and this reflects in everything you do. Magic is second nature to you.
While you don’t get any skill or knowledge innate with this perk, nor any gifts or talents that pass
down bloodlines or through rituals, you now have limitless talent in every single branch of magic
apart from these limitations.
Besides that, you are a genius at learning magic too, mastering years’ worth of material in days
and weeks without even stressing yourself. This growth continues indefinitely, never slowing no
matter what.
Your grasp of magic and its theoretical framework is such that you can manipulate the very
nature of it, and do so with an almost contemptuous ease. You can take apart spells, rituals or
even entire magic systems, and put them back together in whatever different arrangement you
like, even in entirely new magic systems of your own. Even altering spells in real time is second
nature to you, changing their effects, size, scope, everything. As is coming up with entirely new
pieces of magic, with due research and innovation.
Finally, to fuel all this, your ‘Magical Core’, per se, is proportionately vast. You have a humongous
amount of magic at your fingertips, stretching far and beyond any known metrics well into the
realm of legends like Merlin and the Founders.
This perk follows you in the future too, providing you all of these effects in any and all magic you
become able to do. This perk is a capstone booster, meaning that it serves to enhance each of the
origin capstones in their own ways. The interactions are mentioned alongside the respective
perks."
1111,,600,Magical Maestro,Wizarding World,Modus,"Live in this world for a hundred years and you will find no more than a handful of witches and wizards as gifted and brilliant as the great Albus Dumbledore. Such was his prowess in the art of magic that even before he graduated Hogwarts, he was performing feats of magic that even his professors had never seen before. And in recent history, there have only been two others who came to match his skill and mastery of magic.

With this, perhaps you can be the third.

Like Dumbledore, magic comes naturally to you, something you have taken great advantage of. Even as a child, you had already developed some manner of conscious control over your accidental magic, a noteworthy feat indeed. But that is only the first step for a burgeoning maestro such as yourself. Once a wand finds itself in your hands, your control shall only be bolstered, ensuring that any spell you cast is without fail.

Of course, simply casting spells properly is merely the mark of a skilled wizard or witch. We both know that you are leaps and bounds beyond such folks. The spells you cast are in a league of their own, bearing quite a bit more power than those of others, over thrice as much really. And as you grow and learn, your magic shall grow with you, becoming even more powerful the more you come to understand magic, yours and others.

And you soak magic up as if you were a sponge. So long as it is even tangentially related magic, you are a veritable prodigy in the art. Whether it be Transfiguration, Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, or even Alchemy, you will quickly learn it in a pace that will allow you to match and surpass all but the truest masters of their craft within only a decade’s time.

In time, your name shall be spoken in the same league as Grindelwald, Dumbledore, and Lord Voldemort. A legendary sorcerer whose name and deeds shall forever be immortalized in history."
1112,,600,Bippity Boppity Boo,Disney’s Cinderella,Modus,"You have the magical abilities of a Fairy Godparent. This includes such feats as transfiguration, compulsion/mind control, and time travel. It’s quite a bargain! For short, simple effects all you need to do is say a three word phrase. For larger spells and enchantments (or interconnected effects) there needs to be a little song and dance, but it doesn’t have to be too grand or well thought out. You can also choose certain conditions for the spell, such as a time limit or area of effect, as you cast it."
1113,,600,Just The Slippers Remained,Disney’s Cinderella,Modus,"When the clock struck twelve, just as the Fairy Godmother warned, the dress, carriage, and horses disappeared. And yet the slippers did not. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to ensure that Cinderella got her happy ending. Perhaps this was the Godmother’s true blessing. And like Cinderella, you find yourself blessed as well. There are many things out there in the world that can bless you, but they are short-lived. With this perk, you may choose to extend the effect of a spell/enchantment/blessing/power/item/etc by up to one week. There will be no consequences to extending the gift. However, if you instead choose to only keep a piece of the original effect, you can retain it indefinitely. For example, most forms of immortality offer protection from disease, poison, and aging. If you chose to give up everything but the disease immunity, you could keep it as long as you wished. You can hold five of these effects at a time, and can discard or replace them at will, though once gone you can’t just reactivate them without experiencing the original effect egain."
1114,,600,Roar of the Elders,The Lion King,Modus,"You possess an ancient mystical ability normally bestowed upon the leader of the Lion’s Guard, and usually reserved for the second-born of the current monarch. Oddly enough, you seem to possess the ability despite not matching either of those criteria. By letting out some form of roar, you can cause various effects to happen, ranging from atmokinesis, electrokinesis, spirit summoning, geokinesis, rain summoning and unleashing pure concussive force. During your stay, the Great Kings will be able to veto your use of the Roar, but in later Jumps you’ll be able to use this power however you see fit. Try not to piss off the Great Kings of the past while you’re here."
1115,,600,Shamanism!,The Lion King,Modus,"With skills like these, some would think you trained under the tutelage of the great Rafiki, royal Mjuzi of the Pride Lands. You are trained in Swahili Shamanism, allowing you to commune with spirits, peer through the mists of time and perform elemental feats by communing with the spirits of Air, Water, Earth and Fire."
1116,,600,​​Magic Reality Warper        ,Gummi Bears,Modus,"You're a top-tier magic slinger, you don’t have to use any crutches like rituals or any of that nonsense. Instead you can just cast spells using your willpower itself, skipping all of that mumbo jumbo hand waving and spell-speaking nonsense. Ingredients for rituals or spells are just crutches for the weak that you don’t need, you can just throw more magic into it and skip the ingredients."
1117,,600,Favor of the Storm Tritons,Wizard 101,Modus,"The Tritons are brilliant entities of boundless creativity and thunderous power, unlike the smug Dragons and stagnant Giants. By their grace are you afforded a measure of that power. You are a master of Divination, a peer to Ambrose himself in this branch of magic.Power enough to crack the skies and shatter the land, should you wish it. If you so choose, a measure of Triton heritage will grace your mortal form, in the shape of gills, bioluminescence, and an aura of static electricity. In addition, you may channel the wild and frenzied power of the Storm into any magic you do, enhancing its power tenfold in exchange for making it five times harder to control. May Thunderbolts ever mold your path."
1118,,600,Favor of the Ice Giants,Wizard 101,Modus,"The Giants are eternal bastions of wisdom and strength, unlike the vain Dragons and mad Tritons. By their grace you are afforded a measure of that power. You are a master of Thaumaturgy, a peer to Ambrose himself in this branch of magic. Power enough to sunder the land and waste the seas, should you wish it. If you so choose, a measure of Giant heritage will grace your mortal form in the shape of doubling your height, bestowing mighty facial hair upon you, and dramatically lowering your bodily temperature. In addition, the cloak of winter’s chill that falls around you has improved your Tower Shield to block half of all incoming magic damage, and one fifth of all physical harm. May Hoarfrost ever guide your path."
1119,,600,Favor of the Fire Dragons,Wizard 101,Modus,"Dragons are ineffable beings of peerless strength and unquestionable insight, unlike the cowardly Frost Giants and conniving Sea Tritons. By their grace are you now afforded a measure of that power. You are a master of Pyromancy, a peer of Ambrose himself in this branch of magic. Power enough to rend the skies and boil the seas, should you wish it. If you so choose, a measure of Draconic heritage will grace your mortal form in the shape of wings, scales and a dramatically increased body temperature. In addition, the recovery time for Burning Heart is reduced by half, even when bolstered by Ever-Growing Flame. May Dragonfire ever light your path."

Now you know all the tricks. In a wizard battle, you may forcibly change the turn order to sneak off an extra spell every few turns, you may set up contingency spells that trigger whenever an opponent casts some class of spell, (ie. getting off a heal every time the enemy heals, or lays a trap, or just casts a Fire spell). Basically, you can pull off any cheat the game’s enemies could pull off. But before you get too big for your britches, you may only have three such Cheats active at a time, and you can’t alter the turn order at all if you have every slot filled. Outside of Wizard Duels, Cheats work fairly similarly, every few spells you find you have the time to get another off, you can set up spells to be cast automatically on an enemy performing a certain action, etc. Just don’t expect to win many friends, Jumper. No one likes a cheater."
1121,,600,Multidisciplinary,The Owl House,Modus,"Why specialize when you can diversify? You are an expert in multiple schools of magic, like Eda or one of the Emperor’s chosen. You fly in the face of the Coven system, which will carry its own problems, but magical versatility is a powerful weapon indeed! In future jumps, you will find it easy to use multiple varieties of magic. Even if those schools of magic are exclusive or contradictory, you can wield them all. So long as you can learn it, you can use it.

In this jump, you have at least an Apprentice level of training in all 9 covens, and have an Expert level in one coven of your choice. You may still upgrade your standing with other covens by paying with points. Be aware that the Emperor does not forgive witches who break the Coven System and use multiple schools, so be prepared to either join his ranks in the Emperor’s Coven or be discreet with your abilities. See the Notes section for additional details."
1122,,600,Jumper Of All Evil,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Modus,"This is...this is terrible! This land suffered enough with Maleficent, but now you have appeared, a claimant to the title of Master of All Evil, or perhaps a claimant to Maleficent’s title instead? Either way, you possess terrible dark magic, on par with the wicked witch’s own. Like her, you can call down bolts of lightning capable of shattering stone, or creating a forest of thorny vines to entangle a great castle that a noble knight with a holy sword would have difficulty breaking through alone, perhaps ending up as his tomb. Calling down a frost to kill the flowers of one of those pesky good fairies would be child’s play, and the power to call forth green flames to defend yourself from your enemies or teleport with is within your grasp. The curses you call forth could match any Maleficent wields!

That is to say nothing of your most terrible power: like Maleficent, you too may take on the form of a dragon, great and terrible and capable of spewing flames capable of vaporizing stone, erupting with such force as to send a knight flying off his steed even if he should block your attack, and to send that same shield flying if he is not careful. A bite from you is deadly, and you are durable enough that even an enchanted sword striking your hide would only cause you minor pain. Beware, however, that like Maleficent you are not invulnerable. Should that same sword strike true into your more vulnerable underside, well...do remember how the story of Sleeping Beauty ends. Nonetheless, you are a force to be reckoned with. For now they face you, oh Jumper, and all the powers of HELL!"
1123,,600,Sea Witch,Disney’s The Little Mermaid,Modus,"Fortunately, you know a little magic. It’s a talent you’ve possessed since buying this perk. Your magical prowess is equivalent to that of Ursula the Sea Witch. This allows you to cast the same spells as well as brew the same potions – provided you have access to the same resources and ingredients. See the Notes section for more information.

On screen, Ursula has demonstrated the following spells:
• Scrying: Ursula has set up a magical connection with Flotsam and Jetsam, her eels. When they are next to each other, Ursula can peer through their eyes. In the original film, she requires her cauldron as a medium for this scrying. In the television series, she sometimes uses bubbles to scry through instead.
• Magical Contracts: Ursula can summon a magical contract, complete with fishbone quill, as desired. These contracts can give Ursula magical ownership of a person who signs them – it seems that the other party must be fully aware of what they are signing and agree to the terms. The ownership can be immediate or conditional: Ariel had three days to kiss the Prince otherwise she would belong to Ursula, whereas Trion traded himself for Ariel. It is very likely Ursula must hold up her end of the bargain for the contract to work. Once Ursula owns someone, she is able to easily transform them into a polyp. On her death, all polyps reverted back to normal.
• Voice Taking: Ursula is able to steal the “voice” of a person, and store it in an appropriate vessel (she kept Ariel’s voice in a necklace). This seems to require the other person willingly giving their voice up.
• Mind Control: When she had access to an exceptional voice, Ursula was able to control Eric. This effect was limited to him, so either only one person could be controlled at a time, or Eric’s existing attachment to Ariel’s voice was a necessary component.
• Magic Channelling: Ursula is able to take advantage of other magical sources to enhance her power. In the original film, she is able to become gigantic when wielding the trident. In the television series, she is able to redirect a stray shot from the trident to briefly enhance her natural poison ink.
• Small Magic Blasts: In the television series, Ursula is capable of firing off weak magic attacks unassisted.
• Enchantment: In the television series, Ursula enchants several tridents so they could fire energy bolts. These were nothing close to the level of Triton’s trident, and possessed no other effects.

On screen, Ursula has created the following potions:
• Transformation: Most notably, Ursula was able to uses her potions to turn both Ariel and herself into humans. Ariel’s transformation had a fixed time limit of three days, whereas she was able to cancel the effect on herself at her discretion. Ursula’s true appearance was still visible in her reflection. Her cauldron indicates she is able to make merfolk more attractive, but the details of this aren’t specified. In the television series, she was able to briefly increase the size of her eels, but taking damage disrupted the spell. She also turned herself into a crab to fool Sebastian; this too lasted for as long as she desired.
• Animate Objects: In the television series, Ursula used a potion to animate mundane human objects and have them attack those nearby. She was able to use this potion while scrying without being near the objects. Damaging the objects ends the"

You’ve gained skills with it equal to Queen Eclipsa or Star Butterfly, which propagate into other magic training you’ve gained over the Jumps. You can now cast The Spell with No Name and stop time with your powers. (Just remember to keep it under control and restart the wheel of progress after, respectively.)"
1125,,600,Beyond The Code,WRECK-IT RALPH,Modus,"Your code may say that you can only act in certain ways and that you have certain limitations. But your will and desire to do good is so strong, that you can push past these limitations. You can break through, actually giving 110% or more, whether from your fists, weapons, or in other ways. If you had a hammer that could only fix things, you may even manage to find a way to reverse its effect and break things instead. Any limitations on you can be overcome, with sufficient determination and willpower."
1126,,600,Magic School Graduate,Darkwing Duck,Modus,You start with all the same powers as shown to be used by “Morgana Macawber” as a recent graduate of school. Anything from summoning and altering the weather to growing massive and raining down energy bolts upon your enemies.
1127,,600,Fairytale Magic,Shrek,Modus,"What did you loot the Fairy Godmothers Grimoire right off her cold dead body. However you manage it you have learned the basics of fairytale magic. From animating the inanimate, changing the forms of beings, to conjuring time limited products. While you can only do small tricks for a short duration, with practice you can improve."
1128,,600,It’s Just Right,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Modus,"The overarching theme of the Goldilocks story was about maintaining balance. You need to avoid going too far in a particular direction and to control yourself. You have harnessed the essence of the story and learned true balance within yourself. This has allowed you to resolve any conflicting powers you possess and to remain unaffected by other influences. Two examples of how this would work are learning opposing powers and corruptive influences. For opposing powers you will be able to calm this allowing you to use them without issue. For example, you could use dark and light based magics without issue. The corruptive aspect would ensure that you would be unaffected by any foreign influences. You will always remain balanced as these effects slide off of you without causing you harm."
1129,,600,Great Spirit,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Modus,"Even compared to the other options in this section, this is out there-taking this perk will cause you to become a spiritual being, similar to the spirit known as Chakasi who watches over the secret, abandoned city of the Nashoni tribe in Arizona. Like him, you will have the ability to become, manipulate, and transport yourself and others through sand, as well as summon a type of spirit creature such as coyotes made of sand- also having the ability to convert those who trespass on the land you are protecting into these creatures by engulfing them in a vortex of sand. These beings are weak individually, but you start with a great horde of them- working together they can easily make a car crash by slamming into it or do severe damage to a person. Your ability to transport yourself is nigh instantaneous and fast enough that you can keep pace with a car, and transporting others takes only a few moments more- this transportation can be done anywhere where there is sand within the desert (or beach, if you prefer). By turning into sand, you and your familiars can fly through the air at great speeds and slip into any crack large enough for a grain of sand."
1130,,600,Witch,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Modus,"Whether via some Faustian bargain, or some other means, you now have great magic at your
disposal.

Your new magical prowess is on par with the Evil Queen, allowing you to cast the same spells, brew the same potions, and create the same magical poison as her. Provided you have access to the same resources and ingredients, of course.

On screen, the Evil Queen demonstrated the following spells:
• Whilst making the Peddler’s disguise potion, the Queen was able to summon a strong blast of wind as part of the potion making.
• Whilst making the Peddler’s disguise potion, the Queen was able to call down lightning in order to mix the potion.

On screen, the Evil Queen created the following potions and poisons:
• Peddler’s Disguise Potion: The Queen uses this to transform herself into an old hag and change her voice.
• Sleeping Death: A poison that puts the victim into a deep, everlasting sleep that can only be undone by Love’s First Kiss. The Queen poisoned an apple with this, which also had the effect of making the apple appear more appetising.

Based on the Queen rifling through books to find potions that only took a couple of pages, it is more than likely that the Queen has access to a much broader range of spells and potions than were shown in the movie. You may fanwank the existence of magical abilities that are within the same range of power and are appropriate to a Disney fantasy setting.

It also seems likely that the Queen’s magic is preparation dependent, explaining why she chose to flee from the dwarfs and try to stop them by leveraging a boulder instead of using her magic to attack."
1131,,600,Witch,Brave,Modus,"That species choice you made here? That merely describes your physical form. In actuality, you are a witch, capable of various magic powers.

Your magical powers are on par with the witch responsible for Mor’du’s transformation – and Elinor’s, should those events come to pass. This means you will be able to replicate the same spells and potions, provided you have the same access to resources.


On screen, the witch demonstrated the following spells:
• Telekinesis: The witch is able to cause objects to move on their own. This includes making a broom sweep up, and levitating various weapons in the air. The objects seem to express a mind of their own; they switch between pointing at the witch and at Merida as the conversation moves back and forth.
• Magical Spaces: The witch enchanted her cottage so that it could switch between two overlapping spaces with a snap of her fingers. She is not shown to be able to trap others in these spaces.

On screen, the witch created the following potions:
• Bear Potion: This potion transforms the imbiber into a bear. In two days’ time, the effect becomes permanent, and the imbiber’s mind also becomes like that of a bear until they are killed and their spirit is separated from their body. Prior to this, the imbiber may occasionally slip into this mentality anyway for short bursts. The imbiber can be purged of the effect by mending a bond, which may or may not require also physically repairing a damaged object representing this bond. In the original film, this potion came in the form of a cake. In the Legend of Mor’du short, it was a more traditional drink.
• Message Potion: The witch was able to record herself talking and store it as a potion. When poured into a cauldron, the message would play. Using many different messages in a cauldron in a short span of time can create a bright flash.

Additionally, during the Legend of Mor’du short, the witch offers various abilities to Wee Dingwall including: being smarter, taller, faster, being able to breathe underwater, fly, or read minds. It is unclear exactly how these would be accomplished, and whether they would be tied to a physical transformation like the bear potion. You may fanwank these as desired as long as they remain within the general scope of the other abilities demonstrated by the witch."
1132,,600,Manipulating Magic,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Modus,"YOU have actual skill in magic, you can manipulate the elements to create events on the scale of kingdom threatening blizzards, create magic mirror diaries that will store and display memories in full color with audio, shapeshifting into other forms, and corrupting others to your will."
1133,,600,Ordinary Demi-Guy,Moana,Modus,"You have the strength of twenty grown men and the toughness to survive a thousand foot fall without damage. Non-lethal wounds heal within minutes and you have enough endurance to stay awake and active for weeks on end. You can survive indefinitely without food or water, and while you won‟t be happy, you won‟t be suffering or hampered by the lack. What‟s more, you can perform what otherwise would be impossible feats, such as dragging islands up from the bottom of the ocean, or lassoing the sun, or growing coconut trees by planting electric eels."
1134,,600,From The Heart,Disney Villains Victorious,Modus,"That’s where the music comes from, you know? While song plays a role in this world, it often doesn’t have much tangible benefit beyond being distracting or just nice to listen to. But where your words flow, so too does talent and luck. When you sing a song, you will find a sudden and downright legendary increase in skill related to the subject of your song. Singing a song of battle against a powerful villain will see you change from an amateur fighter to a master swordsman, a love song turns a wicked sorceress’ heart half-circle, and even an amazingly loud song about how you move with catlike tread would let you sneak past even the tightest security with nobody paying you any mind. That said, songs are meant to be short affairs, and so is this particular magic...your competence boost and contrivances that support your song will fade after a few minutes, becoming less effective the longer a song is. The length of a ‘scene’ or maybe two is when this is at its most effective, afterwards you’ll need a short break. Remember: timing is everything."
1135,,600,Sorcerer ,Aladdin,Modus,"You have the power and knowledge of real magic. No more parlour tricks for you. Know the incantations to summon monsters, magical lore and the casting of great power. You might not be the most powerful sorcerer in the world, but the magic of this world is varied and powerful. Mozenrath had the power to turn all citizens in his city into mindless zombies. Sadira was a sand witch with power over sand. She once even created a pocket dimension. The siren Saleen had the power to bewitch and turn Aladdin into a shark. Select a theme and gain an impressive alt-form for it. Similar to Jafar’s snake form."
1136,,600,Captain Britain ,Marvel Britain,Modus,"Channeling power from another dimension, you now have a level of power on par with Captain Britain himself. You are able to channel this mystical interdimensional energy to achieve a variety of superpowers, this energy will never run out and will remain accessible in future jumps and beyond. As you channel this energy it gives you immense physical attributes, flight, and a forcefield, however these powers are dependent on your level of confidence. At a normal level of confidence, you would be able to lift 90 tons, at peak you would be at 100 tons or more, you also have superhuman stamina, agility, reflexes, and senses. Your forcefield gives you superhuman durability and blocks attacks but is calibrated to let oxygen, and light to pass through, meaning that things like knockout gasses can affect you. The energy lets you fly at extreme speeds and fly through space, and as it is mystical in nature you can interact with magic itself. Allowing you to potentially rip apart a demon lord's mystical dimensions and resist magical spells from ancient spellcasters such as Lilith herself. However, if your confidence wavers you will immediately find that all of these abilities wane comparably."

This can show itself in a new spell or the upgrade in destruction and proficiency of a previously existing power. In the case of training, you find that every and all gain that you acquire as a result of your hard work is amplified by a factor of 10 the more rigorous the training the higher the amplified factor.

Boosted: Go Beyond Your Limits 
Your incident with the stones has empowered your very being where before your limits were broken only in the heat of battle or through incredibly rigorous battle now your limits are being constantly broken and reforged through continuous practise. Through training as you normally do, you find the limits of your spells, body and techniques increasing in size, potency and decreasing in cost but remember you actually have to train not sit around cloud watching like a certain lazy genius. If however, you are in battle or during incredibly rigorous training your limits are broken far greater than normal new spells show themselves far more common where ordinary knights would find their grimoires increasing in spells once every few years so long as you continue to participate in battles or missions that could potentially end you you will find new spells appearing at the end of each one maybe even more than one and in the latter case the results are amplified by 5x over.

In addition to starting off stronger than any average bender you’ll be able to quickly grasp new unconventional bending applications and you’ll also have an easier time unlocking new specializations such as metalbending, lightning, or bloodbending. Additionally you will now have immediate mastery over any other bending abilities you’ve purchased.

1139,,600,Sorcerer Semi-Supreme,Marvel Magic,Modus,"Not quite a Sorcerer Supreme – at least not of Earth, perhaps you are one of a smaller dimension. Or perhaps you were simply apprenticed to one such being. Regardless, you are a cut above most mages of your kind. Your aptitude for the mystic arts is far beyond most, allowing you to quickly advance in the use of magic in a fraction of the time it takes others. You learn spells and rituals in hours or days what would take others weeks or months to work out.

In addition, you will find that most magical beings and other mages instinctively pay you some amount of respect and understand the importance of your task as a defender of all reality. Your words carry a weight such that most mystically inclined beings will hear you out, at least heeding your warnings.
 
Finally, in future jumps you may declare one dimension to be Sorcerer Supreme of, in which you will find your magic to be twice again as powerful as it would otherwise be. Spells meant to defend against or banish otherworldly threats will be particularly bolstered in world."
1140,,600,Unleashed Chaos,Dial,Modus,"With this perk, you harness the immense power of Chaos Magic, granting you abilities on par with the Scarlet Witch at the height of her strength. The fabric of reality bends to your will as you become a master of manipulating and reshaping the very essence of existence. At the core of your newfound power is the ability to manipulate reality itself. You possess the awe-inspiring capability to alter the fabric of the universe, bending it to your desires. With a mere thought, you can reshape the environment, warping space and time to suit your needs. Nothing is beyond your reach as you tap into the boundless potential of Chaos Magic.

Flight becomes second nature to you, effortlessly defying gravity and soaring through the skies. You command devastating energy blasts, capable of obliterating obstacles and foes with a mere gesture. The true destructive potential of Chaos Magic is at your fingertips, enabling you to annihilate even the most formidable adversaries and shatter the mightiest of artifacts, including objects as powerful as the fabled Infinity Stones. Embracing Chaos Magic, you become an embodiment of raw and unpredictable power. With each manifestation of your abilities, chaos ensues, and the world trembles before your might. However, be cautious, for the unrestrained use of this power can have unintended consequences. It is up to you to wield your powers responsibly and temper the chaos with wisdom and restraint."
1141,,600,God of Darkness ,Dial,Modus,"With this power, you embody the essence of Chernobog, the Slavic god of Chaos, Night, and Darkness. Your connection to this primal force grants you unparalleled strength and the ability to absorb and manipulate various forms of energy. In addition, to this gain a number of other abilities. First, your physical strength surpasses the limits of mortal capabilities. Your physical power is on par with that of Thor, allowing you to engage in battles of epic proportions and topple mountains with a single strike. Your mere presence radiates an aura of raw strength, instilling fear and awe in all who witness your might. Second, perhaps your most formidable ability is the power to absorb and harness any type of energy. Whether it be gamma radiation, life energy, or the very essence of souls, you can draw upon these energies and utilize them to fuel your own power. This absorption grants you increased resilience, enhances your physical attributes, and allows you to unleash devastating energy-based attacks.

Third is an ability called Night&#39;s Embrace. By drawing upon your connection to Chernobog, you can shroud yourself in a nearly impenetrable cloak of darkness. This grants you enhanced stealth and the ability to move through the shadows undetected. Within the veil of night, your movements are swift and silent, allowing you to strike your enemies from the darkness with lethal precision. Fourth, you have been infused with boundless vitality and endurance. You possess incredible stamina, enabling you to fight relentlessly for extended periods without tiring. Your body regenerates rapidly, healing even the most severe wounds with remarkable speed. This resilience makes you virtually unstoppable in battle, as you can shrug off injuries that would cripple lesser beings.

Fifth, in moments of intense fury or dire need, you can tap into the true depths of your power, unleashing the unbridled chaos within. In this state, your strength and energy manipulation abilities reach their peak, allowing you to unleash cataclysmic blasts of energy, reshape reality itself, and bring forth devastating chaos that engulfs everything in its path. Harness the might of Chernobog, the god of Chaos, Night, and Darkness. With your primordial strength, energy absorption, chaotic manipulation, night’s embrace, eternal vigor, and the ability to unleash chaos itself, you become an unstoppable force, feared and revered by gods and mortals alike. Embrace the darkness, revel in chaos, and leave a trail of destruction in your wake as you bring forth the untamed power of Chernobog."
1142,,600,Blackhearted,Ghost Rider,Modus,"You are heads and shoulders above most demons, let alone mortals; in Hell, you may not be on the throne, but you’re certainly one of the higher (lower?) ups; certainly, you’re more than a fair fight for the Ghost Rider. Your demonic strength and durability is drastically increased, to the point where you’d be capable of throwing down with the Ghost Rider, and you’re now capable of moving at high speeds as well as great feats of agility. Your presence chills the air around you, and your Stygian touch is capable of sucking the life out of mortal beings, and the coldness that makes up your being is even capable of resisting or even suppressing hellfire. You are capable of summoning demons such as Abigor, Gressil, and Wallow to do your bidding, and may attempt to do the same thing with the demons of other worlds while you’re visiting them- though the results of this may be mixed. Finally, you’re immune to some of the holy things that might harm an ordinary demon, such as the crucifix or holy water, and can enter churches and other holy places easily. You can also smell fear.

Boosted: Child of the Devil- You’re not just one of the major players in Hell; you’re almost at the top, second only to Mephistopheles himself and perhaps Blackheart. By using a massive amount of power, you are capable of taking on a massive demonic form, capable of towering over large buildings. The appearance of this form is up to you; it could be something as simple as a larger version of how you normally appear, or something like a humanoid goat/dragon hybrid with a massive head of flaming hair. You could even take on a form similar to Blackheart’s, since you’re technically related, with hellish red eyes, black skin and quill like hair. Taking on this form strengthens all of your demonic powers considerably, and of course your demonic form has massively increased strength and durability to go with its large size. You can now summon some of the stronger demons from this world; towering figures twice as tall as a man and made of flesh and stone, demonic clowns and Deathwatch’s ninjas among them.

1143,,600,I Can Still See the Light,Ghost Rider,Modus,"Now, your faith is your sword, as well as your shield; you are capable of blessing and creating holy relics that are especially good at countering the forces of evil; weapons that are capable of striking intangible spirits, sanctuaries miles around where evil beings cannot enter, prisons capable of holding even the strongest demons, and more. What’s more, you’re painful for demons and other evil beings to touch, as your skin is to them what fire is for mortal beings, and you’ve even become moderately resistant to the evil or dark powers that they bring to bear against you.

Boosted: Saint- Truly, you are one of God’s most favored children; your holy relics are truly symbols of the divine, with your weapons capable of harming even the Devil (if you wanted to risk fighting him in Hell), your sanctuaries could encompass entire cities or even countries if you took the time to maintain them, and your prisons would be capable of holding the Devil himself, if you could trick him into it. Finally, your holiness makes it painful for evil beings to look at you, let alone touch you, as the purity of your soul blinds them, while also granting you protection from all but the strongest of evil or dark magics.

In fact, you don’t seem to have limits anymore. Your abilities will steadily grow over time, and with practice this growth can be further accelerated. While you might have once been limited to creating illusions not much larger than yourself, you would one day be able to conjure an entire city from your memories.

Boosted: By surpassing what you once thought were your own limits, you have learned that such things are largely self-imposed on others, and how they can overcome these limitations. Perhaps a vast gulf in power compared to your associates made you feel lonely, or you saw the potential in strengthening your allies? Either way, you can ensure that your friends, allies and subordinates can benefit from their own endless potential in the same way you can.

1145,,600,Limbo Sorcery,X-Men the Claremont Years,Modus,"Did you get dragged into a hell dimension for half your life Jumper? You now have a talent for the sorcery of this world and training in the magical arts of Limbo. Now, the rules of magic on Limbo are a lot different, and looser, than those on Earth so you’ll find yourself incapable of casting spells on Earth through just this ability, though this will ensure that you have the potential to learn magic in this world. Of course even then your talent will be relatively limited on Earth compared to when on a world like Limbo. In more magically loose dimensions you will find yourself more at ease magically, capable of minor magic in magical realms and dimensions such as Asgard or the Astral Plane even without additional training. Where you really shine is in Hell dimensions where you have the magical knowledge and skill of a practiced sorcerer, and the potential to be worthy of the title of Sorcerer Supreme for the dimension (which sadly still is not equal to Sorcerer Supreme of Earth).

Of course this limited magic is not the main power this perk gives you. You have formed part of your soul into a weapon of pure magic. While this soulsword (or other melee weapon of your choice) typically does nothing to the physical bodies of those it cuts, unless they’re a creature of living magic like a demon, it can cut through psychic forces and constructs and more importantly almost any sorceries or magic with ease. With time and skill you may learn to be able to toggle on and off this magic-rending and intangible nature to use it as a normal sword as well, or even as both a magic-rending and normal blade simultaneously. You may import a melee weapon to act as your soulsword.

Finally as a side-effect of this all you find yourself almost completely immune to telepathic powers. Even Charles Xavier could not read your mind no matter how long or hard he tries, and controlling you would be even further out of the question. While it’s possible for these shields to be overcome - the Shadow King while possessing another psychic mutant whose own power was mental possession was implied to be able to overcome them with time and great effort, and Psylocke bolstered by Mojo’s magical powers was able to - what can overcome these shields is few and far between and of truly staggering power."

Meaning with only a year of training, you can rival a Master of the Mystic Arts who spent decades. However, to reach the level of a Sorcerer Supreme would require at least decades of training and a great deal of resources.

Boosted: Your talent surpasses that of Dr. Strange. If you study hard, you can reach the level of a Sorcerer Supreme before ten years are up, and even faster with the right resources.

Note: If taken with Mystic Arts Proficiency, you start as a Master of Mystic Arts, and if you also have the Blessing of Stan Lee, you start at the level of Dr. Strange Senior prior to his death.

The extent of this power is based on your species in this jump. If you were equivalent to a frog you would be strong enough to beat small crocodiles, create small rain clouds that follow your foes, or minor lightning strikes, but would be of little use against a t-rex, and a hippo would be able to provide more raw destructive power than you. This strength will increase with the more powerful species you bought in this jump; as a Dangerous species you would be notably superhuman in your strength, as an Apex you would be able to play with some of the more powerful superhumans, as a Behemoth Dragon while you’d still be noticeably weaker than the stronger showings of Thor or Gladiator, you’d be able to go several rounds with She-Hulk in pure strength. Your elemental powers will likewise increase, though, likewise will never reach Thor’s in strength. If you would prefer not to be a carbon copy of Thor you may choose another set of elemental powers than storms, but whatever you choose will have roughly the same level of utility and usefulness; choosing time would allow some low end temporal manipulation for brief bursts of super speed but not free movement through the future and past for example."
1148,,600,Sanctorum Magic(600),Marvel Midnight Suns,Modus,You learned under the Ancient One at Kamar-Taj along with Stephen Strange. Just like Doctor Strange you are a sorcerer of Vishanti.

1150,,600,Major Magic,Marvel: What If...?,Modus,"You’ve gotten into the powerful tomes and learned a few secret techniques that will put you on a whole different level. Choose two of the spells listed below to add to your repertoire. If you purchase this perk a second time, you may learn all four spells.

i. Protection spell: A must-have when facing cosmic beings, this spell wraps the wearer in glowing eldritch energy, giving them an additional layer of armor and enhancing their mundane tools and weaponry. With a spell like this, you or your allies could tangle with even Ascended Ultron for a short time.

ii. Duplication Spell: A relatively simple spell with a high potential energy requirement, this technique lets you create up to a dozen copies of an object or creature, each capable of moving and acting independently or in concert. The more powerful the object or creature, the more energy you must fuel the spell with.

iii. Mirrored Reality: A specialized and high-dangerous variant of the previous technique, this spell can create a split in a localized section of timeline, allowing two versions of an individual to exist simultaneously. This is far more efficient than the Duplication Spell, and can be used on more powerful beings, but can only be maintained for short spans of time. Go meet your evil twin, Jumper.

iv. Pocket Dimension: Make some space for yourself. You can craft a small extradimensional space that you may enter or exit at will. You control how time passes in this space, as well as who can enter or exit. Maintaining the space takes enormous concentration and power, so I still suggest using your Warehouse for storage.

You are also able to summon moisture from the air and create floods, blizzards, and/or snowstorms.

Essentially a much stronger version of the earlier outlined abilities, though you don’t require them to purchase this. Your powers will grow with time, until your power rivals the Prince of Thunder himself. 

EE-Aerokinesis- A gentle zephyr and a rending gale; you embody the air to scatter your enemies to the winds. The force of your gusts can potentially topple skyscrapers and flay flesh from bones; summoning a tornado is as easy as breathing for you. 

EE-Pyrokinesis- An inferno burns within you; you embody the flames to burn your foes to ash. Your fire is nearly as hot as the sun, and is highly resistant to being extinguished or smothered. 

EE-Geokinesis- The ground shakes with your steps; you embody the earth to crush your enemies. Highly destructive, you can cause localized earthquakes to topple even the sturdiest buildings. 

EE-Hydrokinesis- The ocean breaks at your command; you embody the seas to drown your enemies. The amount of water you can control can easily be considered a tsunami. 

EE-Audiokinesis- Your voice is destruction; you embody sound to deafen and obliterate. Your mastery of sound is such that you can control the force and volume of it, making it so your decrees can be heard city-wide without worry of damaging your surroundings, or whispering with enough force to turn men to dust

EE-Electrokinesis- The storm comes at your call; you embody the storm to electrify and shock your enemies. Thunderstorms are called at your will, striking with deadly precision and even moving to hit more nimble opponents, and you can call down great bolts of lightning that could disintegrate buildings. 

EE-Chlorokinesis- Plant-life grows to suit your needs; you embody growth to create life. You can grow plants that would take hundreds of years to reach maturity in seconds, and can easily create hybrid plant life, taking the best properties and none of the bad. What’s more, you can create plant-like creatures that are perfectly loyal to you, and with time may even create sapient plant-life.

The abilities that are on level five or stronger would receive an accelerated growth in strength, utility, effectiveness and range with combat and at very least one percent growth at every battle or per hour of prolonged battles but it needs to be at very least somewhat threatening to you."
1166,,600,Amplifier Node  ,Toaruverse,Modus,"Normal humans only have one brain but unlike others you have an extra one in the form of a node that grows beside your original brain and quite different from a certain project that needed a lot of time and maintenance. This node has a special function that amplifies all of your powers strength, effectiveness, utility and range by ten times at bare minimum, and you’re Esper ability can exert strength, effectiveness, utility, range and powers one level above you’re current Esper level but has no effect on a level five other than amplification. You can also connect this power with others allowing you to amplify their powers and Esper ability like yours with no limit on how many you can connect or how far they are from you as the connection once set is unbreakable and you can also forcefully connect with someone through prolonged physical contact without their permission to control or calm their berserked abilities or powers and this also applies to you which passively increase you control to all of your abilities and powers. This also allows you to know the location and conditions of those connected with you."
1167,,600,Heavy Armor ,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"A magic that grants the user control over the primal force of gravity. The user may decrease their own gravity or that of others quite easily, allowing the float freely. However, the most relevant usage of this ability is to increase the gravity of one area, or the gravity that a certain target is subjected to. For most, they will be easily crushed once the gravity is increased a hundred times, but others may require a larger effort.

This also may be turned into gravitational spheres or beams that destroy everything around their path by forcibly compressing them upon contact. The user may even create a large area where their maximum gravity increase slowly expands to consume everything.

A Seija before dragonizing may go as far as increasing the gravity of an area or a target up to a thousandfold, instantly crushing most targets. A more powerful dragonized Sieja may use it up to thousands of times."
1168,,600,Gift of the Enchantress,Shovel Knight ,Modus,"You gain the ability to use magic. At the very beginning, you can shoot beams at the cost of ten mana, but as you progress, you will unlock new spells, use less mana, and make existing spells more powerful. You will also be able to improve others via magic, letting them using a stored spell continuously or some other such ability."
1169,,600,Maven,League of Legends,Modus,"Your melody moves the soul, and your silence sunders the body. You gain incredible talent with a single musical instrument of your choice (Your singing voice is a viable option). Whenever you play this instrument, you gain access to powerful magic music that can bolster your allies and hinder your enemies. One chord can heal and shield your allies, and the next can create a powerful blast of magic to knock your foes off their feet. You can even use your magic to force your foes to drop what they're doing and dance, if only for a couple seconds before they realize what's happened."
1170,,600,Rune Magic,League of Legends,Modus,"You use an extremely powerful and rare variety of magic, capable of harnessing pure energy as a weapon. Using magical runes stored either in a spellbook, a scroll, or on your skin you can create blasts and vortexes of energy capable of blasting people apart with ease, cast a spell to lock someone in a prison made of energy, or create a portal to warp yourself and your companions anywhere within a kilometer after 2 seconds of delay. This magic's power is reliant on pure, magical energy- So, the only limit to how powerful this magic is is how much magic you can store in your being, the power increasing in proportion to the magical energy you pour into it. Beware, however, for careless use of this magic could easily lay waste to entire landscapes, rendering them inhospitable wastelands."
1171,,600,Beyond the Bounds,Arcane,Modus,"While Piltover marches on into the future, it sometimes seems that Zaun has been left in the past. Even so, amongst its sunken towers there are those whose minds could outstrip any of the academics of Piltover, if they were only given the chance. Those high-and-mighty scholars might spit on your theories, call you mad or deluded, but you know better. You’re a genius.

You have an incredible talent for invention - not the stable kind that propels society as a whole forwards, but creating things that would be deemed preposterous by most, breaking the seeming bounds of science or crossing disciplines which seem incompatible to achieve the impossible. Machines that bend and twist time, spells that seem to go beyond the rules of magic, drugs which can heal a person from the very verge of death - you might create all of these, if you put your mind to it.

Such creations are generally difficult or near-impossible to replicate on a mass scale, and are often unstable or possess downsides or negative side-effects, but their potency cannot be understated."
1172,,600,Judgment ,King Arthur ,Modus,"The pinnacle of holiness. You've mastered the arts of the divine and are able to unleash energies that even the most powerful of unholy abominations will fear, with enough time you could purify almost anything. Even your very hands will burn demons if you wish and you may call a huge beam of light down from the skies. The ultimate skill you possess is the white dragon. After a short prayer you can summon a gigantic divine white dragon. It is the most powerful divine ability in this world. With its very presence thrusting life back into the land around it. That is by no means it's only ability though, breathing fire hot enough to melt castles and it's scales harder than any mundane metal make it almost untreatable in battle. Finally the dragon is quite knowledgeable about almost every holy ritual known , and most likely ones unknown to man."
1173,,600,Relevance,Dresden Files,Modus,"So in a world with magic and monsters, one might feel cause to doubt how relevant a normal mortal can be, without any magical muscle of their own. After all, even the ordinary critters of the night tend to fall towards the ‘bullet immune’ side of the fence. Well, with this perk you can do something about that. You have the curious, almost wondrous ability to bridge the gap between the mundane and the magical, even if only in the ways you can wield your powers. It might be that you use money to dig up magical artifacts, or you make alliances with magical forces who need something from the mortal world, but you can make whatever form of ‘power’ you have relevant and useful in just about all the ways power can be defined. You know how to use what you have to get what you need, and this works in both directions. So someone who is a magical heavyweight would find themselves suitably rich and influential in short order, too. More than just the grand prospects of power, this also works on the little stuff. Using police investigation skills to solve mysteries of the Nevernever, using a Mortician’s skills for patching up people... your ability to cross-utilize skills beggars belief."
1174,,600,Soul Source,The Dresden Files,Modus,"Somehow, you've gained the power of Soulfire - the ability to use the energies of your soul to enhance your magic. By infusing a spell with not just your will, but all your being, it'll be infused with a sort of ""mystic rebar,"" granting it a lot of strength and giving it significantly more structure. Since your self is part of the spell now, it also functions more along the lines of your intentions, rather than just providing you with a raw boost. Of course, this comes at a cost: you're literally burning away part of your soul for power. Souls do heal up, especially when engaged in ""soul-affirming"" activities, but overuse might be worse than fatal."
1175,,600,King’s Blade ,Dark Souls 2,Modus,"“A knight serves their king to the bitter end, and some beyond even that. Are you a shield, a sword, an eye, an ear? Whatever purpose you might have, to meet the many hardships guaranteed by such loyalty head on, you will become something more. Depending on the purpose or mission assigned to you by those who hold your allegiance, you will slowly grow to adapt and fit into the rule you were given. One tasked with pursuing undead will slowly acquire greater mobility, and power to drain away the remnants of their sanity. One tasked with guarding a road will find their soul bleeding into the area and making it their own, a perilous obstacle. Those tasked with protecting something together with another knight may even find the ability to pull their compatriot back from the brink of death, and vice versa. You will not grow into a duty you aren’t attempting to carry out, but you do keep whatever development that may have grown while carrying a mission out. A single campaign may offer heightened ability or proficiency, but it’s the ones that last a lifetime that allow you to evolve.”"
1176,,600,“Seath’s Studies”,Dark Souls 1,Modus,"Above all others, you have proven yourself most capable in aiding Seath’s research. It is you who have been given the most trust and the most exposure to his most vital experiment results and tomes on sorcery. You’re incredibly familiar with Seath’s experiments, all of them, from his exploration of crystal sorceries to his heretical crimes against nature producing warped life. Through this knowledge, you can warp the biology of captives to mimic the form and abilities of other lifeforms, though this is tricky and failures will come out as uniquely twisted abominations. An example of a failure is a Pisaca, while a success would be the Moonlight Butterfly. Delving into Crystal Sorceries has taught you how to create crystalline structures, even Crystal Golems with the energies of your soul, as well as the White Dragon Breath Sorcery mimicking Seath’s breath. Combined with expertise in the fundamentals of Sorcery, you could adapt normal Sorceries into superior Crystal Sorcery variants that are stronger, providing proper experimentation and development time of course. When taken with Eyes of Seath, you are able to bestow your mind’s sight, which is a fancy way of saying you’re able to share memories. This allows you to bestow experiences, knowledge or even proof to back up your words."
1177,,600,Arcanist’s Touch,Bloodborne,Modus,"“There are many mysteries in this world, but those present in and under Yharnam blow most out of the water. The inner workings of the Pthumerian Ruins beneath Yharnam, the identity of the divine Great Ones, and what form of entity provided you such ephemeral gifts. 

Eldritch energy flows around your touch, emboldening other energies your body contacts. In simpler terms, you now greatly empower arcane or elemental objects you touch with your hand. This can even affect mundane sources of elements, and temporarily endures after such things have left your hand. 

Simple objects like a Molotov cocktail could release great, incendiary explosions after reaching the end of your pitch. Hunter’s Tools like the ‘Augur of Ebrietas’ could send men flying dozens of feet away with its summoned tentacles. Enemies beware, even a simple torch can be used to fell a dark beast.”

Boosted: Bloodborne + Arcanist’s Touch: “The combination of Arcanist's Touch and Bloodborne transforms the holder's blood into an arcane energy rich elixir, shifting it to bright blue in color, and causing it to glow. This causes Arcanist's Touch's arcane empowerment to extend to any abilities using your blood, such as Blood Bullets fired from a gun, or other forms you manipulate it into with Bloodborne’s help. 

Additionally, as an arcane medium, it can extend the range of Arcanist’s Touch to whatever is properly coated in your blood. The effects will only apply for as long as blood is still wet, but that grants much more time compared to before. Wouldn’t you agree? Other applications are yours to find.” 

Boost Requires Bloodborne(Bloodborne)"
1178,,600,Seventh Saint,Demon's Souls,Modus,​None can doubt your faith for surely you have been blessed by God. Any holy powers you have are amplified. Should you have a great soul to study you may convert it into a miracle. The weaker souls can be used to improve any faith powers you have.
1179,,600,Sage  ,Demon's Souls,Modus,"In magic you have few equals, many of them brilliant prodigies much like your self. Your intelligence improves the damages of your spells. With study you can turn great souls into powerful spells to be used. Weaker souls can be used to improve your magic."
1180,,600,Inner Self,Demon's Souls,Modus,"​Much like the Maiden, you can use the souls of great beasts, heroes, or villains to give others apart their powers. Beware though for the nature of the soul can change the person you are using it on. Weaker souls can only upgrade someone's abilities. You can use this on yourself."
1181,,600,Primal Current ,Elden Ring,Modus,"The eldest primeval sorcery is said to have been discovered by an ancient astrologer, who glimpsed a primeval current that became real, causing the stars' amber to rain down. Not only are you highly skilled in the sorcery learned from Crystallians, and Onyx and Alabaster Lords, that mortal men struggle to comprehend but the effectiveness of your spells increases when you are able to witness the stars clearly-even if only as a simulacrum or projection, as long as it is sufficiently accurate one. Their movements presciently guiding your knowledge of things to come as well as the complexity of your spellcraft, and unlock insights into creating new sorceries beyond mortal ken. With time and study, any celestial phenomena in the heavens above can be used to design a new sorcery bolstered with the power of the heavens. Notably, you have already discovered one that can cause glintstone to rain down from the heavens even in other worlds-a great boon for the sorcerer’s art, for that precious substance contains the stars’ lifeforce and is valuable for building all manner of implements.

Greater power awaits you if you are willing to apply your knowledge of the forbidden primeval current. You know how to replace your body parts with inorganic glintstone components, to transplant your soul into a great primal glintstone through which you can animate a suitably prepared puppet’s body and to weave multiple such sorcerers into a “star seed” to channel greater power. More importantly, your chances of surviving such a procedure with your mind and soul intact have drastically gone up-and in general, magical transformations of the body, mind and soul are far more successful and safe for you to undertake than they were without this. Last but not least, beings of eldritch or alien nature are much more amicable towards bargaining fairly with you-intuiting your needs and desires, and being more generous in terms of granting power. It may still be perilous to court a significantly malign or powerful entity, but in this world should a star fall to the Lands Between a pact might be struck with it. "
1182,,600,Blessing of Blood,Elden Ring,Modus,"Deep under the earth in the wretched Mire beloved of Mohg, you sought the Formless Mother’s favour-and always generous, she bestowed it. Now all manner of blood-themed magic is greatly empowered in your hands, be it wringing more power out of sacrifices or enhancing the lethality of blood-borne curses. Spirits you summon also benefit from this reviled blessing, healing you slightly when they draw blood from others and gaining strength when inflicting bloodloss by any means on their foes. When you set out to shed blood on your own initiative she favours you further, granting you phantom Great Runes that can bless all beings capable of bloodshed not allied with your chosen victim similarly and enhancing your own capacity for bloodshed further. And last but not least, the Formless Mother craves wounds she hopes you will spread across the multiverse itself. With her Bloodboon incantation you may thrust into her formless body, spreading bloodflames around you that sear your foes with their cursed heat while wracking them with unnatural bloodloss. With such a direct link with the source of all blood magic, it goes without saying you are a master practitioner of blood incantations. Conjuring swarms of flies and bloodflame talons is old hat for you, and you may easily bestow similar powers on those you favour or in time innovate new ways to channel the power of blood."
1183,,600,Moon-Touched ,Elden Ring,Modus,"Like Queen Rennala and her daughter Ranni, you encountered a mysterious moon in your youth-and it has greatly augmented both the raw power of your sorcery, and your talent with mastering it. You can fill the sky near you with glintstone stars, and unleash the power of the Comet Azure with mighty capable of punching through nearly all protection and blessings afforded the Golden Order’s champions. Creating shimmering, nigh- impenetrable barriers is also well within your power, and many miscellaneous mystic arts such as summoning creatures are at your disposal as well. Already you boast the in-depth yet extremely extensive knowledge that only one with the resources of Raya Lucaria at their disposal for a lifetime could accumulate. It is well within your power to perform various magical feats such as scrying your fate in the stars, creating advanced bodies capable of housing souls and even performing the dread art of rebirth upon living beings-although such magics generally require the power of a Great Rune to perform without distorting a living being into a delirious Sweeting. But you are not only well- versed in principles such as the primordial current-your supreme intellect lets you master magical spells and artifacts that are hopelessly out of reach for most- and wring tenfold the power out of more conventional ones. This lets you innovate and modify your magical techniques unlike any other in the Lands Between-whether by using a projectile as transportation as well, or forging glintstone artifacts.

Included is a spell unique to the Carian royalty: The power to incarnate a moon roughly sized to your own body and send it at your foes, drawing in and dispelling all sorcery it touches as well as reducing magical defence negation; with further study, certain elemental powers may be applied to it as well. It is no exaggeration to say that your sorcerous expertise compares favourably to the might of some demigods, gracefully drowning your foes in them like a rain of shooting stars and conjuring phantasmal night-graced landscapes that seem wholly real to those caught within them.

You also have the towering build and formidable spiritual power of a true champion, rising above the height of most of your kind-and adept with a magical stave as a tool of war as well as a magical instrument. And just like the Carian royal family’s distant but cordial relations with the moon, though your path may be difficult if opposition is truly overwhelming not only are you fated to attain great political and mystical power-but all your magical abilities are particularly effective against extraterrestrial invaders, corruptive forces and eldritch horrors of all sorts. Even divine beings or the truly alien of form will find their innate natures grant them no particular protection against your spellcraft. Let the malign forces that would twist human ambition against itself bear witness to the coming of a cold, dark night."
1184,,600,Shapers of Nature,MtG - Ixalan,Modus,"""Shapers adapt nature to fit their needs and then return it to the way it was, leaving no trace of their passing."" You have this advanced and powerful terraforming ability, capable of not only shifting the landscape, stirring on growth, and shifting both tide, earth, and wood to your wills - but also the precision to return it to its natural state after you have accomplished your goals with it."
1185,,600,To Hold Dominion,MtG - Amonkhet,Modus,"The gods are physically exemplary, but they are also magically unparalleled. Beyond the power of mortal mages, the gods wield immense magic of their own. You may choose one of the five colors of magic and a concept that fits within that color. Your divine magic as a god of Amonkhet is deeply connected to that concept and, to a lesser extent, that Color (see Notes for Colors and concepts). However, it is mighty enough to overpower any planeswalker born after the Mending, and many of those born before. At the same time, your divine magic cannot be turned against its own nature, and carries other restrictions about when it can and cannot be used, and in what ways. It is at its strongest when you are acting in your official capacity as a god. Under the right circumstances, such as during a holy trial, you could overpower the whole of the Gatewatch. Gods get this for free during the jump( and if they chose to stay), but must buy it to keep it if you Go Home or Continue On."
1186,,600,Archmage,MtG - Amonkhet,Modus,"Perhaps that’s an exaggeration, but the fact remains that you’re a powerful, highly trained, and talented mage. You may pick one form of magic to be an undisputed master of, with years of training and experience behind you. If you are a Planewalker, you will be on par with a member of the Gatewatch, and even if you aren’t you’ll be able to give them a fight, at least in terms of power and skill. Dozens of forms of magic exist, examples including elementalism, hieromancy, telepathy, necromancy, thaumaturgy, lithomancy, sanguinomancy, diabolism, choronarchy, and many, many others. 

Purchase Requires Spellcaster(MtG - Amonkhet)"
1187,,600,Brazen Borrower,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"The faerie are consummate thieves, but this goes even beyond that. Simply put, you are capable of using a magical process to ‘steal’ attributes from people, a process that can be resisted with a virtuous heart, but catching them off guard is likely to make it an easier attempt. - these attributes can range from as meager as a hair color to abstract as their love or their voice - allowing you to keep it in the form of a physical trinket or use the stolen attribute yourself. There may be some method for the stolen object to return, as fae magic tends to leave these riders...but of course, a clever thing like you knows how to cover your tracks, right?"
1188,,600,Witch’s Vengeance,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"Witches may not necessarily be as good at transformation curses as the faeries...well, they’re an absolute master at nasty, nasty spells. The three main uses of their particular brand of witchcraft are mystical mind-controlling geas spells, death curses, and blight spells. The first two are what they sound like, but have a few caveats. While they can affect multiple people at once, the more ‘broad’ the curse, the weaker the effect is. If you simply cursed a particular individual to death, he would begin to rot away as his soul was ejected from his body, with only a bright and truly virtuous soul perhaps resisting it. Cursing a family would put them all ill to the brink of death, while a village-wide death curse would seem to the untrained eye as if a plague had swept through. Doing either requires something of the victim or symbolic of the victim as a focus for the spell. Blights merely poison water and earth for a time - rendering it sickening and barren. Finally, you are capable of replicating the effects of “Frogify” and “Hypnotic Sprite” with potioncraft, using strange materials to brew philters that will shape the senses and body."
1189,,600,Legendary Beast,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Modus,"There are some wild creatures that attain the status of an individual myth even within the Wilds, such as the ever-venerable Questing Beast. You have attained the ability of such a creature, becoming one of the following legendary forms of Fae. 

Harmonious Archon: You gain a pair of luxurious wings, and can take a goat- like form with an ‘equalizing’ aura in terms of physical capabilities - giving normal people the strength to shatter bears with a punch and having super- powerful beasts slowed and dulled in instincts enough that there is a sense of fairness to physical confrontations, though some gaps cannot be bridged… A dragon and a barehanded human may have a more ‘fair’ fight beneath your light, but it won’t be an easy thing for the human regardless, and any mistake for them is lethal. 

The Boojum: Illusion and madness are a tangible force in the realm of the Wilds, and the Boojum is able to utilize it almost naturally - the Boojum is capable of sending the weak willed or unsuspecting within reach of it into a mental maze, leaving their bodies comatose as their minds fight to awaken from the reverie...and what’s more, the Boojum is capable of escaping into this maze and hunting their prey from there! Though, a strong minded person or those with great virtue may be able to break through the maze quick enough to deny any openings in a fight. 

The Deathless Wolf: Fear. Death. Constant companions of those who live on the border of the Wilds. You may not necessarily be a powerhouse - one of your only ‘real’ abilities normally is to meld into and energy from the shadow...it’s what happens when your body is destroyed that makes the fear eternal. One of your teeth will fall into the ground, this tooth being your essence. If it is destroyed, you have been slain - your very being scattered out. But untilthen, the tooth will feed on the fear of those who know your story - the anxiety of the survivors will nourish this tooth until it reforms you whole to terrorize once more. 

The Jabberwock: Violence. The Wilds is red in tooth and claw, and you are one of the apex beasts of its legends - with eyes of flame and a vicious spirit. You are so in tune with violence that you are capable of making strikes upon your enemies without even moving your body - your desire to kill manifesting as a gaze which ‘strikes’ without striking and gestures that carry your attacks on the wind, allowing you to reap through the weak with almost bone-chilling ease. 

The Faeburrow: Growth, flourishing and verdant. You are a forest unto yourself, with an oddly maze-like ‘interior’ made of wild woods, strange creatures, and whatever fauna and flora you cultivate within. You are capable of ‘manifesting’ the creatures and plants within you from your very body, and what’s more you can attempt to bring creatures within your inner forest - a maze that can be escaped with courage , or simply powerful magic. In addition, damage dealt to the inner forest is reflected upon you...so perhaps a Knight of Embereth may not be the best prisoner."
1190,,600,Lithomancy,MtG - Zendikar,Modus,"Masters of earth and stone crystals, lithomancers are wizards with a strong connection to earth, using their magic to shape the earth itself around them and create potent artifacts. Commonly found among the Kor, lithomancers are invaluable for their ability to craft gear far surpassingnormal metal from nearby stone, forging shining marble-white stone weapons of incredible hardness. But this is the least of the skills of a lithomancer; with training they may extend their senses to see the entirety of a body of stone and craft crystalline structures capable of channeling mana massively in excess of that which a person can safely contain and seal things within stone."
1191,,600,Lull/Roil Mage,MtG - Zendikar,Modus,"The Roil: Zendikar's one true constant and the reason that other constants don’t last if left untended. The massive storm that is the Roil cannot be stopped, but it can be calmed and it is to that end you dedicated much of your life to the Lullmage arts, learning to embrace harmony of mind and with the land to soothe the Roil, and in other places calm nature to stop storms and appease spirits of the land. No exploration party is complete without a Lullmage to quiet the Roil- well, no expedition that expects to return, at any rate. But in recent years you have been forced to turn to more destructive pursuits in opposition to the quieting of the Lullmages. Roilmages may focus on disquiet to incite the land, and draw on the might of the roil detonating the landscape in storms of earth, stone, and fire; calling upon the harshest weather imaginable to smite all before them. In jumps following this you will find yourself able to calm native weather as though it were the roil and incite nature in other planes into a frenzy akin to the roils fury on zendikar. This is a primarily cerebral art and a blue magic at base."
1192,,600,Animist ,MtG - Zendikar,Modus,"For most learning the ways of the land is the experience of a lifetime; a long and grueling experience. The Animists, however, are far more attuned and know Zendikar far more intimately. Animists are shamans attuned to the mana of planes to a rather extreme degree - to the point that the flows of mana are as visible to them as a river is to anyone else now you too are one of their number. This attunement has many consequences: for one, the land itself will grant you visions, showing any threats to it, though hazy at first. With more time and some effort, you may learn the art of raising elementals and with yet more experience you will find yourself attuned to the life of the planes themselves, allowing you cause plant life to burst forth from barren ground, manipulate forests to fight with you, or even channel the mana of planes themselves into your own spells or those of others. This is a predominantly green magic, focused on nature."
1193,,600,Devoid,MtG - Zendikar,Modus,"Your mana and your magic have taken on an odd quality: they are colorless, stripped of the color inherent to them by your very nature and making them akin to the spell-like effects wrought in the wake of the eldrazi. This has several practical effects; the most significant of which is that any colored or elemental magical resistances will fail against them. Fire wards will be utterly ignored by your colorless fireballs, but more generic anti-magic will still see its full effect. The same applies to specific elemental or type immunities as well. On the other hand, their colorless nature will mean that your own colored or elemental-boosting powers no longer apply to your spells either; your colorless fireballs won’t be enhanced if you have a special talent for pyromancy. Thankfully you can toggle this on and off to take advantage of the situation at the cost of two motes of colourless mana and a few heartbeats of focus."
1194,,600,Grandmother ,MtG - Homelands,Modus,"Before her welcome into the Sengir family, Grandmother was known as Ravi, a wizard with a past somewhat similar to Sengir's. She was a powerful pupil of a planeswalker, traveling the multiverse, studying magic, and learning to wield it. Yet in the centuries she spent trapped since the ringing of the Apocalypse chime, she became blackened and twisted.

Hopelessly insane and with little memory of who she was, the crone has spent the years since her release as the Baron’s tutor and guide, teaching him green and black magic, wisdom, and lost knowledge. Her mastery of curses and hexes is second to none in the Homelands, though with your arrival she now has an equal. While you (hopefully) lack her insanity, your mastery of the darker magics is just as great as hers. The serum to create lycanthropy, the curses to bind the spirit of a dying man as a shade, the complex spells to grant magical immortality to people, even the methods to boiling the flesh of beautiful youths for juices that keep you alive for centuries longer than magic alone could… all these and many more feats of black magic are within your grasp now.

If you wish, you can also use this great well of dark wisdom and mastery of black magic to easily secure a position similar to Ravi’s with the Baron, or any other rulers of darkness and masters of corruption. Serving as a guide, teacher, and advisor in the black arts you would be sure of a comfortable position in return for your tutelage."
1195,,600,Overwhelming,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"Let cowards hide behind their rules and limitations, uncaring of the potential within. You have left behind the shackles of more disciplined magics, and when you reach for true power, the spells within your grasp will follow. You have the unique ability to strengthen any magical effect you can manifest by infusing it with additional arcane power (such as mana) for greater potency. Pouring double or even triple the ordinary mana costs into a Stone Rain spell might see it devastate a hostile mage’s magical bonds, a summoned Ball Lightning grows ever mightier as you pour power into its being, and even the humble Shatter spell could be turned into a violent explosion as the excess mana combusts. Let no limit restrain you, for in the power of Red magic, you are set free."
1196,,600,Esoteric Cancellation ,MtG - Shandalar,Modus,"Though all colors of magic study the workings of power for their own ends, Blue mages alone study magic for the sake of magic. The underlying principles of spellcraft and magery are far too complex and mystifying to be grasped by one studying only one color of magic... but some commonalities do exist, and you’ve learned how to use that commonality to your advantage. By directly opposing the magical power of a spell as it is cast, it’s possible to disrupt its structure before it can fully take hold in physical reality - and with enough power, it can be negated entirely. Through this process, a substantial investment of power on your end allows you to essentially prevent any spell from being cast, sending it fragmenting into the aether before it ever fully forms. The process becomes increasingly simple the greater you understand both the system of magic that is being used and the exact spell itself (so trying to blindly Counterspell an effect is very difficult if you don’t know what the spell is trying to achieve), but while you’ll always need at least an amount of magical power to match the total power of the spell or ability you attempt to negate, the process can be adapted to other systems of magic as well."
1197,,600,OVERLOAD,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"Some spells can seem weak on their own. Forcing an opponent to become immobile, dealing a decent amount of damage to someone... they’re okay, just not as useful when facing a lot of opponents. Overload changes everything. By exerting a considerably larger amount of energy while casting, you can make single-target spells mass targeting. Instead of immobilising one guy, stop the whole room in its tracks. Boost one of your teammates? Why not all of them? Drop a lighting bolt on one person, or on everyone in a city."
1198,,600,CIPHER,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"The Dimir have mastered the peculiar and somewhat disturbing art of encoding spells into living beings, so that they trigger upon dealing damage in combat. There are obvious advantages to this: a spell often takes longer to cast than simply throwing a punch, and once a spell is encoded into a being, the effort needed to cast it no longer needs to be paid each time. I’m sure there are many other ways you can use this to your advantage as well."
1199,,600,DETAIN ,MtG - Ravnica,Modus,"Rule making? Acting as a judge? Don’t get me wrong, those are great and all, but what being a member of the Azorius is really about is stopping (mostly) bad guys from doing bad stuff. You are exceptionally gifted in the magic of restriction and sealing, able to cast spells which can bind, lock, and capture, stopping people directly in their tracks. And this doesn’t just apply to physical movement either. Enemies detained by you also find their capacity to use magic or any other paranormal abilities is significantly hindered."
1200,,600,Aquitect ,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"The ferry magic seen by landwalkers is far from the only way the merrow use their ancient magic of water. Aquitects use their magic to redirect rivers and maintain their network of waterways across the world, shapewater orbs to allow for two-way communication between Tideshapers, and deep below the water’s surface the architecture of the merrow primarily uses permanent shapewater to construct their gleaming walls.

You’ve gleaned these secrets now, your water manipulating magic growing more powerful to let you command and redirect entire river-lanes, even as you’ve learned the complex art of permanently turning normal water into gleaming shapewater. The magic used in the creation of these fixtures of merrow architecture has about as much to do with the magic used by merrow ferrymen as the kithkin have to elves, producing glistening crystals totally unlike the mere solidified water created by lesser merrow mages. Along with these, you’ve also learned a few more tricks of the trade, like the creation of linked shapewater orbs that allow one to speak and see through the two-way link with only a little effort of will (though it would take longer to create an orb a landwalker could use)."
1201,,600,Pure Combustion,MtG - Lorwyn,Modus,"The blue stage of the Path of Flame, attained exclusively by the wisest and most experienced of flamekin mages. Beyond fire, these elders have the ability to unleash pure, infinite combustion and incendiary energy. They could, if they wished, cause destruction on a wide scale to reduce dozens to smoldering, unrecognizable corpses and blast the land. 

But they also have complete control over their flames and are specifically trained not to cause such utter destruction. The precision of a practised tribal elder is such that they could demonstrate their heat and precision by conjuring a perfect faerie-sized cage of flame that fit its occupant like a second skin. So long as the faerie didn't move, he was unharmed. If he touched the flames, they'd burn his bones to ash.

While you might have to find a faerie volunteer if you want to replicate that show, your own control over your flames and magic is suitably perfect. Collateral damage is a thing of the past, and calling on the pure energy of combustion grants unparallel destructive ability. Other more practical uses of this control might include floating through the air on diffuse jets of light that match your flames, or sending forth a wave of almost invisible heat to cause stone boulders to explode."
1202,,600,The Magic Found In Stories ,MtG - Innistrad,Modus,"There is magic in tales, in the words of the past, of histories lasting record. You can draw upon mana to coax this power out from scrolls and books, and any other form of writing, shaping it into a spell that utilises some critical aspect of the story to change the world around you. Mayhap a story of a thief that disguised themselves as a rock but was caught out lying would allow you to cloak yourself in a visage appropriate to your surroundings until you tell a lie. Perhaps a tale of beings gaining independent thought could clear the madness from an infected mind. In time you may come to know stories you repeatedly use so well a mere glance at their written form is enough to call upon its magics, allowing you to unleash it quickly - useful if you ever found yourself needing to quickly fire a lamentations ice magic at an attacker, for example."
1203,,600,Necromancy ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Modus,"Necromancy is, at its core, the power to manipulate shadows. A necromancer stores their magic inside a physical vessel (a cane, a coat, a gun, armor, etc.) and uses it as a focus to channel their power. They can use shadows to attack and defend by shaping them into solid constructs. If your focus is destroyed, the power flows back into you, and must be stored in a new vessel before it can be used again. Necromancers also have the ability to passively sense death around them and draw on it to strengthen their magic. Many of them can infuse corpses with small fragments of their power to create zombies under their command. More advanced necromancers can perform a technique called Shadow-walking, a form of teleportation through shadows with a relatively short range (only a few hundred meters).

Boosted: Deathbringer: With the capstone booster, you become a match for Lord Vile, the greatest Necromancer the world has ever seen. The range of your shadow-walking is measured in miles, not meters. Your zombies can range in complexity and power from ‘mindless shambling corpse that infects others’ to beings on par with the White/Black Cleaver, which was skilled enough to use weapons and capable of regenerating endlessly. You can gather shadows around yourself to fly, and you can perform a technique called the Death Bubble, an area-of-effect attack that rips the life force away from everyone inside its sizable radius and draws it into the caster. Finally, much like Melancholia St. Clair, you can store your necromantic magic inside your body, allowing you to use it without need for a focus.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
1204,,600,Magic Formula Creation,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Modus,"The Power of Order was Celica Mercury’s power, and the opposite of her sisters. Konoe Mercury, instead of repelling, resisting, and erasing magic, was born to embrace it. Magic simply make sense to her, as if it wants to be used. You were also born with this blessing. While I’m sure that you can figure out the uses for that, because it gets better. You see, Konoe, Nine, was also a genius of science. When the Black Beast began to overload the world with magic she flat out created a new system of magic that anyone could use in order to help combat it. She called it the magic formulas, and bound them into weapons that could cast for those unable to do so. On top of that, and with the help of Yuki Terumi, she took a second Black Beast and bound it into a power source for nine weapons of unparalleled might. With the blessing of your birth, magic is yours to command. With the blessing of your mind, science lets you bend the world. Together? You’ll go down in history. Nine certainly did."
1205,,600,Princes of the Universe,Campione,Modus,"Pandora is the name of the goddess who creates the Campione. An artifact known as the Circle of Usurpation, and a glitch in the system of divine reincarnation allows her to take certain things from the slain heretic gods, and instead award them to her adopted children. Regardless of the details of the system, you now own a slightly different copy. This fake Circle of Usurpation is not necessary to continue to grow in power in other worlds, but rather for other worlds to grow in power. Once per jump you can select a ‘type’ of foe for this to affect. In the same way Campione gain Authorities from the slain Gods, you can set a system that gifts powers from those slain beings to others that match your rules."
1206,,600,Casting Code,Fate/Extra CCC,Modus ,"Mystery died. Magecraft faded away. Magic is unreachable. Despite all this, the Magi would not tolerate losing their power over the world. Through great effort, a new form of magic was found. Taking the form of digital manipulation, mastery over spiritrons, and more than a little skill in simple programming, the magic of Code Casts became widespread. There was no need for a masquerade, for while the Magi had to abandon magecraft in favor of code casts, it was a wholly new tradition and wouldn’t benefit from Mystery regardless.

Enough about history, for you are now a very talented wizard indeed. Equal to the likes of Rin Tohsaka, you have a general and remarkable level of experience with manipulating code, and utilizing your skills to manipulate the digital reality of the Moon Cell. However, this is simply a skill, and you are very talented. Should you have rare enough resources and stretch what you can do as much as possible, you’ll grow in leaps and bounds, quickly growing to be able to do things like sealing powerful Servants in stasis cubes, modify a Servant’s matrix to give them additional power, and mess around with the arenas of the Moon Cell like a Magus of old might manipulate the landscape. You are not the best, but this tradition is a new one, and should you work hard enough you may yet carve your name in history books as one who pushed the boundaries of Code Casts and achieved great deeds with your excellence."
1207,,600, Digitized Sorcery,Fate/Extra,Modus ,"The Magi of old had to adapt, converting the dying system of magecraft into something that could be used to their advantage within the Moon Cell. The results of their efforts are the Code Casts, a digital version of magecraft. Much like them, you can now convert magical systems into a technological variant. This will not be instant and will require a fair amount of research for you to accomplish, but it would let you find a new side to existing systems you possess."
1208,,600,Root of all Swords,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Modus,"For years, you swung your blade in pursuit of a greater truth. While others sought power or wealth
or glory in battle, your blade pulled you onwards past where they all faltered. As you learned, others
fell in droves to your skill. Maybe before you even looked back and realised just how far beyond
other swordsmen you have already come.

You have reached a level of swordsmanship that cannot be described as just supernatural or divine. To the eyes of the few others on your level, they describe it as having reached the Truth of the
World with a single cut. The result is the ability to accomplish many impossible feats through your
sword style. Cutting any physical material, repelling vastly superior opponents from a location your
guard without injury to yourself, cutting through armies of threatening foes with grace and fluidity. Even with the body of an ordinary man, rather than some powerful heroic form, you remain one of
the most lethal combatants in Japan. Your style currently culminates in a single perfect expression of
your talent, which has been taken so far as to warp reality itself. A technique that incorporates the
Second Magic to cut three times with one slash, creating an inescapable prison of steel, is the best
known example.

But this peak you have reached is just the base of another mountain, as you have the ability to
rapidly bring new techniques to such a supreme level. Your repertoire, provided you continue your
harsh practice, will likely see new abilities like this every few months. Additionally, bringing other
sword-based fighting styles to the level you have reached with this one is a speedy process of
around a year’s practice, your existing skills easily bridging the gap. "
1209,,600,Runelord,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Modus,"The most iconic of magics for this place it seems, though what you are taking hold of here isn’t from
Ireland at all. With the purchase of this, you have become a master of Rune Magic, which utilises
magical energy drawn in set forms to create powerful spells. It takes more time to perform then
many other kinds of magic but is exceptionally powerful. Of course, you know all the normal Norse
runes and much of your spells come from combining them in different orders to create magic. But what makes you special is that you are aware of the Primordial Runes, the same ones that Odin
himself used. Even just using two or three at once can accomplish things like rewriting a Servant’s
saint graph, grant sapience to mere animals, bring terrible monsters to life from nothing or harm
even a divine spirit. Of course, you’ll need a lot of energy to equal the sort of stuff someone like Odin
might have done but you’ll now find yourself overflowing with more than enough magical power to
destroy a mountain or three. Maybe even crack a big island into itty bitty pieces with the right rune
combination."
1210,,600,Phenomena Operation Principles,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Modus,"King Solomon established a worldwide network to allow the use of magecraft for humanity, a stark
difference to the Age of Gods that held magic to be the province of the Gods and their kind alone. The phenomena operation technique was this grand working that Solomon accomplished and yet, he never took those principles further. Maybe they were left so that you could do something
amazing with them. You have the knowledge, skill and outright potential to create massive magical
formations and metaphysical structures, the sort of things that can establish entire systems of magic
use for whole worlds, cast spells across entire planets, allow for mass alteration of any target within
the field or almost any other imaginable effect that can be ‘programmed’ into these massive area
creations.

You can create these magical frameworks with surprisingly little energy as well. While it would still
take a magician on the level of Solomon himself to create a planet spanning magical framework, even a basic magician of this age could cover a mile diameter framework. Thankfully, the
frameworks can be piggybacked off of the World they are linked to in order to prevent you to need
to constantly maintain them."
1211,,600,Hero King,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Modus,"Indeed, Charlemagne conquered Europe through his prowess as a king. The heroic legends are just a
fantasy. A fanciful tale. But the world needs those ridiculous, absurd, wonderful heroes just as much
as it needs the realistic, practical kings. The charisma of a hero is not the sort that leads nations but
the kind that binds people to you personally, making those you fight alongside or save into close
friends in short order and lifelong comrades without much more effort. You might not give people
faith in your governance but you inspire people with the hope that they can follow you out of any
darkness they find themselves in. But a hero is much more than just their charisma. The brilliant holy light shines forth from you, a sign
of the great power you hold. You are able to use this light, a powerful form of magic, to enhance
your physical body to move beyond sound itself or smash through castles like a house of cards, even
letting off mana bursts, flashes and blasts of light in different forms. As part of your heroic
experiences until now, you are also highly capable with most traditional forms of weaponry for
knights and heroes, like the sword and lance and bow. The light greatly empowers your offensive
and defensive abilities against the foes of your religion and those beings that call the darkness their
home, letting you cut through heretics and devils like you were thrice as strong as normal and
making you similarly tougher to their returning strikes. Lastly, for whatever whim of the heavens
causes it, the light continuously acts to put you in the most dramatic of scenes and visions, ensuring that everyone that looks on you can’t help but think- that hero is simply the coolest thing. Charlemagne would be proud."
1212,,600,King of the Cavern,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Modus,"A lifetime of hatred, focused into a physical form. The sheer depth of that hate would be made
legend for another man, yet now it finds itself within you as well. You can feel it deep inside of you, an almost aimless well of black rage that when called upon, will empower you. All it takes is to
withstand the force of your own feelings. Calling upon your inner hatred in this way, already immense as a consequence of this perk, enhances
your body in several ways. Immediately, it brings your physical parameters to the point of
threatening a holy knight, such strength that fortress walls or a small army of magical guards pose
little challenge. It reinforces your body and mind to become immune to poisons, mental interference
and highly resistant to many negative status effects. The hazy black aura that distorts your form
when you use your hatred also conceals your abilities and true identity from those using magic to
scry them. The primary gift of your hate is the ability to convert magical energy into poisonous black flames. Already many times hotter than even molten magma, the flames produced from your body will even
scorch magical energy or the soul itself, destroying both spells and spiritual bodies in equal measure. The poison of the fire is so tenacious that even a Dead Apostle’s time rewinding regeneration will fail
to effect it, nor can a reincarnating immortal hope to escape the burns on his soul. With a burst of
energy, it is also possible to use the fires to take command of grudges in the area, forcing enemies to
fight each other and run wild with their own hate, or to turn those grudges into more magical energy
to power your flames."
1213,,600,National Deity,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Modus,"Gods can grow and change with the right impetus, even their vaunted authorities are not as static as
many might like. But none have the control that you seem to have. This perk grants an extra
Authority of the Gods, perhaps even your first if you were not a God already. Equal to your other
Authorities if you had some or around the level of a lower level God if not, such that offensive use of
the Authority could destroy a small mountain at best. What is unique about this Authority is that you
are able to change it and attach it to groups of things that you have fully created or majorly
contributed to the creation of. A country that you founded, a faction that you were part of the founding members, lands that you formed and populated, even a family line that was first birthed
from you. Your ‘floating’ Authority can attach to one of these things at a time, allowing you to control and
manipulate it. The Authority will grow in power as it’s subject grows, depending on what it is. A
country will expand your Authority as it grows in size, military power, economic power, political
influence and more. A family Authority may expand as the power of loyal family members grows or
the size of the family does. Uniquely, as your Authority grows, it will also improve your physical and
magical power as a God to match and even, at a much smaller rate, grow other Authorities you
possess so that they are at least in the same range of power as your floating Authority from this perk. When you swap the target of this Authority, it will reset the power of this Authority but the growth
to your personal power and your other Authorities will remain, though they will not grow again until
your custom Authority reaches the power it had before swapping. Finally, you are able to split off fragments of your custom Authority and with it fragments of your
other powers. This allows you to gift them to other beings, imbuing them with not only minor
Authorities over this concept themselves but also enhanced or entirely new abilities elsewhere. Prophets of God, as it were. These can be recalled at any time. A section at the end gives further details to Authorities."
1214,,600,High-Speed Incantations,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Modus," You have learned the techniques necessary to speed up
your spellcasting without sacrificing the efficiency, effectiveness, or stability thereof - a
supremely useful skill for mages who expect to fight other mages. Currently, your
spellcasting takes only half the time it should, but with practice you might be able to
perform it at ten times its natural speed. Also, neither nervousness nor the strains of
combat will interfere with your spellcasting, and you’re very good at interrupting and
anticipating the spells of others, though the latter skill requires some information on the
opponent."
1215,,600,Exceptional and Lucky ,Tsukihime,Modus,"The process of gaining true mastery of a Dead Apostle’s state of being, let alone becoming a full-fledged vampire, is a fundamentally slow one that is based on several different factors and the passage of time. It might even be...how do you say, impractical? So how do you keep speeding through all of it while barely knowing what you’re doing? This perk’s benefits are twofold - any sort of power or item that requires a ‘certain person’ to use it, you automatically qualify. For example if you needed a strong spiritual will to become a certain type of being, then undergoing the process to become that being would welcome and accept the change to your body. Secondly, all abilities that grow based on age or practice now take a considerable fraction of the time and effort needed for you to perfect it, perhaps even letting you develop a Reality Marble as an Apostle in a year as opposed to decades or centuries. I wonder what sort of madness created a being like you...?"
1216,,600,High Speed Magus ,Tsukihime,Modus,"High-Speed Incantation. The ability to perform otherwise-complicated magecraft that would require time and ritual in mere seconds. Whether through intense training or a natural talent, you are an expert at this Incantation, able to cast and rotate your magic within an instant. Your multitasking and mental calculations are good enough that you could pass off as a fledgling Alchemist of Atlas, able to perfectly cycle through spells in mere seconds and shorten the time of complicated magical formulas incantations’ from minutes into seconds, or hours into a short few minutes. In addition, this mental processing lets you easily juggle both hand-to-hand combat and constantly using magecraft alongside it, letting you easily use magecraft alongside any other physical abilities or powers you may have - so long as your body can handle the output of both at once, of course.
"
1217,,600,Cryokinesis ,Young Justice,Modus,"Cryokinesis allows its user to greatly lower the temperature around them, causing ice to rapidly form. This can be used to fire “beams” of cold temperatures that freeze whatever they strike, or to cause the ambient temperature of the surrounding area to drop significantly. Experienced practitioners can drop the temperature further still, as well as affect much larger areas, to the point where one might be able to affect an entire city.
"
1218,,600,Infernal Sun ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Modus,"With mastery over nuclear fission and fusion, you will be in control of perhaps the most powerful source of energy in the natural world. The incredible raw power of this ability is attributed by the fact that it originated from the god Yatagarasu, the embodiment of the sun itself. Not only will the peak of your ability over nuclear energy rival that of the stars in the sky, you may eventually be able to utilize the power of their powerful gravitational attraction as well. Simply reaching the upper limits of your power with magic alone, without using more energy or matter to support the process of nuclear fission and fusion process will be close to impossible. This power is also very hard to control, especially at the upper limits, threatening with not only its unchecked destructive power, but for the inevitable gamma radiation fallout as well.
"
1219,,600,Luna Dial ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Modus,"You have some serious power over time and space itself. Through manipulating time, you can speed yourself up relative to everything else, enabling you to act far, far faster than any human could react, or turn it towards mundane uses such as quickly aging fine wines. By manipulating space, you can turn one projectile into dozens. The two things you cannot do is stop time, you may only slow time itself down enough to make it look like time is stopped, and you cannot reverse time either. Within these constraints, you have a tremendous amount of versatility.
"
1220,,600,Elite ,Sonny,Modus,"You’re a high-ranking member of the ZPCI, and for good reason. To start, your strength and skill are beyond olympic; able to lift cars with a middling amount of effort, keep up with those cars, and get hit by one without taking too much damage. You’re also a crack-shot with guns, skilled in using them as magical foci, and make up for your lack of strength compared to zombies with your sheer skill. In fact, when training in martial pursuits, you easily learn at five times the rate of a normal man. In addition, your experience grants you one of the below sub-trees.

-The Paladin tree allows you a further boost in your physical might, double what the base capstone granted you. In addition to this, you gain a great talent for manipulating electricity, a middling talent for support magic, and a small talent for fire magic. You might fire giant electric bolts, or empower your strength to even greater heights than before, and maybe make an occasional fireball. Whatever you do, you are made for killing zombies.

-The Captain tree grants a wide skill set. First, you’re skilled in the art of leading soldiers in combat situations with efficiency and speed, allowing you to storm a large and highly equipped insurgent village and eradicate everyone there within minutes with only a dozen or so mildly experienced soldiers. But the big part of where you shine is your elementless support magic. Whereas with other trees buffs and debuffs are simple health boosts or damage modifiers, this tree goes wild with what it can do. Increasing a weakness to fire, doubling someone’s strength, so on. They are costly however, so you can’t just hand them out like candy. Lastly, you know a few poison-based spells.

-The Judge tree first bestows you with knowledge of shadow and ice magic, though primarily ice magic, with a particular bent towards capture and debuffs. You could use your ice to freeze enemies in place, and use your shadow magic to weaken your enemies in order to reduce their struggle. But the real place you shine is in your strength and durability, with strength enough to flip a tank with small effort and durability enough to take a tank round to the chest and only feel a bit bruised.
"
1221,,600,Magician ,Sonny,Modus,"There aren’t exactly any schools for magic here, nor even any sort of codified ranking system or rules since everyone tends to make up their own style, so getting this far by yourself is impressive, though not unique. But before we get into the meat of what you can do right now, let’s start off with a few bonuses. First off, you learn magic about thrice as fast as before, and not only that but are about twice as magically powerful as you would be otherwise. This applies to other magic systems too, though it does fall off with more esoteric systems.

- The Baron tree is for those out there who hate being a productive member of society. To begin with, you have an immense talent for manipulation, such that a wanted criminal could throw on a loose mask and jacket and begin a cult with their victim’s families as the members within a month. Second, you also have a good talent for shadow magic. You have a few high-quality buffs and debuffs in your arsenal should someone see through your bullcrap, and you have a moderate strength boost in case you run out of Focus. No, you do not get the ability to control zombies. This doesn’t make you Baron Brixius, it was just based on him.

- The Deceiver tree is a bit more classic. You have absolutely grand talent for Shadow and Lightning magic, and a bit of raw Cosmic aligned attacks. And the shadows are not just simply the debuffs the other trees use so often, but actual attacks as well. And this is the biggest thing you’ve got, you by far outshine the other trees in this with your sheer skill and raw power. You could throw electric bolts that match actual lightning strikes in power, throw great beams of darkness that shatter concrete like glass, and shoot arcane bolts that act like high-power grenades. Keep in mind that even though you are powerful, your Focus supply isn’t infinite and you don’t have much in the way of physical attacks.

- The Shaman tree gives a lot of needed variety. You’ve got a bit of everything. Fire, Ice, Electricity, Cosmic, non-elemental, buffs and debuffs, the whole nine yards. Your selection is above average but none of it will be enough to match the other skill trees. You do have a bit more talent with Fire and Ice than anything else though, so that might be where you want to aim your pursuits should your desire be to catch up to the others. Until then, you make up for your lack of power with versatility. As a side, you also have a decent bonus to your physical might, maybe enough to crack a tree and withstand similar blows.
"
1222,,600,I Cheat ,Justice League Dark,Modus,"The truth about magic is it's all a great, big, bloody lie. Really, it's simply telling a lie so great that the universe itself hands you the effect without the cause. What does it matter which dead language you chant in or where you draw your power from? It doesn't, because when you get down to it... it's all the same. Your realization of this has given you the skills required to mix and match different forms of magic. From spells to entire magic systems, you can pick them apart and put them back together in whatever form or fashion you want.

That's not all, either. Your grasp of the way magic works lets you make adjustments to spells on the fly. Changing the size, scope, or to some extent, the actual effects of spells is child's play for you. And this doesn't only apply to your spells; you have an innate talent for understanding any spells or enchantments you come across, immediately discerning both their purpose. This innate ability to understand the structure of spells also allows you to find their weak points, and most spells, like diamonds, can be shattered if tapped in just the perfect spot.

At normal human levels, large objects such as cars can be lifted and thrown easily enough; Martians may start out being able to lift more both in terms of quantity and weight. This can only be used on things that are within the range of the user’s vision, and cannot be used on the internals of living organisms, even if the user can see those things somehow.

You have become a Liche High Priest, the most powerful and knowledgeable of all of the priesthood of death. Your powers with the magics of life and death, particularly those unique to this land such as the Lore of Nehekhara, have grown to staggering levels of might. You have a knowledge of the rituals, ceremonies and traditions of Nehekhara unmatched by any save Khatep himself. You could have unsealed the greatest of tombs and performed the rituals to summon Settra and his great army alone if you were awake at the time. And if you had done so, summoned the dead yourself, your will would stay with them regardless of your presence. The undead you create or raise up do not require the presence of a priest to maintain themselves or energy to continue functioning, though you may still forcefully dismiss your own creations.

1226,,600,Voodoo ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Modus,"Not a terribly well liked form of magic, even among the often brutal Amazons. Voodoo magic is only rarely used by the witches that live on the outside of Amazon communities, a form of curse magic that allows them to harm or cast spells on people even from great distances away, so long as they have a link. You’ve mastered this magic, allowing you to affect people so long as you have a piece of their body. For a normal person or those weaker than you, a lock of hair would allow you to cast spells on them from hundreds of miles away or kill them by destroying a doll made in their image. Those stronger than you or with significant magical protections of their own may only receive lesser effects or even be entirely immune to your voodoo magic, unless you can get something more important from them. Even those stronger than you might not resist if you have a limb or organ of theirs."

For instance, Knots of Fate lets you foresee the future (immediate present) luck of up to three targets and swap their fated lucks with each other. Backstitch undoes effects on yourself, Running Stitch teleports targets up to 60 feet, and Hemming Stitch fuses limbs together.

Any spells you cast can have their “good/evil” alignment/karma be determined by your own level of good/evil and your good/ill intentions for the spell. That said, keep in mind that magic that requires performing evil actions to cast like human sacrifices, due to such actions being evil, would make the spell likely still count as evil under this perk."
1230,,600,WIDOW’S GUIDANCE ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"Tzarina Katarin was believed to be the first Khan Queen Miska returned due to her peerless power with ice magic. She now has a peer as your own abilities equal hers and you would be just as capable of creating a large glittering building of ice with little more than a thought, breathe waves of intense cold, summon huge blizzards to freeze foes where they stand or eviscerate them with razor sharp ice shards. Any powers of snow, ice and cold you have also become considerably more potent.
"
1231,,600,HAG MOTHER ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Modus,"You have dabbled with the dhar and are too old and your abilities too powerful for other hags to question you. You are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, any dark magic you possess is boosted, and you are capable of a great many brutal spells. Despite this mastery of dark magic you remain uncorrupted by Chaos and your powers against them remain formidable. You can even remove Chaotic and daemonic taint from the souls of men with a ritual and, although a difficult and painful process that involves the afflicted drinking bear urine, you may even remove mutations from the bodies of these poor souls.

1232,,600,Slaughtermaster ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Modus,"The mere ranks of the Butchers can no longer contain your largeness. You’ve become a Slaughtermaster, one of the high priests of the Ogre race. Your Gut Magic is empowered to massively greater heights, along with any other eating or food related powers, as you reach a step just below the great Prophets of the Maw itself. Your abilities in combat, particularly with cooking utensils, increases to the point where you become something of a whirlwind of flying butcher blades and airborne limbs, snatching each dismembered body part from the air and cooking it as you fight. You are even able to ensure that your Gut Magic never misfires or results in disastrous castings for yourself. The Great Maw sees fit to give a little shielding to one of its favoured chefs. This role of course, also makes you into one of the most holy and respected figures in the Ogre Kingdoms, not the least due to the grand, delicious feasts you can whip up in a few minutes.

1233,,600,Incarnate of Da Great Green ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs and Goblins,Modus,"Power overflows out of the Waaagh! beyond anything any can recall when it comes to you. Emerald lightning, smoke, and flame have overtaken your eyes and your voice carries with it three tones. Other than these aesthetic effect, which you can turn off at will, you now have a full and complete mastery over the Greenskins racial exclusive magics to the point where you can utilize every spell known commonly to orcs and goblins. Your energies grow with the horde, tapping into the Waaagh! and every Greenskin identifies you as a living, breathing monument to their gods. Outside of the more obvious powers this passes on to you you may also quell the instinctive animosity of beings in your range and change willing intelligent beings into orcs and goblins. Unwilling beings can try to fight the powers of your spell but if they fail they’ll end up Snotlings or Squigs.

1234,,600,Everchild ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Modus,"What’s better than being as comely as the avatar of Isha? Being the avatar of Isha! Technically. You aren’t popping in and replacing Alarielle. You just, have most of the benefits without the authority or prestige of being Everqueen. Yes, you may take this even if you’re male. More importantly, what you can do. First, all spells you cast from the Lore of Life are supercharged. Healing mortal wounds with ease and resurrecting the recently dead to true life. Punching whole units of your foes in the groin with rapidly sprouting trees (yes, this is a spell). Also, for fluff purposes you get a minor version of Alarielle’s ability to alter your surrounding environment with your mood, which you can toggle on and off at will. Post-Jump, full stop, you might as well be Alarielle.

1235,,600,Traditional Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"At the core of the Mysterium is tradition, and learning to cast spells as the mages of old. You have studied these ancient teachings and found a way to draw a sympathetic connection between your own magic, and that of the long past. Whenever you perform a spell that you have studied extensively and that has been cast by someone else in the past, you may form a sympathetic connection to that previous casting, preventing your spell from being interrupted. So long as you are able to start casting the spell, it will continue to progress and take effect regardless of any interruptions that may occur. For example, if you began casting and someone were to punch you in the throat, preventing you from completing the necessary verbal component, the spell would discharge when you would have completed the spell had you not been interrupted. The spell however will be weakened by the lack of your own involvement, being less effective and having a shorter duration, but it will still occur. (Note; this does not protect your spell from being dispelled by another mage after it is cast, and it will still be nullified if cast within an antimagic field).
"
1236,,600,Resolved casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"Traditionally the determining factors of a spell’s ability to effect a target are the power of the caster and the mastery of their craft. You however have learned of a hidden X-­factor that allows mages of equivalent skill and power to overcome one another. Willpower. It may be a bit trite but you have discovered the means of reinforcing your spells effectiveness through sheer force of will. The stronger your willpower is, the more likely your spells will be to effect a target, overcoming any innate resistances or mystical safeguards they may have, as well as increasing the duration of your spells effect.
"
1237,,600,Unbound Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Modus,"By keeping yourself untethered, it seems that your magic has similar freedoms. Your magic does not seem to suffer the same ill effects of counterspells or anti­magic fields as other mages might. Regardless of the mystical circumstances, it seems that you will be able to cast your spells at full effect so long as you manage to complete them properly (note; You may still be stopped or interrupted during your casting, and some creatures still have innate resistance to magic which this does not bypass. Your magic will simply be unimpeded by any ambient effects or willful acts of countermagic.)"
1238,,600,Another Font Of Light ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Modus,"You know what’s both really useful and really hard to use? A ritual designed to bring you back from the dead that runs on the lifeblood of the people who killed you. I mean, you’re dead. They won. How are you supposed to ritually sacrifice someone stronger than you, while dead? It just doesn’t work, not without entirely too much time and resources devoted to just that. But, what if there was someone else? Someone untrained and ignorant, but with the same power that made you need the heavily defended princess? This ritual is designed to breach the walls of reality and call one such person to you. Make no mistake, they are ripe for the taking - but be wary. For they are also the perfect person to strike you down. Don’t give them that chance.
"
1239,,600,Playing the Wind ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"The language of magic is music - those feelings that stir in those who hear a well played song can attest to that. But it’s said that there were tunes that could even change the course of the world. You’ve at least been initiated into this hallowed art. You have learnt the art of infusing a bit of your own magical energy into your songs, allowing you to play magical songs. At first the effects will be environmental and more inclined towards influencing nature(such as calling storms, changing the direction the wind blows, or calling on friendly animals for assistance) or for discovering secrets(such as playing a tune to open hidden passages or make secret treasure ‘hum’)...but with greater practice and investment of magic energy you could play stronger songs that even influence the flow of time(Though to a limited extent, and such a spell would certainly leave most musicians out of breath and weary.) These effects are amplified by enchanted or legendary instruments, as well...though those would be a rare find in Hyrule at this time.
"
1240,,600,Ballad of the Champion ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"You’ve truly earned the title of your race’s hero! There were once five Champions gathered, the best that the races of Goron, Hylian, Zora, Rito and Gerudo could gather as the defenders of their kind. They were chosen for their one of a kind talent in both magic and combat - and you have that same spark of greatness. Within you now. You gain a few benefits from this, the first of which is your “Power.” This power is named for you, and has a unique but powerful magical ability on the level of those shown by the Champions of Hyrule - the kindness of Mipha becoming a healing power, the ferocious warrior spirit of Urbosa becoming an offensive spell to strike down giants, and the determination and grit of Daruk becoming a defense unbreakable by any attack Hyrule can bring to bear. In addition, You can ‘bless’ others with a somewhat limited version of your spell with your own consent. It’s limited chiefly by a ‘cooldown’ for those who aren’t yourself. Finally, if you have “Crème de la Crème” you are truly the successor to the original Champions of the people of Hyrule - you have achieved a level not only the peak of their potential, but noticeably past it! Enough to even surpass those storied heroes in their capabilities."
1241,,600,Song of the Fairies ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Modus,"They said there was once an Ocarina that, if the right tunes were played, would be able to work miracles to the point of being able to shape the flow of time. This is not that Ocarina - but it’s quite close to it. Any music played on this Ocarina has a way of enchanting the world around it, brave music empowering your allies, peaceful music soothing hostilities, and a frantic panicked song instilling fear. If actual musical magic were to be used with this, it’d be much much more effective.
"
1242,,600,The Second Oracle Of Ages ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"Well now, this is an odd one. Nayru comes from a long line of people who have the same name, look similar, and have the same powers. And interestingly enough, you seem to have joined that particular lineage? Or maybe you were just blessed by Nayru - the goddess, not the oracle - and gained power over Ages. The long and short of that power is that you can now time travel. Actually, this power seems to be utter crap at the small stuff. Anything less than a hundred years and it basically fizzes out. For more combat applicable uses, maybe try literally punching people into next tuesday? Or freezing them in time, that way you can use them as a coat rack!
"
1243,,600,Your Powers In My Hand ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Modus,"I find it interesting that the oracle blessed by wisdom has what I can only call the more powerful version of the time powers. Meanwhile, the oracle blessed by power has the one that must be used wisely to be useful at all. There’s probably a lesson in there somewhere. However, more to the point, Nayru never actually shows the ability to do half the stuff she does while possessed by Veran. Maybe she could always freeze time, or maybe Veran’s own power combined to allow her even more control over time? Regardless, the powers that you steal are almost always more powerful in your hands than in theirs - though that's more a surprising amount of skill and a lack of morals than actual power. As you can imagine, this pairs nicely with possession.
"
1244,,600,The Second Oracle Of Seasons ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Modus,"I’m... not sure how you’re managing to pull this off, but congratulations on your promotion. You were probably a wise woman or a minor priestess before, but now you are a fully fledged Oracle. Which is extremely odd, since Holodrum already has one. Ignoring that oddity, you now have the same power that she does. Simply snap your fingers or maybe give us a twirl and you can change the seasons in an instant. From Spring to Summer to Fall to Winter, or maybe even running in reverse. I’m sure that no one will panic if you do this. Oddly enough this also allows you to resist wide scale magic as you enforce the natural order of the seasons onto the world.
"
1245,,600,Demon Tribesman ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Modus,"Well now, it seems you’re no ordinary demon. Not a monster created by the king, or something left to fester in the dark places. Instead, you’re the same as Demise, a true and proper Demon. In truth, you’re a minor deity like the dragons, though one that stole power to ascend instead of being given it. As a result, you’re now a source of Malice, of hate and anger, rage and jealousy, and all those other deliciously dark and deviant emotions. This has a few uses that I’ve already mentioned, assisting in the casting of curses, reviving monsters, even turning weak fools into monsters or corrupting machinery to go from defender to destroyer. But as I said, you’re now a source of Malice. No relying on your king to bring you back or hiding away in the dark places until you grow powerful enough to step into the light. You have the raw hate to take the world by force.
"
1246,,600,The Goddess Walks The Earth ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Modus,"The name ‘Zelda’ means very little in the end, but every thousand years one of them is born with power born of wisdom. You are now one of them. But, with that said, the Goddess Hylia is all but forgotten and her legacy washed away by the Great Sea. How lucky for you then that the ‘Spirits of Good’ that the Lokomo serve seem to have blessed you in her stead. While previous eras had a talent for barriers and other defensive magics, you seem to have the ability to hijack magical effects for your own ends. The phantoms, while not particularly holy, are still ‘good’, and as such you can bend them to your will. Similarly, Zelda was able to use Lokomo tech herself, and even run it on her magical energy when Anjean wasn’t available.
"
1247,,600,Royal’s Wisdom ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"In these flooded lands, this ocean and it’s islands, there isn’t much in the way of magic left in the world. Most of what you’ll find is magic items - weapons and the like that have a special effect when magic is channeled through them. Things like the Deku Leaf, or the Fire and Ice Arrows. Still, just because magic is forgotten, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Where others must wield these magical weapons in order to use any magic at all, for you merely using them a few times is enough for you to use the magic yourself. Beware though, as your magical strength is not without limit.
"
1248,,600,Conqueror’s Power ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Modus,"You will often find that those without power will flock to the side of those with it. A suitably charismatic individual could be pure evil, but so long as they had enough power to back it up, their army and allies would remain theirs. You are one such individual. Compared to the others in this world, you are simply better. The spells you cast have more weight behind them, your sword blows hit harder, and your words resonate in people’s hearts. In all other aspects, your power is not as overwhelming, but you are still stronger than most everyone.
"
1249,,600,Sorcerer ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Modus,"Magic is rare in this time period, very few people possessing the ability to use it like you do. Using magical energy which replenishes slowly overtime or by consuming certain items, you have gained the ability to levitate, shoot elemental projectiles, create small but nearly impenetrable barriers, teleport short distances, slip through walls, summon simple weapons or armor and even change your appearance and shape to a degree. If you somehow gain more magical power, you’ll not only be able to increase the effect of these spells but will be able to pull off much more impressive feats- conjuring gigantic objects, making yourself massive or tiny, empowering or corrupting others and even transporting yourself between worlds are all things you could do, if only you had more power...
"
1250,,600,The Wise Man’s Teachings ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Modus,"You have kept the old ways, and ensured that the knowledge of sages is passed down - what’s more, using this power is now your right as the Wise man’s apprentice. You have learnt the spells Shield, Jump, Life, and Fairy with just this alone. All spells last approximately 5-10 minutes, before needing to be recast - in the case of “enchantments” such as Shield and Jump. Shield creates a mystical “armor” around your form that acts as invisible and weightless plate mail, turning otherwise mortal blows (or a full heart containers worth, for reference) into survivable hits. Jump allows you to leap twice your normal height and land with ease. Life allows you to restore the equivalent of 3 “Heart Container”’s worth of vitality to yourself. Fairy transforms you into a small fairy much like those that bless the hero link, giving small size and flight.

If you have 5 “Magic Containers” you also also know Fire, which allows you to fling powerful fireballs to defeat otherwise resistant foes. With 6, you learn Reflect, with works much like Shield but allows you to actively reflect magical attacks instead of giving greater defense. With 7, you can learn the Spell, which transforms the weak willed and unintelligent around you into slimy beasts. With 8, you learn Thunder, a powerful attack that creates a localized and violent rain of lightning bolts around you - striking all enemies around you with the power of the heavens.

Finally, you are able to teach all these spells to others - though the Magic Container (or equivalent magical talent) limitation is still in place.

"
1251,,600,Shockingly Dynamic ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"How are you doing that? The Paths and spells of sorcery are meant to be self contained. Yet, for some reason, you can combine different paths and spells for more complicated and powerful effects than should be possible. It’s significantly harder than it would be for an Awakened mage doing Sphere magic, but the fact that you can do it at all is fascinating. In future worlds, you will be able to combine different kinds of magic in much the same way, as long as they aren’t diametrically opposed anyway.
"
1252,,600,The Ritual Congregation ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"You are a true master of leading groups of sorcerers in joint works. If you know a kind of magic, and you can gain the assistance of others who do as well, then you and your allies can perform ceremonies to enact spells that are not only more powerful than any of you could have performed alone, but more powerful than a single magician with the combined power of the group could have, by a significant margin. Even magicless assistants can help, so long as they’re willing and able to follow instructions. This applies to other forms of magic with joint spells as well, though those without magical abilities may not be able to assist, depending on the form of magic. Up to one-hundred people may be included with such ceremonies.
"
1253,,600,The Traditional Way ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Modus,"Unlike true mages, sorcerers cannot use their powers effortlessly, or without foci. As a jumper, however, you will - or have - likely acquire means of sidestepping the requirements of sorcery, and other powers as well. With this perk, you may not want to. For every requirement that you can forgo but don’t, the power is 10% more effective. This applies to other powers as well.
"
1254,,600,Master of Magic,TES: Magic,Modus,"All magic comes to Nirn through the sun, a massive hole in the
sky that leads to the realm of Aetherius. It is an integral part of everything, but with your
mastery of Mysticism, you can break that link. That's right, you can temporarily shut
down a person's ability to cast magic, no matter what kind it may be. You could even
disenchant artifacts of great power with a snap. Though, you could also use this to
greatly enhance the magic of another, supercharging their spells with your own energy
to such an extent that few could ever match."
1255,,600,Master of the Elements,TES: Magic,Modus,"I see you have devoted yourself to the School of
Destruction, a wise choice should you find yourself frequently on the battlefield. Through
countless battles, you have refined your spell work to such an extent that damaging
spells are thrice as powerful, with their effects lasting twice as long. And while the
greatest enemy to a mage is those who are capable of resisting magic, they are of no
concern to you. Indeed, your spells are now capable of ignoring magic resistances in
their entirety. Let them feel your wrath."
1256,,600,Nightwielder ,The Elder Scrolls,Modus,"You have learned the signature magic of Azra Nightwielder, Shadow Magic, which grants abilities outside the normal schools of magic. By using this magic, you can create objects and familiars of pure shadow, teleport short distances by slipping through the cracks of reality, hide yourself in the tatters of space-time to evade the notice of everything around you, and much more."
1257,,600,Anti-Magic ,Generic Magical Girl,Modus,"You can just shut down any magic less powerful than your own. Attacks vanish, curses break, animated statues stop moving, and spells in progress stop dead. If the source of the magic is stronger than you, you'll still manage to disrupt it a little, but you won't be able to break it completely unless it's a very delicate spell. Starts out weak, but as with other powers gains strength with practice. Tires you out a lot to use it, you can only manage this once a day at the start."
1258,,600,Creative Solutions ,The Dragon Prince,Modus,"Whether you choose the path of Dark or Primal Magic, or both, a great wizard is not one who bludgeons the world with his power, but one who has the perfect tool for any situation, and failing that can adapt their spells to match. Your creativity in using spells for new things, and setting up situations where they can be used to greatest effect, is outstanding."
1259,,600,Mana Affinity ,World Seed,Modus,"In Neolife, all things possess affinities, sentient races included. Druids, and those using the same skills, cultivate those same affinities by cycling mana of the affinity they want to gain between themselves and a source of said mana, and manipulating their mana to match it. As they increase their affinities, they will see bonuses such as being able to cultivate passively, control whatever the affinity represents, and even develop a resistance to their affinity, as their passive control grows to protect them from its expressions. Meanwhile, people who do not develop their affinities simply have them hovering around somewhere below the first useful threshold, 5%, as they choose to focus their attention elsewhere.

But there is a third option to take here. Anyone may choose to strip away all of their affinities, which would normally be a lengthy and complicated process in and of itself. But for sacrificing their ability to possess and gain affinities, they would instead get an affinity for pure, unattributed mana. Now, since you already paid the cost of this new affinity in other ways, there is no need for you to give up your other affinities, so we can jump straight into the explanation of what this actually means for you. While it won’t let you control anything new (anyone can already control mana without any affinity, after all), you will get a reduction on magic costs equal to your affinity. So with the affinity at 10%, your spells would cost 10% less mana. And if you managed to get it to 100%, you would be able to cast magic for no cost to yourself entirely, as you could command all the mana in the world around you to access a virtually unlimited supply of it. This would let you rain spells upon your enemies incessantly, create high-level enchantments without having to resort to mana gems, and even use time magic to travel forwards or backwards in time for more than a few seconds.

You’ll also find the control you have over mana increases as your affinity does, making it far easier to actually cast all those complicated spells. Another bonus is your ability to create Mana Gems, the only objects in the universe not aligned to any element, but rather, you probably guessed it already, pure mana. Even though they might not be of much use for you, since mana costs will soon be a thing of the past when it comes to yourself, they are for most other people, who would gladly pay a lot for them."
1260,,600,Fallen Goddess ,Konosuba,Modus,"You didn’t come down to this world without picking up a bit of extra spark along the way. You’re a former Goddess now, a divine being that has lost a large portion of its power but still retains incredible abilities and varied powers. Just for being what you are, your beginning stats in this world are far higher, equal to an end game adventurer. You are also able to draw magical energy from any who worship you in this world, though this particular trait won’t persist past this world without a certain perk. As a Goddess, you also have a series of purviews over which you hold divine power. You may pick up to three different things to hold power over, such as Water, Luck or The Arts. You’ll find yourself blessed in regards to these things, effortlessly skilled in anything relating to them and with vastly more power when you use magic associated with your purviews. You also have an innate affinity to your purviews which may provide passive abilities, such as being immune to heat damage if you pick Fire. You will also choose whether you are a good or evil Goddess, though this won’t affect your actual morality. Instead it will give you either a Holy or Unholy attribute, respectively. You’ll gain an immensely powerful aura for which attribute you choose, such that a Holy Goddess could kill high level undead with a single tear due to the holy energy infused within or badly harm them with a touch. It will empower any Holy or Unholy abilities greatly too. Lastly, buying this will boost any capstone perks or items that you purchase, as detailed in the notes section at the end of this document."
1261,,600,The Path of Explosions! ,Konosuba,Modus,"In your heart of hearts, you know the life you were born for. A flash of light, a thunderous noise, the pressure wave, the great heat and total destruction at the centre. Explosions are love, explosions are life, and explosions are all you need. You’ve got this same love for the Explosion spell or, if you’re some kind of heretic, another spell. For you this spell is just on a different level to anyone else. The power you have for it is a hundred times the normal amount at least, so that even a single digit levelled adventurer could match a boss in the high 80s or 90s when comparing the same spell between the two of them. The costs for that one spell, whether in mana or materials, are negligible. Your love for it is such that you could cast it at least a dozen times a day. The spell will continue to improve as you use it too, never having an upper limit and slowly growing in all aspects as you keep using it. Brighter, hotter, louder and more destructive. Finally, as a sign of your true dedication to the Path, you may induct other people onto the path as well, being able to teach your spell easily to anyone with even a basic amount of mana and share a small portion of this perks abilities with them."
1262,,600,Holy Hexes ,Konosuba,Modus ,"Spells becoming more powerful isn’t just a matter of having more mana, at least not in this world. Upgrading those spells more with Skill Points is usually the main path. At least if you can be bothered, which it seems you’ve skipped past entirely. Magic that you use now scales to your general level of power, regardless of how much points or energy you put into it. If you cast a fireball you learnt at level 1, using the same amount of energy, but were a level 80 wizard when you cast it now? You’d be summoning a conflagration that could consume half a town instead of a mid-sized fireball attack. Even things as simple as a low level voice changing spell could become a spell that allows the target to freely make any sound they wanted, rather than just a single different voice. You can still expend energy or points to improve spells, provided the spell can be improved in such ways, even more but their base level of power will rise alongside your own general power level."
1263,,700,Russian User,Medaka Box Abnomral Jumpchain,Modus,"Time is a matter of perspective. As is cause and effect. And most things really. You’ve learnt to play
havoc with that perspective, twisting things around to have a little bit more fun. You are able to
reverse actions and situations between two individuals that you can see, including yourself. By
announcing that the situation is different because you are ‘In Soviet Russia...” you are able to swap
the positions or status of two people. You could cause the wounds one person has dealt to another
to be reflected back to them with the original victim healed even from death. Someone who has
been captured or imprisoned by another person is suddenly the captor themselves. A villain who has
stolen the power of a hero now finds the hero holds all the power of both parties. "

Draw a painting with a town on fire, and it will be so. Enthrall an enemy in a genjutsu in which they melt? Somehow, someway, it will happen. Canonically, this comes with a weakness in the form of the user developing a stronger personality that can potentially overtake the main, but since you’re paying with CP, that doesn’t affect you unless you want it to. Should you choose to retain the personality, it will come with certain benefits. Your secondary personality will instead be your ally, and will defend your mind against attempts to enter.

Without you this very thing or idea does not exist within whatever worlds you find yourself, the primordial of strength could never be beaten in a test of strength and all who would wield it do so at its discretion. A being of dream would be both the mantle, all its endless worlds, and every part of its story;  one of death would not be just as the grim reaper, but the existential dread of endings. You could be the very thing of time itself and thereby alter its nature, as you are its nature. You can not select something as broad as The World or Matter but Time, Space, Life, Death, Land, Sea are all options , but so are smaller concepts such as being the embodiment of a specific river or a specific star or the concept of stars themselves. The more power you have the greater influence that power has within the worlds and if there are other beings that act as this embodiment in future worlds you may replace, war with, coexist, or subvert them as you see fit, always carrying your concept with you. Due to your influence over this concept you can materialize it as you wish freely; bottle up hope, lightning, or time, wield victory as a banner, shine the light of day upon the secrets of the world, or manifest dreams into reality only limited by your power. As an embodiment you hold the characteristics of your concept and you can no more be harmed by anything that could not destroy your very concept itself. The more specific your concept the greater the influence and power this concept holds and you hold over it; and if you held both a major domain over and embodiment of a single concept you would have absolute power and control in that aspect or realm."

1267,,700,Chaos Magic,Marvel: What If...?,Modus ,"Sometimes hidden talent just needs a catalyst. Like Wanda Maximoff, exposure to the Mind Stone has awakened your latent magical talents, combining to form something brand new. Your fledgling power will initially manifest as telekinesis and telepathy, but time and training will reveal how expansive your power really is. Chaos magic is even more versatile than the Eldritch magic used by the sorcerers of Kamar-Taj, letting you mimic their feats of levitation, astral projection, and conjuration. But all of this pales in comparison to your true potential. At their apex, your powers allow you to warp reality itself to your desires, changing objects and people around you to better fit your vision of the world. This could be as subtle as manipulating the probability around an unexploded bomb or as incredible as warping an entire town to your liking. Even the spontaneous creation of life is within your abilities, though much work remains if you wish to truly master this power. Perhaps you can find a teacher or text that can help you hone your great and terrible gifts."
1268,,800,The High Priest,Worm CYOA v17,Modus,"Eidolon was considered to be the strongest parahuman to ever exist, rivalled only by the Fairy Queen. During his life, his powers continually weakened, but don't worry--that's not a problem for you. With this perk, you gain a pool of nearly infinite superpowers, and the ability to reserve four incredibly potent powers, or five weaker, but still fairly powerful, abilities. While you can swap them out at will, you don't have the abilty to choose which powers you get, only that they assist with whatever you need help with, and they take a couple minutes to reach full strength. Building just collapsed? Fly over and apply a localized field to reverse time. Your opponent is too tough? Just grab a matter erasure beam! Even turning yourself into a super-genius is possible. These powers average around a 9 on the PRT threat scale, but can scale upwards depending on your needs--like containing an explosion powerful enough to destroy India. Should you purchase this perk, you'd find yourself on even footing with a weakened Entity if you were to battle. Not for long, though. You'd still die."
1269,,800,Eternal Eternal Life,Medaka Box Abnomral Jumpchain,Modus,"Life just moves on, you know? You can’t expect things to stay the same forever, with people never
leaving you and the world never changing. Not if you want to call yourself a healthy human being. The power to make things stay the same is in your hands now. You are able to make ever-lasting, static or permanent anything you touch or are involved with. You could make someone’s love for
you never change no matter what you did or did not do, the trees you touch would never lose their
leaves nor grow old, a water droplet that floated in the air would remain so for as long as you
wished and those you turned your wrath on would remain injured forever by daring to rouse you. So
long as you can make physical contact with the target or something physical the target is connected
primarily to, you can make all or part of it permanent and never changing. "
1270,,800,Afarkaup Avarkostir,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Modus," Everything has a price in Norse mythology, and there is no means around that, but the price is sometimes negotiable or able to be paid by others, and you have already paid a great price it seems and in return this gift. The cost for you will be reduced by an order of 3 and your gains will be increased by an order of 3. The cost of what? Anything within reason really. If you went to purchase a cow for 50 gold, you'd hand over 17 gold and get 3 cows instead or one cow that was 3 times better. How does that work; like, where do the extra cows come from? Seriously, just roll with it.  If you were crafting a sword it would take up a third of the material and you might get three copies of it; it would take a third of the time to craft and be of three times higher quality. You can not cycle items this way by repurchasing something that has been acquired, enhanced, multiplied, or made through this, but god help the money markets as it's still fairly exploitable.  Working out for an hour will take 20 minutes and only a third of the stamina and provide growth as if you worked out for three hours and received 3 times the gains per hour. While it can never reduce your cp cost, purchasing things like levels in an rpg setting with exp, items, or cp  will grant you 3 times the amount, it functions as you please either in a gestalt fashion or increasing your capacity for hard limits and levels by an order of 3. You will receive 3 of any item purchased with cp. The costs you pay are now indifferent to the specifications, if you make a contract with a demon for your soul, you can substitute in anyone else's unless there are other stipulations like a powerful or good soul,  if the specifications are for unique items or things so rare they might as well be, you may all but ignore such specificities with even a glancing notion of an attempt for equivalency ( a deal for the strongest soul in the universe, you could just go grab the soul of a random guy just getting into bodybuilding or a gym rat.) A deal for your life? Okay, I have this slave here you can use as you wish for 1/3rd of each day or here is 1% of the life force from 100 people under my rule or power. The ability to substitute is in direct proportion to how specific the deal is meant to be, how rare the thing being paid is, and how personal it is to you; something like gold you may MAY be able to switch out for jewels gemstones and other currencies if the dealer isn't a stickler but you could not switch out for fool's gold and receive the benefits of this perk, an heirloom magic necklace thats been in your family for generations could be switched out for a necklace of similar craft and make containing some magic blessings. This will not stop people from noticing a substitution has been made or getting miffed about it, but the deal will be considered valid if you try to stay within reason."
1271,,800,Ikomiki,Bleach,Modus,"There have been Hollows as long as there have been souls. Despair, loneliness, rage, death, it’s all
part of the human condition. Life and death entwined together, for millions of years. Just as there
are souls who still live from those ancient days, there are also Hollows that yet remember the
primordial world. And what horrors those creatures are.

As originally such a being or one who managed to take on their traits else-ways, you are a primordial
Hollow with innate potential far beyond any normal member of the species. An avatar of their
evolutionary force, your potential for evolution is limitless. There are no barriers or limits to your
progress, in evolution or hollow powers or other methods of growing through consumption, and
certainly no need to judge your progress by the stages of a menos. You cease to devolve as a result
of this, the souls you eat unnaturally silent and submissive once digested. By devouring a soul, you voraciously tear away all that is useful and make it part of your being. Their
power is added to yours in full, their abilities or unique spiritual traits combine with your own. An
innate mastery of one’s form, a natural thing for any true Hollow, allows these traits to be
manifested as pleased without becoming an incompetent, misshapen blob of meat. Indeed, as your
power progresses, you’ll be able to shape your form to your will from the different components of
your preyed on souls. Even the abilities of other races can be absorbed, from the Zanpakuto of a
Shinigami becoming slaved to your will or even the fragments of the Soul King slowly transforming
you into something closer to royalty.
It’s also possible, with some physical contact, to pass on some of what you’ve eaten to other hollows. Raw souls or even unique absorbed abilities, enabling the quick creation of a powerful army of
monsters. All the more useful, with how common the creation of new Hollows becomes in the wake
of your rampages.

Note: Requires Hollow to purchase."
1272,,800,Chaos Magic,Marvel Zombies,Modus ,"You possess the powers of the Scarlet Witch, but the expertise comes separately. The Demonic Elder God Chthon came to you at birth and imbued your infant form with vast amounts of mystical energy. You are a bona fide reality warper. The easiest way to use your powers is to create probability-manipulating “Hex Bolts'' that'll cause strange, unfortunate events to happen to whoever or whatever you direct them towards. This could be anything. A bucket could fall onto the heads of your foes, superpowers could fizzle out, or a chasm could spontaneously swallow them up. But you are capable of much, much more. Or at least, something like that. Control over virtually all types of energy, elemental powers, future sight, invisibility, telekinesis, limited time manipulation, and so, so much more. You can do pretty much whatever you want, though you won’t be able to reenact M-Day on a whim, nor can you wish away the zombie apocalypse. You might be able to pull it off in time, but during this jump? No. Nor can you give yourself superpowers. And while your powers are extremely versatile, they have their weaknesses. You’re no more durable than you were before, so if you’re a regular person, a punch might still lay you out. And don’t forget about the mental health problems Wanda suffered. While you aren’t the equal of the Scarlet Witch, but if you put in the hours, you will be."
1273,,800,The Great Magician,The God of High School Jump,Modus ,"The great spirit of all true Magicians around the world and throughout history. The Great Magician imbues it’s wielder with the ability to wield true magic, not just specific supernatural powers. Still reliant on the user’s life energy, the range of effects this Charyeok is able to achieve is unmatched. Starting with the creation and manipulation of all the elements, it covers everything from teleportation, transmutation, illusions, summoning and alchemy. The Great Magician will work with its new partner to teach you the arts of magic but it will take time and effort to become worthy of the title Magician."
1274,,800,Pandora,The God of High School Jump,Modus ,"The box from which a woman in the ancient past released all the evil in the world. Pandora was filled with such hate that that woman felt from being tricked by the Gods into opening that box and thus became the Second Key, the second weapon to strike down the Gods in the sky. The Charyeok is immensely powerful even without its Key nature. It grants the user enough physical enhancement that a Bishop class Nox agent was able to handily defeat one of the legendary 9 Demon Kings. Whilst your boost will not yet be on that level, you will certainly be able to match a Bishop from the first moment. Pandora can generate almost any kind of poison or disease, both in the air and directly within the bodies of those the user can see. It can even force others around the user to experience any sort of hallucination the user desires. Pandora grants the powers of telekinesis and telepathy, even across dimensions, as well as the power to create strong force fields for defence. The Charyeok is even able to summon an armour that increases the user’s physical abilities even more, with a second stage to go even further.

The greatest abilities of Pandora however, are what it gains from its status as the Second Key. Unlike the First Key, Pandora cannot work on more than one target, only being able to unseal one being from the Taboo that the user can see at a time. However, it is also able to seal away powers, leaving the user with only their physical abilities, albeit they may be supernaturally great still, instead of any divine abilities or Charyeok. This sealing may also be used to reflect any attack away from the user and back at the attackers, though both this and the power sealing effect may fail if the foe is too far above the user’s power level.

The Final ability of this Charyeok is The Hope- Sovereignty. Within a small area and for a very limited time, the user gains a great deal of control over the laws of physics and causality. With this, one could prevent attacks from being fired or nullify the abilities of others to manipulate physics in a similar way. This ability seems unable to be used to attack others, only change or nullify things. When active, it creates 3 angelic wings on the user’s right side and one on their left."
1275,,800,Curious Cat ,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Modus ,"So there is another. You are now a being much like the Curious Cat and able to do all they can, a rather wide range of abilities. You can calm a person by sharing a piece of your heart. In the Ever After only you can even let someone decide if they want to keep doing their role now or chose to ascend, even able to assign them a new purpose. You can teleport in quick burst of movement resulting in you turning into purple and blue polygons as you travel (or colors you choose now or are fitting for you, or in a bright flash of light that teleports you and nearby people to a completely different area. You can turn and remain invisible, selectively make body parts visible, such as eyes, mouth, and face markings. The upper and lower halves of your body can split off and reconnect easily, and you can even levitate. Beams of energy can also be shot by you, able to catapult someone several meters. Finally and what might be your most... dreaded ability is that you can forcefully possess anyone that is hollow on the inside and has given into despair."
1276,,800,UnEquivalent Exchange: Coverous Jumper,Avesta of Black and White,Modus ,"A power reminiscent of a now long-lost star. Yours is the power to gain something via losing something else. By sacrificing and spending your riches, you can gain even more riches. While the usage of this power requires you to keep giving up things to receive more power and fortune in return, it also makes it so that there is no true loss as long as you are concerned. In fact, instead, you end up with more than you lost before.

Even a Star Spirit with this trait could decide to drain dry their own Stellar Body and its people, and instead of getting weaker, they would get stronger. Similarly, you could also trade injuries in a fight for receiving special powers, or subtracting those from your enemies. Perhaps something like losing an arm would see you stealing your foe’s arm and gaining some of their abilities.

Of course, there is a limit to this. You cannot give up your own existence in hopes of gaining something greater, as there would be no one left to receive the resulting blessing from such expenditure."
1277,,800,Will of the King: Big Bang,Avesta of Black and White,Modus ,"A rare quality that could be called a Miracle in itself. You now possess an ‘ego’ that surpasses even the Avesta and could stand toe to toe with God herself. A desire to overthrow the God of the world (Truth) and impose a new Law into the cosmos, giving birth to a new universe. Not only is this a special disposition that is no longer tainted by the current Law, but also a special quality of your soul. That is, you have the qualifications for sitting on the Divine Throne, and spreading your Law by undergoing an apotheosis and becoming a God.

As you are now, this untapped potential seems to be of little use. But with time, as long as you attune to your deepest craving, you may potentially begin to challenge this world in multiple ways, such as ignoring or limiting the effects of contradicting a Commandment, even negating the entire Law of the Avesta and Commandments all-together in a certain area. Eventually, you may ascend into godhood and challenge the current order. That is, you will start to emanate, repainting the world with your own color. And if your strength proves to be as great or greater than that of the current God, you may also dig into the Singularity, challenging them for the right to dye the entirety of creation with your color.

However, this is not something that you can do immediately in most cases. Depending on your craving, the path to activate your Law and become a full-fledged God may require a costly undertaking, such as Sirius’ Paradise Lost requiring him to save ‘everyone’ personally before being able to fully emanate.

And just like the Covetous Dragon, you can also decide to prevent yourself from emanating by not following your desire, but once you realize it you won't be able to stop yourself. At least not just with this potential. And that might be a wise decision if you aren’t strong enough yet to challenge the sitting Godhead.

It may even be possible that your own actions, should they lead you to take a path that goes against your own Law, such as taking a Commandment that goes against your very own ideal existence, may make it impossible to fully emanate until you fully accept your own craving and discard the other limitations.

By default, this craving is manifested as a Hegemony type.

However, you may also decide to be self-centered beyond reason, and instead of seeking to change the world, seek to reach your own ideal self. Thus, you may decide to take the path of Transcendence and instead become a Transcendence God. You won’t be able to emanate, but you will also be able to use the power of the Big Bang, or as it will be known in other eras, Taikyoku or Atziluth. Be advised that Transcendence Gods may only manifest in multiverses, as they are a living universe, they cannot exist in those universes, like that of Ahura Mazda, where only a single universe exists, for those who follow this path cannot replace the Godhead."

Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects.

1279,,800,Comedian ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Modus ,"You have perhaps the most versatile and powerful technique of all, the ability to change reality itself with your thoughts. There is, however, one catch required to activate it – whatever you want to achieve with this technique, you have to think it’ll be funny. You can’t cheat this requirement: attempting to bypass it through mind controlling yourself or pretending you find something funny will completely fail. Losing confidence in yourself will also cause this technique to falter. However, so long as you genuinely think something will be humorous, regardless of what others think, you’ll be able to make it real. Naturally, because of this it’ll likely need a certain personality type to get the most use of it.

For example, even if you were hit by an attack that should leave you as little more than a bloody paste, if you think it’d be funny to crawl out of the crater it leaves unharmed, that’s what would happen. Similarly, having yourself spontaneously covered in sauce to have punches slip right off you or summoning a harisen to bat away projectiles are also possible, though these are both incredibly small examples, a shadow of what this technique is truly capable of."
1280,,800,Born With It,DxD Universe,Modus ,"You know, limits exist for a reason, well whatever, much like Tobio Ikuse you are just born with everything unlocked or at least the first stage, for example picking a sacred gear would come with its balance breaker immediately unlocked, this does come with the drawback that if you use this transformation not only does your stamina goes down fast, but you go into a blind rage, that said if you unlock this ability in the normal way the drawbacks disappear and you get the next stage, once you unlock a stage the normal way you will get the next with the drawbacks applied instantly. An example would be if you went Super Saiyan 2 you would immediately unlock Super Saiyan 3, and once you unlock Super Saiyan 3 the normal way you will immediately get Super Saiyan 4.

As a second effect you also tend to arrive to those stages very quickly, you would be considered a unmatched prodigy by pretty much everyone when it comes to unlocking new forms"
1281,,800,Action Commands,Asura’s Wrath,Modus ,"The ability to win all comes down to timing and guts. You have a sense for the dramatic, and can shift an encounter from slugfest to high­-cinematic choreography. You can awe continents with your feats.

If you would be faced by a dramatic challenge you would be otherwise just barely manage to overcome, or even just barely fail to do so, you either summon the strength to do so, or you surpass it with heaven-­shaking effect. Both results depending on how dramatic it is (based on your relative ability to what you’re facing).

The limit of this perk is your innate capability­ and if you hit all your cues, and there's enough dramatic tension in the air, it lets you surpass that limit in grand style. It will not let you accomplish patently impossible feats, however.

Failing to hit those marks means you’ll take some damage though, and you’ll have to build back up to the right dramatic moment..

1282,,800,Power of Svarog ,Dial,Modus ,"With the Power of Svarog perk, you gain the immense powers associated with the deity Svarog. Svarog is often revered as a god of fire, creation, and craftsmanship, and with this perk, you become a conduit for his divine abilities. This grants you access to a number of abilities. The first of which is pyrokinesis. You have the ability to manipulate and control fire with your mind. You can generate flames, shape them into various forms, and project them as powerful projectiles or defensive barriers. Your control over fire is highly precise, allowing you to manipulate its intensity, temperature, and shape. You can unleash devastating infernos or create delicate flames for illumination or precision tasks. Your mastery of pyrokinesis enables you to use fire both as a weapon and a tool, providing you with versatile capabilities.

Second, you possess unparalleled skill in the art of crafting and forging. You can create magnificent weapons, armor, and other objects of great power and beauty. Your craftsmanship is infused with divine energy, imbuing your creations with extraordinary properties and enchantments. The items you forge are exceptionally durable, resistant to damage, and possess unique abilities tailored to your desires. With your divine smithing abilities, you can create legendary artifacts and bring forth masterpieces that surpass the craftsmanship of any mortal. Third, you gain the power to shape and manipulate matter and life force. You can create and mold objects or organisms according to your will, breathing life into inanimate matter or altering existing life forms. Your abilities extend to healing, allowing you to mend injuries, cure ailments, and restore vitality to the wounded. You can also bring forth new life, whether it be through creating beings or rejuvenating ecosystems. Your power over creation and life enables you to reshape the world around you and bring about profound changes.

Fourth, as a bearer of Svarog’s power, you become exceptionally resilient and immune to the harmful effects of fire and heat. You can withstand extreme temperatures, including scorching flames and molten lava, without suffering harm. Additionally, your body possesses enhanced durability and regenerative abilities, allowing you to recover from injuries at an accelerated rate. Your divine resilience grants you the ability to survive in hostile environments and endure the most intense battles. The Power of Svarog perk grants you mastery over fire, divine craftsmanship, creation, and resilience. With these abilities, you become a formidable force, capable of shaping the world around you and wielding the powers of the divine. Embrace the essence of Svarog and unleash the might of fire and creation upon your adversaries."
1283,,800,Staff of One,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Modus ,"Part of Dormammu’s rise to power, this staff is bonded to you, popping out your chest whenever you bleed a little and say a short incantation. “When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge.” The staff has the power to do anything... once. Well, except “Become God” and variants because Dormammu already did that.

For those lacking the gift of magic, or very new, the Staff responds only to one-word commands. “Freeze” “Burn” “Teleport” and so on. Duplicating a spell you’ve already used once causes a random magical effect. You can get around this to an extent by using different languages, but not if the words are the same or very similar. Mystics can use whole phrases, drastically opening up their options and doing less literal things, like forcing someone to follow a scripted timeline with “the show must go on.” They can also use the staff to levitate themselves at will, which is a nice side bonus. 

Each new Jump, the staff will forget all commands given to it in one (1) language of your choice."
1284,,800,Chaos Magic ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Modus ,"You possess a power similar to that of Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch. Part probability manipulation, part energy control and manipulation, and part reality warping. The easiest way of thinking about it is probably as low level reality warping. It has performed a wide range of effects, but is ultimately extremely difficult to control precisely, requiring intense concentration, and it does have limits to its powers. At its simplest you pointand will, and let reality change in a way that reflects your desires. This is simplest for destructive purposes; altering something in a random manner is usually destructive. Even so this quick and slap dash use can be used for other purposes; such as willing a dying person to stay alive. But if you want to control exact effects you will need to focus and prepare the energies with a specific intent, and cause more controlled effects such as the controlled implosion of a building. This power can do a large amount of things - calming magical storms, affecting radioactive half-lives, disrupting machinery, flash aging objects, turning ice instantly into steam, cause the fighter craft of space pirates suddenly jerk in other directions to crash into their allies, and nearly endless possibilities - but it is extremely difficult to control, and runs the risk of backfiring, creating an effect that is actively detrimental to you.

Coupled with a means to sense or feel energies, this power can be highly effective at energy manipulation, working to bridge the gap between different forms of magical energy such as the Celtic gods and the Asgardian fire demon Surtr, drain energy from beings, disrupt energy connections, and break mind control by disrupting the mental energies used to create them. This energy disruption can also make for useful counterspells, disrupting others’ attempts at spell working.

This power is limited. You must be able to directly and firmly sense your target, usually this means see it, and you must actively direct the energy; typically this is with your hands. It cannot create true life. It is possible to block it with technological means, as shown by Ultron’s protective shielding specifically against it, and some energies may prove too exotic for you to easily affect. Its power is also influenced by your mental state. It is possible to push it above normal levels in a state of madness, helping to force reality to follow your delusional beliefs, but this increases the difficulty for fine control.

With external boosts it would be possible to use this power as more full form reality warping. But you would not have the raw power needed to create Nazi soldiers, summon Dormammu, or create a Kree battleship and invasion force from thin air with just this. This power does synergize well with magic which can sometimes be used to boost it to higher effect - though even Wanda’s sorcerous training and powers would not normally bring it to the level of creating even simulacra of soldiers. Replicating the events of House of M would require a rather substantial external power source, and it’s worth remembering the House of M reality was inherently unstable and nearly self-destructed due to it, and threatened to damage the multiverse as well in the process."
1285,,800,Aspect,League of Legends,Modus ,"Your power is, in the most literal way, heavenly. Blessed by one of the aspects of Targon, you possess fantastic magical powers, themed around celestial objects. Whether your powers are themed around belts of asteroids, constellations, or something like the sun or the moon are up to you. All aspects of your physical person are enhanced, giving you incredible strength, speed and agility.

1287,,800,Id_es,Fate/Extra CCC,Modus ,"How dirty. Not even pretending you’re following the rules, are you? It is unclear on how you have obtained such a thing, but now you get the option to obtain one of the so-called “id_es” skills, complete cheats made by transforming and empowering a skill into complete absurdity, to the point they could rightfully be called cheat skills. If you want, you may pick one of the existing id_es skills shown. From Passionlip’s Trash & Crush which can reduce and compress anything at all into a 5x5x5 gray cube, even the mass of the target being reduced to 1/10th of what it was, evolved from the Skill ‘Monstrous Strength’. Perhaps you want the All Drain, which lets Meltryllis absorb anything with a solid form she can inject her “honey” into, stealing the target’s abilities, power, and self, and maybe even turn others into copies of you, evolved from the Skill ‘Absorption’. Perhaps you’ll want Crack Ice, letting Violet completely paralyze anything within her field of sight, although it won’t extend to stopping the minds of your targets.

If you possess some other ability you are fond of, you may choose to transform and empower that ability instead, elevating it into a similar level of absurdity as the examples given. Well, these skills aren’t unbeatable. Meltryllis was defeated by tricking her into absorbing a poison developed from her own virus, and Trash & Crush will take longer than an instant against objects larger than a Sakura Labyrinth floor, so pay attention to what kind of id_es you obtain, and keep in mind any weaknesses."
1288,,800,Sympathetic Magic ,Libriomancer,Modus,"Like effects like. That which is a part of something may impact the whole. This is the core of all magical theorems and you have come to understand this to a degree others cannot. By taking a small piece of something (or a suitably constructed symbolic representation) you can affect the main body or others like it. Attaching a vampire's fang to a yo­yo could let you send other nearby vampires spinning back and forth. Channeling magic through a narrow straw creating compressed air could let you create localized gale force winds. You could create tracking devices or communicators using locks of your hair, and similarly find a target by having something that they held dear or was once a part of them. Just remember that you are ultimately covered under the same sympathetic clauses as your magic."

You are a true sorcerer, able to “see” or “feel” or “sense” magic as is appropriate to your chosen medium. For Bi Wei it was starlight, for Ponce de Leon, wind. Who knows what it is for you. In any case you are able to draw upon the power of magic in very nearly all of its various forms. While not capable of the specific applications of magic such as libriomancy, bardic music or sanguimancy you can generally dabble and control magical energies of all sorts to some extent. More specifically you have the most general powers of your envisioned “wizard” able to communicate across great distances to pre­created scrying mirrors, teleport short distances or fly as you please. Cause heavy objects to become light, light objects to become heavy and lift and throw both of them with magic. Heal most wounds, unravel violent spells and turn them back on their caster or simply deliver raw concussive force as needed. Don’t even start me on your ability to go unnoticed in crowds, transform magically unprotected individuals into newts or turn a letter opener into a broadsword. You’re a sorcerer now ­ subject only to the amount of magic you can channel and your imagination.

1290,,850,High Magic,80s Sword and Sorcery,Modus,"The heights of sorcery and wizardry. You are a highly skilled mage now, at least in the field of your choice. And highly skilled as you are, you can still progress further, in skill, knowledge, and power, this is merely your beginning, but you will know a variety of spells in the field, ranging from relatively weak to terrifyingly powerful. This magic will make you a potential challenge to a sword wielding hero, and allow you to rather easily dominate an average warrior in battle, but you are not a god yet, and a mortal man could defeat you with luck and cunning on his side. Still it grants you a breadth of utility which a protagonist can only dream of. Regardless of your initial choice, though, you can learn and obtain mastery of the entire field with time.

● Battle Magic: You have learned magic intended for direct combat uses. Spells which would blast or destroy foes, balls of fire, bolts of lightning, protective shields of energy, and even magic to bind and constrict enemies fall here, as do evocations and creations of magical energy or clouds of fog and mist. You will find that possessing this magic along with teleportation makes it easier to summon objects to you.

● Enchantment: Magic to influence the mind is yours to command. Whether it is merely a trance in which they obey without a thought, spells to create love and affection, or corrupt the will. This has some overlap with Illusion as you can beguile the senses, though it is harder and less precise images than with Illusion; though if combined they will be superior to either alone.

● Necromancy: Yours is magic to command the dead. Raising the dead as undead legions even from afar and summoning ghosts fall in this field, but so too does magic to unnaturally prolong or return life; you might be able to bring back one from the verge of death, or even resurrect a mostly intact and recently deceased individual. This can also include magic which directly assaults the life force of the target.

● Transmutation: The magic of altering the shapes of objects and entities. While precise human forms are far from easy with this (for that you want Flesh Changing) it includes magic to cause wimps to grow mighty muscles worthy of a barbarian warrior or even superhuman strength, turn people into animals, animals into other animals, objects into animals, objects into other objects, or even to bring temporary animation to inanimate objects. Coupled with Flesh Changing it will be easier for you to control specific details of appearance in general, and changing from one human to another or simply altering your own form will be much easier.

Regardless of your choice of high magic the skill and power of magic which comes with it will improve any low magic you have also purchased. You may buy an additional option for an additional (undiscounted) 200 CP, 2 for an additional (undiscounted) 300 CP, or all for an additional (undiscounted) 350 CP."
1291,,1000,Contradictory Conjuction User,Medaka Box Abnomral Jumpchain,Modus,"Every day, miracles are happening around the world. From child birth to heroic feats of courage and
strength, the everyday impossible is always happening. But you’re not about what’s just every day. You make the really miraculous things happen. When you use this style, usually by reciting the word
‘therefore’, you are able to make the least possible thing in the current situation the most possible
thing. A girl cutting an airship in half or winning against an opponent they could not ordinarily defeat
at all. It’s a mighty ability that, with careful use, can allow you to succeed in almost all things. But it
cannot make the impossible possible and it will only ever make the least likely thing into the most
likely, which may not always be exactly what you want to happen. "
1292,,1000,Sorcerer's Apprentice,Fate/Stay Night,Modus,"You've done it. The goal of all Magi. Reaching the Root of Akasha. Unbound by the limits of modern technology, numerous users or just mortal limitations. You've inherited one of the 5 Great True Magics...sorta. You see, just making you a master of True Magic would be horribly unentertaining. You weren't even going to be offered it until that kindly old man with the red eyes popped in and made a suggestion. You are getting a True Magic, one of the Five known ones of the modern day, but you're starting from the bottom. You have the ability to perform it without instantly killing yourself and a crash course on the basic functions, making you about equal to Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel story without the Jewel Sword. After that? It's up to you. Maybe you might like to look for the past users, if they're still around? I hear the 5th Magic has some red haired chick as its owner. And that kindly old man we mentioned earlier? Well, he's always up for giving kids a few lessons on the 2nd Magic. Good luck, you're going to need it. 

Of course, any Magic you do eventually master could be taught to a student. Emphasis on A. Once you reach a high level of skill in your chosen True Magic you’ll be able to awaken the potential for it in one other being and teach them too. Once they reach the same level of skill that you unlocked this potential at, you may choose another student. Or if they drop out or die. True Magic is quite dangerous after all. You may buy multiples of this perk but only the first purchase is discounted to Magus Heirs.

1293,,1000,Overlord,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Modus,"Oh, uh, shit, didn’t know who I was talking to. Pick something that’s been called “The Devil’s Work” like drugs or the radio or cartoons. You can cast any magic you know using that as a medium adjusting the magic as needed to work with it. You gain magic strong enough to be able to fight people like the three Vs: Valentino, Vox, and Velvet. You also gain control/magic tied to the Concepts even vaguely associated with whatever you chose. Such as Radio letting you “Make Contact” with eldritch beings and summon them or parts of them to attack for you. Or drugs letting you literally chain someone to you by making them addicted to you to a soul deep level. For 400 more points, you can now fuck around with Alastor and the like. You won’t be destroying planets, but you will be able to wipe a building off the map pretty easily, and possibly an entire city if you really try. However, there’s no telling what big A might do if he hears that there’s someone out there in his realm of power, though."
1294,,1000,Dealmaker Demon,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Modus,"You can make Deals. The D needs to be capital too, this isn’t some pansy-ass half baked give some idiot gold for his soul. This is straight-up Wish-Granting levels of bullshit. And you get a power boost for it though small, about 0.1% for every deal made. But in turn, as long as you have the raw power, skill, tech, or whatever else needed to fulfill a wish, even if it would normally take years, you can do it instantly and with no prep, if it’s for a Deal, though you’d have to have enough time left in Jump to do it. After Spark though, it’s “As long as you could eventually do it with the power and skills you currently have”. And these deals do not lower your power in any way. If you can make/reproduce something within the time you can create it instantly for the purpose of the deal and it doesn’t drain or take it from you in any way, such as money or a potion. The deal is not fiat-backed or forced on either side, Demons and those in deals with them constantly try to one-up each other.

This gives you some freedom though, such as if someone was, to say, ask to be rich, you could maybe change their name to Richard, or turn them into yogurt or something. Look, my point is that you can twist that wish into something fucked up and not at all what that person wanted if you really wanted to. Maybe for kicks, maybe it’s funny, maybe you hate that particular person, whatever reason you have to fuck up their wish, you can fuck it up so long as it was technically what they wanted. Oh yeah, and the person who wants the Deal actually has to want it. No abusing this power in some weird-ass way, like having one of your companions repeatedly wish for you to take a breath or something."
1295,,1000,Power of Mephisto,Dial,Modus,"With the Power of Mephisto perk, you gain the infernal powers associated with the demonic entity known as Mephisto. As a being of darkness and manipulation, you wield abilities that tap into the essence of evil and temptation. This grants you a wide array of powers from the satanic titan. The first of which is the power to manipulate souls, both your own and those of others. You can drain and absorb the life force of living beings, weakening and eventually extinguishing their essence. This ability allows you to siphon energy, vitality, and powers from your victims, strengthening yourself in the process. You can also trap souls, binding them to your will or using them as a source of power. Your mastery over souls grants you control over life and death itself, giving you an edge in battles and the ability to manipulate the very fabric of existence.

Second, you possess unparalleled skill in creating illusions and manipulating the minds of others. You can deceive and manipulate perceptions, creating realistic and convincing illusions that can fool even the most astute individuals. Your powers of manipulation extend beyond mere illusions, allowing you to influence and control the thoughts, emotions, and actions of those around you. With your abilities, you can sow discord, create false realities, and bend the wills of others to suit your desires. Third, you gain control over hellfire, a potent and destructive form of mystical fire. You can summon and manipulate flames that burn with intense heat and possess corrosive properties. Your hellfire can bypass conventional defenses and cause significant damage to physical and mystical barriers. You can project infernal fire as devastating blasts, engulf enemies in its scorching embrace, or create barriers of flame for protection. Your mastery over hellfire grants you both offensive and defensive capabilities that strike fear into the hearts of your foes.

Lastly, as a bearer of Mephisto’s power, you possess immortality and regenerative abilities. You are virtually indestructible, and injuries that would prove fatal to others heal rapidly, allowing you to recover from wounds and regenerate lost body parts. Your immortality grants you longevity and the ability to resist the effects of aging. However, your immortality is tied to the essence of Mephisto, and severing that connection would render you mortal. The Power of Mephisto perk grants you dominion over souls, illusions, hellfire, and immortality. With these dark powers, you become a master manipulator, capable of corrupting and controlling those around you. Embrace the dark arts and revel in the temptations of evil as you wield the infernal might of Mephisto."
1296,,1000,Chaos Magic       ,Avengers Vs X-Men,Modus,"This isn’t just a mutation, like the other options. On it’s own, this option would be something akin to probability or energy manipulation. But much like Scarlet Witch, you’ve had some special stuff done to you by one or more beings of cosmic nature. You have the ability and training to make use of Chaos Magic in the same way as she can during these times, the intensely powerful magical energy combined with your natural mutations allow you to warp reality for a massive variety of effects. From turning people into frogs or piles of dust, bringing the dead back to life or negating the powers of other beings, even eventually learning to warp reality on an enormous scale and bind it such that lesser attempts to undo what you have done will destroy everything. Even a large portion of the Phoenix force could be stalemated by your powers at their greatest extent. There’s very little you are not capable of, provided you remain focused and mentally stable when using your powers. These powers do make mental illness a greater threat for you, though that may not necessarily be linked to the power itself, and you will need to take care of yourself to remain in peak condition. The exact source of Chaos Magic is unclear and several potential options are open to your choosing. "
1297,,1000,Silver Arts ,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"A miraculous ability achieved by the man who would become the pinnacle of dragon hunting. The fusion of a human and a silver sword due to continuous use, and maybe some other freakish modifications and coincidences. The Silver Arts are not properly a magical ability, but rather an ability that exists to combat magic. They confer the user a physical power and speed nigh unrivaled, on the same realm of those that even only a handful Seija can hope to reach. Destroying large castle wards with a punch and sending someone flying kilometers away with a kick, just to get near them again in less than a tenth of a second is just some of one starting to grasp the potential of the Silver Arts could accomplish.

Your touch is deadly to any dragons, being instantly frozen the moment you extend your hand towards them. You can even do this with several dragons in a large area, freezing dozens of them by releasing your silver aura. The same goes for their magical power, which either gets completely frozen and broken by your touch, or at least makes you highly resistant to them. In future worlds, this would extend to all sorts of magic-based creatures, although the strongest of them may be able to resist this power, needing to combine it with your strength and speed to break through their defenses before being able to use your silver aura on their cores.

The fusion within your Silver Sword has granted you the ability of summoning silver swords from thin air, all an extreme quality, as well as infusing other silver swords or weapons with your potent silver aura power.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with this power, as even more uses could be mastered with enough battle experience and training.

Normally this power would possess a deathly toll onto the body, with continuous use probably killing you in over a year, but you find that it is merely physically draining instead of life threatening. Unless you really wish to go beyond that this would grant you and extract even more power from the sword fused to yourself, in which case it can still potentially harm you.

Finally, this grants you a form of quick regeneration, letting you recover quite fast from heavy wounds, and it may even let you reattach something as a cut head if you do it quickly enough with your incredible speed."
1298,,1000,Truth ,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"A fearsome magic. By merely speaking and imbuing one’s words with this magic, reality itself is forced to change in order to comply with the user’s words. Telling space to shift may deviate a powerful attack from its intended target. Telling some to die or disappear would inflict them with grave damage and push them hundreds of kilometers.

Those with magical power greater than the user, or with similar abilities that let them resist magical abilities, may be able to at least partially avoid the effects of the user. Another weakness is that the user may only affect those targets that are around him, so it is not the best of magics for long ranged combat.

The area and targets that one can affect increases with magical power."
1299,,1000,Time Control ,Ragna Crimson,Modus,"Perhaps one of the mightiest magic, and paradoxically, more commonly seen magics that you may find here. By taking this, you have gained the power to control time itself. You can both stop time entirely for everyone but yourself and those who you ‘whitelist’ or just freeze in time certain individual beings or locations, while still being able freely interact with the world yourself. The second power that you have is that of rewinding time, undoing damage or even bringing back the death. Like with your ability to stop time, your power allows you to both rewind time on individual objects or beings, specific locations, or even travel yourself back in time entirely, albeit that last ability will be much more energy consuming, to the point that you may only travel a few minutes back in time once a day even with the magical energy of a powerful Seija. 

The user may even cheat death by rewinding their own time, undoing even their death or healing deadly wounds, a power that activates automatically in the event of catastrophic damage.

It would do you some good to not get too overconfident with this power, because it has three major weaknesses that the top warriors of this world may still exploit: first, you cannot rewind and stop time at the same time. Second, the time stop requires a small window of time, equal to the speed of thought of the user, to activate. Lastly, whenever time is rewind, either for the user or the world, the magical energy consumed to do such an act doesn’t get restored. This means that you can only avoid true death as long as you have enough magical energy to keep restoring yourself."
1300,,1200,Fact User,Medaka Box Abnomral Jumpchain,Modus,"Did you know that you fortune cookies are from China? Honest truth. Did you also know that when
you tell a lie now, it becomes the truth? I promise I’m not lying. You have the ability to turn any lie
you tell into the truth, changing reality to match your words. All you need to do is have someone
other than yourself there and to tell them a statement that begins with ”Did you know...”. As long as
that person believes, even for the briefest of moments, that you have not lied then the lie you told
becomes the truth. If they can manage to prove that you were lying or have some ability that allows
them to uncover lies, reveal truth or destroy illusions, then they can revert your lies and any effects
they have had on the world and the beings in it. However, if they cannot do that, then they are
essentially helpless before your tricks."
1301,,1200,"Head, Eye, Claw",Library of Ruina,Modus,"I suppose that if you’re willing to spend so much on power, we could make you not a mere member of one of the subordinate wings of the world, and instead make you something more.... special, as the leaders of this world govern with overwhelming force and unshakable hypocrisy. You’re either one of the Heads personal agents, the mysterious and regal Arbiters, wrapped in darkness and gold; or their executioners, the brutal Claws with their arrays of serums. While the benefits from this perk (as well as much of your career, suppressing the worst violators of The Heads laws) remain the same either way, you’ll find the clothes often make the man in the City, and in few cases is this more apparent than in what’s given to the direct enforcers of the iron fisted rulers of the Cities will and whim alike.

Rather than the self centered, individualistic, and... well, egotistical power of E.G.O, your power is derived from the reproducible devices which anyone could use, though ironically most are more likely to find themselves with those unique powers than latch on to the most blood soaked bleeding edges of science you hold, the unadulterated militant uses of the Singularities that these types bring to bear in combat. 

Though the irony is, of course, that a creature such as yourself will find that you bear your own, unique talents regarding the use of such products of science which should bring forth the same results for everyone. Any such weapons you wield (rooted in advanced science, rather than magic or abnormalities), no matter how exotic, find you to be able to wield them with such grace that one could mistake them for a part of you. These devices and augmentations of war grow deadlier in your hands, to the point where you could devastate fortified buildings with focused blows with the augments provided, or use a energy blade fit to cut through steel as a tungsten boiling greatsword. Meanwhile more temporary effects, such as those of combat drugs find themselves more intense, longer lasting, and safer to use, pushing minutes into skirmishes, and hours into days. 

The most directly scientifically questionable ability you find yourself with, however, is actually one of (albeit somewhat debatable) mercy. Emulating certain technologies, you may teleport across long distances, though there is a delay which renders it of questionable utility in combat. However, if you are to claim victory in combat, you’ll find that your foes are truly at your mercy, as you find yourself able to teleport them anywhere you have been previously. Classically, the use of this has been to banish that which the Head denies the right to exist from the city, if an agent is impressed enough to find it a worthy and interesting foe, but in your hands this could be replaced with a cell, or perhaps some form of horrific workshop you’ve brought with you to grind your foes into components. 

Though, even with all this, be wary. Even if you’re perhaps amongst the finest of your number with such paragonal abilities, one of the greatest cruelties of the A, B, and C Corporations is that their tendency to send only the minimum number of enforcers is not out of any kind of lack. If you were to rebel, there are perhaps hundreds more finely trained, armed, and dressed slaughterers at their disposal. But as long as you stay within the confines of the Heads of the Worlds laws, you can be assured that few forces in the city can stand up to your might."
1302,,1600,Mind Reading,The God of High School Jump,Modus,"The ability to read the minds of other beings. Wasn’t this already present? Indeed. This one is special. You don’t just have the ability to read the mind of any being that you can see. You have the ability to copy any skill, technique or ability that you see and be able to use it as if you were a master, regardless of the difficulty of the technique, the way it works or the source of the power. You can do this if you see the technique or power used before you or you can just look into the mind of another being and copy anything that you see in there. This works even on beings such as Azathoth--though you should probably acquire the requisite defense perks lest your soul explode. The one limitation to this is that you cannot copy passive abilities of other people, such as the innate strength or speed someone has. The copied thing will work according to your level of power and you may choose how you wish to power it, with life energy or some other source of power."
1303,,1600,Polybius,Worm CYOA v17,Modus,"You grow. Every concept or idea, thought or power, is within your grasp. They are born as the Sun rises, natal, and with eternities spent, lash at their confinements until the maché walls of Is and All collapse. An old desire for absolute power will be fulfilled, surpassing every boundary, or a simple wish for victory will be granted; your innumerable, all-powerful foes suddenly lay dead at your feet. The cosmic hierarchy is shattered, and you have claimed your throne amidst Empyrean to lord over Everything. With this power, you don't exist. You are—for among all those who falsely claim in fiction, no-one is truly omnipotent but you. Given time, of course.

It's difficult to overstate the absolute power this perk grants. In both versatility and power, it supersedes and renders obsolete every other perk within this Grimoire, limited only by the time and effort invested to grow it. To begin with, you have up to five of any sort of power you desire at a given time, though these are limited both in scope and potency for the time being. It’s less you have an infinite pool of powers to pull from, but rather new powers are generated instantly to suit your needs. You can shift between powers instantly and at will, and if you cannot think of a power to achieve a goal, the most suitable power or power set will be offered to you. This is not your limit. Initially, your powers average a twelve on the PRT threat scale—or, power potent enough to threaten the Earth, supers or not. Powers strong enough to lay low Endbringers with little difficulty, and challenge Entities as the Apex. Initially. Once you’ve used a power, it will grow, but more frequent usage of a specific power will see it grow faster. Not only that, but your capacity to hold powers will grow as well—you will not be limited to five powers for long. Really, is there really any ability more powerful than fiat-backed omnipotence?

1304,,1600,Might of Chthon,Dial,Modus,"With the Might of Chthon perk, you gain access to the eldritch powers associated with the ancient and malevolent entity known as Chthon. Chthon is a being of dark magic and primordial chaos, and with this perk, you tap into the raw energies of the arcane. This grants you access to a wide array of abilities. First, you gain mastery over dark magic, enabling you to cast potent spells and manipulate the forces of the occult. You can tap into the primordial energies of the universe, channeling them to cast devastating spells, create powerful illusions, and manipulate reality itself. Your command over dark magic grants you a wide range of abilities, including energy projection, teleportation, dimensional travel, and the ability to summon and control mystical creatures. With your knowledge and control of dark magic, you become a formidable sorcerer capable of reshaping reality to suit your desires.

Second, you possess the power to manipulate chaos, the fundamental force of disorder and unpredictability. You can unleash chaotic energies, causing disruption and turmoil in your surroundings. Your control over chaos allows you to disrupt the flow of reality, creating pockets of instability that can alter the course of events. You can manipulate probabilities, causing unlikely events to occur or negating the likelihood of certain outcomes. Your mastery over chaos grants you an unpredictable edge, making it difficult for your enemies to anticipate or counter your actions. Third, you gain access to ancient and forbidden knowledge, granting you insights into the secrets of the universe and the arcane. You can tap into the vast pool of Chthon’s wisdom, unlocking hidden truths and gaining a deep understanding of mystical forces. Your eldritch knowledge grants you access to powerful spells, rituals, and incantations that few can comprehend. With this knowledge, you can uncover ancient artifacts, decipher cryptic texts, and unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.

Lastly, as a bearer of Chthon’s power, you have the ability to assume an eldritch form, transforming into a terrifying and otherworldly entity. In this form, your power is heightened, and you gain additional abilities and heightened physical attributes. Your eldritch form grants you enhanced strength, durability, and mystical energy manipulation. You radiate an aura of dark power that instills fear and awe in those who witness it. The Might of Chthon perk grants you mastery over dark magic, chaos manipulation, eldritch knowledge, and the ability to assume an eldritch form. With these arcane powers, you become a formidable sorcerer capable of wielding ancient and forbidden energies. Embrace the chaos and tap into the primordial forces as you harness the power of Chthon."
1305,,1600,Living Instrinsic Field,DC Comics,Modus,"It’s a sad, mysterious story that’s been repeated in the lives of both the more famous Captain
Atom of Earth-0 and his counterpart Allen Adam. Atom’s Dilusteel skin gives him a direct line to
the Quantum Field underlying all existence, letting him manipulate atomic structures with
enough precision to nullify other matter manipulators like Firestorm, separate individuals from
their cybernetics or even manipulate magic-and with severe enough nuclear reactions, even
destroy and recreate the universe. Or the heroine Chrysalis, whose exposure to a nuclear drill
gave her similar levels of metamorphosis on even a sub-molecular level which let her escape
her original reality and vivisect cosmic beings. The mystic Ahti who ascended to the role of
Kismet who embodies time is no less impressive, being able to guide astronauts lost in deep
space back to safe harbor-and her mourning husband Dominus, a rogue Lord of Order who
would later gain even greater power, has both smote beings as powerful as her as well as cast
his foes into different timelines simultaneously and even turn dreams he manipulated into
reality. You see, at some point your molecular structure was affected by a high energy reaction
that has given you a perspective beyond most mortals and even some divine beings. Whether it
was by magical rite or scientific accident, whether you did this deliberately or were caught up in
some sort of cosmic crisis, the result is the same: Matter and energy, both natural and
supernatural, bends to your will for you have become a fundamental aspect of it. The exact
nature of how you have become like this is kept deliberately ambiguous, and may provide you
certain specialties or deficiencies compared to other similar beings. Perhaps like Dr. Manhattan,
you are a font of Anti-Crisis Energy; this represents the greatest raw power available through
this option, but also the greatest risk of a mortal mind being overwhelmed by it. Perhaps like
Booster Gold’s future self, you have become a similar being to the Waverider-holding great
finesse over the currents of Hypertime.
Your body is no longer bound by the limitations of flesh and blood, but made of fundamental
energies fixed in shape by your self-image as an abstract wave function. Your mental abilities
are powerful enough to interface with the technology of the Monitors, and you perceive reality
on multiple dimensions-sufficient to see through time and space clearly, and perceive that
there’s something almost...comic book-like about its fundamental structure. Surely that’s just
one of the many mysterious of the cosmos? Back to the more known stuff, you can freely
traverse space and time at will, and have virtually unlimited shapeshifting ability by refocusing
on your self-image to morph your intrinsic field into various forms. As for your elemental and
telekinetic powers-from nuclear reactions of arbitrarily scope and complexity to vivisecting
cosmic beings, you have the potential to remake time and space, be in multiple places at once
via quantum superpositions, disintegrate enemies before they can react to your presence or
even fuse multiple universes together-and empower other beings into threats of cosmic scope in
their own right. The magic and mysticism of mortals or the Major Forces underpinning creation
can prove somewhat challenging for you to defend against directly if you do not grasp their
innate properties-but even they can be harnessed and wielded by you with far greater power
and finesse than many of the most prominent practitioners alive. Creating matter ex nihilo is
also well within your grasp, if you want to create a private pocket dimension with a family of your
own (or a harem of Power Girls). With discovery and practice of your powers you will unlock
more and more powers. Perhaps in time, you’ll be able to merge with and manipulate the
fundamental axioms of creation itself or alter the histories of the greatest heroes and villains of
this world into forms more pleasing to you. Perhaps the greatest trick you’ll ever learn is how to
undo those changes.
Keep in mind that for all that you’re beyond nearly all conventional engagement by post heroes
in the post-Crisis era and onwards, you’re not truly invincible, all-knowing or omnipotent. You
have a terrific amount of resistance and regeneration to such effects; nuclear explosions for
example could potentially scatter your substance and consciousness across a planet or further,
but you have the potential to reassemble yourself from even subatomic disintegration. Though
by the same token, you may be so torn asunder by powers such as Captain Atom’s
disintegrating blasts or certain high-end ordinance of the New Gods’ emanations, deceived by
tachyon particles or similar effects that skew your vision of the future or potentially harmed by
the multiverse itself reacting to your alterations. Cosmic or divine beings of extraordinary scope,
such as the Super Celestials (or perhaps, their most powerful fragments) and the greatest of
gods in their true forms can potentially bring you down."
1306,,2000,Magical Potential,DC Comics,Modus,"Among humans, to be unequaled in magic is to be the
Opener: A conduit of raw, uncontained magic and the owner of a soul so strong that demons
foolish enough to steal it risk the human, if canny enough, counter-possessing and remaking
their body perfectly and immaculately from the demon’s own substance. Tim Hunter, the Opener
of the modern era, wields such raw power that he reflexively brought imaginary friends into
reality, claimed and reshaped other magical servants at will and reshaped portions of other
realms of existence like Faerie or Hell by his mere coming with almost no meaningful
knowledge on how to use his powers. Merely as an infant, he created thousands of alternate
worlds simply to disperse his traumas. The title itself of “Opener” along with Tim is a creation of
the New Earth era’s Merlin, himself the living conduit of magic for his day. Such was his power
that he granted both Tim and himself multiple, overlapping histories to protect them and
enhance their powers with ambiguity-and resulting in different aspects of Merlin being
imprisoned at multiple places all over the world. And were you to be a god with such potential, it
would appear you are some strange twin to Hecate or her Dark Multiverse counterbalance the
Upside-Down Man: A true embodiment of magic, only given the trappings of divinity by other
rules of the existence. Such are your powers that you could appoint new incarnations and
guardians of aspects of reality such as death, lay waste to divine realms and otherwise alter the
nomic rules of existence and possibility. Though not even Hekate has reached so far, magic at its full potential has no limits, power granted equal to the likes of Owen Reece--but exploiting this is easier said than done. Be warned: Mere mortals have bound, harmed and broken such both such beings through extreme feats of heroism and villainy."
