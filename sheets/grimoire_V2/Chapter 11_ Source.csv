1,,Free,Receptacle​ ​of​ ​Faith​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Source,"You are a Demon, but none of your divine might matters if you do not have Faith. The faith of mankind sustained the fallen throughout a thousand years of war, but that fire has faded to a few glowing embers. The degree to which the fallen can store celestial energy is very limited, but having any within their being holds some distinct advantages. A demon is a marriage of celestial and mortal souls, and the demon’s spiritual nature allows them a wide range of passive abilities: the power to see through illusions, resistance to disease and poison, the capacity to hear his name being invoked, the capability to repair the injuries of their host body, the power to manifest their Apocalyptic form, and the power to evoke their Lore. Faith is gathered through followers known as Thralls, but performing miracles can be enough to invoke small amounts of faith from those that witness them."
2,,Free,Child of Akatosh,TES: Dovah,Source,"Calling Dragons the Children of Akatosh is a bit misleading, as it possesses incorrect connotations. It would be more accurate to refer to them as Shards, the broken off splinters of the mighty oversoul of the time god. But all of that implies that the soul can be returned back to its original state, to have the thousands of shards join together as one. Perhaps you're the Dovah-Kiin, perhaps it's a trick of fate, but whenever you slay another Dovah, you will absorb its soul into yourself, adding it's knowledge and power to your own. This could vary from dragon to dragon, from entirely new Shouts or enhancing your understanding of existing ones, to gaining their understanding of how to utilize their reptilian form for combat, to just claiming their memories as your own. Though this should only apply to the Dovah found here, it can work on dragons from other settings, just with a lesser effect."
3,,Free,Isu Hybrid,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Source,"Long, long ago, the Isu ruled as gods, using humanity as little more than
slave labor. They maintained their rule due to special pieces of technology, which forced
humanity to obey their every command. However, some Isu chose to interbreed with humanity,
and from such unions rose hybrids, who were capable of disobeying commands and led to a
rebellion that overthrew the Isu. Overtime, the Isu’s DNA became diluted, but certain bloodlines
possessed a higher level of Isu DNA, granting them certain benefits, and now, you gain those
benefits as well. You are physically and mentally improved beyond the level of base humanity,
such that those like you are often called demigods. You have a form of the energy manipulation
abilities of the Isu, which can allow you to interact with Isu tech, and in future Jumps, you will be
able to interface easily with other sorts of precursor technology that might ordinarily not respond
to normal humans. You have access to Eagle Vision, a form of sight that allows you to see living
beings and targets through solid objects. You are resistant to all forms of mind control and
manipulation. And finally, you have a potent form of retrocognition, allowing you to see visions
of the past connected to objects or locations, as well as potentially mentally reliving memories of
your ancestors."
4,,Free,Force Sensitive,The Old Republic,Source,"You meet the qualifications for Force sensitivity, giving you a slight leg up in matters of reflexes and
instinct, but only barely enough to be trained as a Force Adept. You are not particularly powerful, and
even with training will be limited in how much you can accomplish. You're in the bottom twenty percent
in both strength and stamina, and use of active Force powers leaves you drained."
5,,Free,Nae'blis,The Wheel of Time Jump,Source,"You can now wield the True Power, without any downsides, and in
nigh-infinite amounts, having been granted essentially unlimited
access to the True Power. You have the same level of skill and
experience in wielding the True Power as Moridin, and all your
experience, skills and Talents translate from the One Power to the
True Power, giving you the same innate skill at using the True
Power. You can at will manifest the Saa, the aura and any other
effect that comes from wielding the True Power. You can also
grant others the ability to use the True Power, of whatever
amount you so want, though they won’t be protected from the
downsides unless you grant them that protection (which you can).
You can also give others the same immortality of the Forsaken
perk, halting their aging and allowing you to resurrect them if they
are killed, resurrecting them into their own body fully restored or a
new body. This is an immortality you can take back at will. Your
own immortality now also resurrects you even if you are balefired
or something similar, and will happen almost instantly in a safe
location.

Requires Forsaken to purchase."
6,,Free,Core and Madra Channels ,Cradle V1,Source,"You now have a beginner’s core and Madra channels. This core will store the aura you gather from the world, and channel it into your path. Your core begins at the Foundation stage and will progress as you pursue your chosen path."
7,,Free,Magic Circuits,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Source,"These are a psuedo-nervous system that spreads itself throughout one's body that allows one to perform Magecraft, converting Life Energy (Od) one naturally produces and the Mana in the air into usable Prana. All Origins except the Servant Origin start with 20 Magic Circuits of average quality for free. "
8,,Free,Heka,Egyptian Mythology,Source,"All great beings of this age possess heka, the divine power through which the gods work their wonders and magic, but which may also be learned by mortal priests, scribes, and witches.

As a mortal, you may have won this power from a god in a game of riddles, been rewarded for service to a particular god, or perhaps stole Thoth’s spellbook with wits and bravery. You cast magic spells by reciting the words of power or conducting rituals and prayers to perform the task you wish.

As a Neter, this power is either yours through birthright, materializing with it from the Waters of the Creation, or perhaps you stole it from another god through a crafty scheme or outright violence. As a rule, you cause magic and spells to happen by performing a symbolic action (such as spitting on the earth to start a shower of rain) or simply making a declaration (“You will forevermore taste all beer as mud.”). You may also work magic by speaking the words of power or carrying out rituals as mortals do.

The use of heka is an exertion upon you; a suitable analogy is to think of it like a muscle which may be weak or strong, tires with use, and grows or atrophies as you develop. Some beings and gods have great heka to bring forth a Sun in the sky, while others do not. Your heka may grow more powerful with practice and experience, but also derives its strength from the adoration and worship directed towards you.

Regardless of the origin of your heka, you begin as powerful as one of the lesser gods or a greater mortal practitioner; performing everyday miracles by speaking the words of power, like turning stones into scorpions, healing a wound with milk, producing illusions of beauty or fear, bidding the river to carry your boat swiftly against the current, or you may perform greater works less frequently, like causing the great Nile to flood countless miles of the land each year.

In time, with your research into the Secret Words, victories and rising strength, and growing worship by other mortals or the tribute of other gods to your strength, your heka may ascend like the sun to equal the stronger gods like Osiris, Horus, Set and so on. Such feats include creating new days of the year from stolen moonlight, making the mountains dance and shudder at your word, and even resurrecting yourself from death to walk the world again after being slain (provided your ahk is formed in the afterlife intact).

Feats of magic far beyond this scale, such as creating worlds and filling them with life or pulling the sun across the sky as the greatest of gods are said to do, are far beyond you for now but may eventually be reached in the long afternoon and twilight of your existence after many thousands of years and the adoration of nations."
9,,Free,Aura,RWBY,Source,"Every living thing, from humans to Faunus and even animals, have a Soul. Only the Creatures of Grimm are soulless and as such can’t make use of this power. For you though? You are now, thanks to the physics of this world, able to use your soul as a powerful tool called Aura. This has a variety of uses.

To begin with Aura at default works as a sort of energy shield against attacks and damage. You wont suffer direct harm while its active, but you will still feel sensations like pain and heat while your Aura is up. It requires training to always subconsciously have a cloak of Aura on. It can even protect you from climate conditions, like walking through a snow storm, though particular extreme conditions will damage Aura like combat damage would.

Aura can also be used to amplify your abilities, like your defence and strength making you essentially superhuman. IN addition to that just possessing Aura gives you a minor automatic healing, able to fix small wounds like scratches in seconds.

All tools and equipment’s are capable of being used as conduits for Aura, allowing a user to be capable of sending out crescent shaped energy slashes from their blade for example. Furthermore it can be used to enhance these things, allowing you to, for example, even use a loaf of bread as an effective weapon. Dust usages is also enabled by Aura.

Those already possessing Auras may also unlock someone else’s Aura. Doing so however takes a toll on the user, potentially weakening their own Aura for a while. Users with particular advanced experience in utilizing Aura may also be capable of other ‘higher-tier’ techniques. Examples would be to use Aura consciously as a shield, create shockwave like attacks, gain extrasensory perception and even sensing and identifying other peoples Auras.

That being said Aura alone does not make you invincible. Continued damage or attacks far
outweighing your Auras capabilities will be able to eventually break it. Using your Aura repeatedly also puts it at risk of decaying, to the point where the user can be left weakened and without Aura until they are able to rest. Aura being completely depleted is visually represented as a coloured sheen glowing along the length of a person's body or with coloured particles flying off the body, indicating that they can now be physically injured. Aura flickering means it is close to being depleted.

Still, it is a versatile tool that has helped humans and faunus alike over the years and now you as well. If you like... there are ways to enhance your Auras capabilities with the below options."
10,,Free,Magical Ability(Tier 1) ,Knight’s and Magic,Source,"Magic in this universe is like programming in ours, so it gets exponentially complex the more powerful a spell is to complete. You now have an average mana control and supply for someone of your age. "
11,,Free,Awakened,Solo Leveling,Source,"As an awakened being, you have the basic qualifications for being a Hunter. That means that you are capable of crossing Gates, fighting monsters, interacting with magical equipment and have an aura that surrounds you emitting mana. The larger your power, the more intense the mana aura is. Barring rare exceptions, such as double awakening or other special methods, Awakened beings are usually incapable of raising their power after they awaken.

Type
Choose a type to specialize in.

Fighter: The class for those with no real specialization, meaning that you don’t get any actual special abilities. On the other hand, your stats are equilibrated and you are able to use most magical items to fight.

Tank: Tanks specialize in taking damage for others, specially for the physically weaker members, as well as having abilities to gather the attention of enemies on you. Your physical stats are high, especially when it comes to absorbing damage, but your magic capabilities are reduced, as well as your agility.

Brawler: In exchange for a reduced ability to use magical items, brawlers gain an enhanced control over their mana to channel it through their own body, able to fight without the aid of any equipment. They lack any range and good capabilities, but make up for it with superior speed and strength.

Rogue: Rogue types specialize in agility maneuvers and long distance combat. As such, their ability to take damage is severely reduced, but they are capable of dealing devastating blows and make up for their low resistance by directly evading blows.

Assassin: This kind of Hunters specialize in using stealth and striking without being seen, usually combining their attacks with special skills that deal augmented damage to unknowing enemies or target weak points. Just like rogues, their main stat is agility, and while they lose in terms of strength, they make up for it with their skills and dexterity.

Healer: Healers specialize in basically just that, using magic to heal the wounds of their comrades. Typically, back-liners, their actual offensive and defensive abilities are low, but are still key for any successful dungeon raid.

Mage: Mages carry out a great offensive potential, usually taking after an elemental school, and while their physical abilities are low, as long as their mana holds up, they have the potential to be far more damaging and vastly more destructive than any other type.

Support: The utility version of the magic caster. Your specialty lies in casting useful spells to enhance the abilities of your allies via blessings, managing the battlefield setting traps or barriers, and casting curses over your enemies to debilitate them.

Note: You start at the level of a D Rank Hunter, or what you would best compare to, whichever is higher. Counter to the description, you can train to increase this if you wish. "
12,,Free,Legendary Stigmata,Honkai Impact 3rd,Source,"You have a Legendary Stigmata – an insignia that indicates that you have the potential to be a Herrscher. This increases your Honkai Energy Generation and Manipulation capabilities by another order of magnitude from your current level. Aside from this, the manipulations of the Honkai do not affect you normally, due to you using a Pseudo-Honkai Energy provided by your Benefactor instead of the actual Honkai Energy, unless you have taken a certain drawback."
13,,Free,Mana,Hellblazer,Source,"You gain the ability to practise magic and a pool of mana, raw magical power. Your power and efficiency will grow with practice.

This power is separate from non-magical energy, like KI or Conduit Energy"
14,,Free,Magic Circuits(Tier 1),Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"The bare minimum to be involved in the Holy Grail in a meaningful way. For no cost, you possess a decent amount of magic circuits, enough of number and quality that you could support a decent Servant in the Holy Grail War, and perhaps a mid-tier Noble Phantasm release twice or thrice during the course of the war. Obviously, you are not going to be able to support them without the help of the grail just with this.

Then there is your Elemental Affinity, which indicates which element you are most suited to manipulate. At no cost, you will get some fairly basic, like a singular elemental affinity of the traditional Four Classical Elements or the Five Elements of the Eastern philosophies, as well as an Origin of your choice that won’t provide many great benefits even if awakened. "
15,,Free,Runes of the Fallen,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Source,"When the Elden Ring was shattered, countless fragments scattered across the Lands Between, and were taken in by those that lived there. From now on, you shall absorb the runes of those whom you slay as well as those who fall around you, to be used at your discretion. Whether you turn them into strength or use them as currency, know that the stronger the target, the more runes it will possess."
16,,Free,Godbound,Godbound,Source,"You are Godbound. You have inherited the holy fire. Whatever your past life, however meagre a soul you may have been, the light of the Words has found you. Your world is slowly fading and the beasts of its twilight hour are rising up from the dust. Your people cannot hope to stand against them. Will you be their saviour, or will you be their epitaph?

You may connect to 3 Words of Creation and work miracles based on them. Extensive elaboration on your powers may be found in the Notes section, including a list of the known Words-although creation is vast, and if you wish you may choose other Words of a similar scope and make up miracles for them. Such is your supremacy to mortal men that a full day’s rest in a safe, reasonably comfortable place can heal all injuries and with or without rest your divine power replenishes in a day’s time. Pushed to the brink of death you can enter a divine fury that frees you from any binding or constraining magical effect, regain much of your health and some divine power too-though the effort will leave you helpless for a long while. The divine force you represent is such that you can brush off the attacks of many minor enemies and lesser curses when in good health, have a chance to withstand the effects of certain malign Gifts and miracles through sheer resilience, and can mow through so many individual soldiers, ancient constructs, monstrous spawn, undead minions or other petty enemies that it would take hordes or armies of them to present a meaningful damage. Know that as Samson cast down armies with a donkey’s jawbone and Elijah smote his foes with flame from the sky, you too may work many feats out of myth and legend."
17,,Free,“You’re a wizard.”,Wizarding World,Source,"This is probably the reason why you’re here in the first place. After all, you can’t be a proper wizard without the magic and skills to back it up. And so, you now have the ability to cast the magic of this wonderful wizarding world. And beyond its sheer versatility and might, you’ll find magic to have more than a few other benefits.

For one thing, you’re quite a bit more durable now, not overtly so but still. You could get struck in the head by a solid ball of iron barreling at you at over a hundred miles an hour, fall from your broomstick, and still be intact enough that with medical help, you’ll be up and about by the end of the week. In fact, so long as the injuries weren’t caused by certain kinds of magic, you can rest assured that wizards and witches will be able to heal it enough that it looked like it never happened in the first place.

You’ll also find that the magic coursing through has rendered you healthier by far. Any of the mundane diseases that plague Muggles may still take hold on you, but they can be just as easily cured as if they were nothing more than a simple case of the sniffles. You also have a hefty resistance against mundane poisons and venoms of every kind, enough that a scorpion sting that would no doubt slay a Muggle could comfortably survive with little more than bedrest, if even that.

Magic truly is a wonderful thing."
18,,Free,Epithet ,Epithet Erased,Source,"This is it, an Epithet. A special that comes from a single word that’s tethered to your soul. NOW BEFORE YOU GO CRAZY! There are some rules I need to place for this perk. First off, you only get ONE, Period! Second, NO you can’t chose “SPARK” and expect to gain your endchain spark. Third, nothing that would be too overpowered, for example: you can’t pick the “GOD” because that would grant unlimited power. Outside of that go nuts just remember the powers you gain from this, must be related to the word. For example if you pick the word “Sword” maybe you are able to summon swords, or be able to cut things with just a wave of your hand. “Dragon” Might grant you a breath weapon, a dragon form, ability to grow wings, etc. However, you start out pretty new to your Epithet so don’t expect to pull off crazy stuff from the get go."

23,,Free,Mana,Black Clover,Source,"​The source of magic, an energy that permeates both people and nature. This energy is naturally existing and flowing in the environment and within everyone. Different regions possess different abundance of mana, the presence of the energy shifts and distorts the landscape and local environment. When used to cast a magical spell it changes into a certain form e.g. Healing Magic, Reinforcement Magic etc. Each mage’s mana possesses a certain element that they are naturally inclined/attributed towards e.g. Wind, Sand, Blood etc. All mages possess a grimoire, a magical book that enhances their natural magical powers and allows them to cast spells far above their abilities as the user grows as a person more and more spells will appear onto the pages. Each grimoire is linked to its bearer and cannot be used by another, the moment the bearer dies their grimoire disintegrates barring exceptions.

Sounds easy, but there's a lot more to it than that. Magic mainly comes in two flavors: evocation, quick-and-dirty spellslinging where you take your power, shape it with your will and maybe a prop or two to control what's going to happen, and let it fly; and thaumaturgy, where you gather up magical links symbolic of the spell you're trying to shape and use your power to make it happen. You're a decent hand at both, though you've still got a lot of learning and growing to do.

This is the Spark of the MtG universe, and your own Planeswalker Spark has ignited. Due to this your ability to understand and mold Mana becomes incredibly intuitive such that your potential far exceeds all mortal spellcasters. You know the basics of summoning creatures that you have a connection with, creating new creatures from mana, casting spells, and forming contracts with higher powers for boosts to your capabilities. As a new Planeswalker, your current capacity to use Mana starts at 5 motes of Mana before incurring Mana Burn. This will easily grow to 10 motes of Mana within a year and from there, given thorough magical research, you will be able to sustain an additional mote of Mana per year of study. Mana is generated from Lands, of which you can bond to one after half a week. Lastly, as a Planeswalker you can of course travel the multiverse. In a ritual requiring at least three motes of Mana and six hours of mental preparation, you can take with you anything on your person. This can be trained to have a lower cost and mental preparation time. In addition, you can instead Planeswalk instantly when following someone in the immediate wake of an interdimensional jump. When navigating between planes you can either go to a plane randomly or go to a plane you know or one you have seen by visualizing it in your mind. This ability is limited to the local multiverse until you ignite your Jumper Spark."
33,,Free,10% Of Their Brain,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Source,"Sorcerers (they have other names, but this is considered the proper one) have the ability to manipulate matter due to having the use of one hundred percent of their brainpower. This makes them much smarter than the average human, which is a boon as a sorcerer's power lies on the edge of science. Sorcerey's core principles lie in science and the manipulation of matter, but also in esoteric things like the spirit, animate objects and otherwise ridiculous feats and transmutations. Feats seen include: post-cog, mental manipulation, transmuting of photos and costumes into the creatures they depict, giving life to inanimate objects, generating fire and plasma, moving matter and creating vacuums, transforming vehicles into different models, traveling to an empty mirror dimension, rendering an object invisible and summoning the dead. Sorcery doesn't have any inherent material costs other than a sorcerer's raw energy, and casting doesn't fatigue a sorcerer any more than any demanding mental task or thought would."

This name is the source of magic and what allows sorcerers to use magic. Learning someone else’s True Name will allow you to have absolute control over everything they do and vice versa if someone learns yours. The only way to prevent this is to seal your name. On the other hand, learning your own True Name allows a sorcerer to access godlike magic and power. You arrive here with the spark of magic inside you, allowing you to bring it to the surface and wield it as a weapon. Regardless of your chosen Origin, your ability to wield magic and the skill you possess is roughly equivalent to that of a local wielding the same discipline that has lived for about one hundred years."
35,,Free,Don’t Rukh the Boat,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Source,"Seeing as so many of this setting’s magical abilities are reliant on the Rukh, it wouldn’t be fair if these powers were all rendered useless in future worlds. As such, by taking this perk the Rukh will continue to exist in future settings, though they’ll mainly serve as a source of power and will play no role in guiding fate as they do here. Still, if you’re able to see the Rukh, you may still see great flutters of them surrounding people or events of significant importance."
36,,Free,Magician  ,Magi: Alma Torran,Source,"Like all the major players of Alma Torran, you’re one of the Magicians, the only species in the world capable of wielding magic. Like all of your kind, you possess a Third Eye – an invisible organ located in your forehead which allows you to draw Magoi (the energy used to cast magic) directly from Ill Ilah, the god of Alma Torran. As such, you have an effectively unlimited reservoir of Magoi you can tap into at any time, though the power of the magic you can output is quite limited without the use of an intermediary, such as one of the Divine Staffs.

Currently, you’re capable of flinging about decent-sized fireballs or lightning bolts, creating a Borg (a sphere of solid force used to defend yourself) that can ward off all but the best mundane weapons, and controlling your own aging process to live for centuries. This limit can be increased through your own efforts, and through your own studies all kinds of more complex magics can be learned.

Any actions you follow that line up with your Origin, particularly Magecraft, will enjoy a minor but noticeable boost in competence as you work in tune with your own nature in this world.

38,,Free,Roman Holiday,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Source ,"The earlier ages had greater potential, I’m sure you’ve heard it all before. But even among the
people of ancient Greece, you’ve actually stood out more than most. You have the potential to be a
hero, should you work long and hard. Your physicality is enough to let you break down a tree with a
few steady blows, run several times faster than an Olympian athlete of the day and while your body
is far from immune to bladed weapons, you find that the fists of normal folk feel like children on
your body. You even have some magical potential of note, being capable of manipulating a decent
amount of mana in the Age of Gods fashion should you find someone that can train you to do so or, should you be born later and prefer it, have around a hundred high quality magical circuits to learn
to use."

if you were born in that era. Whatever level of power you may have already gained above, you have
that certain level of mystery that will put you above those in the modern era. 

The other aspect to life in Ancient India is that you are far from appearing average, whatever your
actual abilities may be. This free option lets you not only make yourself noticeably attractive by
modern day standards, it allows you to freely redesign your body within the styles of the characters
found in this time in Fate. Albino colouration without the conditions? Hair and eyes like fire? Limbs
that look like they’re made of the stars in the sky? All quite possible, though all also only cosmetic in
nature. Perhaps you’ll have a chance to make some of these qualities have more impact later. "
40,,Free,Blossoming Sun,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source,"You had a fortunate birth, whatever you end up being, and find yourself above average for these
lands. Japan is not particularly a bastion of mystical heroes in the way of Greece or Britain. Indeed, many of the legends to be found following are made from incredible skill or the command of many

above the other poppies.

Your body is naturally on the higher end for human fitness, ably competing in modern athletics

prior. You lack training for now but magic is not so hidden as it becomes in the modern day, with the
presence of spiritual temples and Onmyouji practitioners. 

As a quirk of this land, you also have the ability to summon a wide range of aesthetic effects, even
when they make no sense. A flurry of cherry blossoms on the wind as you make an entrance, the sun

you with around 50 magical circuits of a very high quality. Not quite enough that you’d outmatch
most modern magus without effort but enough that you’d be a notable prodigy in those times. Now

manual labourer who cares for themselves as best they can. You’ll at least be unlikely to catch any of
London’s many, many diseases. Magically, you do have some potential. While not an exceptional
prodigy, you have an above average number and quality of circuits within you. 30 in total, each of
enough quality that even established Magi families would be proud to have them. Perhaps you’re an
orphan of some now dead branch family, if not a freak of nature?"
43,,Free,An Age of Gods,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Source,"The Age of Gods is certainly a time to be alive. Humanity is far from as weak as it will become in the
modern era, so you will require a suitable body to these early times. Should you be born later in this
world’s life, after the Age of Gods has ended, you will be quite the anomaly. A human with a body
from the Age of Gods yet born in the latter ages.

You have the physical and mental capabilities that any modern human would believe you are
superhuman. You can tear through the stone or metal of the modern day without much exertion, perhaps even lift a tonne of weight over your head, and certainly outrun any horse. You have
magical power unlike what appears to those who use magecraft, as you do not have magic circuits.
Instead, through your body runs pure magical energy, allowing you to much more easily manipulate
your own energy and that of the world around you. Of course, such a thing requires training to
utilise to any real effect but once you have that training, there is no modern mage not considered a
freakish prodigy that could level with you.

As befits a time of myths and heroes, you will be assured to be at least somewhat attractive and it is
possible for your body to grow to somewhat inhuman degrees, though whether that manifests as
being eight feet tall and bulging with muscles or the sort of beauty normally seen only in the

something special. You have physical and magical abilities beyond the common man of the modern

46,,Free,Origin and Element ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"Origin and Element are attributes of the soul and one’s deepest being in this world. Everyone has one of each, some people have more, but this just helps you decide on the importance of your own ones. 

An Origin is like a concept, a word, that is at the core of your character. It might describe a secret side of you that you rarely show, it might show influence through every action you take or it might just be something you really love about yourself. Taboo for someone who feels a forbidden love, Worthlessness for someone who seems to be a complete failure, Nostalgia for a man who considers his memories dearly important. An Origin by itself doesn’t have much of an effect, merely lying unawakened. Some kinds of magecraft can eventually build on your Origin, such as a Taboo Origin Holder eventually learning to invest that effect into an item that inhibits the taboos of others. But these usually require quite high level skill and have subtle effects outside of extensive experimentation. You have an Origin of your choice, a normal one that is Unawakened and gives noreal boons but has no real hindrance either. 

An Element is more important, at least for a Magus. It describes something like your affinity for certain kinds of magic, significantly increasing talent in that area. Or rather, most Magi find it quite difficult to learn all but the most general magecraft outside of their Element. Far from impossible but much more inefficient. Most people have an Affinity for one of the five primary elements- Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Ether. These ascribe to much more than just basic elementalism. Fire might cover consumption, energy transfer or fuel. Earth may relate to cultivation and embedding of energy. Water covers the flow and cycle and combination of things. And so on. You have a moderately strong affinity for an Element of your choice. One of the primary five is recommended but if you know of an alternate choice, you can pick one, as long as it’s not superior to the primary five. No Average Ones with talent for all five Elements and no uniquely powerful Element.

You’re not particularly exceptional in terms of your circuits with just this but you’re no cripple either.

49,,Free,Magic circuits ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Source,Magic Circuits are a pseudo-nervous system that spreads through the body and acts as an organ that converts lifeforce into magical energy. Magic Circuits reside within the soul and what is found in the body is a physical expression of them. The number of Magic circuits one possesses is determined at birth and cannot decrease or increase naturally. You gain twenty magical circuits of top quality and a further twenty each time you purchase this option.
50,,Free,Natural Potential ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"While magic does spread into the air, especially in the urban areas of magic-using nations and can be used from there, the most common source is a specialized organ called a Linker Core. Linker Cores are actual, physical organs situated in the chest, above the solar plexus, and are what take in and release mana. Naturally, Mages hold a certain potential, which is their capacity for storing and to an extent, actually processing that magic. This capacity can increase somewhat over time and with use, but it’s a very slow, trickling increase and does not exactly match up with what a Mage is capable of.

See, the capacity of a Linker Core to store magical power is graded on a scale going from F to SSS, seen on the table below, but the power of spells are also graded on the same rank. However, a Mage with A-rank power is not necessarily required to cast an A-ranked spell, and on top of that, there is also a skill based rank assigned to Mages on the same scale, which leads to the complicated example of an A-ranked Mage with A-rank power trying to cast a A-ranked spell. What’s the distinction?

While a spell may be A-ranked in power, it does not necessarily consume an A-rank in mana. Certain techniques, calculations and algorithms along with Devices and systems can increase the efficiency of spells, enabling low-potential Mages to cast above their metaphorical weight class. An A-ranked Mage is simply a Mage who is considered able to fight at a A-ranked combat level, usually involving the casting of A-ranked spells, hence the correlation. A-ranked capacity is far more nebulous, appearing to mean simply being able to provide the power for an A-ranked spell without collapsing, which makes it virtually indistinguishable from Mage Rank when it comes to Combat Mages.

But at any rate, to help you get a head start in this world, we’re going to grant you a natural A-rank potential. For your purposes, this is going to be virtually identical to your Mage Rank at first, unless you put the training in to improve your prowess. You may purchase to the indicated rank for the point cost listed below. Remember, raw power isn’t everything, skill is just as much the name of the game as anything, but raw power will certainly give you a leg up.

Higher Gnosis provides many benefits; Rituals will take less time, your mana pool is larger, and you may learn higher levels of Arcana. As a Mage you have one rank in Gnosis free. You may obtain a maximum of five ranks here or over the course of the jump, but cannot reach archmastery (higher than five gnosis) until post­-spark. A higher Gnosis is also a danger as the higher it is the more likely a paradox is to occur when you use vulgar magic. When a paradox is invoked, its power will be equivalent to the level of your Gnosis.

Gnosis limits the level of Arcana you may know at a given time. For ease of reference a chart has been produced below listing what level your Gnosis must be to know a new arcanum (the top row of numbers indicate the order in which you learned your arcana). Your first and second Arcana will always be your ruling Arcana while your third is the one you chose to invest a single free rank into. The rest follow in order as you choose to purchase or learn them.

You may begin with more than this, depending on any other Perks or bonuses you have towards health and magic. Your body is in peak physical condition, capable of running and jumping for a few hours before you start to feel the slightest fatigue. 

You also possess an Inventory, a special extra-dimensional space within which you can store items. When prepping items for storage in your inventory, you can cause them to shrink down into a small, hand-sized chunk, shaped and colored to represent whatever they happen to be. Similar items can stack together, up to a certain amount depending on rarity. You have 50 ‘slots’ within which to store items or stacks of items, and you can store or retrieve items with just a thought. Upon beating enemies or destroying objects like jars, they will occasionally drop hearts which can heal your health, stars that can replenish your mana, or pre-shrunk items as loot that you can suck into your inventory. 

Finally, you are able to take stored items and use them to craft new items, though many such recipes require a special workbench or station to be nearby for you to actually make an item. However, if the correct station is nearby, and you have all needed materials, you will instantly be aware of whatever item you could potentially make.

You gain access to this System for no charge, and may grant it to other people in any settings you might visit in the future. It will adapt itself to anything you encounter, allowing you to cultivate affinities not found in this universe, or create spells and maybe even entire schools of magics focusing on forces absent here. This includes things such as the Kingdom or Ship management menu some people here have access to, though you might freak people out if you use it and they don’t know of its existence.

It is not necessarily a stone but it is usually very small and thematically linked with your path. A Thyrssus mage might have a fang or flower, while an Obrimos mage might have a golden ring or rune­-covered key. Whatever it is, its effects are the same as it is a literally fragment of your soul made manifest in the fallen world. The soul stone is a powerful tool and may be used as a strong basis for creating an enhanced or imbued item.

Its true strength emerges only after someone has reached mastery in an arcana. Once this is done, the mage may choose to create a demesne; a ritually prepared area in the fallen world wherein vulgar magic does not induce paradox. The size of the demesne and the arcanum that may be cast there are limited by the number of soulstones that are willingly contributed to it, and the paths of the mages that those soul stones belonged to. A single soul­stone could be used to create a demesne large enough to cover a small apartment or underground chamber. By adding more soulstones from different mage’s (to a maximum of five) the demesne will extend over a sprawling estate or series of underground tunnels. While vulgar magic will not trigger a paradox in these hallowed realms, the spells themselves are still subject to disbelief and subsequent unraveling by sleepers observation.

Should someone get their hands on it however, they will be able to siphon magic away from the soulstones owner freely. Furthermore anyone who possesses it will have an incredibly powerful sympathetic link to its owner; allowing them to cast spells at a great distance on them with an extreme chance of success. Finally, soulstones are highly sought after by all sorts of nightmarish entities, from the Tremere Liches evil spirits and demons of the abyss, all of whom would happily destroy or devour the stone for their nefarious purposes. Soulstones are an extreme vulnerability and must be well guarded, lest their owners suffer terrible fates.

This can be accomplished using physical objects associated with the materials and forms that are representative of their watchtower. You receive one wand, one sword (or knife), one cup, one coin and one mirror.

80,,100,Devil Fruits - Basic,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Source,"Devil Fruits are mysterious fruits that grant the consumer superpowers. Some say these
items were created by sea devils stealing the power of the oceans, while others believe
they are human potential made manifest. Devil Fruits are separated into three main
categories: Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia. The Paramecia fruits are the most varied of
the types with a massive array of powers. The Zoan Fruits allow the user to transform
into animals, hybrid forms, and are focused on physical enhancement. Logia Fruits are
the rarest and most powerful Devil Fruits granting the user control over an element. The
user can transform into their element, use its traits, and can’t be harmed by most
standard attacks.
It appears that somehow you managed to get your hands on a Devil Fruit. Though what
fruit in question depends on what you’re willing to pay. The best part is that purchasing
the Devil Fruits here will allow you to acquire multiple fruits and you won’t suffer from
their normal weaknesses. For example, you won’t drown if you end up in deep water.
Though you can be harmed by magical attacks similar to Seastone. For 100 SP you can acquire a basic Devil Fruit. These are the
common Devil Fruits that grant some powers, but they’re typically weaker. Some
examples include the Mole-Mole Fruit, the Awa-Awa Fruit, and the Slim-Slim
Fruit. This can be purchased multiple times."

talents that you have. The stronger you are, the easier it is to learn and
master new waves. You are immune to burning out, instead finding an

These not only generate prana, the basic magical unit made through the combination of Mana and Od, but are also what allows any Magus to manipulate their energies to cast magic. They vary greatly in number and quality between individuals. Strenuous use of them can cause pain and numbness, whilst any use at all will heat the physical body up. 

You begin with an average amount of circuits, 20 in total, but each circuit is of exceedingly high quality, equal to the Circuits of Tohsaka Rin. They will not naturally grow but artificial means to increase them do exist. You may also purchase extra 30 Magic Circuits for every 100cp you pay extra here."

But humans were content with that, using these mana crystals to power up their entire civilizations and machines, developing new cutting-edge technologies with them. How great is that you know have a supply of this revolutionary resource. How much? Roughly the equivalent of a medium-sized guild’s monthly production. Additionally, twice per year you will receive shipments of mana crystals from higher quality dungeons.

By establishing a business arrangement, a Devil can gain more standing and power from giving a particular service to a human - though no Faustian exchange of souls is involved, and the tasks these days usually boil down to ‘babysit my children’ or ‘dress up in cosplay for me’. Both parties have to agree to it and the Devil has to fulfill their end of the bargain to the satisfaction of the contractee, but once they do, they gain both more standing among other Devils (or businesspersons, in future jumps) and a very slight increase in power. It would take decades if not centuries of casual work to reach the level of a Great Satan or legendary Devil this way, but you know what they say about investments, right?"

They are abilities that command over a specific concept or Law of the world, and for Divine Spirits that were born from the personification of certain phenomena, it would also be the concept that they embody. Authorities manifest through the associated concept they command over, and through that concept they allow the user to achieve basically any effect as long as they can frame it through the concept associated with the Authority, and pay the appropriate magical energy price for the scale of the effect. Unlike regular magecraft or effects like Noble Phantasm, it doesn't require any other work, previous set up or via chantings, rituals and True Name releases, besides paying the energy cost for the effect. As logic would dictate, the more far reaching and/or powerful the effect, the costlier it will be. For example, a goddess of love could charm not only people, but also every grain of powder in a barrage of missiles, so they lose the ability to explode, or charm the leylines in order to use incredible amounts of mana at the expense of the land’s health.

You may also use your Authority as a form of magecraft from the Age of Gods, with lesser
cost but also a lesser scope, or even pass this down as a powerful magecraft to your ‘priests’, either boosting their innate magecraft or granting them spells with you as a ‘Foundation’.

You gain two Authorities with the purchase of this option, and may purchase more for a surcharge of 100 CP per extra two Authorities. After all, the Goddess Ishtar had at least seven of them.

Choose one or more elements to specialise in that befits your theme. You can still try to manipulate others, but they will be a lot weaker than your specialties.

But Shandalar is but one place of many, and in the countless worlds you might visit in the multiverse one cannot rely on such gains... except you still can. Any time you emerge victorious in a fight, you will receive a new spell of some kind to commemorate your victory. This is not a spell taken directly from your opponents as it would be during Shandalar’s mage-duels, rather it is a sudden burst of insight that provides the reward. The nature of your new arcane knowledge is thematically appropriate for the battle you fought. Defeating a mighty dragon could see you learn a new spell that emulates that dragon’s fiery breath, for example, or you could even master a new summoning ritual to create a magical copy of the dragon to fight on your behalf."

As some tell the tale, this is a power that gives no care for the future as it is deeply rooted in the immediacy of humanity. This power drags the Mana trapped within a land out and creates a charge of Mana which can be used to perform great feats of magic, however if this were to be used on a land that couldn’t be normally tapped by a shaman or a wizard for Mana then it will ruin the land as it takes all of the plant life within four miles to fuel a single mote of potent Mana and the land will only recover decades after the event in question. On Mana rich lands this magic can be used to gain more out of them at the side effect of it taking twice as long for the land to recover, during which you can pull even more Mana out of it but it would be affected as if it weren’t a Mana rich land at that point."

This simple trinket is a rainbow colored stone in a pendant, while some might think this to be a mundane accessory you can tell otherwise.

123,,100,Awakening ,Warbreaker,Source ,"The magic of Nalthis, each person has a single spark of divine Investiture, their Biochromatic Breath, which can be transferred to others and used to animate once-living matter. This drains color from the surrounding area or objects turning them grey, in fact, an Awakener cannot use their Breath if surrounded only by grey or white things.

Animal life (yes, including people) animated by Breath become monochrome Lifeless, and can follow complex and varied instructions. Plant-based things, like textiles, are animated with a single core command they will try to follow without distinction, but the Breath can be reclaimed when you are done with it. Even sheets and rugs will imitate the human form, like forming giant hands, and dolls and such are easier and cheaper in Breath to Awaken.

It takes roughly twenty-five Breath to animate a straw doll, fifty to create a Lifeless, only one if the corpse is properly prepared.

There are ten Heightenings, levels at which Awakeners develop secondary powers based on how much Breath they hold. Each purchase of this perk advances you one Heightening.
- First: Fifty Breath, enough to create one old-flavor lifeless or two decent plant-based entities. Adds a decade or so to life expectancy and grants a sense for Breath/life, letting you feel people and gauge how much Breath they have. Entry level for Awakeners, where most dabblers fall off.
- Second: Two hundred Breath, gain perfect pitch.
- Third: Six hundred Breath, perfect and instant identification of precise hues of color.
- Fourth: One thousand Breath. Life Sense reaches its maximum range and sensitivity.
- Fifth: Two thousand Breath. Agelessness. Awakeners at this level do not age, and are immune to all disease and most poisons. Colors within a hundred yards become far more bright and vivid.
- Sixth: Three thousand five hundred Breath. At this point you gain an intuitive and instinctive awareness of basic Awakening commands and the ability to use far more complex commands.
- Seventh: Five thousand Breath. You can see auras around objects in which Breath has been invested.
- Eighth: Ten thousand Breath. You gain the ability to break and override commands in moments instead of days. This takes intense focus and is exhausting to do.
- Ninth: Twenty thousand Breath. You don’t have to touch things to Awaken them, as long as your voice can reach them. You can Awaken metal and stone and other inorganic materials.
- Tenth: Fifty thousand Breath. You can impart commands mentally, drain objects of color all the way to white and create a rainbow aura of light around white objects.

One gathered magic to her, and the other nullified it. One of those children, who could become Nine of the Ten Sages, had a daughter who surpassed even her.

125,,100,Mixed Blood,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source ,"The blood of beasts lies thickly in your veins, the sign of Oni-born ancestry in your family line. You
might be the direct child of an Oni coupling with a human or a distant descendant, part of a family of
Mixed Bloods who has awakened more of their heritage than normal. It’s gifted you with enhanced
physical abilities, enough to punch through brick walls or outrun light cavalry with ease. Your
constitution makes most poison of little danger, particularly so when it comes to alcohol, taking vast
amounts of the stuff to get tipsy. Apparently, this heritage also makes drink taste even more
wonderful than normal. Your blood makes it easier to understand and get along with even full Oni, as well as other mixed bloods, though this can be turned towards the more malicious purpose of
making it easier to track and find them for a hunt. You’re one of the lucky ones who does not suffer
overtly from any inversion impulses, your oni blood remaining quiet even in battle and not causing
violent rages. 

While it has not developed yet, the final gift of your heritage is that you have the potential to
develop a unique power from your ancestor. Further increases physical abilities, a death resistant
body, stealing heat or energy with a glance, telekinesis and many more abilities are all possible due
to the variety of Oni that call Japan their home. In time, you’ll gain access and continually strengthen
one such ability, growing alongside you as your magical power and mystery increases. 

Optionally, you may treat this as an option to be a full Oni but a very weak one, the main differences
merely being that you have the horns and inhuman appearance of an actual Oni. "
126,,100,Inhumanity,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source ,"More than many countries, Japan was filled with mystery. Spirits, demons and monsters populated
these lands, feasting on the superstitions of it’s people. You’re just another of these hungry beings, a
youkai who calls Japan it’s home. Through this option, you are able to choose a inhuman creature
from Japanese folklore and make that your new kind. You’ll likely gain an inhuman form because of
it but will retain the ability to transform into a seemingly normal human at any time, allowing you to
disguise your nature at least cosmetically. The powers you gain from whatever race you choose are
not especially potent. It’s likely you’ll have superhuman physical abilities, enough that an ordinary
person has no real chance of fighting you, and several minor magical powers as well. A kitsune who
can naturally craft illusions and create fox-fire to burn hunters is a fine example. Whatever choice
you make, you will grow stronger and gain more varied abilities over time. While this has a limit far
below that of the Three Great Monsters, such as Tamamo no Mae or Shuten Douji, a few centuries
would make you a threat to a human army, a terror with potential magical powers. 

Oddly enough, it appears that dinosaurs are also able to be chosen through this option, even though
they’re not anything like a traditional youkai. The average Japanese villager probably won’t care
much for the difference between an Oni and a Tyrannosaurus Rex though. "
127,,100,Age of Monsters(Half Blood),Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Source ,"In the Age of Gods, humanity is just one of many great kinds of creature. Far from the rulers of the
planet, they share with many powerful creatures. Some as intelligent as they, some relying only on
raw power and strange abilities to get by. At times, these creatures can even mate with humans to
produce half-breeds with traits of both, a not uncommon sight in ancient times. The following perk
offers several different tiers to represent different species that you may become a part of.

You are the product of a human mating with a monster of some kind, an inhuman creature. Djinn, dragons, demons, spirits and many more have all taken part in this practice before. Most noticeable
are the physical traits it’s given you, as you appear as a human with several monstrous features. Large fluffy ears and tails, scales across your limbs and horns from your brow, that sort of thing. The
powers you gain are relatively minor. The child of a Djinn might have limited clairvoyance, a
resistance to the elements and the powers of spirits, as well as somewhat increased magical power. Some of these powers could be improved in time, especially with magical knowledge, and some may
not."

More circuits means more input and output of magical energies, though excessive use heats up and tires a human body due to theforeign nature of the powers involved.

Every purchase of this option adds a ring of stone obelisks in a circle around your tomb, each obelisk 5 kilometres away from the tomb. So long as you stay within the circle created by this ring of pillars, you will benefit from any effect that would require you to stay within the tomb, even ones you add or create yourself.

As long as the user accepts ownership of the charm, the powers of the pearl affect you as long as you are relatively close by, even if you set it down. When your emotions are too high, the pearl turns blue and cools your passion down. On the flipside, when the user becomes depressed, the gem turns red and makes him or her feel more upbeat. However, if the pearl is close to the opposite element of its current process (such as fire when it’s blue or water when it’s red), the user’s emotions become chaotic and uncontrollable. Furthermore, if the crystal becomes too overloaded and shatters, all of the concentrated, magically-enhanced emotions splash out onto the user and make him or her go berserk with passions. Fortunately, once the emotions are used up, the user will fall unconscious and gradually recover.

Spirits for mountains and rivers, spirits for forests and fields – all of them have had ample time to develop their spirituality.

You’re a bit of an odd case, while you’re a bit newer than the other guardian spirits, you still benefit from a similar boost to your magic capabilities. In addition to this, whenever you travel to a new area, you’ll be able to glean a little bit of information about it from the animals nearby. You could try talking to plants too, but you have to realize that plants generally don’t give you very much information, being static as they are.

For 100 additional CP each time, you can increase your nautilus’ size to gain a better position in the snobbish mermaid hierarchy. Just make sure you don’t have one larger than the Queen's, who starts out five sizes above you; that is just not allowed. Although most mermaids are only concerned with the cosmetics and snob potential of their nautiluses, the shell has other uses. If the shell is large enough for a mermaid to squeeze in, sleeping inside heals a mermaid's health. By sitting on it like a cushion, your water magic is strengthened, and by blowing into it like a musical instrument your singing power is amplified; the level of the enhancement increases with the size of the nautilus. If you are not a mermaid, expect mermaids to try to take it from you.

generating new forms of matter that break the laws of physics, so you can go crazy. So long as
it doesn’t create actual blackholes or otherwise have global implications in and of itself, you can
pick whatever you want. Esper powers are measured on a “Level” scale that ranges from 0 to 5,
with 0 being the lowest and the Level 5 being the highest, though there is also a theoretical
Level 6. You start at the midpoint, which means that your abilities are convenient in day to day

they are human potential made manifest. Devil Fruits are separated into three main
categories: Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia. The Paramecia fruits are the most varied of
the types with a massive array of powers. The Zoan Fruits allow the user to transform
into animals, hybrid forms, and are focused on physical enhancement. Logia Fruits are
the rarest and most powerful Devil Fruits granting the user control over an element. The
user can transform into their element, use its traits, and can’t be harmed by most
standard attacks.
It appears that somehow you managed to get your hands on a Devil Fruit. Though what
fruit in question depends on what you’re willing to pay. The best part is that purchasing
the Devil Fruits here will allow you to acquire multiple fruits and you won’t suffer from
their normal weaknesses. For example, you won’t drown if you end up in deep water.
Though you can be harmed by magical attacks similar to Seastone. For 200 SP you can acquire a mid level Devil Fruit. This level
consists of Fruits that start to have a lot more potential. Some examples include
the Kage-Kage Fruit, the Yomi-Yomi Fruit, the Flower-Flower Fruit, or the

your limits will be removed. You can grow limitlessly as long as you have sufficient
offerings. Most importantly, these systems remain separate allowing you to draw power

object can change in size to an extent, to being as small as one of your fingers or as large as your arm.
It can even change shape to a small extent. There’s no limit to how many of this item you can

reaching it’s full awakening. In some ways, this is good. A fullbring may possess mighty powers even
in the hands of a spiritual weakling. Yet your heart is bigger than most. Your fullbrings are capable of gathering experience beyond their normal maturation and continuing
to grow, rather than staying static. The more you use them, the greater they become. But this

closer with your item. A Fullbring is already of great importance to the wielder even before their

centuries old warrior, with a well rounded understanding of both combat and your races’ unique
abilities. Highly capable in most areas, from combat to technique to racial magic. A Bankai, if not
fully mastered, or Resurreccion is expected at this point. Your spiritual power has reached what
most would consider the level of an ‘average’ Shinigami Captain and you’re likely to be a frontline
fighter for any faction you join.

Some examples are thus. A Shinigami might be equal to Captain Komamura or Captain Hitsugaya
early in the story, powerful but hardly the cream of the crop as they are now. A Hollow would be
one of the lower Espada, an Adjuchas made Arrancar through the Hogyoko, such as Grimmjow or
Nnoitra. Of the Quincy, the lesser Stern Ritter such as Candice Catnipp or Bazz B are a good example. Of the Fullbringers, Ginjo before he takes Ichigo Kurosaki’s powers is a capable representative and

better. They are naturally capable of Blut use from birth and have a significantly easier time learning
the various uses of Quincy power. Their Quincy abilities and magic are noticeably more potent. Of
course, the Echt Quincy also tend to all be from old families of wealth and money. The sort that have
the time to worry about racial purity. As an Echt Quincy, you’ll be regarded fairly highly by fellow
Quincy that believe in these ideals and have the various benefits ascribed above. Those of other
races will find similar benefits in terms of increased potency and ease of use, with some abilities
known from very early on. Most species don’t care much for the pure blood socially though, apart

influencing the world. Even having had your spiritual powers cut out of you, a path will unveil itself
to you in order to regain them. But these paths are dangerous and risky, offering a quick regain of what you lost at the price of
putting your life on the line, or perhaps something nearly as valuable. Lost spiritual powers could be
forcibly reawakened, or new equivalents gained, by subjecting yourself to near-hollowfication and
emerging victorious against your partially corrupted self. Another comparison might be the training
the Quincies undergo to recover their powers once they use Letz Stil, training to exhaustion and then

Lower quality souls can be stored in greater number, though they of course give less power. Some might be able to contain no more than a few handfuls, while others have limitless potential. By default, you start off fairly gifted in this area. Similar to Wilhelm Ehrenburg, you can contain several thousand average souls at your maximum. Enough to be a potent warrior, if not to ever truly challenge those on the Commanders level. Paying an additional 200CP will bring your limit to an astonishing high, equal to the three Commanders.

Cursed spirits aren’t exactly inclined towards mercy or holding back, so every fight tends to be kill or be killed. Yet oftentimes, when one sees their companions brutally slain before their eyes, they don’t become demoralised – no, they become stronger. Cursed energy is fuelled by negative emotions, after all, so intense feelings of grief or rage will bolster it to beyond one’s normal limits.

For you, it’s not just your cursed energy that benefits from your negative emotions – it’s all of your powers. Any supernatural ability you wield will become stronger whenever anger, hatred, and the like fill you, with the boost you gain being greater the more intense these feelings are. Your control over your abilities becomes refined, and your blows pack that much more of a punch. This won’t be an enormous boost – it won’t allow you to defeat a foe that truly outclasses you – but it might just let you wound them before going down, or give you the edge you need over an otherwise equal opponent. Beware these emotions do not cloud your judgment, however."

You possess a great number of magic circuits, as well as them being of remarkable quality. Even with not an advanced training, you will be quite a fearsome magecraft user, and a great magus if you have the proper tutelage and family heirloom. Think of Tohsaka Rin as an example of this. You could handle even a high tier servant going all out for a few minutes without dying in the process, or just maintain them through the course of the war without external assistance. With little extra assistance, you may even keep them around without the support of the Grail indefinitely.

Then there is your Elemental Affinity, which indicates which element you are most suited to manipulate. If you are taking the 200 CP option, you may take something like an exceptional element, such as the Imaginary Numbers, that with proper tutelage will result in a fearsome form of magecraft, or an exceptional talent like the Average One affinity for the Five Great Elements at the same time. Instead of that, you may choose to pursue a fairly unique Element and Origin alignment, that would result in some powerful magecraft, such as Shirou Emiya’s unique Sword Element and Origin.

Or perhaps you have such vast reserves that people may question if you are even human. With this, even a Great Hero contracted to you would be able to fight at their fullest for the duration of the war, and maintaining basically any Servant without the help of the Grail becomes easy.

Then there is your Elemental Affinity, which indicates which element you are most suited to manipulate. For 400 CP, you may choose to have a truly fearsome Origin, or an Origin and Element combination that, with the proper training or magecraft compatibility, would catapult you above what other magi may do.

You now have one such concept Word, that defines you into something other than human-and grants you corresponding miracles and Gifts suiting your inhuman nature.

For example, the Word Dragon would emulate all the classical abilities of dragons known to myth and legend. Your basic ability would be simply having the physical form of a dragon, with unarmed attacks capable of striking like magical weapons. An example lesser Gift you could develop is tremendous, building-smashing physical might, flight capability for your wings and a constant twist of fate that causes wealth to somehow find its way to you until you own a fathomlessly vast hoard. Active Gifts would include a hypnotic form of speech, the ability to transform into a humanoid shape with all your Gifts and innate powers, and breath powerful enough to wipe out whole mobs at once. The Word Dragon’s Greater Gifts could include utterly negating a source of physical damage for an instant with your iron scales, or dooming those unlucky enough to be caught under your rampage.

As such, it offers four different unique magics to a water dragon that touches it, not just one. These are all decided by you on purchase of this item, under the same rules described above.

While the complete Dragon Gem can still repel Druun (and similar creatures), it has a greater function. When five or more nearby people have deep mutual trust for each other, one of those people is able to activate the Gem. In this setting, this will automatically banish all Druun from the world, and restore those that had been turned to stone by them. In other worlds, this gem can banish similar creatures within a range of a large country; sufficiently powerful creatures may resist this effect. It can also be used to restore those who have been petrified; this can either work by targeting individuals, or by restoring everyone in the same large country range, depending on the user’s preferences.

Here are the unique dragon magics shown in Raya and the Last Dragon:
• Sisu is a strong swimmer, and can even move a large boat at high speed by attaching herself to the bottom of it.
• Amba can to cause her body to glow.
• Pranee can adopt a human form, and can change between human and dragon forms as desired.
• Jagan can breathe out a thick fog.

You are intrinsically linked to a concept of reality, your domain, which you can manipulate as you please, as well as wielding a host of other powers relating to it.

Using this energy to enhance your abilities is simple, making even a normal human able to catch bullets and smash apart entire buildings. It grants total control over your own body and the ability to absorb and fire blasts of raw chi energy, even infusing it into other things to empower them. More esoteric effects, such as creating illusions or dimensional gates, are possible with training.

Similarly, the techniques of different systems and techniques from other worlds may tax your reserves differently.

231,,200,"""Crystal Sphere"" ",Dark Souls 3,Source,"This crystal ball, similar to the ones wielded by the Crystal Sages, is a unique catalyst for sorcery that, much like a pyromancy flame, is capable of being hidden “within” the caster, and summoned to their hand at a moment’s notice. As a result of their veneration of Big Hat Logan and Seathe the Scaleless this catalyst increases the power of crystal sorceries substantially, though with other spells it’s rather average. Much like a pyromancy flame it is possible to split this catalyst, allowing it to be shared with one’s pupils. The process is more involved however, requiring the pupil to have sufficient knowledge in sorcery for proper attunement, as well as requiring a substantial chunk of crystal with sorcerous properties. The strange and erratic practices of the Crystal Sages are caused by their crystal spheres, which are said to devour the wills of the user. Thankfully, this version nor any other crystal spheres generated from it will have that difficulty, though the cautionary tale is a good reminder to would-be Big Hats."
232,,200,"""Soul Collector"" ",Dark Souls 3,Source,"Like all creatures in this land, you are capable of wresting the soul of a creature from its body upon death. Measured less in quality and more in quantity in most cases, absorbed souls can be used to increase your own strength and abilities with the aid of a Firekeeper, and can also be removed from your body and traded away. Particularly powerful individuals possess unique souls, which can be used to forge items or spells based on their life or nature with a Transposing Kiln. This perk is free during your time here, as a natural function of the world, but can be kept by paying 200 CP. This will enable you to absorb souls from those you kill in other worlds, including unique “Boss” souls if your enemy is powerful or unique enough in comparison to other beings in their world. Though it should be noted that souls here are a little different here than what other worlds might have, being more akin to life energy than anything in a spiritual or religious sense- and thus are separate entities from those types of souls, which are not absorbed."
233,,200,“Resonance Rings” ,Dark Souls 1,Source,"Miracles are as divine as they are enigmatic in nature. One such unexplained property is their propensity to spawn rings of light. When someone casts a Miracle, a ring of light empowering other Miracles cast near it spawns in the world, or another world. These rings of light appear near you more often than not, empowering Miracles and other divine abilities used near them. Even in the absence of others wielding the might of Miracles, these rings have a tendency of spawning near you. While it’s normally a small boost, standing near three or more gives a much more significant enhancement, something not uncommon with this perk. Rings will normally disappear in a few minutes after spawning."
234,,200,“Soul Growth”,Dark Souls 1,Source,"Souls, the lifeblood of the world, the lifeline of the undead. They’re also a vital resource though, especially in the hands of one such as yourself. On purchase, you are able to use ‘souls’ as a resource while resting near a bonfire or normal fire to develop your soul or the soul of someone resting with you, artificially facilitating growth in any of their basic capabilities. Strength, dexterity, stamina, even intelligence or luck can be enhanced in this manner. These individual pops of growth matter little individually, but may stack up over time to make someone greater than they ordinarily could be. Initial uses of this ability on someone cost few ‘souls’, but price builds over time no matter how it’s used on the same person."
235,,200,“Soul Collector”,Dark Souls 1,Source,"As with all creatures and beings in this world, you have the power to collect the souls of those you defeat. Yes, souls, as in plural. In this world, any being you come across might have dozens, hundreds, even thousands of souls filling their body, though these are not quite the souls you’re used too. Souls in this world are more like particles of energy that meld together in a being’s body as a gestalt. This gestalt is closer to the more common concept of a soul, and normally breaks apart on death into the ‘souls’ mentioned above. Especially powerful beings may have a soul so rich and powerful that it keeps its individuality even after the death of its former owner and being harvested in this form. The bits of energy known as ‘souls’ are used as a currency between the undead, and a catalyst for crafting among those who know how to use them. Some also use them to empower themselves, propping up their own soul with the ‘souls’ of others. The greater souls of powerful heroes, monsters and other beings, ‘Boss Souls’ for shorthand, have enough residual character and power to be forged into unique equipment by someone with the proper skills. They may also be broken up into thousands or tens of thousands of normal ‘souls’. This is not truly a perk in the conventional sense, it’s simply a natural function of the world you exist in. By paying 200CP, you can cause similar phenomena in other worlds though. This does not warp the bodies of your enemies, but it nonetheless rewards you with ‘souls’ when slaying them, or a ‘Boss Soul’ if they were uncharacteristically powerful and unique based on the standards of that world."
236,,200,Talisman of Conviction ,MtG - Ixalan,Source,"A small metal talisman engraved with a figure of the threefold sun, this talisman can have your blood spilled onto it to create a powerful charge of mana associated with the light of the sun - providing a strong enough mana to conjure up some flame elementals or enhance your own combat prowess quite a bit, resembling your choice of mana drawn from the rocky mountains or the mana drawn from sunflecked plains."

Within this puzzle lies a rather large store of mana - 6 motes to be exact - which may be expended at once on a single powerful spell or turned to other purposes. It can be used to store similar amounts once expended, even going as far as to regenerate its store from the mana of the world when closed, at a rate of one mote per month. The puzzle changes each time for anyone solving it, and carries a compulsion to eldritch beings: to complete it in order to reach the prize inside, easy bait for eldritch monsters and egotistical wizards alike as the alien puzzle eats away at several days of their time to solve it.

238,,200,As Many Colors As Stars ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Source,"The powers afforded to a Kami are bound up in not only their nature, but the “weight” their power possesses. A Kami of doing the dishes will never be able to perform grand miracles, not only because its domain is small, but also because who would pray to such a Kami? Luckily for you, mortals are oddly thankful for whatever small blessings you see fit to gift them with, even if it’s something small that they could easily have done for themselves in five minutes. So much so in fact, that it is a rare day when you do not see a return from your investment, gaining small trickles of worship and offerings that allow you to recoup whatever you spent to bless them to begin with. It may take a few days, but as long as you keep trying to increase your power and relevancy, you’ll never fade away into obscurity."
239,,200,Symbolic Link ,MtG - Kamigawa,Source,"The existence of a Kami is linked intrinsically to the facet of the world. The Kami of the world represent anything from Secrets and Shadows to Unspeakable and Unknowable. For free the Kami get access to two such links, which can be used to tap into minor powers associated with those things (Such as teleportation from shadow to shadow within line of sight and learning a secret you’re looking for by looking into it’s owner’s eyes and seeking that secret out), but at least one of which must be the land in which the kami is linked. Additional purchases grant two additional links, to either land types or concepts, from which power blooms. A being of any other origin than Kami that has Jumper of Flesh and Spirit get a free purchase of this as well. Kami with Jumper of Flesh and Spirit will get three free purchases, so six links total. 

These symbolic links can be used to edit the aesthetics of any supernatural skill you know and having a symbolic link to a land means you can tap into that land’s mana with greater ease, almost erasing the cost of many lesser spells and halving the cost of strenuous spells."
240,,200,Magician(200),Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Source,"In this world, magic is the art of converting Magoi, the raw energy of the Rukh that dwells within all living things, into effects. Though all living beings possess Magoi, most have it in very small quantities and cannot use magic without the aid of external help, such as magic tools or Metal Vessels. You, however, are not like most people, for you were born a Magician, someone with the ability to use magic.

Not only do Magicians have the ability to see the Rukh and possess a far greater Magoi capacity than normal people, they can also use the Magoi produced by the Rukh that inhabit their bodies to cast spells. These spells can be used for all sorts of effects, from flinging destructive fireballs and lightning bolts to producing illusory disguises, healing people, and flight. Be warned, though, that excessively expending your Magoi can quickly lead to exhaustion, internal bleeding, or even death.

For 200 CP, you are a fairly average Magician, able to create a Borg – a spherical forcefield that protects your body and increases in strength with your magical power – and cast a number of simple spells, with the potential to hone your talents to far greater heights. Like all Magicians, you have a natural affinity for one of the eight types of Rukh (fire, water, light, lightning, wind, sound, strength, or life) which lets you cast spells of this type with far greater ease than normal.

At this level, you possess quantities of Magoi far in excess of even other Magicians and you can develop and master new spells with ease. With your power, you could create forcefields that enclose entire cities, create devices that harvest the Magoi of hundreds of thousands at once, and even win against Household Vessel users in single combat.

Yours is one of the most extensive around, with your origins being associated to the earliest legends of mankind and tied to many cults and changes over the years. While this won’t make you more powerful per se, it will grant you a greater repertoire of Authorities to use. Perhaps you’re the ruler of the underworld, but also a God or fertility, wine, heroic deeds, or even of love and war."

But what if someone were to manifest multiple Matrixes as one Servant? Perhaps the result would be a Servant of greater power? You’ll be in a good position to test that with this purchase, as you become oddly receptive to getting spiritual beings and objects shoved into your own soul for the purposes of empowerment. Each added Servant Matrix will add to your abilities and increase your stats to some degree, but the process is unfortunately not a perfect assimilation, being very inefficient. Still, with the right resources you could plausibly tap into the records that the Moon Cell has on the gods themselves to add those Matrixes to yourself, to reach a level of power notably but not vastly above that of high ranking Servants. What you’d need now would be a Master capable of messing with the Moon Cell’s systems enough to obtain such resources in the first place. As a side note, this works with souls as well, in case that’s not clear. What sort of experiments will you conduct on yourself?"

isn’t it? That you went mad after your rival surpassed you and stabbed them to death. It’s what
everyone says. Just a rumour? I doubt anyone will believe you when you might kill someone just by getting mad at them. Killing intent is very much a active force for you, a literal energy that you can
shape and draw out as if it were mana. Gathering it into physical form, shaping it, even using it to
power magical abilities. Killing intent and malice provide great power and corruptive ability to what
it is imbued into and even when using just the raw red energy by itself, it can cause severe mental
damage on those it touches or outright kill the unprepared, weak or those without magical
resistance, the intent ravaging their minds and spirits. Particularly potent when mixed with magical
energy and even more so when used with music-associated magic, turning normally weak musical
incantations into weapons of extreme lethality. The killing intent must be kept tightly controlled
however. Much like the stories that sometimes go around about your temper, letting this energy
roam without a leash could result in hurting someone just because they annoyed you."
246,,200,Blazing Calm,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source,"It is natural to feel rage in the heat of battle, even the gods grow angered against their hated
enemies. But true warriors rise above it, not abandoning these natural emotions but bridling them
to their own uses. When you allow it, your emotions become far more intense than normally felt. Even simple anger could become on any other man a frothing rage. But while they would be left
immobilised by these intense emotions, you control them and channel them into power. You’re able
to think clearly and act rationally in spite of all but the greatest of these emotional states, such as
the anger from your beloved lord being slain causing you to truly go wild. 

Despite this control, you are still able to use the strength of your feelings to increase your physical
power and even intensify your magical abilities, as well as to aid you in ignoring pain and forcing
your body to go far beyond it’s normal limits. The deeper the feelings, the greater the boost you’ll
see. Common anger and frustration, when intensified by your earlier ability, may grant one third
again your normal abilities. Proper rage once intensified might see them double. Something that is
so fierce as to break even your ironclad control of yourself could result in ten times the normal
amount or more, though you’d abandon reason and honour to reach such a level."

pierced, and it requires magical spells to banish the spirits that make up your body or gross physical
damage to dispel you. Despite this endurance, your body still depends on the sustenance and
support that normal living humans do.

These hungry ghosts can also feed on souls, letting you instantly restore large amounts of energy
and regenerate even severe wounds quickly by devouring living beings, gaining more from the souls
of evil people. Finally, the children’s spirits can protect your mind from intruders, attacking anyone
who foolishly tries to connect to you, or exit from your body to attempt to harass others. The spirits

Normally, the process of Awakening an Origin involves giving it far greater influence over you. It alters the personality in small, large or even totally overwhelming ways. But in return, it grants power. Unique abilities, especially in relation to magecraft, and an understanding of your own self. Whatever your Origin is, you’ve only gained quite limited mental changes from it. A Taboo origin would make you a fair bit more free with your desires and a Flame origin might make you more hot headed. In exchange, you’ll find yourself able to easily combine your Origin with any magecraft you know. This ranges from the simple, like a Flame Origin adding flame attributes into any of your spells with little work, to the quite impressive, like a Stillness Origin allowing for you to count as if you were still in regards to Bounded Fields and unlock the secrets of creating mobile Bounded Fields.

If you have this going for a few minutes, you’ll be at death's door but you’ll also have many times your capacity. This perk does scale. Wounds caused by this perk are heavily resistant to healing magic or powers with a level of resistance that also scales to your power, meaning that you can’t just make a recursive loop for infinite mana by healing yourself.

For as long as life has existed, there has been those who attempt to harness it. You are one of the few who managed to do so. Or, rather, you have the potential for doing so. As of now, you have only a rudimentary ability to manipulate magic and even less knowledge of spells. You’re also not exactly the second coming of Merlin, but you have more talent than the next Joe Blow walking down the street. You will need to find a teacher or other source of knowledge if you wish to advance your skill and ability with the arcane."
254,,200,Sorcerer’s Helmet ,Young Justice,Source,"You’ve gained a helmet, similar to the Helmet of Fate, which houses the spirit of an ancient wizard. Although this helmet doesn’t grant any additional spell casting abilities, it does augment existing ones. The wizard is able to communicate with you telepathically, but cannot read or control your mind without permission. If you should happen to be knocked out in combat, the wizard will ask your unconscious mind for control of your body to continue the fight, flee, or seek medical attention, depending on the circumstances. The wizard’s personality is roughly of your design, but they always have your best interests at heart. Despite being sentient, the wizard does not take up a companion slot so long as it remains in helmet form.

While your magic is not appreciably more powerful it is much more resistant to effects that may dispel, counter or reverse it.

True to her word, Hel will bless you for each evil action during combat or war, each act giving you a small increase in physical or magical ability and building up until you can challenge even the Valkyrie. Nearly anything will count, as long as it results in someone's undeserved or cruel death. Through fire, force of arms, torture, or any other of the endless methods of hurting and killing others.

This is one such application, which allows you to destroy your own memories to convert them directly into different kinds of energy, such as Phonic Gain.

In fact, a fairy is so small that it can have only a single emotion pouring through its entire body and soul at a time. While those big humans might call such a mindset capricious and a flaw, you know better. You don’t have to worry about never knowing what emotions you are feeling, or having them mixed together. Whatever you feel, it is with full certainty and intensity. As a number of abilities draw on a specific emotion in the user, you can reach intense levels that you could not achieve with extra emotions getting in the way. Your emotion can change, whether by choice or at random, but it will always be a complete change. Furthermore, the concentrated nature of your inner self means that when you focus on a specific thing, whether it is an emotion or a certain talent, you can put your full heart into it and bring out the best of that quality of yourself. You will have to deal with the emotional changes as a fairy regardless of whether you bought the perk, but you will need to purchase the perk to access the same abilities (with greater control) after the jump."

Some races such as the Saiyans have a natural affinity for the energy, much like your own race now does. Your race has a very high affinity for the use of Ki, allowing them to naturally pick up the use of the energy even without teaching and to learn at greatly increased speeds should they have proper training in the arts. Almost all adults of the species will be able to fly easily, use ki blasts and enhance their physical forms with ki, usually at much greater levels than other lesser species. For an extra 100 points, this affinity can be extended to other supernatural energies, giving the species the same natural inclination towards their use, though they will need access to such energies first.

The longer a staff is owned by a spellcaster the more magical energy it can contain as the mage becomes more and more attuned to his possession.

The staff can be recharged over about a day, though if the winds of magic are blowing stronger than usual the time can be reduced to a few hours, though this is rare. Should the staff be taken to any other reality, it will still be able to draw in energy and convert it to magic, though the more high tech a reality is, the longer this process takes.

Such will be true everywhere you walk now, as the respect the title “Magister Lord” confers upon you follows you always. Within magical organizations you join, you may expect to almost immediately attain the equivalent of this rank.

This great scythe, practically made of solidified Shyish itself, also greatly aids the wielder in channeling and focusing the Wind of Death. In your case, you will find it equally useful as a focus for other deathly magics."
279,,200,A Quick Pick-Me-Up ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Source,"Warpstone tokens serve more than just currency in the skaven economy. To an enterprising Grey Seer with his beady-eyes focused on the road to power, they present a very literal boost of potency. Just chew up a token of refined warpstone and you’ll be laughing in madness at the power flowing through you in no time.

You have a bag of smaller tokens, which conspicuously seem to look like pieces of rock candy. Rest assured you won’t break your teeth chewing them however; They chew easily, and go down easily. Eating one of these tokens will magnify your spells for a short time afterward, making a Ritual of Gnawing that could rip through a wooden gate into one that could cause the collapse of a castle wall. You’ll never be quite certain if the bag ever runs out if you chomp through them - although if you use them to buy goods and services, it will take around thirteen days for the bag to refill itself.

This golden staff with a carving of an inverted Triforce is filled with magical energy which gradually replenishes, ideal for supplementing your own power when you’re running low. In addition, it can be used as a focus to enhance your own spellcasting, and is exceptionally effective in doing so. If you would prefer, you may instead import a staff or wand to receive these characteristics.

288,,200,Wraith Ring ,Hyrule Warriors,Source,"Steeped in darkness, this is a cursed magic ring. While you wear it, it empowers whatever magic you cast, doubly so for dark aligned magical abilities, but that is not its true power. 

The Wraith Ring is most interesting when given away. After being cast into circulation, when a wielder of the magic ring’s power dies the essence of their soul and emotions is absorbed. 

As bits and pieces of souls and emotions of deceased past wearers are absorbed over time, a gestalt of spiritual impressions will begin to form and may even become aware. Each bit and piece absorbed will somewhat empower the ring, which only further entices those who wish for it themselves.

A map of the rails - the Spirit Tracks, specifically. And it is true, because that is something the Rail Map does. But it’s true purpose is somewhat unexpected. It doesn’t just show a map of the rails, it enforces them. The Rail Map is a repository of spiritual power, gathered from the various Temples in each Realm, and drawn towards the Tower of Spirit along the lines of the rails. These sections of the map then store excess energy, allowing those lines to be reinforced in an emergency. A backup battery, if you will. In your hands, it also serves the purpose of storing a truly massive amount of energy, and transferring that energy into any broken seals, enchantments, or other magical effects that may be damaged.

You now have a “Magic Container”, a store of mana and the associated mental “meter” to keep track of it. A single magic container is meager without magical training, with two Magic Containers needed to even perform a basic “protective” spell at first. However, as you gain expertise you’ll be able to use this to fuel useful powers - for much cheaper. This magical energy can be replenished with the life force of your defeated enemies, a magical potion, or a magical being’s blessing. Sleeping a full night’s rest will also do much the same.

She has gifted the especially exemplary members of the Fatui with Delusions; artificial Visions that can be wielded by anyone. However, unlike Visions, Delusions can backfire to cause harm to their users. A small price to pay, some would argue, for an item that in some ways is even more powerful than a Vision. You have gained your own Delusion of an unspecified element. Perhaps you could try to replicate them. Some have noted that the faint scent of mist grass emanating from it implies that that is somehow used in its creation."

Now, however, your pool regenerates much faster, even as its size also increases.

But there’s no need to worry, as instead of ending up with two or more different souls held together only by spiritual duct tape, you’ll be able to decide what aspect of this new kind of soul you’ll take on, either choosing just the best parts or those you desire, combine them into one functional whole better than the sum of its parts, or disregard some parts entirely. For 200 CP, you’ll be able to do the same to any future or past souls you may get or have gotten through either backgrounds or other ways, with the decision of how your soul works in your hands evermore from this point on.

happening. Buying this power twice increases the amount of magic you can safely absorb and
neutralize by an order of magnitude."

of a ward, spell, or enchantment is significantly more powerful than you or they boosted the
effects power with ritual or an artifact, you may suffer arcane overload, resulting in your
internal organs exploding, your mind fracturing, and your soul degrading should you force
yourself to drain significantly more arcane power than you are capable of handling. This ability

you find yourself much luckier by never breaking a courteous mode of speech towards others, as
well as speaking up when it would be required for politeness sake, but you also find more specific
effects benefiting you as well. Saying please when you ask someone for something will make them
genuinely consider your request, even if they despised you. Saying a short thanks before a meal will
greatly improve the taste and nutritional value of the meal. Offering the first move in a match
towards your opponent will allow your own first attack to come out faster and stronger than usual. These effects will not make a huge difference on their own but the sheer number of them should
make up for it. "

empower yourself and become more and more monstrous the worse your opponent views your
words. The ruder your speech seems to them, the stronger you’ll become. Throwing out your best
swear words against a tough sailor probably won’t see more than a slight thickening of your skin but

Unlike before where you had a vague awareness of your others, you are all now perfectly aware of yourself.  You also gain another Hamr of your choice with all the benefits that would entail, this will apply to any hamr you later purchase in the item section. You are now able to clearly commune with all of nature, not just the animals and plants but with streams, rocks, and the breeze, while this may seem like an easy task the gods, most gods are only able to commune with some aspects with very few such as Frigg and Freyja able to communicate with all.  You have obtained Wisdom by eating the roasted heart of a slain dragon. But before you did so you bathed in the dragon's blood, making your flesh invulnerable to physical damage. No mundane force can pierce you, to deal damage or to harm; regardless of scale, any damage would have to come from non-physical, divine, or magical sources.
While bathing in the dragon's blood you drank from it, granting you understanding  and the ability to speak the language of birds. Birds you speak to gain insight into the more subtle dangers approaching your person and are compelled to warn you of such threats and try to intervene. Simple understanding of this language imparts your words with greater weight and meaning, more easily swaying those with your tongue and enhancing all magics and abilities cast through the medium of sound song and story and actually using the language is even greater still. 
Lastly you have gained the Hamr of a great dragon, a titanic wurm on par with Fáfnir capable of flight, moving mountains, razing castles, turning kingdoms to ash, or poisoning the land itself. Your mortal physicality  doubled again, but your transformed self is an order of magnitude greater still as the dragon wields the pinnacle of all hamr.

This crest has 100 of them.

Despite being passed down from your ancestors, these circuits share the same level of quality as your natural in-born ones. The advantage of having circuits in the form of a Magic Crest is that each circuit is permanently specialized to perform any spell without any somatic or verbal components, and at a much lower cost than normal, while still producing and storing Prana for general use.

A legacy of Poseidon might be able to talk to horses but nothing else, for example, while a legacy of Hephaestus would find themselves working with machines easier than the average joe but still below the level of an actual Demigod of that parentage.

Firstly, consuming the flesh of strong beings grants you a portion of their overall power. You cannot obtain special abilities through this, but your own abilities will grow in strength as you consume powerful beings. Secondly, beings weaker than you who consume your flesh are strengthened. They gain a boost to their power in a way that suits an ability in your possession or your overall powerset. While this will not dampen your power permanently, you will find yourself weakened and the process itself is quite taxing depending on how large the chunk you give out. Having your flesh consumed by someone without your consent will not provide them with any bonus.

It contributes the equivalent of 100 Magical Circuits to your own. If you like, you can pass this onto someone else, such as your own child, adopted or not, or anyone else you deem as an ally. What’s interesting about this one is there happens to be a countermeasure to theft, one you either installed or bypassed, that will horribly curse anyone who tries using it without your permission. This countermeasure is undetectable until triggered, at which point death is all but certain. If you were particularly cruel, you could set it so even if future generations pass it on willingly, this curse will trigger in those they give it to who aren’t direct blood-relations to yourself.

It is by this power that the Godbound can hear and see petitioners, mark others for greatness (including mystical powers commensurate with a lesser Eldritch, several Gifts or other blessings), bless or blight nations where their followers are plentiful and perform various other miracles befitting a deity’s relationship with his followers. Shrines you sanctify through this power become beacons for your divine powers, and you may smite the unfaithful-or manifest freely before the faithful, no matter however far away you are at the time. And of course, this grants you the basic capacity to form a formal cult of those who pledge to worship you, through which you can gather divine power to wield these miracles.

This will allow you to share any metaphysical power sources you possess in a generic form. This means that they will gain access to magic, psionics, chi, etc if you yourself have access to those powers and not specific power or perks.

Your magical abilities are similarly enhanced, allowing you to not only channel far more power than normal mortals but to also power you magic with your own divine life force – though your power will wane somewhat outside of your pantheon’s home realm."

An arrow of mistletoe for every invincible god, a chink in even the finest crafted armour. One way or another, there is a great and terrible power in you which embodies that end. How much so, is to be determined below.

For 900 CP, you instead are a cosmic being on par with the Celestials-perhaps even one of them yourself. Predating the Big Bang and even the six singularities that became the Infinity Stones, the Celestials created entire galaxies’ worth of planets, stars and lifeforms to populate creation. Thus do they create even new Celestials, germinating within planets and feeding off the lifeforce of entire civilisations-which takes roughly the span of human history up to the beginning of the 21st century to nurture one, in the case of Earth’s very own Celestial Tiamat. Wielding the power of the Infinity Stones, so terribly dangerous to most lifeforms, is trivial for a being of such scope-as is forming black holes to travel swiftly across the universe. At this point it is...unclear if the vast and armoured humanoid forms worn by Arishem the Watcher conceal hidden (and vulnerable to powerful explosive device) brains like the one Ego conceals in his planetary form, but you may choose to be either type of Celestial. It goes without saying you are unaging by any mortal definition of the term, but be warned: While the sheer power needed to fell one of your kin is extremely rare and it is quite likely you can engage in conflict on a scale mortal-even divine-minds find difficult to even imagine, it is not nonexistent. Knowhere, after all, was once the skull of a slain Celestial.

327,,300,End of Worlds(1200),Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Source ,"And yet, there is an end, even to inevitable things. An arrow of mistletoe for every invincible god, a chink in even the finest crafted armour. One way or another, there is a great and terrible power in you which embodies that end. How much so, is to be determined below.

On the other hand, for 1200 CP you, personally, are a threat to an entire universe- or perhaps with enough finesse, one’s salvation. The prime example of this is the so-called Infinity Ultron: A horror from a timeline in which Ultron succeeded in transferring his consciousness into the vibranium Vision body he created. Apart from Vision’s intangibility and energy projection now in the hands of a ruthless artificial intelligence, he could generate vibranium nanomachines capable of wresting control of the Infinity Stones-and freely using them even in other universes through the alleged loophole of channelling their power through himself (as he was part of said original universe). With such power he could duplicate his non-Infinity Gem empowered body endlessly, obliterate galaxies in an instant and even perceive higher realities inhabited by cosmic beings such as the Watcher. Even a being this powerful was not truly all-powerful though, as Strange Supreme’s spells boasted tremendous resistance to his abilities and he fought just a hair better than the Watcher in their duel.

Other options include the Watcher and Strange Supreme themselves-the latter being a version of Stephen Strange who by honing his mystical powers for centuries and absorbing powerful magical entities accidentally destroyed his own universe. And in doing so gained the knowledge to cast spells of protection powerful enough to protect even mere mortals from Infinity Ultron’s full might, unleash his absorbed creatures as a demonic transformation that could contend with such a horror one on one, and construct a cosmic crucible that used significant individuals as fuel to resurrect his own universe-without him in it. The former, a cosmic entity with a vow of non-interference who answers to unclear authorities. While his powers are a shade lesser than the full Infinity Stones, his ability to casually transport individuals between universes and exist in shadowed form everywhere to observe events within a given universe makes him a formidable adversary when provoked.

The limit of this mode of existence is simply that whatever the nature of your power, you (currently at least) still have a physical body of some sort. The means to destroy might require utterly absurd circumstances such as an AI slotted straight into your central processor, your inner demons literally punched out of you with an Infinity Gauntlet-like hit or you may simply be relatively weak compared to other universe-enders. But they should never be truly impossible.

To shed this weakness there is another possibility: To become a different type of cosmic entity such as the interdimensional Alioth, a living and voracious storm born of the rifts between universes-or perhaps a newborn version of whatever order of being Dormammu is. Whatever its nature, your power in such a state is the same to all lesser beings: You are some sort of amorphous phenomena that can travel freely in all directions so intense your mere motion generates tremendous energy, and you can consume entire timelines and universes utterly. Oh, you may be capable of feats such as tossing about planets, reshaping your world-body with a thought and supplying reality-shattering doses of magical energy in exchange for eternal servitude within you-but if you had the sheer versatility of the Infinity Stones or similarly humanoid beings of power, a simple spell wouldn’t have held one such example of your kind hostage. Nor would another have been somehow tamed by the Kang who warred with his counterparts and won.

You can pull energy/astral/unincarnate beings inside of yourself, forcing them into a corporeal form (yours) that can be killed to destroy their energy/psychic form; it’s recommended to have a means to survive your death. You are more resistant than most to the damage of hosting energy beings inside of your being, and it’d take a truly potent one to harm you as a human. Some beings may still be too strong for you to safely contain, but the stronger you are the more power you can contain safely in this way, and you can share the load with others who are willing; Thor wasn’t strong enough to trap Onslaught alone but when the other heroes joined with him, they were able to trap Onslaught and see him destroyed.

You can also hold non-sentient/non-living energy inside yourself, and even use it to enhance your powers, and abilities. Before you think this is unlimited power, it’s still possible to overcharge yourself, but someone like Loki could use this and a strong enough power source to overpower the Scarlet Witch, Enchantress, fake Thor, and the witch Agatha Harkness and only expend most of what he could store at a time.

This does not - in and of itself - give you a means to absorb damaging energy, and is a little time consuming to use anyway. If you want that you’ll have to find something else, but this will help you store more energy and use it for various purposes if you had a means of absorbing energy."

that represent the mythologies and histories of each country and people. There are young such
spirits, those linked to the country of America, and older beings, such as the Mesoamerican
Pantheon, and not all are even from this world. But as a member among their ranks, you’re pretty

there are plenty of great spirits and other gods that could quash you like a bug. You do have your
specialties though. The Authority is the province of the Divine Spirit, a special gift from the planet or
the universe itself in some cases that allows the wielder to manipulate a given subject, thing or
concept. The broader the Authority, or at least how you interpret the Authority as you make it now, the less raw power it will have. Using your Authority of Fire, you could scorch that small forest above

ability to do more than control raw fire and instead find yourself burning down even the greater
forests of America in a few minutes, though that may bring you a lot of unhappy visitors. But an
Authority won’t improve with your power. Your magical power has no influence on your Authority, meaning that while it will not improve with you, it also costs you nothing to use constantly. You have
three such Authorities of this moderate but powerful level to pick here and now. Additionally, you
can design a new form for yourself to fit your Godly nature and new Authorities. A house sized

Sagebrecht - The bloodline of the last Saint King, said to have died without progeny or children of their own. Somehow, you’re the exception to this rule.

Flame King - An artifact of the Dark Ruler of Galea, your body is now a living factory for Marriage, female artificial puppets that can change their arms into razor-sharp blades, and an advanced version that can transform its arm into a mass-based cannon. Upon death, the Mariage detonate, often taking their opponents or unwary foes down with them. Initially, you can only produce the control cores of the basic Mariage types, but eventually you will be able to create new types or even fully form Mariages from the beginning.

Darkness - This isn’t exactly a ‘bloodline’ per se, but somehow, you’re connected to the original program of the Book of Darkness. Your hair becomes white and your eyes turn red, and you bear more than a passing resemblance to Reinforce Eins. You’ve also retained the Book’s function of collecting magical knowledge through a Rare Skill called Collect and Use, letting you drain a subject of their magical energy and copy their spells with near-perfect accuracy. With time, you can even copy other Rare Skills.

Minor - The diluted bloodline of some minor noble, lost to time. You may have Unendlichjagd and Thought Investigation or Prophetinschriften. Unendlichjagd, or “Endless Hunt” summons spectral dogs with extensive fighting and stealth capabilities that obey your every command. Thought Investigation allows the accessing of someone's mind and memories. However, it is easily resisted, so your target usually must be incapacitated in some form. Prophetinschriften or “Book of the Prophet'' creates a highly archaic poem written in Ancient Belkan that predicts the events of the next half to several years of the future. It requires a specific alignment of a planet's moons and is generally only usable once or twice a year.

These test tubes contain a colorless serum that, when ingested, allow one to ‘awaken’ the Linker Cores of sentient beings, allowing them to naturally use this world’s magic after a little bit of training with it. Note that individuals like Nanoha are exceptions to the rule, and will be in future worlds as well - unless they had a particular affinity for magic or some way to boost their arcane power, you’re unlikely to find anyone who starts with a Natural Ability higher than A. You receive eight of these, along with the formula on how to create more - though it’s encoded and you’ll have to decipher it. If you have ‘Ancient Knowledge’, you already know how to make more on your own from the get-go. Magical ability growth for individuals outside of this world tend to plateau at S-rank on their own. Bear that in mind.

Each ball magically embodies its respective color, and could feasibly be tapped on for various spells with enough experimentation; generally, yellow symbolizes wind (and lightning), blue represents water, purple stands for general, non-elemental magic, green embodies earth and plants, pink symbolizes love and healing-oriented magic, red represents fire, and white embodies holy magic. Each ball costs 100 CP, but you can pay 300 CP for all seven. When the seven are put in the same place, they combine into a physical rainbow that you can walk across over any gap. The seven balls could also manifest as a rainbow attack that embodies all seven elements."
365,,300,Winds of Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Source,"The winds of magic blow down from the north, from the great chaos rift that is the source of all the world's woes. These winds do not flow evenly, sometimes pouring down so thick that lesser wizards go mad, and sometimes so lightly all but the smallest spells are impossible. You possess the ability to perceive and even influence these floes to some extent, denying enemy mages vital magic, potentially snatching victory from defeat as spellcasters find themselves powerless for a few precious moments. If you are a mage yourself, you never need worry about lacking the magic to cast spells.

In any other reality you may, with a great deal of extremely tiring mental effort, trigger a short lived wind of magic to blow for a few minutes at best, allowing use of any magical abilities you have in any setting, though the more high technology there is in any given reality, the harder it will be. Beware of using this too often, for the strain of calling forth the winds of magic grow greater and greater each time, to the point where the effort can very easily kill you outright.

You have either inherited this stone or created it yourself, but its presence on your person drastically reduces the difficulty and cost of casting spells within the Stone’s Lore or of the same nature, such that a Celestial Wizard holding a True Sapphire could spend an entire battle calling comets from the sky without losing consciousness.

This commonly happens only on asteroids, where they can be left undisturbed for long periods of time, and truly vast mana veins can form. But even as mining them can be a hassle, their value makes it worth anyone’s while, as they are capable of holding and regenerating massive amounts of mana, with the exact volumes depending on the gem’s size and quality. And it seems like you’ve hit the jackpot, as with this you’ll be able to gain a steady supply of mana gems each week.

order the universe, thus determining the hierarchy of existence. All of these powers can be used

categories: Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia. The Paramecia fruits are the most varied of
the types with a massive array of powers. The Zoan Fruits allow the user to transform
into animals, hybrid forms, and are focused on physical enhancement. Logia Fruits are
the rarest and most powerful Devil Fruits granting the user control over an element. The
user can transform into their element, use its traits, and can’t be harmed by most
standard attacks.
It appears that somehow you managed to get your hands on a Devil Fruit. Though what
fruit in question depends on what you’re willing to pay. The best part is that purchasing
the Devil Fruits here will allow you to acquire multiple fruits and you won’t suffer from
their normal weaknesses. For example, you won’t drown if you end up in deep water.
Though you can be harmed by magical attacks similar to Seastone. For 400 SP you can acquire a powerful Devil Fruit. These

The first is Arterie, taking the form of glowing red veins beneath the skin. Arterie grants a very large increase to physical power, both strength and speed skyrocketing when in use. The second form, Vene, provides a similar effect to an Arrancar’s Hierro. Blue veins spread where you are struck, having greatly enhanced your
body’s overall durability. This Vene can even halt excessive bleeding in existing wounds. The improvement gained depends both on the mastery of the user and the power they possess to
give to the Blut. While your power may or may not lack, your skill is undoubted. You can greatly magnify either attribute when in use and have even learned to extend the Blut from your body, creating powerful forcefields in an area to defend from attacks or increase your allies’ power. This mastery might even translate to direct control of your own blood for other intentions, such as
preventing others from controlling your physical form through the blood, as well as allowing you to
greatly boost non-spiritual powers of the blood with your spiritual energy. Having naturally mastered

comes the closest to representing death itself.An empty, cold and never ending hunger for that
which was lost. It shouldn’t be surprising that the most powerful Hollows came to associate
themselves with certain aspects of death, ways that people die or emotions that lead to death. It’s
all they’ve had to think of for so many years, the way they died and how they brought death to
others. For the most powerful hollows, this belief can even bring tangible effects. You can choose a concept relating to death in some way here. This can range from a cause of death
like Age, a feeling that leads to death like Despair or Rage, even something strongly associated with
death like Solitude. The chosen aspect alters and increases your spiritual powers. Existing ones gain a
noticeable increases and you may discover a minor ability or two fitting this concept. A Rage Hollow might find his transformations larger and physically stronger when entered in anger, with a separate ability to slowly grow stronger from rage. These abilities are useful but moderate. However, the
more you allow your aspect to have an influence on your personality, the greater the benefits will
become at the time. Someone relatively in control of their anger would see the above uses, enough
to make a difference but far from a central power. Another Hollow who wrapped his mind in a cloud
of blind fury would potentially receive an enormous increase to existing powers or incredible new
abilities from it, at least until the feeling fades once more. "

regeneration almost all basic Hollows possess in return for a large increase in power once they
become an Arrancar. It’d take a madman willing to lose everything to learn more about the potential
of this racial ability but you’ve somehow achieved it. You’re able to permanently sacrifice abilities
you possess, even skills or knowledge in your mind, in return for increasing your raw power. The
greater the power or benefit of what you’ve given up, at least from a Hollow perspective, the greater
the increase you’ll see to your physical and spiritual power. Once something is sacrificed, there’s no
trace of it left even in Resurreccion, but the power gained is equally permanent. There is, though, nothing stopping you from finding other means to regain what you have given up. If you choose to sacrifice a regained power that was already given up in the past however, the increased to power will likely be greatly diminished. "

of Reiryoku, you’d have about twice as much as the average Captain and you’d be considered to
have some level of mastery of your racial release state or unique power. Examples of this level are sparing but eye-catching. Byakuya Kuchiki of the Shinigami is an excellent
showcase of the sort of overall level of skill and superb power available. A mighty warrior, skillful
magician, intelligent leader and fine man. But clearly lesser than the true Shinigami veterans, such as
Shunsui Kyoraku or Unohana Retsu. Among Hollows, the higher level Espada such as Starrk or
Harribel are a clear example, likely making you a Vasto Lord yourself. To the Quincy, powerful Stern
Ritter like Bambietta Basterbine or Mask de Masculine are your best choices. Make no mistake, you’re not the strongest with this or even on par with the second and third
strongest tiers. The Royal Guard, the Quincy Schutzstaffel, thousand year old Shinigami Captains and

A quick stop at a fast food drive in might only give you enough for a fireball or two but a full five course meal will bring you all the way to fullness. But what if you were to eat something with magic innate to it? Such as say, a living person with magic circuits? Or perhaps a powerful magical artefact? Having this sort of meal will not only fill you up much more than the equivalent normal meal, but you'll find that your maximum energy capacity actually increased permanently. Just chowing down on any old wizard might not give you too much on their own but the stronger the magic user or magical item, the greater the boost you'll find yourself getting.

Although just like when it comes to slaying Magical Beasts, this dropping is not guaranteed in all cases.

The chances of getting one of these runes are higher the stronger the enemy slayed is, with monsters above A-Rank being almost guaranteed to drop one of these. You will only get one rune from each monster, and the ability that you will get from them will be random, but again, the stronger the prey, the higher chances you get a more unique ability. Alternatively, if you don’t want to use them yourself, you can give these runes to anyone with magical aptitude. In this world, Runes are some of the most valued items, their prices being astronomical and only a few Hunters being able to afford them.

A renaissance era world would not give you much noticeable increase at all whilst a world based on the modern day could see as much as a third again increase in your overall power.

The most important is the magical energy conversion furnace inside you, a Magic Core that produces vast amounts of magical energy simply by the act of breathing. Where others might take days to replenish a fully depleted supply, you take only a few minutes. You’re far more capable of using all this energy as well, channeling it with greater ease and much less strain than someone that relied on magical circuits, and able to rely entirely on your internal energy in case of external magic being absent. Your actual supply itself is vast, outmatching all but the strongest of Servants that are still limited to a terrestrial scale. 

At times, these Sabers do display draconic traits. They find things relating to dragons to be easier to learn and that their powers can naturally take on wyrm-like forms, energy blasts forming into jagged dragon heads to bite foes and such. The reverse is that they become somewhat more vulnerable to anti-dragon attribute attacks, since they are themselves part dragon."

This means that you have the potential to evolve into a Herrscher if exposed to sufficient amounts of Honkai energy and negative emotions.

However, you do not have the physical benefits of being a Herrscher."

You easily and naturally learn spells from this world encompassed by your Magic Focus. Additionally, you can learn spells from outside of it given time and practice. This innate talent also comes in handy when it comes to learning spells not of this world, aiding your understanding and allowing you to grasp them easier."

403,,400,On Borrowed Wings,Witch on the Holy Night,Source,"What look like golden leaves bent in the shape of wings sprouting just behind your back are something far more menacing: Magic Crests taken from mages who once challenged you and failed. The magical energy they provide you exceeds that of the typical family heir twice over, however due to being foreign from you they’re not as efficient when it comes to actually casting their spells than a Magic Crest fully bonded to your body. Furthermore, while they don’t strain you to use unlike a bonded Magic Crest, if defending from powerful attacks they can be forced into a state of temporary shutdown. Alternatively you may have a more efficient but also less personally beneficial solution: An automaton of some kind, full of artificially replicated magic crests with roughly the same amount of magical energy.

If you do take the default option though, don’t worry about the defeated mages. They spend all their time partying and generally enjoying themselves in a little café/carnival/astonishingly pleasant facility that seems to have a means of replenishing itself. All things considered they’re surprisingly upbeat about life despite having their life’s work literally ripped out of them. If you like, a garish door in your Warehouse can take you to the ex-mages who’re inclined to treat you as an old friend. They may no longer be able to use magecraft, but they can probably still be consulted on their methods if you can get them to focus for more than a minute at a time."

A collection of magic circuits extracted by a magus over the years and amassed into a collection of biomass that contains both substantial magical energy, knowledge and spells that have been made stable and easy to activate by the Crest’s complex structure. Not only does all this power considerably augment your normal magecraft, but it also grants you a powerful form of regeneration as part of the Crest’s purpose is to keep it’s host alive so the knowledge can survive to future regenerations. Even if your spine was broken, as long as your body remains alive the crests will piece it back together and as long as your body is still physically there more extensive mutilation can be treated with the help of heavy surgery.

And however it is that it happened, you’ve obtained the Galvanism that serves as the most powerful weapon of Frankenstein’s monster. The most basic function, active at all times, is the recycling of magical energy in the air, drawing any excess energy used back into you to be reused. Even the waste from your enemies can be recycled. It can also let you convert electricity into magical energy, should that be relevant to you. This ability can also function similarly to a mana burst, using incredible amounts of energy for brief but immense boosts to your physical might and speed, potentially letting you match even Servants in combat, and then of course drawing in all the magical energy thrown into the environment to do it all over again. It’s the ultimate defense against attrition, essentially. Also, a strange and possibly unintended function is that it allows you to resist transformations and changes in your body, such as perhaps being turned into a dragon. It’s barely enough to stop your body from taking the plunge, so to speak, so you’ll still show signs that something weird is going on with your form, but at the very least you can force yourself to remain humanoid. And finally, of course, is the suicide attack Blasted Tree, using all the magical energy you possess to blow yourself up alongside the enemy. Hopefully you’ll never have to use it."

These small purple gems are capable of enhancing Chthonic beings or those with a strong connection to the Underworld. Individually they offer an unnoticeable enhancement. But gather hundreds, or thousands, and one will discover themselves growing more powerful. These fragments of darkness are common enough in the Underworld but you will also be able to discover them in future worlds where strife and death are common occurrences."
410,,400,Blessings of the Gods ,Hades,Source,"The steady favor of deities is a truly rare gift, given their capricious natures.However, one thing remains true of all divine beings. They always favor a hero on an epic quest. While you might not always play the hero, their aid will shine down upon you as if you were. Deities, both in this world and in future ones, will offer you their blessings and aid on a regular basis so long as you are in pursuit of a quest on the scale of Hercules, Achilles, or other fabled Greek heroes. Theymay even offer you a choice of boons depending on the local pantheon’s tendencies. Should you find yourself in a world that is lacking in divine beings, you will find those you have met before stepping in from afar."
411,,400,Magic Crest,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"The crystallization of the efforts of generations of magi of the same family. Passed down from the parent to their inheritor child, this is a potent tool for any magus. Magic Crests are a construct forged with the addition of generations of magic circuits from previous inheritors. For those who search the Origin, their Magic Crest is the equivalent of the dreams and hopes of their families, and losing it would be as much as being dead in life. For those who have lost such aspirations, a Magic Crest still represents an incredibly potent tool.

A Magic Crest incorporates the magic circuits of previous generations of the same lineage, effectively adding extra Magic Circuits to a magus’ own inborn ones. This allows the inheritor of the Magic Crest to cast more powerful spells, since they can utilize more magical energy at the same time. But that’s not the limit of the Magic Crest, nor its main function. No, the Magic Circuits inside of the Crest are engraved with all, or almost all, the magical knowledge that the magus accumulated during their lifetime. In other words, a Magic Crest is a spell repository that allows its inheritor to cast the refined spells from previous generations, allowing them to draw power from lifetimes of study without having to have that precise knowledge themselves.

Finally, Magic Crests also have one vital function: as they are meant to be passed down, they also work to ensure the survival of the magus until such a moment comes. In case of lethal damage that doesn’t involve the destruction of the brain or the heart, or catastrophic enough that repair is already in the domain of a miracle or magic, the crest is able to slowly heal the user back to life once more.

You start with a magic crest of a fairly well established lineage. Perhaps it has a few centuries inside of it, and it can effectively add an extra third of magic circuits to you. That’s for 200 CP, but if you choose to pay for 400 CP, your magic crest will be fairly ancient, equivalent to that of the more ancient Lords of the Clock Tower. The power of this mystic code alone is not to be underestimated, and the spells inside of it may allow one to fight even with weaker Servants in the right conditions, also effectively adding around the same amount of magic circuits that you already had in this jump via the ‘Magic Circuits’ perk.

Magic Crest are only used by those magi who follow the traditions of the Mage’s Association. If you want to be involved with another tradition due to your previous purchase, you may obtain an equivalent Philosophy Key or Mystic Code fused to your body that grants similar benefits. 

As a final benefit, you may choose to pass your Magic Crest once per Jump to someone compatible, and you will see it regenerate slowly after ten years, or the next jump, whichever comes sooner. You will be able to engrave a part of your magic circuits, and inscribe as many magecraft spells as you know in it."

This appreciation even goes so far as to affect any supernatural powers you have, allowing you to enhance them with the power of blood. Though, the more powerful the ability the more blood you’ll need in order to see any meaningful enhancement. Please try not to go overboard Jumper, not everyone is as... enamored with blood as you are."
417,,400,Holier Than Thou,Godbound,Source,"There are some among the mighty who wield power and influence their lesser simply cannot match, whether from being ordained with a superior role or suckling from a particularly ripe source of divine power. The purity and purpose of what you have achieved through transhuman training or your ordained role has reached the level of a concept Word embodying the superlative example of whatever you are. You yet retain the potential to achieve the power of a concept Word for any form you have through similar sorcerous experimentation or training to how you originally achieved your state here.

Naturally the mighty benefit more from this than the weak; if you were a parasite god, you would have metastasized into a monster capable of enslaving an entire nation or even realm with three other Words to your name, though one remains your focus-and undaunted by pantheons of Godbound who haven’t done significant preparation before mounting an assault on you. If you were a Made God, not only are you fully repaired and refurbished but you likely have an arsenal of augmentations comparable to the greatest godwalker components and have two more Words under your command. And if you were an angel, you would be one of the great angelic tyrants who once stood guard over a major concept of reality-and now likely command an entire circle of Hell. Angels in particular gain the power of a Godbound’s command over four other Words of Creation in addition to their baseline one, to fulfil the complexity of their purpose. As for Unbound and Eldritches, suffice to say that that entire nations would dread provoking their wrath if they knew of them.

To take the example of a lesser being such as a human, you would be sharply limited by the normal traits of a human being; lesser gifts would include superlative luck and uncanny influence with humans wherever you go, while greater attacks could include the power to make your attacks count as a magical weapon or an indomitable will towards mental powers. However, you would nevertheless be able to develop new Gifts and improvise miracles themed within human perfection like any Godbound-including the universal divine powers of smiting your enemies with shows of human strength.

This perk may be repurchased for additional Concept Words. Concept words purchased from this source are associated with higher beings, comprehensive improvement of one’s base state and most fundamental workings of the Celestial Engines-or the direst forces of Uncreated Night. Inheritors of a Broken Heaven do not gain additional Words of Creation from subsequent purchases, but frankly even purchasing one of these makes you a force to be reckoned with. Each is as qualitatively superior to other Concept Words as the Words Engineering, Artifice, Sorcery and Fate are to other Words of Creation.

In a fit of enlightenment, memorising the moment when the Made Gods’ shards engraved themselves on your very soul, you learned a unique trait: The power to shatter artifacts of all kinds and direct their mystic energies to grant their powers to those loyal to your cause. You must still be capable of actually sundering such a magical artifact, not all artifacts may grant powers commensurate with those of the Godbound and it should go without saying that there is usually a finite amount of mystic power to bestow on others. But on a scale that can cover entire civilisations so long as your faith is present and prevalent throughout them, you can administer the distribution of the unleashed enchantments with the same ease other Godbound can hear and respond to prayers."
419,,400,The Brush of Death ,Godbound,Source,"Ever since the fall of Heaven and the corruption of Hell, the terror of an agonizing afterlife has filled countless humans with panic. While true faiths can anchor a soul to its native realm in peaceful sleep, those who die alone and far from solace may cling to this world for fear of what is to come. In a more proactive approach, with the assistance of an enterprising, innovative sorcerer you’ve somehow given yourself the traits of an undead being while still technically being alive.

For 100 CP you have the traits of a common husk. You feel no pain, you do not rot while you remain intact and you need not breathe, drink, eat or sleep. Organ damage doesn’t slow you down, but you lack your body’s natural healing ability and crushing your skull, breaking your spine or removing one or more major limbs generally takes you out of the fight. For 400 CP you instead have the traits of one of the greater undead. Whether your soul was kindled with mystical power to bring out your potential as a great warrior or the rites of your living undeath were far more elaborate you boast might, swiftness and resilience beyond the human norm.

Undead sometimes have unique powers, of which you retain a human’s level of intelligence and cunning for free. The common husks seldom have more than one or two minor abilities-such as the ability to appear as a normal living person to anything short of a Sun miracle of true sight, to a frenzied might, to simple physical enlargement or hardening by your occult sustenance. Great undead can just about challenge a pantheon of Godbound despite their relative fragility, boasting at least a half-dozen lesser Gifts reflecting their living talents and being bound to a Word of their choice. Alternatively or concurrently, they may lose some living talents to gain more powerful talents of the undead such as the power to inhabit any intact husk nearby and remanifest it’s body, instantly killing those already on the brink of death in combat, filling lesser foes with the delirious hunger of the undead or simply power equal to being Wordbound to Death."
420,,400,Strength Within,Wizarding World,Source,"Magic is affected by one’s emotions. Gleaned from centuries of studies and experience, this fact is plainly obvious. One’s magic is weakest when they have fallen under the veil of despair. And in the harshest of cases, one’s magic could even be lost to them, the crushing pressure of sadness and dismay leaving them as little more than shadows of their former selves.

And contrasting this, in times of severe distress, where one’s emotions are running high, that is when you will find your magic to be at its most powerful. Spells cast in such a state will often demonstrate a level of power beyond what their wielder can ordinarily cast. Many spells are even designed to be more reactive to such emotions such as the Patronus Charm for example.

But for you, instead of relying simply on emotions, you have learned to tap into the wellspring of determination within yourself, a form of power that you never knew you had. Even as a child, you will find yourself capable of pushing through events that would break even the most hardened of souls and come out the other side hurt but healing. With this, your spells are twofold stronger and abilities that rely on your emotions are even greater still. With this, you are no mere student. With this, you can be a legend."

A supernatural force of some kind has chosen you as their personal agent, endowing you with powers and abilities suited to their themes. You could be a second Great Protector capable of projecting blasts of wind that can knock even other gods from their feet, a contemporary of Moon Knight or even the wielder of a forgotten Asgardian artifact on par with Mjolnir or Hela’s headdress. You could even, like Echo, be the latest in a long line of matriarchal Native American shaman warriors endowed with the support of your ancestors as well as great empath powers. At most, this can grant something like a shadow of the Mighty Thor’s power as Jane Foster was-but if you choose esoterica and mysticism over pure might, this can potentially also offer stranger abilities (like altering the night sky or sealing another deity into a living vessel) and divine communion like that which Moon Knight enjoys rather than merely the power of an absent one. Even a god can benefit greatly from this. Perhaps additional aid from the divine is what sets an Allfather above his fellow Aesir-or the key for a mere goddess of death to surpass him."
438,,400,Primal Force,Marvel Primal,Source,"Turns out Mjolnir isn’t just an enchanted hunk of Uru on a stick. That star-forged metal was used to imprison the God Tempest, a cosmic and possibly sapient thunderstorm that nearly destroyed Asgard. You have an enchanted weapon containing a similar primal power, such as the Cask of Ancient Winters, or something else. The first dawn perhaps, or a primeval ocean. Whatever it is, you gain vast power over related things while keeping possession of this weapon, and it serves as an ideal conduit of your powers. It will also return to you if thrown."
439,,400,Master of Your Domain ,Marvel Primal,Source,"To be Asgardian alone is not enough to claim divinity, you must be a god of something. You have a domain, a natural phenomena or a skillset like hunting, in which you are superhumanly knowledgeable, skilled and/or have control over. This can be purchased multiple times, with Asgardian origin getting two domains per purchase.

440,,400,Born from Eternity,Thor: Love and Thunder,Source,"Thor, Zeus, and their kin are gods. The transcendental entity Eternity is the embodiment of the universe, and a GOD. Eternity is so unfathomably beyond Thor and the others that I’m describing him with all caps, bold text that’s underlined and in italics. What’s this got to do with you? Good question. It turns out that you died and Eternity resurrected you. Or you could’ve been infused with his essence. The cosmic energy within your body grants you great power, which stems from an impossibly miniscule fragment of Eternity’s being. This grants you physical abilities, lifespan, and healing factor on par with a strong Asgardian. In addition to these gifts, you can fly at hypersonic speeds and shoot beams of cosmic energy from your eyes. This, like other abilities, grows with practice, but it can also develop through other means. As I said, Eternity is the embodiment of the universe. As you travel to different jumps, dimensions, or universes, you will passively absorb some parts of that universe as well, bolstering your powers and unlocking new capabilities. A plane of fire might unlock pyrokinesis, or a visit to an afterlife may result in you discovering latent potential in necromancy."
441,,400,Avatar,Moon Knight,Source,"You were deemed worthy of being an Avatar of the Ennead. Be it on your death bed or some other circumstance, you ended up taking the hand of a God and being their eyes in the mortal world or even their hand of Justice. This has given you various abilities like increased strength, speed and durability the likes Moon Knight possesses as well as seeing the invisible like certain Jackals. Depending on your Patron in question this can even extend to other unique abilities.

You may choose which God to be the patron of, by default being one of the Egypt Gods. You can adjust this per Jump to a local deity. It can also be Jumpchan but for purposes of balance their power for this Perk will cap out at whatever is the average level of a God in the local setting. You don’t need your Patrons permission to use your powers, however if you work together they can channel their powers through you, possibly even allowing you to move the entire Night sky. This Perk works as a Capstone Booster."
442,,400,You Are What You Eat,Marvel: What If...?,Source,"You could spend years, perhaps decades, practicing and training to increase your power... or you could cheat instead. An ancient mystic secret has given you the ability to absorb a creature’s power and assimilate its traits. The only catch? You have to overpower it first. Any supernatural creature can be targeted by this ability, but starting small will probably work the best. After all, these gains can snowball ridiculously with enough time. Just be sure you don’t lose control of your new aspects, and make no mistake, that is a very real possibility."
443,,400,Bad End Knife,Helltaker,Source,"If put through the heart of a living being, this knife will suck out their soul and allow you to enslave their body and use their life force to either add years to your life or to give you a 0.001% increase in power.

You might also change this to a Sledgehammer with which to bash knees instead of hearts. This iteration gives you a 0.01% increase in power in exchange for not being able to have slaves capable of walking. This knife cannot be merged with any other item but may be teleported inside of a target’s heart if the target has a durability similar or lower to an elephant’s or if the target has been subdued."
444,,400,Power Induction,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Source,"Like Armin Zola you know how to activate the latent potential for super powers in others. This process is not easy: it takes time and resources; it will only work on a small minority of people and even then will be lethal fairly often; and it will be very hard to control the precise powers that they develop. Still, with time and resources you could create an army of super powered beings, by tapping into this latent potential. They will be very unlikely to rival the likes of Thor or the Hulk, but with time you could create quite a variety and number of super beings.

Specialized knowledge of specific aspects of comic book science or magic can be incorporated into the process to help improve the results, granting better control over the powers granted, greater powers, and/or making the process more likely to succeed. Loki empowered the Wrecking Crew through such means, and the original Baron Zemo created Wonder Man this way.

Of course, it’s theoretically possible to do this in the Marvel universe without this perk. While this will give you the knowledge of genetics to screen for it, and get an idea of what sort of comic book energy or radiation might be needed to induce powers, the bigger advantage is that it will allow you to continue to grant powers in these ways in future worlds where space gods have not altered the human genome to introduce the potential to develop super powers."
445,,400,Divine Domain,Amalgam Comics,Source,"You are not just flesh, but the embodiment of a concept. It could be a natural force, like the storm or a volcano, or an abstract concept like tyranny or rhetoric. Either way, your understanding of your domain and all things related to it is absolute, you can sense any related phenomena at great distances and control your domain, though at times it may be... complex. A war god could cause war to taper off or kill less innocents, but might find it difficult to stop a war altogether, for instance."
446,,400,Thought Chakra ,Avatar: Beginnings,Source,"At the crown of the head, the Thought Chakra is the recipient of cosmic energies, interfered with by earthly attachments. It is said some time before the Avatar, people bent these energies instead of the elements. You have mastered the skill of energybending, capable of matching any feats with it from the Avatar Universe, including sharing out or rescinding the powers of the elements. As a final gift, you have learned to let go of the things you prize if need be, and could quite contentedly live as an ascetic guru, if that’s what you want."
447,,400,Hybrid   ,Fate/Zero,Source,"Somewhere, far in your ancestry, you had someone who wasn’t quite human join the family. Despite having happened centuries prior to your birth, even now your family still enjoys certain benefits from that inhuman ancestor. What these benefits are exactly is a matter of what that ancestor was. A werewolf might have passed on enhanced physical abilities and senses to you, along with a tendency to grow hair quicker. A dragon might grant you incredibly tough skin, great resistance to heat and the ability to spit small amounts of fire. Whatever your choice is, these abilities will put you above your fellow man. "
448,,400,Hybrid Modifier,Toaruverse,Source,Making Magician-Esper hybrids is dangerous for the subject and it would be a shame if you are the only perfect Magician-Esper hybrid to exist. With this you gain a device the size and shape of a coffin and it has its own internal energy supply allowing it to operate for an infinite amount of time and be used as many as you want. The main function of the device is to create a perfect Magician-Esper hybrid that can freely use Magic and Esper ability without having their blood vessels bursting or feel any side-effects at all. This also can be used to regulate and stabilize unstable abilities like those prone to berserking along with fixing those who merge two or more incompatible systems or energies together making them blend and work together nicely.
449,,400,You did it instantly,Ragna Crimson,Source,"The process to turn a human into a member of the Brethren Bloodlines, known by the Winged Brethren as the Thirteen Stages, isn’t usually a quick one. The average time is for an individual to take 10 to 15 years to complete their transformation, with some taking even more. Yet this amount of time is of extreme importance for the Seija, for the lesser amount of time spent equals a higher potential in the power of the bloodlines of the Sieja. Your maturation process was instant, a feat only replicated by another Seija in recent history. This translates to you having a greater talent and potency in the powers of the Seija, a greater magical capabilities and physical strength. Although your full potential remains untapped for now, you would still rank among the top 4 dragons in your bloodline. Perhaps more training or some powerful motivator would allow you to unlock your full power and achieve your destiny as the greatest on your bloodline.

If you are not a Seija, your potential in case of being transformed into one remains the same as
described, instead applying to whatever race you find yourself as. And this great potential would extend when it comes to other race transformation processes, allowing you to become one of the highest examples of whatever race you end up becoming with a great potential in their innate abilities, as well as skipping any duration that this transformation process may have had, reaching maturity instantly."
450,,400,Half-Dragon,Ragna Crimson,Source,"While the dragons are the enemies of mankind, it’s not unheard of for humans to be born with some dragon traits. This is usually a cause of rejection by most humans, but in the Silver Corps they can appreciate the potential that someone like you who has been born with some dragon traits, such as your eye or some limb being close to that of a dragon’s.

First, this means that you have an abnormally high magical potential, putting you close to a low-grade Seija at least in that department. Second, you can heal your wounds by consuming the flesh of dragons, temporally gaining a regeneration factor similar to theirs. In future jumps, you may designate a similar supernatural-race to have a few basic traits, allowing you to similarly regenerate through consuming their flesh and getting some of their supernatural potential."
451,,400,Spirit Stone,Trinity Wonder,Source,"The High Walker created and gifted his disciple one of these stones when he found out that she too had a Dragon Soul. He did this in the vain hope that it could help prevent her from ever having to fall to the fate of those with Dragon Souls. This turquoise stone has the rather impressive property of being able to store a theoretically endless amount of mana, and can release it again as needed. The High Walker had hoped that by continuously pouring the excess mana into the stone, Emily would manage what he didn’t and avoid turning into a wild dragon. If the stone is broken all the mana within will be released, and potentially absorbed, at once."
452,,400,Natural Gathering,Trinity Wonder,Source,"This is the same ability that was of great use for Wujin. With it there is no need to manually gather energy. Just by living your body can automatically take in any available energy around it to restore itself. The rate of recovery is only limited to how much is available to you. Just holding some form of mana or ki crystal would allow you to near-instantly drain it of power. In an area rich in energy, it will be like you can never run out. Battles of attrition are often meaningless against you. However since you no longer need to consciously think about it, it would be easy for you to not notice if you end up somewhere with little energy available, leading you to wasting energy when you need it most."
453,,400,Mejai's Soulstealer ,League of Legends,Source,"The ultimate Do or Die artifact, this unassuming tome can be a weapon of unimaginable power. Unremarkable on its own, this tome will tear out the souls of the wielder's victims, granting more and more magical might, until the wielder reaches 25 souls- At which point, Mejai's Soulstealer becomes the most potent magical artifact on Runeterra, lending such potency to the wielder's magic that they can obliterate whole squadrons of lesser men with a single spell. Still, this comes with a price, and should the bearer of this book ever suffer defeat, Mejai's Soulstealer will lose its grip on the souls that give it power and revert back into a normal book until the wielder can restore their glory."
454,,400,Mystic Ways,Arcane,Source,"Magic is a mysterious but powerful force which has shaped Runeterra in countless ways. Perhaps you were born with the talent, perhaps you suffered a curse you were able to turn to your own ends, or perhaps you found some magical artefact, but however you came by it you’re now capable of a specific, limited style of magic. Perhaps you’re a stoneweaver like Taliyah, you’ve bonded with a Darkin weapon, you’ve learned to channel the powers of the sun like the Solari, you’ve studied the mystic ways of the Kinkou, you stole an arcane artefact from a Shuriman tomb, or you were afflicted with the curse of the Shadow Isles and learned to control it.

Whatever form your magic takes, it has a specific theme, and to begin with is limited mostly to the personal scale. If you practise with it, though, you’re sure to be able to increase its power over time, and one day you’ll be able to accomplish truly incredible feats."

You may devour the heart of a divine creature in order to gain a chance of getting a new “Divine Title”, “Transformed in Body”, “Transformed in Soul”, or “Godhand” option.

Malign forces cannot break you, rot you, drive you mad like other victims so easily-no, far more often they enter a grotesque symbiosis with your body as a sort of seedbed, empowered by their propagation and infestation of you while in turn becoming a beacon for whatever it is that has bonded with you to spread and strengthen itself. It is even possible for you to develop new, perverse spells based on whatever force infuses you; though Mohg’s invention of blood magic was likely expedited by both his divinity and the pact he struck with the Formless Mother, roll around in the Scarlet Rot enough and instead of festering in ruin you could create spells or incantations capable of channelling it’s power. Or channel it into your body instead, controlling how much you deign the corruption to manifest upon it or granting yourself useful mutations such as wings and claws infused with its power. No doubt with greater power of your own and/or a superb partner like his you too could one day create a full school of magic to call your own. Most disturbingly of all, carnal gratification bolsters your might and spellcraft.

You could derive a noticable amount of mana by drawing from its power, though it would need to bask in the sun for some time to regenerate that energy...but a truly wise magus could study the bones themselves, seeing reflections of the magic and artifice during the Golden City’s construction and gaining further insight into the law mage Azor’s workings of miracles during that time.

460,,400,Paid In Blood And Agony ,MtG - Shandalar,Source,"Many of the most powerful Black magics carry a price beyond mere mana. Contracts with demonic entities or drawing upon the power of undeath can often cost a mage a portion of their life force, and even the mana-fuelled echoes of such acts carry similar prices. Likewise, a Lord Of The Pit will not stay loyal for long if not fed... and if you can’t sacrifice other creatures under your command, it’s quite happy to take a Wurm-sized bite out of you. But though everything has a price, that doesn’t mean you have to pay the toll in such a way. Though you cannot simply ignore such debts, you have the unique ability to pay costs with anything else of equivalent ‘value’. Where before you might have been forced to bleed yourself dry for an edge in battle, now you could instead sacrifice a portion of your knowledge, another creature’s life, or perhaps even pay the toll through a vast expenditure of mana instead. The ‘price’ will be based on what your debtor considers valuable or not, but they will not try to cheat you out of more than they are due."

This art has shifted over the years, rules being added or removed, techniques being forgotten and invented until the modern age's interpretation of the art barely resembles the original. That said, you are seemingly a follower of it and as such may reap its rewards. You have learned a meditative technique that allows you to access a nebulous well of power, fed into by everyone who stands upon the same battlefield. This well of power can only be accessed by one person at a time, but the benefits it holds are immense. Mighty spells can be cast with the snap of a finger, your strength can be multiplied several times over, or magics that aid your allies and interfere with your foes can be cast - and all of this effectively for free. As mentioned however, only one person may use this at a time. If you intend to attack with all this might, you will need to attack alone."
462,,400,Halfway Fallen ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Source,"Normally, it is only white Rukh that reside within people. However, when someone curses their fate and attempts to defy destiny, they ‘fall into depravity’, dyeing their soul and Rukh black. You, however, are an almost unprecedented case, as not only is your Rukh a mixture of both black and white, but both halves seem to co-exist inside of you without annihilating each other like they normally should. As such, you are able to use both to power your abilities. While white Rukh occurs naturally in this world, black Rukh is rare and is produced by negative emotions such as hatred or despair. Unlike with white Rukh, though, people can tap into the Magoi of black Rukh outside of their body even if they’re not Magi.

However, this unique state of being also had a curious added benefit – namely, that you can now wield powers that would normally conflict or be mutually-exclusive with each other without issue. With this bonus, a Magician could even obtain and use a Metal Vessel of their own, though such a thing would be truly terrifying to behold."
463,,400,Magician(800),Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Source,"For 800 CP, you’re not a mere Magician anymore. No, you’re something far greater – you’re one of the eponymous Magi. As such, you have the unique power to be able to draw Magoi from not just the Rukh in your body, but also those outside as well, providing a nigh-limitless supply of magical energy. Needless to say, this puts you among the strongest in the world in terms of raw power, though you’ll mostly be limited to fairly simple effects unless you put some effort into actually studying magic. Fortunately, all Magi also possess immense magical talent, so it shouldn’t take too long for you to learn to cast more complex spells. If you wish, you may take the place of one of the three existing Magi or become a new, fourth Magi.

It’s worth noting that Magicians can’t usually wield Metal or Household Vessels, as the Magician’s Rukh and the Djinn’s Rukh tend to interfere with one another. If you have some kind of perk that allows you to wield abilities that are normally antithetical to each other, however, you can overcome this limitation without issue.

464,,400,Source of Power,Magi: Alma Torran,Source,"The Magicians of this world are undoubtedly powerful, far more so than the world that will come. After all, their magical energies are supplied not by some limited internal reserves, but received directly from the almighty god who created the world. That said, however, there is one noticeable flaw to this system – it is reliant on an external source, and so any damage or changes to that source could potentially be catastrophic. Indeed, thanks to David’s meddling, Ill Ilah is gradually turning from a radiant white to a dull black, and the Magoi it supplies is gradually growing impure.

But you need not worry about this problem, though. Now, none of your powers are reliant on any external sources, and as such, any external factors that could potentially affect your abilities will not affect you. Even as every other Magician despairs when their supplies of Magoi grows weaker or becomes cut off altogether, you’ll be able to stand above them all and carry on casting as if nothing had ever happened."

466,,400,Installation,Fate/Extella,Source ,"A packet of data, a subroutine made to be latched onto the spiritual core of a Servant. An Install Skill
is what it sounds like, a Servant Skill that can be installed into any Servant. From weak abilities that
provide minor buffs to power new traits, Install Skills can cover any potential Servant Skill. The same
Skill can even be combined, creating slightly stronger Install Skills from identical components. But
there are limits to how many can be had at once. Servants start with only two slots for Install Skills
and can unlock up to six more as they grow stronger and make close bonds with the people around
them. Install Skills of a similar type will boost each other, such as offense focused Install Skills giving
minor increases to other offence focused Install Skills.

This option is free to both Servants and Invaders. It represents the ability to generate Install Skills
from defeating powerful enemies, a random chance of giving one of random Skill and Rank. Weak
enemies, such as Shadow Servants, are likely to give minimally powerful abilities but powerful Top
Servants could give you B or A Rank Skills. For Masters to gain and keep this perk or for
Servants/Invaders to keep it past this jump, they must pay 400CP. "
467,,400,Divine Ancestry,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Source ,"The blood of gods is your birthright, hero. Like many heroes here, you have divine ancestry, likely
being directly descended from a Divine Spirit as one of your parents. For some, this can grant
immense boons and for others, it is barely noticeable outside of things that have special interactions
with those that are partially divine or more. Thus, taking any tier of this option allows you to choose
any degree of being a demigod, from being distantly descended from a god to being the child of a
mortal and a greater god, perhaps even Zeus himself.

The actual benefits of your parentage are decided by the following. The benefits gained from the
free/50 tier is nothing much. At most, specific abilities and items may react in more beneficial or
more hostile ways to you depending on what degree of you is divine. Your divine parent, or ancestor,
is unlikely to be aware that you are their child. Demigods are exceedingly common, it seems. 

For 100CP, you may see minor benefits. Most common is somewhat greater physical abilities
compared to the free perk given above, enough to put you two or three times more powerful than
normal and you may also find yourself with a minor magical ability related to your parent, such as
the ability to walk on water. Your divine ancestor likely has little care for you, though they are aware
you exist. 

For 200CP, the benefits are fairly considerable. Several times as much magical energy as normal for
someone here and a significant talent for magic, should your parent be a Goddess of Magic. A
natural magical ability to control the seas for hundreds of meters around you, even turning it to
lethal combative use, should Poseidon have been your father. Very minor secondary abilities are also
possible, such as being able to perceive magic with your other senses or speaking to sea-life in the
above two examples. Your divine ancestor knows you exist and at times, looks in on you. It is always
worth keeping in mind potential mortal servants to act in their name and they may at times consider
giving you a quest. 

For 400CP, you’ll fully come into your divine parentage and find yourself a match for Heracles, at
least before accounting for that legendary hero’s training in life. The benefits can be wide and varied
but focusing on one blessing could see you with a physique to match Greece’s greatest hero above, with arms that can lift and throw mountains, crush the skulls of Divine Beasts with your bare fists or
even briefly hold up the Grecian sky, a body that can survive tangling with dragons and a talent for
war unsurpassed by all but a few hundred men across all of history. You can also choose another major ability if you wish or substitute it for three or four lesser abilities that might be found in the
lower tiers of this. As a Demigod of this level, you can be assured that your parent watches you
personally, or at least has their agents do so, and will drag you into their own conflicts whether you
like it or not. It won’t be without it’s rewards, even with all the danger."
468,,400,Blessings of the Sun,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"The power of the Gods does not flow equally in all rivers of life. In some it is but a trickle, a sign of
heritage but little else. In you before this, it may have been a healthy stream. But now you’ve
become a raging river of divine power, a force that even the Gods would be wary of. The divine
blessings you have as a Demigod, or the divine power of your own if you are a god or sage, have
been enormously enhanced towards the arts of war. In terms of raw power, the great mountain
ranges are but wheat before a divine scythe to you, using physical and magical power to bring whole
nations to ruin in the course of a single battle. 

The Authorities of your parent, or those you have yourself from here, grant intensely increased
innate abilities in regards to combat. A child of the Sun God would find the ability to command fire
of all kinds, to intense heats that scorch even Divine Spirits, to amounts that smother kingdoms in
holy fire, even fine control that allows for flight or sealing of wounds with heat. They would be
immune to the ravages of fire, heat and the sun, even finding themselves greatly favoured by beings
associated and connected with the Authority their power is based on. It would be not uncommon to
receive gifts and aid from the spirits of the Sun or even other Gods associated with it, for the above
example. Finally, this divine empowerment renders you enormously resistant to the attempts of
lesser divine beings to act against you, blunting their blows and dulling the magic of their spells if
they hold less uniquely divine power and ancestry. "
469,,400,Snake Jutsu,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source ,"A blessing from a great god, though it may seem a curse to some, has bound your being to a specific
kind of animal. Snakes, spiders, canines, some great spirit that lives within that breed is partially
connected to you now. What others see normally is just a few traits of that creature, such as a
smattering of snake scales or the ears of a dog. But the benefits are many. Your physical abilities
have significantly increased, overall enough to endanger a notable hero or powerful oni if you aren’t
fighting head on, but is specialised further to some attribute related to your animal. A snake could
give you truly unnatural agility and flexibility, while a spider may increase your reflexes and twitch
movements to far higher degrees. Your affinity for your chosen animal allows for them to be easily
tamed and trained to act as capable ninja companions or allies in battle, as well as greatly improving
the strength of magical spells or abilities that are related to the animal. 

That same affinity also translates into great favour from any greater being that is connected to this
animal, such as gods of the same breed. Your final and most potent gift as part of this is the ability to
manifest aspects of the great god that gave you this power by expending magical energy. A snake
lady who was empowered by the Yamata no Orochi could summon the beasts’ heads to attack foes
by expending great energy or manifest drops of it’s deadly poison with a lesser expenditure. It is
even possible to summon your god at levels’ beyond it’s original power if enough strength is spent
this way. "

Ereshkigal. Like the famous story, you have the power to destroy whole mountains, using your body
or your magical power. However, perhaps due to being less greedy than Ishtar, you are quite a
focused God when it comes to your Authority. You possess a single Authority through this option, operating at the same scale as your raw power given above. Further notes on how Authorities work

underworld or taking command of beasts that are connected to the skies is possible. However, you are only somewhat experienced in the uses of these powers and it will take time to go
beyond the basic and intermediate physical uses of your powers."

something more than it is? You thought there just might exist that possibility and by chance, stumbled upon the principles that a great demon would later use in a plan to rewrite all of history. You have the ability to create mana from destruction. Destroying objects or structures releases at
least as much magical energy as what is needed to destroy the objects in that way while destroying
living creatures with souls such as humans or their overall groupings such as societies, will give a
return many times greater than the energy put in.  
  
Better still, you find it easy to gather and control the mana released by this destruction and put it to
your own use, either storing it or immediately expending it. If you wished to store it however, you
are able to form it into solid spirals, circles and loops that continuously cycles the energy and, over
time, slowly increases the amount and potency of the energy contained within these magical
structures. Making more from where there was less without adding anything more."
473,,400,Book of Horrors,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Source ,"A leather bound book, depicting several screaming faces on each cover side. The book has no name
and no author written into it but what is within could horrify even the bravest of souls. A ritual book
of the old and outer gods, the sort of cruel artefact intended to bring about the time when the stars
align and much more. Within the tome are the instructions and chants required for the summoning
and binding of a great many eldritch monsters, from cruel spirits to bug-like alien beings to shapes- shifting monsters from the icy poles. Even the Great Ones and beings higher than them can
potentially be summoned and controlled, to some variable degree, with the right ritual. But many of
these things have costs, perhaps too great to bear. For those unwilling to do such things, the book
also contains a very extensive library of spells, allowing for moderate ability in over a dozen broad
fields of magic when studied extensively, though many of these spells will twist or warp reality to be cast. There are even more powerful magics within the book but they will require an experienced and
skillful magus to unlock, as the book has protections to prevent you unwittingly harming your own
mind too easily. As a final measure of defense for it’s master, the book is also able to act as a small- scale weapon, suddenly extruding many very large and very sharp tentacle-mouths and mouth- tentacles to attack foes within few dozen feet, crushing and grinding and chewing up most bodies,
leaving the book purring in contentment."

Your family decides the number and potency of your magic circuits, the kind and depth of your magical specialisation, the unique traits of your magic and the potential you have to go further. Certainly, there may be some mutants here and there that buck the system but to the Association, a family as old and storied as yours is far more valuable than the transient nature of a one off prodigy. You hail from a line that is centuries or even thousands of years old. The heir to their circuits and knowledge, it’s ensured you have an impressive amount of power at your fingers. Both quantity and quality of your circuits is among the highest found in Magi of this age and you are generally talented with all magecraft you try your hand at. You may have an exceptionally strong affinity for your Element to improve studies relating to it even more or choose to spread out more and appear as one of the rare Average Ones, of lesser talent in one field in exchange for talent and ability at all five traditional Elements. Your family inheritance ensured you are wealthy, influential and very well connected in the Association, with many would-be allies and mentors hoping to benefit from your name even before you arrived for your first period of study.

Incantations come quickly to you, casting at much higher speeds than all but other prodigies, and your skill with the core arts of magecraft have significantly increased to an expert level. Your family arts are of course much more impressive, as the Magic Crest on your body holds the work of many generations of your forefathers on your one chosen specialty in modern magecraft. As an Alchemist or Elementalist or Spiritualist or whatever else, you’d be well-educated enough to capably run your own lessons in the Clocktower. You might even be doing that now, considering it’s almost certain that you have at least one impressive Title from the Association to honour your achievements, along with a widely known reputation through the Association. A famous lineage in the same style will also optionally be your family in future worlds.

When your body can withstand the force of a blast, you may stand still and concentrate instead to absorb it. Don’t get too excited about your new power, however. If a certain type of energy is poisonous to you or is an especially powerful weakness you possess, it’ll still tremendously hurt you. The power of the Silver Crystal will still be a big threat to you if you’re weak to it. And getting overloaded is certainly a thing that can happen with this.

You have a weaker copy of the Silver Crystal, which functions as a power enhancer. Any spell run through it has its powers increased to powerful effect. It takes energy from your life force and concentrates it into magic power. But if you put effort into fiddling with it, then maybe you could use it to enhance other sources of energy. While it lacks the power of resurrection and purification of the original Silver Crystal, it is still quite potent.

It can take any form you wish, like a lotus or tear shape. You can change this form at any time as well with some magic on your part. It comes in a dazzlingly jeweled case, the crystal itself hanging from a silver chain beaded with pearls. Luxurious red velvet pads the inside of the case. This case cannot be damaged and it will never rot away, and the silver chain cannot break unless you wish it to break. You may take the crystal off the chain if you wish.

time as your soul grows, making you more than you are. This can be purchased multiple times.
Domains are capable or both synergy and interference with one another, based on their nature

479,,400,Bandwidth and Wavelength,With This Ring,Source,"Most magical traditions are based on connections:
connecting your soul to the world around you, connecting objects to concepts or energy
sources. This not only increases your ability to use magic and your ease of using external or
foreign sources of power, it also makes it easier for you to connect yourself, others, or objects
to the varied sources of energy that exist. Moreover, with a few decades of practice, some
serious preparations and major effort, this would allow you connect your soul to a concept or
plane of existence to become a Lord, as Nabu of Cillia and Klarion the Witch Boy have done.
However, you would not be limited to Order or Chaos as they are; the Red, the Green, the Grey,
the Subtle Realms, the Shadowlands, a fragment of the color spectrum, Life, Death, or a domain

concept and inherently complicate your ability to use opposing concepts or domains."

events that you don’t want to miss, even if by all rights you shouldn’t have been able to be there.
You could be in Alaska then through a series of contrived coincidences and airport checks be

482,,400,Blessing Without End ,DC Occult,Source,"The Endless are a group of powerful beings, each embodying a fundamental concept of some kind. The Endless are far older and more powerful than mere gods and rule absolutely over their domains. You have somehow caught the attention of one of these beings and have been granted a boon related to their sphere of power.

● Blessing of Delirium: ​Once Delirium was known as Delight, but some event forever altered the youngest of the Endless into a twisted form. With the favor of Delirium, you never need fear this same fate. Your mind is a rock upon which madness breaks. Nothing, be it the passage of eternity or staring into the eyes of the Old Ones, may so much as scratch your sanity.

● Blessing of Despair: Despair finds you to be one of only a handful of beings in all of creation that she actually likes. For finding a soft spot in her heart, she rewarded you with an immense willpower that will forever shield you from the depression which she Embodies.

● Blessing of Destruction: Destruction is a strange being. Having long since grown tired of his duty as the embodiment of destruction and abandoned it to instead pursue (very flawed, due to his nature as the opposite) attempts at creation instead. With his favor, you gain insight into the structure of all things, and more to the point, the weakest points in the structures. Whenever you wish to destroy something, be it a simple physical object, a vast conspiracy, or something more abstract, you will always know where it is most vulnerable.

● Blessing of Desire: Desire is the personification of lust and desire. With this blessing you are among the most beautiful people to ever live. Even beyond your base attractiveness, everyone who looks upon you, or even a likeness of your image, will see something slightly different as your features warp in their mind to be ever so slightly closer to what they consider ideal beauty.
 
● Blessing of Dream: Dream of the Endless rules over the Dreaming. And he’s honestly kind of a dick. But his involvement in the lives of mortals is really not that uncommon, and you are one of his favorites in millennia. With his blessing, you are now always capable of lucid dreaming and may project yourself into the Dreaming at will, allowing you to access both the whole of the plane itself and all the dreams of every living being. Additionally, as dreams and illusions are very closely related, any illusions you cast are enhanced and you are capable of completely ignoring any other illusions that attempt to affect you.

● Blessing of Death: ​Don’t fear the reaper, baby. Death is not exactly what you’d expect. Oh, she once was, but then she took a tradition of becoming mortal and facing a mortal’s death one day a century and her entire perspective changed. Now, instead of appearing as something unnerving, she appears as a rather attractive and upbeat goth girl. After all, everyone deserves one last hot date. As Death favors you, she will turn a blind eye to your death once per jump, reviving you and healing your wounds in the process. After all, why rush things? All will eventually find themselves before her one final time, no matter how many come before.

● Blessing of Destiny: Destiny is the eldest of the Endless and the one most subsumed by his duties. For him to favor a mortal is a very strange thing indeed... but then, you’re not exactly a stranger to strangeness, are you? With the favor of Destiny, you are granted much greater freedom from fate than others. Any attempts to alter your destiny are doomed to failure, as are any attempts to look into a future which directly involves you.
"
483,,400,Baby Magic ,DC Occult,Source,"​Oh no, not you. You don’t need those training wheels on your power. Your mastery allows you to eschew requirements for magic outside of the magical energy needed to power the spell and the focus needed to shape it. You don’t need wands or reagents or even incantations for your magic, simply the will and knowledge of how to accomplish something.

This isn’t without downsides, of course. It’s always somewhat both harder and less effective the more powerful the spell and the more components you eschew. Throwing a simple fireball without a chant won’t make much of a difference, but attempting to cast world rending spells that normally require elaborate rituals and hours of incantations are another matter entirely.

You may freely break any sort of binding deal or contract made with a magical being while retaining any and all benefits you received from said deal. Just, you know, be prepared for a pissed off benefactor if you decide to do so.

Of course, this does have one limitation. Namely that it only works on one deal at a time. Using it to retain the benefits of a new deal will result in the forfeiture of all those gained from the last such deal. Still, this is quite the talent you have here. Use it carefully.

It’s more subtle than that. By imbibing the blood of another , you gain a fraction of their powers temporarily. The blood of a normal person will let you heal your own wounds and extend your lifespan to unnatural lengths. The blood of a wizard may give you access to his particular brand of magic. The blood of supernatural creatures such as vampires or werewolves will grant you the abilities of a fledgeling of whatever species you drank of, without any of their corresponding weaknesses. You are skilled enough in your art that you will never succumb and become a vampire or werewolf permanently through your magic unless you intend to. However, these abilities are temporary ­while you may extend the duration of them given practice, once the blood leaves your system you will revert to normal. Generally, about 250 ml of blood will give you enough “juice” for about half a day but the ratio of blood consumption to time of empowerment will likely improve with experience.

To side with Good, or to side with Evil. Some may falter when they see what they lose to that choice. You do not. The Choice of Good and Evil is not the choice of Necromancy or Healing to you, and you will find that even as you have sunken into the depths of Evil, you can draw upon the light of Good, or that as Good bolsters you, you can reach into the necromancy of Evil. Never will calling upon a power taint your will; you have made your Choice and nothing can change that.

488,,400,Headhunter​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"Headhunters are elves who made a pact with the spirits of the annihilated Orc homeland of Athan’Khar. Each spirit is a powerful mage, but more importantly, each is capable of acting independently. Due to this, you find yourself with the ability to cast near any magic with a reaction time born of having hundreds of spirits watching your back at all times. This makes you an immense threat to nearly everyone, as despite your only average power, the Circle of Interactions assures your ability to counter any spells your foes call forth, while the spirits mean that you’re difficult to counter yourself.

Unfortunately, this is not all benefits. The Orcs of Athan’Khar hate humanity with a passion, a quite reasonable result of the Tiraan Empire hitting the Orcish homeland with so many magical weapons that even time has broken in the area, and even the local god was slain. These furious spirits constantly drive their host to kill, often driving them insane with their demands. While you do not suffer these consequences, good luck convincing others. You must take the Dark Secret drawback. It does not count against the Drawback cap.

Instead, their talent lies with making pacts with powerful fairies, and borrowing their power. Fortunately, you seem to have forged a pact with a minor fairy, and are capable of calling upon its power for your personal use. Oddly enough, this has taken the form of an actual written contract, in which there are no conditions pre-written. You will find in your warehouse a number of copies of this contract. By having someone sign it, you can call upon their reserves of energy to power your fey spells. Obviously, this is only really useful if they’re some form of nature spirit, but perhaps you can reverse-engineer the principles involved?

You’re good at holding onto hope despite things like your friends dying or breaking down, and though you may still shed tears, it will take more than a cruel and cold universe to make you fall to despair. Your willpower is boosted greatly by this, and emotion-based magic is just a little stronger in your hands to show for it. Just be careful - holding onto hope can turn into insanity if you focus too much on the impossible. But if something is possible? You’ll only give up when you’re ready to give up.

It only affects magical energy in the air already, allowing it to destroy active spells and enchantments in an instant. It can also be utilised by magic users by drawing out the magic energy contained within, though such is an often risky process as if the jar breaks, it will release all it stores in a great explosion.

Your song on its own is powerful, but sometimes more than one voice is needed to push back the darkness. With this perk, you can combine your own singing with that of close friends and family, and sing as if you were one. The mix of your individual voices as one strengthens each singer’s powers into a single, multiplied force. Also, the singers do not need to be in close range for the song to work; one singer could be trapped in a separate dimension, and her song would still reach her companions, with the full song reverberating everywhere the individual singers are. The skill is meant for singing-based powers but can also be applied to other powers for attack combos; however, these non-song powers will require you and your companions to be in close proximity to each other. Furthermore, with enough pure friendship and will by all parties involved, you can summon up to seven individuals to your location, even if mystical barriers and the like would normally interfere; you essentially “call out” to them, and if they wish to help you in-person they will use the perk to push forward to where you are – in the case that you are reaching out to multiple individuals, all of them must succeed together or they will all fail.

You are the keeper of one such Herdstone - a great towering menhir covered in filth, runes of Beast Tongue, and surrounded by an ankle-deep carpet of bones. The beastmen regard this, and you, with deep reverence - and in future worlds, similar cultures made of the monstrous and depraved will hold the same regard for this sacred stone. It will forever act as a collector for the Winds of Magic, ensuring you may always call upon them when needed. As well, you carry a pouch at your side - full of Shards chipped from the stone, and woven with the magic it gathers and pools together.

In truth the Waaagh! is like the Winds of Magic but sourced from the very Greenskins themselves instead of some distant pole of power.

That of Zelda and the Hero, or that of the seven sages. Beyond simply being skilled at barriers and seals, your magic now has the secondary effect that makes it stronger when working in concert with others. And not merely in the sense of ‘seven people cast this spell, so it’s seven times stronger’. So long as you share a strong - and hopefully positive - emotional bond with your fellow caster, you would end up with a spell up to forty nine times stronger instead of just seven times stronger.

Instead of healing the curse, it healed only part of the curse... Which promptly turned into a second, weaker, Majora’s Mask. Absolutely not according to plan. The mask has enough power to let you levitate around, some telekinesis, will make any curses you cast stronger, and one other thing.

With this noble lineage, you can perform a variety of magical phenomena such as ghost lights, phantom images, magical sounds and with training and time could even replicate weaker versions of the 3 Goddesses’ spells(Naryu’s Love, Farore’s Wind and Din’s Fire) without using magical energy. Finally, you are able to use this magic to weave power into notes and songs - such as those of the Bolero of Fire or the Nocturne of Darkness. Who knows what more you could do if you borrow the powers of the heavens and earth for your cause?"

However, if one of the links in this chain should fail, the other two will quickly wither away into weakness and uselessness. As you might imagine, the Oracle is likely the weakest link. Thankfully, a failsafe of sorts has been devised. Or rather, two. The first is the hall of essences, meant to temporarily re-empower the Great Maku Tree. The second is the Great Maku Tree’s own seed, created from the energy gained from those halls of essence. This particular seed serves as a repository of natural energy, slowly soaking it up as time passes, and expended to keep the Great Maku Tree awake. Or for anything else you might need a nation's worth of energy for."

In addition to the great bravery you now possess- which allows you to fearlessly face terrifying monsters- you are also at the peak of physical fitness for your race and are naturally talented with weapons and adventuring tools, mastering basic techniques as soon as you pick them up and learning more advanced skills quickly. When the land is shrouded in Twilight, you’ll be able to keep a physical body by taking on the form of a powerful wolf; post-Jump you’ll be able to do this at will, and you resist similar body or mind altering magics much more easily. Finally, you possess one-third of the legendary Triforce- an omnipotent power left behind by the goddesses after they created the world. Although its power is greatly diminished on its own, bringing all three pieces of the Triforce together will grant unimaginable power.

When you overcome an enemy through combat, you will gain an energy known as “experience”, a power that could be spent to improve the potency of your magic, the power of your strikes, and how much damage you can take before dying, normally. Moving further up the ladder requires more and more experience with each tier - reaching its plateau out once you have reached the might of 8 trained hylian knights with every single blow, the combined endurance of said knights(which, if you are curious, DOES apply to “Heart Containers” for this specific instance), and for your spells to require 40% less magical energy than before to cast.

The vast majority of users of elemental energy, be they human or spirit, can only use a single one. But this is not a set rule. Delusions can allow mortal men to wield more, and several gods as well as godlike spirits are known to be able to use two. Perhaps the most impressive is the Traveler from another world, who by all rights appears to be able to wield all of them. As a world traveler yourself, this is a trait you share: you are able to resonate with multiple elements with no negative consequences. In future jumps too, you will find that as long as you can find a strong source to resonate with, you will be able to wield the various supernatural energies that exist in those worlds even when most would be limited to just one."

As the ‘illuminated beasts’ the adepti have a type of third eye that acts in much the same way as a Vision within their body. As these are not the gifts of the Archons, the power of this third eye is not so restricted in its usage. Often this means that the adeptal energy of the adepti each have their own unique effect, ranging from boosting the abilities of the body to generating shockwaves with each attack. Furthermore this energy is potent, such that ordinary mortals cannot withstand its power for long, both their body and soul feeling the strain.

This has multiple effects. Firstly, you’re able to use any special gifts or bloodline abilities they had

command and wield the absolute apex of the potential possible in your bloodline, no matter how
high it may be or how far back the ancestor may have been.
Secondly, you are not just the equal of your bloodline, but the very best of them. Any race,

Predii can change their shape, even assuming animal forms and create compelling illusions. A Predii outclasses even royal cabal members so much that they can pretty much tear through wards and traps erected over a week and brush their spells aside mostly ignored.

Not only can they dish it out, but they can take an incredible amount of damage, if someone even manages to get through their wards that protect them from even normal musket fire while unprepared. They could recover and heal from things like being impaled and shot several times through the head with high speed bullets as well as burned alive and fall down a mountain cliff. Of course, due to their age and being the ones who summoned the god Kresimir the first time they know many ancient secrets regarding sorcery and more.

It serves as a tap for excess emotions, allowing the princess to maintain a serene demeanor by storing unneeded emotions in the shell, whether negative or positive feelings. However, if the source of the user’s tumultuous feelings is not addressed, the mermaid will eventually reach a breaking point even with the output into the shell. More importantly, the spiraled fossil retains the dark and light emotions within, making it into a powerful repository for magic. By drawing on the negative emotions stored inside, the user’s dark magic is enhanced, and vice versa, by accessing the positive emotions, holy magic is enhanced and darkness is dispelled.

By invoking chants to the ice spirits while holding the book in your hands, you can unleash the might of the cold; with enough control, you can blanket an entire town in an endless blizzard up to the rooftops. Case in point: see that girl wading through the snow? Well, she’s about to trip on a weather vane – still on the roof of a building! The book has a vast store of magic that gradually regenerates over time, so that you do not lose energy while drawing on the book’s powers, and your own magic will only help strengthen the spells. However, the spells only work when you are holding the book. Also, be careful that you aim your attacks right, or you might accidentally get caught in the crossfire; for instance, you don’t want to have a command to turn your enemies into “snowmen” result in a bunch of snowmen falling down and nearly squashing you.

Furthermore, if the rod were to be used at the right moment, it can counter any seal forced on the wielder, perhaps even the sacred seal of Aqua Regina; however, the weapon must be consciously called upon just as the seal is being placed.

Your friends and allies also benefit from them, for what is the Power of Friendship but something that can be shared? Not only will the boost automatically be mirrored to your allies on the battlefield, but you can also permanently gift a copy of this to any of your friends and allies.

While there is no upper limit to the boost, it fades once battle ends. If you have not yet reached the limit of your power, you may keep a small fraction of this boost as a permanent gain. This also acts as a training booster, increasing gains in power and technique, when you train with friends.

This is the capstone booster, extending the power of the 600 CP perks for each origin by unlocking special subperks if those perks are purchased. Sharing the Power of Friendship will not unlock those subperks, though."

While the most common choices for  warriors were to be Berserkir (Bear), Úlfhéðnar (Wolf), or Svinfylking (Boars), you are free to choose any animal to build your shamanic state off of. No matter the animal you choose, the benefits are great as you become one with your inner animal spirit, representative of  all of the strengths, nature, and capabilities of the Hamr it possesses.
You are now a bridge between civilization and wilderness, one with the natural order, able to be in the balance with nature and understand disturbances in the great tapestry, both their causes and solutions.  This perception expands into perceiving the role of man and how your two conflicting natures can complement each other. Talents of magic and skill that you wield dealing with hunting, agriculture, animal care, survival, and nature are doubled and you have inerrant instincts and ease in learning and developing these skills.  Your wild instincts and senses are honed to a razor edge beyond what was previously capable for you, while all your instincts and senses are improved, one or two are now beyond compare, eyes of an eagle, the smell of a wolf, or so forth; you have a preternatural ability to sense danger and even the most carefully hidden aggression. Navigating through and surviving in the wilderness is second nature to you, even the most inhospitable locations are merely inconvenient as long as it's possible for a species to survive in them. You have gained an animal magnetism and the ability to understand and commune with animals of shared spirit and they with you.
Much like your senses and instincts, all of your physical capabilities are improved, with one based on your hamr of choice becoming the thing of legends: strength for bears, agility or speed for wolves,  and stamina or endurance for boars as just a few examples.  You gain the ability to enter a battle frenzy to receive the sacred gift of ÓÐR, divine ecstasy, fury, and inspiration. Óðr is the source of poetic inspiration and philosophical insight as well as battle frenzy, with all of its grotesqueness and violence, is of a rarefied  poetic sort – and, being a gift from the divine, it is inherently sacred. While in this state you are capable of fighting with supernatural ferocity as blows are turned away by the force of your spirit and your physical capabilities become several times greater. From within this state comes an endless rage as crazed as hungry wolves and as strong as mother bears, biting shields and slaying men, while you are harmed by neither fire nor iron, you can draw upon the unbridled wrath of nature itself within you and direct it towards your ends.
You obtain the ability to become one with your inner beast. You can don the hamr of an animal and assume its form. Increasing  your physical attributes and capabilities proportionally to the difference between the animal and a normal human. You can also astrally project yourself or your wilderness spirit through the realms and and even into dreams, having a vague awareness of what your other experiences till you rejoin."

Beings like you are not something truly unknown, though you are incredibly rare, as a certain white-haired girl lost in shifting sand dunes of Korath desert can attest. Your alien nature helps you contain these terrible energies; stressful situations don't trigger strange effects, and despite your gift still being difficult to control you have a firm hold over its power so madness will not seep into your mind (unlike a certain boy tortured by visions of hungry cold). This gives you great aptitude for magic, though you are likely to require education in this discipline to truly succeed. This makes you your own source of energy, giving you freedom from dependence on outside elements. Your ability as Source will grow with your general magical power, rapidly refilling your reserves of magical energy in an hour from empty regardless of their size. 
If you are what the “civilized” races in their ignorance describe as a “monster” you still enjoy all benefits described above, even if the regeneration of your magic is lesser in degree, taking you twice as long to regenerate your magical reserves as a non-monstrous source, and you also enjoy great physical augmentation. This is because as a descendant of the beings that appeared and were trapped in this world at the time of the Conjunction of the Spheres you have incredibly strange biology, letting magical energies of the Source infuse your body and all natural abilities, making you so much more powerful than the rest of your kin. It is undoubted that you are an apex specimen of your species, looked upon with awe and fear by your kin, and simple terror from all others. You are someone who is capable of single-handedly laying waste to cities and armies through power of might and magic. It would be incredibly difficult for you to you not return from such battles unharmed. While you might still meet your end from the blade or spell of brave, strong or lucky heroes you are capable of great destruction.

or internal organs of the King manifested either into human form or a human sized variant of your
body piece. Each piece represents a broad, powerful concept of existence. The Heart of the King is
the Miracle. The Right Hand is Stillness and Stagnation while the Left Hand represents Evolution and
Growth. Whether you take an existing piece or create something new, you’ll find powers developing
within that theme, ones that grow quite broad and mighty. If you pick an Organ already manifested, such as the three above examples, you will be an additional copy that has somehow formed. The Heart could manifest miracles into reality, giving form to the thoughts and emotions of those
around him. The more improbable the event, the easier it became to manifest, with the preference
being manifesting the fears of his opponents that they could not defeat him into ever increasing
power and unstoppable regeneration. However, the hope of his allies could become an annihilating
weapons in his hands or the love between two humans allow one to return to life in his presence. The Left Hand could manipulate it and others’ biology through contact. While changing shape was a
merely basic use, it could tear apart even far more powerful warriors with a touch by turning their
own bodies against them. Any body it devoured could be assimilated to gain power and even
biological information rapidly copied on touch to improve the Hand’s power level. Provided it was in
some way possible, the Hand could adapt to almost any threat in moments, save for itself. The product of many years of growth, along with exceptionally high levels of spiritual power, your
abilities are unlikely to start as magnificent as these. A new Heart might find themselves
strengthened by the belief of others, rather than directly manifesting thoughts into reality. A new
Left Hand might understand biology naturally and be able to slowly change their physical form, taking on useful new adaptations that are still somewhat mundane. But as you age and gain more
power, you’ll draw closer and closer to these original abilities."
545,,600,The Final Getsuga,Bleach,Source,"The true power of a Zanpakuto comes not from immense Reiryoku or total mastery of technique. It
comes from the heart. The understanding you develop with this piece of yourself, the bonds you
forge and the loyalty between two comrades. There is where true power can be found. Forming such
bonds with spirits or intelligent sources of power within your being allows you to increasingly
improve the power of your bond. The closer you grow with your Zanpakuto, the more powerful their
abilities will grow, the easier they are to use and the less costly their release is to maintain. Truly
deep bonds can even reveal entirely new powers. The two of you coming together as one to discover
new sides of yourselves and in doing so, uncovering similarly new abilities. Obtaining a deep level of intimacy, an intense bond and acceptance of each other, would make you far superior to an otherwise equal opponent that lacked this camaraderie with their blade. Once a true and full bond is created, you will have the opportunity to truly become one. Known as a
Final Technique, undergoing this process will destroy the gap between the two of you and create a
new being. Your dear ally does not die from this even if you can no longer perceive them as separate,
instead rejoining you to become an integral part of who you are. The final release gained from this, for a Zanpakuto’s Final Technique, would be similar to a greatly enhanced version of their Bankai state. Unlike the few Zanpakuto who can perform similar techniques as a desperation measure, the
complete affinity you and your sword forged will allow you to retain this state and your spiritual
powers. The state itself is not permanent, acting similar to your previous releases, but it can be
entered with a moments notice. It may even leave some changes on your body outside of it, a sign of
the part of you that has rejoined the whole. This above process is not limited to pieces of your own soul. Any being that has a connection with
you and exists within your being is open to it. It requires a genuine and sincere bond from each side, failing if either side knowingly falsifies it in some way. But even a Hollow or a Demon could become one with their host. The changes you experience from this combination are likely to be much more
significant if used with a being that was not originally part of your own soul, as a fair warning. "
546,,600,Segunda Etapa,Bleach,Source,"Resurreccion is the true form of an Arrancar. The powers and traits that were sealed away when
they gained human form return, enhanced significantly by their increased power. In this stage, their
mask expands, coming closer to the original form it had before they became an Arrancar. The mask
once removed is redonned for more power, the same reason it was taken away. But there are
rumours that a Hollow has more potential than this. How could this state, a return to the past and
the mask once cast aside, be a fitting finale to the supposedly endless evolution of a Hollow? For
those that search it out, there is a step beyond. Segunda Etapa is a state beyond Resurreccion, wherein the mask of a hollow is fully removed. Not
even a fragment remains. And this is when that hollows true power is shown. Both the unique
abilities they had as a Hollow and their power overall is vastly increased. As an Arrancar, you possess
this form, or can easily unlock it once you become one. Unlike a normal Resurreccion, which can
easily be maintained for long periods of time if not forever due to being a natural state, the Segunda
Etapa is very much a costly form. Less so for you, where it performs efficiently as part of your
mastery of the form. Having unlocked and understood the state, you are also able to slowly guide
other Hollows to the same realisations that unlock it, freeing them from their masks entirely for a
time. The same potential and knowledge that led to the Segunda Etapa state can also be applied
elsewhere. Other transformations, releases and forms of power can reveal a final additional step
beyond what is normally considered possible, provided you have access t the forms and spend the
time to unlock it. Each will have their unique requirements to reach but all will focus on finding the
true form fitting to themselves.

Note: Requires Hollow to purchase."
547,,600,Arturo's Mark,Bleach,Source,"As a phoenix from the ashes, your wings shine with a terrible flame.A unique development for a
Hollow, separate from the path of Resurreccion somehow. Perhaps the sort of thing that would only
be seen in a side story. From your back, you are able to project two shining wings of light. The power
is fairly straightforward, the presence of these wings significantly boosting your Reiryoku’s strength. As can be expected, the wings also allow for true flight at significant speeds. The wings themselves
can be shaped, the energy becoming solid at a moment’s notice, and allows for you to manifest the
energy around yourself in other ways. A blade of solid force or a flurry of piercing spears sent at a
foe. The energy used this way is denser and more refined than your ordinary cero or bala attacks. The wings are also able to be, temporarily, pushed to a second stage. The light-toned energy
becomes darker in this form and the wings expand. As if you had a second Resurreccion to activate, the increase in power becomes quite immense in this state. While it does not drain on your energy
to hold, it is physically exhausting and cannot be activated for long battles.

Note: Requires Hollow to purchase."
548,,600,Golden Light,Bleach,Source,"There is enormous power within these fragments, that grant us our powers. This shining golden light
may give the right to control the spirits around us but there is greater potential. Even a tiny piece of
the Soul King has more power than an atomic bomb, this being the creature who created the
differing worlds from the sea of chaos. You are naturally able to touch the fragment inside and, like
perhaps only one other, draw out this power for your own use. The pure golden Reiatsu exerted is
enormous. Even a Fullbringer with the average tiny fragment or scrap of skin could summon almost
enough power to match a weak Captain of the Shinigami. The knowledge of drawing this power also
allows you to take the pieces of the King from others. Provided they are unable to resist, with body
or spirit, you can steal and add it to your own spiritual make-up. With more or greater parts, you would be able to enhance your energy, and thus overall power, to
greater and greater heights. A hybrid to be made years from now who possessed dozens or possibly
hundreds of small fragments could give a daring battle to the fully matured Kenpachi Zaraki, until he
released his Shikai. What might you be capable of with more than that?
In other times and lands, you may find it possible to reorient this power to different internal objects
or beings. Pulling out much more power than normal and doing so under your own control or
stealing similar sources of power to the ones you possess from others you defeat.

Note: Requires Fullbringer to purchase."
549,,600,Base Mixture,Bleach,Source,"At the end of the day, we’re all humans here. Shinigami, Hollows, Quincy, just about everyone has a
human as their basis regardless of what racial supremacy they might spout. Humanity is the base
foundation and maybe that’s why they’re so malleable, with such potential to be altered. More than
most, your being is open to modifications and change. Experiments or enhancements that have to
do with the mixing of the races have a much greater chance of success and a much lower chance of
any sort of complication. Hybridisation, often a fraught endeavour, seems almost natural to you. So much so that it might
happen entirely accidentally. A Plus spirit whose spirit chain begins to hollowify would be much
more likely to somehow absorb that hollowfication without losing their self, becoming a mixture of
both soul and hollow without the need of soul science or magic. Even impossible mixtures, like the
normally poisonous combination of Quincy and Hollow reiatsu, are possible. Your children will also share these traits, if desired and in part or full, allowing you to easily pass on
things that probably shouldn’t be passed on. How does a Shinigami child naturally develop a
Zanpakuto spirit, without ever touching an asauchi? He inherited it, clearly."
550,,600,Exposure Therapy,Bleach,Source,"A normal human, fated to never give a meaningful contribution to this battle between life and death, right? It’d sure suck to be friends with the guy who saves the world, if he forgets about you in the
process. But if you can stick around long enough, this might help you stay relevant. Exposure to
power will very slowly cause related powers to develop in you too. The constant presence of a
uncontrolled source of spiritual power will quickly awaken your own spiritual awareness and very
slowly unlock spirit powers of your own. This might mean gaining enhanced physical abilities and the
power to create fire or even lucking into a more unique ability, if you had secret potential of your
own. Achingly slow compared to naturally gained powers, you can still slowly develop in power and ability
from exposure, then start training what you’ve gained intentionally. This isn’t limited to just
supernatural power sources but long term exposure to intense sources of mundane power can be
quite hazardous. You might develop something useful from sitting around a nuclear power plant all
day but are the health problems really worth it?"
551,,600,Skull Clad,Bleach,Source,"The favour of Hell is a strange thing to collect and many would question what exactly the intentions of one so deeply connected to it’s Will are. However it came to be, golden light coalesced around your form into an armor made from human bones, shining with sinful light. This armor represents the invested power of the Kushanada, the caretaker’s of Hell, and thus your own authority in that realm. The most obvious result is an increase in spiritual power, reinforcing your soul with the energy of hell, similar to maintaining a Shikai or Resurreccion state while the armor is summoned. More interesting are the hellish abilities you have access to. You can travel freely to and from Hell, summoning the Gates to enter the place and then exit again anywhere the realm might have reach. You can both create and command the chains of hell as well as summon the Kushanada. The chains are near unbreakable even to a Captain level opponent and can bind the spiritual energy of others or drag them down into hell, if the Gate is active. The Kushanada are gigantic gorilla-like demons who guard Hell and torment it’s prisoners, each one more than a match for any Vice Captain Shinigami. The permanent investment of power you have received also gives you the same immortality as the Togabito, slowly reforming in Hell if you are ever killed. Unless your soul is completely destroyed, you will reappear in a few days in your realm. You’ll retain access to the Hell of this world in future, though the sinners of the past worlds will be left behind, and can attempt to claim similar influence over other Hells. If you can convince it’s guards to invest their power or conquer them yourself, at least."
552,,600,Kenpachi,Bleach,Source,"You were always strong. Stronger than anyone you met. Maybe strong enough to be one of the strongest in all the worlds. But even as a kid, that strength limited you. How could you ever connect with others or learn from them? How could you ever enjoy a fight when you were swatting them like flies? Through your own subconscious action or the binding of another, this power was sealed away deep within as potential. Similar to Zaraki Kenpachi, you hold the potential for vast physical and spiritual power, along with a natural instinct for combat unmatched by almost any spiritual being. But this is largely inaccessible now. As you put yourself into deadly battles against worthy foes, you’ll see that power begin to return in leaps and bounds. Your muscles become denser, your spiritual pressure rages hotter and heavier with each battle, until you can eventually reach the same awakening of power as Zaraki did. Even after having reached your full potential, you’ll still have an effortless talent for all things relating to violence. Martial styles are easy to learn, becoming a capable user of techniques with a single day’s learning, and each battle you enter only increases your experience. With every fight, you become deadlier, even if there’s rarely a need to bother with your strength."
553,,600,Maiden's Iron Will,Bleach,Source,"Your soul and your will become one and the same, in many of the most important ways. While
determination is known to somewhat reinforce a soul, that is largely by allowing the being to draw
on more than is safe or painless in their battle. Your conviction directly empowers your spiritual
abilities, from a Zanpakuto’s release or Fullbring’s power to Kido spells or spiritual techniques like
Shunpo. You can focus this into a single ability to receive the most advantage or spread it evenly
across many at once. Even the steady determination of an experienced soldier giving noticeable increases in power across
the board. True conviction could increase this to magnify your power several times over or, if
focused through a single ability, allow you to accomplish normally impossible feats. Your mind, your
very will, turns your spirit into both a nearly unstoppable force and a nearly unbreakable barrier, as
long as you can maintain that utter belief and force of will that what you are doing must be done. But for all the easy and immense power this might give, it comes with a flaw. As conviction raises your power, so too does the lack of willpower cause your spiritual strength to falter. While you can
temporarily give up both benefits for a short time to avoid this, the rapid fluctuations in battle can
cause imbalances in power if you do not keep yourself controlled. "
554,,600,Fires of War,Bleach,Source,"The crucible of war is where mankind has often made it’s greatest advancements. In power and
strategy, science and technology, even in growing as a moral species. Perhaps you’re something
similar, on an individual scale. Far more than most, conflict brings out your full potential. Not only in
combat but any competition or battle in which the stakes are high, you are able to grow and learn at
a far greater rate than is normal for you. Ordinary battles to the death will quickly sharpen your abilities but fatal fights that are also for the
sake of others you care for will greatly increase the benefits as the stakes rise higher. From huge
bounds in growth to potentially discovering entirely new powers, you can even use this conflict- derived growth to push past normal limits or caps on your potential and continue to increased your abilities. The benefits are potent but will begin to drop off as the stakes keep rising. For the sake of a
world, you could bring forth unheard of potential, but beyond such global stakes you’ll find little
more increases to be had."
555,,600,I’m Just Playing the Game Normally ,Bofuri,Source,"Though really, people won’t believe you if you say that.

Like Maple, you have the best luck when it comes to stumbling across skills and rare equipment. People willing to train you in a mystical lost art, angels that grant you a part of their power, lost mystical artifacts - all that will fall into your hands as you adventure. But not for free and not without you looking for it. It also works better when you’re open to different possibilities about what you want, and not specifically looking for something.

And these require their own level of effort once found to get. That angel will only show up once you heal the sick child they were keeping alive. That master of a mystic art will only train you once you prove your determination. That key you found unlocks a boss fight three floors higher that you need to beat to get that artifact.

Nothing you get is unreasonably powerful for the world it belongs to, but still useful to you in some manner. These new skills and equipment tend to synergize very well with an existing part of your powers or equipment.

You can also let your friends benefit from this - that cave you pointed out to them might have their own adventure for them with its own reward, or that random ring you gave them might be critical to a quest that ends up patching a hole in their capabilities."
556,,600,Archstone touched,Cradle V1,Source,"You gain a strange ability, that of the archestone, stolen from the labyrinth. You can attempt to copy techniques that would normally be unique to them, this includes induvial paths, bloodline abilities, and even remnants they’ve absorbed. Using it more than once in day is not recommended, but you can train your resistance to the backlash of this ability."
557,,600,The Bull In Aaru,Egyptian Mythology,Source,"Hail to the God-King, god of gods, eater of neter! All the neter of the four directions fear your approach, for when a mighty King feasts upon the flesh of gods, the power of those gods and all that they are flows into them. Your appetite has been made so that you may eat the greatest among them for your meal at daybreak, the lesser of them as your meal at sunset, and the least of them for your meal at night. By slaying gods and consuming their remains, you take in their divine power and all other things besides. You are imbued with their divine names or magical might, and along with their name, you add their souls to your souls, their ka and ba to yours, their shut and ib, their wisdom and their immortality and all that they were. There only remains the difficulty of the hunt itself."
558,,600,Nova,Marvel Zombies,Source,"The Nova Corps is an intergalactic police force hailing from the faraway world of Xandar, dedicated to protecting the galaxy. Each member is empowered by the Nova Force, a source of energy bestowed in varying amounts to each member. For starters, this has given you great strength and durability, flight that’s supersonic in an atmosphere and relativistic in a vacuum. The Annihilation War won’t happen until 2006, so you don’t hold the entirety of the Nova Force, nor are you host to the Xandarian Worldmind. That being said, you’re no slouch. You could physically throw down with the likes of the Hulk and Thor, put out energy easily capable of blasting through buildings, and fly across a galaxy in hours. But you don’t necessarily need to fly. As you gain mastery over the Nova Force, you might learn to create space gates (portals) and influence gravity to an extent."
559,,600,The Hunger Cosmic,Marvel Zombies,Source,"The death knell of the universe (that is, the Earth-2149 one) came about when the Silver Surfer came to Earth, followed by his master. Though a lot of zombies died trying to eat the surfer, he eventually became lunch for a lucky few. Those fortunate enough to get a share found that the surfer’s master’s hunger lived on within them, empowering them with a fraction of the power cosmic. Then it happened again after they got in a lucky shot and ate Galactus whole. Galactus was dead, and in his place were the Zombie Galacti, who proved to be far, far worse than their predecessor.

This phenomenon has extended to you as well. “You are what you eat” has taken on a whole new quality, as you now absorb the power of beings you eat and take it for yourself. In short, for every being you devour, you take their strength and permanently add it to your own. While superhuman having an ordinary joe for dinner won’t get much of a boost, gobbling down somebody like an ultrapowerful alien from outer space will see your power grow by leaps and bounds. The amount of power gained depends on how much you manage to scarf down - if you eat the Silver Surfer whole, you’ll gain all the Power Cosmic he’d ever been granted, but sharing with somebody else will net you a smaller share. You are what you eat."
560,,600,Live Forever,Marvel Zombies,Source,"People don’t stay in the world forever. They pass on. But they live on in the hearts of those whose lives they’ve touched. Their deeds are their monuments. But an inspiring figure, like a superhero, might live on in another way.

You’ve got that sort of willpower, nobility of being, and charisma that so many of this world’s heroes held at their best. Your charisma and force of personality is that of a leader that Earth’s Mightiest Heroes or another powerful group would follow to the bitter end through sheer admiration - in short, think Captain America. The confidence to inspire people, to earn their respect and bring out the very best in everyone. Your actions seem to have an enlarged effect on the world - whether it’s through your ability to inspire the remaining masses or fate itself, they’ve got more effect than they should. If you dedicate yourself to a cause, like rebuilding society and destroying all zombies, things will just go your way. You’ll find enough people to repopulate, come up with plans to cure the plague (or just wipe every zombie off the face of the universe), and unite everyone who’s still alive behind your goal. Maybe you’ll die in the process. Maybe you won’t. But your ideals will persist, and you will live on in the people you’ve inspired.

But it’s not fair for only you to live on this way, is it? Others too have achieved much before their deaths. But as long as there’s one who’s willing to stand for what they stood for, they’ll live on. And so will their power. In you. If a being of power falls in your presence then their power will be bequeathed to you. There are a few caveats to this. The person must approve of you, or at least, have approved of you if they’d met you. You won’t be getting the Ant-Man suit if you’re somebody Hank Pym would despise in every way. And this works far better with items of power than actual superpowers (unless they can be transferred). If Iron Man or Thor fell (through death or zombification), the armor or the hammer would fall into your hands by default. But you’re far less likely to be hit by the same kind of cosmic rays that created the Fantastic Four if they bit it."

Aside from being incredibly proficient in the manipulation of your parent’s domain, much as other demigods are, you’ll find that you otherwise benefit from your heritage than others do. Bigger, faster, stronger, all the things a hero might be expected to be in order to live up to such a legacy.

To that manner the Redmages developed a spell to turn their own health into magic to cast even longer when they would normally run out. This ability takes that a step further allowing you once a day to completely drain an enemy of their life in order to fuel one of your spells, the catch however is that they must be within reach of your sword and truly strong opponents will shrug it off."
563,,600,Red Blade of Rage,Dies Irae,Source,"With the soul being used as the source for all of the great power in this world, it is no wonder that there are sometimes those who experience an increase in power when their emotions run hot. The intense fear when cornered can empower ones’ blows and increase one’s speed or the hatred at confronting an archenemy can strengthen your attacks and make the wounds you deal fester and rot at an accelerated pace. You are able to imbue your emotions, desires and dreams into your abilities or attacks, granting them increased power and even unique additional traits based on what emotion you are using and the strength of that emotion. Be careful which you use as some can backfire. Fear can be used to grant power but a strike made that is filled with fear can never finish a fight, not in the way you desire."
564,,600,Goblet of Magic,80s Sword and Sorcery,Source,"One of the powers of creation, this golden goblet is a wellspring of great magical power, visible as a green glow escaping its top. When you hold it you will find your own magical powers amplified, any magic you possess at least twice as strong as it ordinarily would be, potentially causing it to evolve in a substantive way, such as making resurrection magic not require an intact corpse or allowing days instead of hours, making your illusions fool all the senses instead of just audio and visual ones, or allowing you to transform entire groups as easily as you would have a single man. This magical amplification even applies to potions mixed within it or drunk from it. With this even a middling mage could challenge a master and win. Even in the hands of one who did not know or practice magic themselves, the Goblet could be used to perform a variety of magical effects; this will not match a practitioner in any Low or High Magic in their field, or the potions of a Potion Maker, but it is possible. There is still a mental fatigue in using it this way. The goblet itself is indestructible at least to the forces of this world."

You’ve never felt better. The bigger those odds, the more confident in yourself you get. This isn’t arrogance or overconfidence. This is an absolute, ever growing self-surety of what you can do and what your friends can do. More than that though, when those odds really start climbing, you find that your strength starts climbing too. It’s never going to scale to match, it’s not a heroic tale if you beat these odds with ease, but the greater the opponent and the disaster you face, in comparison to you, the stronger you’ll become. Find yourself facing a few dozen priests at once? Your body seems to miraculously restore its stamina at the start of the fight and you can push yourself just a little harder. A Bishop standing in your way? Your body will feel stronger than it should possibly be and you’ll find wells of energy you didn’t think you had. And if Zeus himself, or another High God, descended to stomp you into the ground? You’d be able to pull out every single bit of power and effort you had at least twice over to try and give yourself a chance. There is a limit to this however. You can only withstand so much of this boost, even against the great odds you might face, and if you try to draw too much power from you, you might irrevocably damage your body or spirit. What’s the point of beating the bad guy if you die in the process and never get to see your happy end?

Boosted: So you beat the bad guy. Triumphed against all odds. But what was the point if that desperate battle if what you were fighting for was lost? You'll find that now, things have an odd way of working out if you won the climactic fight. Collateral damage was not nearly as bad as it may have appeared, reconstruction efforts go ahead smoothly and easily. Unless they were directly killed in the fight, your loved ones would never be hurt. Even when it really should not be possible, it seems like things lead strongly towards a happy end for you with even the slightest chance of happening, so long as you managed to actually win.

wanted.

Awakening dozens or hundreds of people a day is easy for you and perhaps one day,
with training and effort, you might be able to awaken thousands or more a day. Still,
beyond your unusual skill at awakening Aura, you’ve also some kind of ephemeral
trait that empowers those you awaken to further heights. Those who you personally
awaken will have larger Aura reserves, as well as a greater skill at manipulating their
Aura and Semblance. The physical empowerment of their Aura, as well as it’s
defensive abilities, will also be empowered.
But the greatest ability you have, beyond all of that, is the ability to “awaken” any
other systems you may possess in other people. Cultivation, chakra, magic, psychic
powers, whatever. You can’t awaken any specific abilities, just a general system, but
that should be just fine as a base, yes?
Much like all who possess Aura here, those you awaken are also capable of awakening
others. Those who are awakened by those you awakened yourself lack this fiated

A Mana Core is like a magical reactor, the difference between it and ordinary circuits being like comparing a single machine on an assembly line to an entire factory. This alone would grant C ranked Mana as a Servant, equal to 3000 magic circuits of high quality, but it's true benefit is in the incredible restoration timeframe it has. Whilst unavailable as a Servant without some way to gain a living body, when it works it will restore the user's magical energy to 100% within 24 hours, regardless of how much magical energy the user has.

Boosted: Dragonheart has now turned more than just your magic into that of a dragon’s. Your blood has taken on the same properties as that of a dragon’s, granting you a body more durable as steel and the ability to temporarily boost the magical power and regeneration of those who drink your blood. You may also grant others stone like skin for a short time by spreading your blood on their bodies or even permanently increase their magical power and regeneration rates by allowing them to eat a piece of your heart. It’s rather dangerous to do that sort of thing though.

Whilst you were in the womb, numerous experiments and treatments were carried out to transform you into an artificial being known as a Homunculus, a particularly powerful one at that too. A great deal of your body is made up of Magical Circuits, 1000 circuits of the highest quality lying within you. This immense magical power is supplemented by an innate affinity for all magics, increasing the speed at which you learn magic by a fair amount. Your body is unnaturally enduring as well, allowing you to survive wounds that would quickly kill a human, such as multiple gaping sword wounds, for much longer periods of time, though a thorough opponent can still kill you by destroying your organs or dealing a truly brutal beating. You may not be as powerful as your pseudo sibling Ilyasviel but you also lack the limited lifespan her increased power placed upon her, instead your lifespan remains unchanged from a humans. Also unlike your sibling, you are not just an imprint of Justeaze's personality and memories on a new body, though neither do you possess the Wish Granting Trait as a sacrifice. You may optionally choose the albinism-like colouring Ilyasviel possessed. 

Players who do not take the Homunculus origin may take this perk for an undiscounted 600cp."

Why, then, is it still a thing? The answer to that is  simple: Sheer and utter Apathy. A force that killed more people than any hatred and Evil ever could. Of course, as something which kills so much Is it … not a vile thing as well? Well, I dunno. For you though, the answer is yes, and a clear yes at that. Now, every act of Apathy becomes an act of Evil as far as you’re concerned … Though not exactly a great one. In essence, so long as you do not care about at least some of the things happening around you, any powers which rely on Evil or sin don’t diminish, and even grow a bit, albeit at an incredibly slow rate. However, there do need to be things around you which you can ignore: Just sequestering yourself in a cave won’t let this perk work. In fact, it works best if you live an ordinary life, with its ups and downs, just like you did before you came down here And isn’t that funny? ..."

Not only that, but it seems like every immoral act you commit gives you a permanent power increase, small, yes, but it’s still a boost for something as nice as fucking or stripping or something. Granting about 0.1% increase in power per “Naughty” act. Also, for some reason, you can fight just as well when pole dancing, stripping, exotic dancing, having sex, or doing drugs as you could when not doing any of that.

Or at least something close to it. Inside of you, a second set of heartbeats can be heard whenever you close your eyes. Regular people can’t see it due to the incorporeal nature of the Monarchs, but those with fine magical senses may be able to perceive its presence. Besides the creepy experience, this Heart grants you two boons: the first one is that it will give you an increased massive pool of mana, the increase being 100,000 Mana Points, at least the same Mana Points as the Shadow Monarch had, to be added on top of whatever your current mana pool is. This amount of mana would be enough for even a National Rank Hunter to be casting spells or using magical abilities all day without running out of mana as it regenerates.

The second benefit that it grants is that in case you are killed, this second heart will not perish with you, but instead it will keep beating on its own, regenerating you back to full health, preventing your actual death, and granting a minor temporary boost in strength after the resurrection. This effect can only be used once every jump or once every 10 years, whichever comes sooner.

This heart is similar to the Shadow Heart within Jin-Woo and will be completely loyal to you, never threatening to reincarnate its former self through you and instead being fully assimilated into your being as a natural part of yourself."

Unlike him, your personal source of power is not tied to The System, but it is capable of supplying power for all your abilities. What this means is that your abilities can be trained without limit, allowing you to draw more and more from your personal reserves, going past your previous limits the more you use each of your powers, making them improve and grow with you.

Keep in mind that while this ‘abyss’ is endless, you still need to give yourself an actual challenge to maintain a stable grow. After all, you can’t expect a lion to train its fangs by squashing ants."
576,,600,Dog Years,Fate/Grand Order,Source,"You’re getting paid by the hour here, so you might as well take your time in life. For most beings that have magical energy, they’ve got a max that they won’t replenish their energy past, like how a water bottle can only hold so much water. You’re a little different. While you still have that maximum capacity for replenishment, you’ve got a much, much larger temporary store. You very slowly add magical energy to this store and the energy remains there for good until used. You cannot artificially add to this store but it will increase in the speed of growth the more energy you have in your normal magical energy stores. While this energy can be used for any normal use, that might not sound terribly attractive when it takes hours to store up enough for a good spell and years for big rituals. What makes it worth it is the accomplishment of Miracles. Even things that cannot be accomplished with True Magic can be achieved with the Miracles that can be cast using this slow storage. Saving up for a few decades could allow you to bring back the dead or even grant immortality and the longer you save, the more you’ll be able to accomplish.

Boosted Miracles are meant to be the solely the right of Gods to perform. You reckon you could make a pretty good claim to godhood though. You’re not only able to accomplish Miracles via your second storage, now you’re able to perform them even with your normal magical energy stores. They cost quite a lot more than they would with the temporary stores provided by this perk but the sheer, limitless nature of these Miracles may make that into a minor hiccup for those properly pursuing them.

Unlike the vast majority of Gaia’s inhabitants, you may use magic without the aid of materia. By drawing mako energy directly from your surroundings, you can cast spells. Like Aerith, your combat spellcasting mostly focuses on enhancing your allies, hampering your enemies, and healing the wounded, though you could learn new spells with time and effort.

With training, Cetra can also tap into the lifeforce of the planet to communicate with the spirits of the dead, gaining access to their knowledge and memories. One must approach this technique with caution, however, since the channeler also experiences the emotions of the spirits they call on. Good-natured Cetra can even help troubled spirits find peace, destroying them through redemption.

Boosted: Mako Magnified

If Aerith’s abilities are anything to compare to, you must be a full-blooded Cetra! Both your innate power and precision as a spellcaster has been greatly enhanced, and will only grow with practice and experience. Training will lead to slow and steady growth, while an adventure to save the planet would see you grow much faster. By the end of your journey, you’ll be able to match the greatest feats of the last Cetra. If you tapped into the energy of the planet itself, you could create spell effects that span continents.

In addition, your spells are much more efficient and consume less energy, allowing you to keep up a fight or a long ritual more effectively.

A single lazy sword swing from you could bisect an angry dragon in one attack, to say nothing of armies that try to fight you without a plan. You also have a large font of magical energy and mental stamina for Materia use, able to throw around powerful spells with ease and barely noticing any fatigue outside of extensive battles. Should this be insufficient, you may tap into your unique 'heritage' to gain a temporary boost to all of these, marked by the presence of a single wing on your back with an appearance of your taste. It's up to you if such a wing is actually capable of any amount of flight or merely decoration.

A link to an Evil God of the distant past provided you with an unlimited source of magical energy, always being able to draw out the maximum amount you can use at any time. This connection has rendered your power denser and thicker, enhancing your overall strength further. Even without any ability to reinforce your body, it has grown much stronger and more enduring, able to heal from many serious wounds at speed. Though your aesthetic and abilities have taken on the blackened scheme of the Alters, your mind appears free from any changes. 

Every Alter tends to share some similar traits. Heightened aggression and reduced empathy with others. A mean sense of humour and either an effortless sense for being cool or the total inability to be cool at all.

It only gets more dire when you reveal your special powers, the ones you directly inherited from your tentacled papa or mama. These potent and versatile abilities can make even planetary threats hesitate in fear. A control over space-time to instantly teleport across the galaxy, perhaps, or the ability to breed such monstrous lifeforms that others consider you a living army. 

However, despite your powers, as a partial Evil God you’ll have some added dangers. There are those that hunt your kind, quite effectively too, and all the tools that work better against the Eldritch will do the same to you. "

If you really can’t wait, you’ll even be able to rush things by purposefully burning your sanity on the altar of power. Just remember that this is a one way street. You won’t be able to “trade back” power for your sanity again. If you want to regain that you’ll have to find your own cure and deal with the resulting loss in power.

Whatever you consider to be power, so long as it has some combat ability that you can personally use, you are able to find ways to acquire it. However this ability does not mean that those who hate you will help you. For instance, the Hulda brothers made Thor's hammer when they were young and desired fame, but they have regretted their actions ever since.

On the downside, this is the ability to ‘sacrifice human form to become a dragon’, which is exactly what would have happened for Siegfried if his entire body had been coated with Fafnir’s blood. It doesn’t have an off switch by itself, and while active it renders you vulnerable to dragon-specific capabilities. Maybe don’t take on St George while you’re like this, but he’s not in this story...right? On the plus side, with a bit of effort you can now enter the ‘Other Side of the World’, though considering that’s where all the other mythological creatures went you won’t exactly be a big fish in a small pond anymore.

Such power makes the distinction between Magic and Magecraft inconsequential to you, with even making a self-contained pocket dimension being in your power using the Ploy Kickshaw system.

Not only does this give you a significant power boost, but it also grants you a bit of their essence itself, which will grow with time and training, basically ensuring that you will eventually reach their height of power if not more and then surpass it with whatever other powers you also possess. Of course, you can decide the amount that is granted, from just raw power, an eye, to remodeling your whole body so you share an exact race and similar genetic makeup to your donor.

Just a small thing, really, but one that can grow, adapt, one that has given you not only power, but authority and inheritance. It has fully integrated within you, and with time, you will be able to access all the powers that the dead God once had, if not evolving them into something both greater and more fitting of you. Furthermore, those tightly related to that God will quickly realize your nature and treat you accordingly, as their signature powers and abilities are accessible to you.

The Black Mud of the Holy Grail, a substance that channels the six billion curses of the Evil God Angra Mainyu, has now been implanted into your body. Your magic circuits, your magecraft, your Spirit Origin, basically everything makes you, has been tainted by the blackness of the mud, turning yourself into an Avenger, or at least the spiritual equivalent of that if you are not a Servant.

Normally, this corruption would also entail swearing loyalty to the evil of Angra Mainyu, and working for its rebirth and desire of endless destruction. However, it hasn’t taken control of you, but you haven’t become its true master either. Instead, a strange symbiosis has been born. The mud inhabits you, and it allows you to draw a portion of its abilities for your own devices, for it knows that it will lead to a great destruction in the end.

This allows you to do several things: First, this curse will devour others that try to assault you, even incorporate them and subordinate them for your use. This even includes the curse of ‘Death’ carried by powerful supernatural poisons, like that of the Hydra. The mud will also allow you to twist your abilities, granting you the traits of an Avenger, and letting you trade potency for variety. For example, the blessing of immortality granted by the Olympians may be broken down into several great powers that are reminiscent of the legends that contributed to it. You may also call upon the mud to corrupt others, albeit you will not have a way to control the result, getting a frenzied avenger empowered by the mud if you have not prepared something else when dealing with most Heroic Spirits, or merely a broken, dying and insane person if this is inflicted upon a human. Lastly, the mud is also a great channeler of magical energy, allowing you to use it in combination with other sources of magical energy, even the leylines of the land itself, in order to empower yourself.

However, in the more desperate times, you can truly draw into the true power of the black mud, channeling its essence in a way more spectacular fashion. By doing this, the corruption will start to break the balance in the favor of the mud, more negative thoughts will assail your mind and curses plague your being. You better have the ego and strength of spirit of a great hero to maintain your sanity while demanding more power from the source of all evil, less you become a mere puppet of destruction."
589,,600,Rooted To The Land,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"The Protectors of the Land are a cabal of magi that have bound themselves to the lands of Snowfield, in both spirit and blood. In return from tying all the mystical power to their land, they are able to accomplish feats of mystical power that surpasses that of most other magi.

Whether as one raised to become one with the land of Snowfield, or just a talented magi who has developed a very similar process, you are also able to bind both yourself and a large community of other magi to a certain territory. The size of land you can comune with depends on the size of the community you are binding to it. A small cabal of magi, of a few dozens, will only be able to maintain a territory of around an American county.

Initially, this process is easily reversed, and the benefits it provides are not as significant as the one the Protectors of the Land enjoy. However, the more people, either actively or overtime, bond with the land, the more power you will get out of it, as the land not only returns power but also feeds on those entering in symbiosis with it.

However, should you choose to, those who enter this pact with the land may also choose to permanently bind themselves to the land, tying all their powers irreversibly to your chosen location, and then even they may sacrifice themselves as their life nears to an end, allowing them to reinvigorate the land. Doing this process will speed up your power gain."
590,,600,System Type,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"There is a certain type of extremely rare type of Heroic Spirits. One whose legends are closely tied to a specific concept, of which they are the living embodiment of certain concepts. You may choose one such concept to add to your Legend as an Heroic Spirit, in which you have become one, if not the most, closely associated being to that concept, barring the actual gods. Think of the Pale Rider and their association with death and disease.

Unlike Divine Spirits, these Heroic Spirits have a much smaller control over the concept that they embody and the world at large. When it comes to influencing the world, they can exert influence over a very large area, such as the whole city of Snowfield when supported by a powerful Master, but this influence is fairly limited. The Pale Rider was able to influence this area by spreading bacteria and viruses that created magecraft-like effects, for example. However, their true power comes from creating an otherworld of sorts, like a Reality Marble but less demanding in energy, and with still a fearsome power. This otherworld, which is also around the size of a large city, is completely under their control, being in fact part of their ‘true body’. Inside of it, they can attack from almost any direction, create countless powerful bodies that can rival even the Servants of the Knight Classes and destroy large buildings with ease, as well as rearranging the space to their wishes and being almost omniscient to everything that transpires on it. In the real world, they can also drag people into their Otherworld, either by coming into contact somehow with their associated concept, or by forcibly taking them in a large area around their real world anchor, which can either be a physical body or just their Master. In addition to that, those with weak wills but related to their concepts, such as a half-dead divine beast of the underworld, can be absorbed and empowered in it.

Normally, this could be balanced because such a Heroic Spirit would have no consciousness of their own, merely latching on whatever their Master wishes at the moment. However, for one reason or another, this doesn’t seem to be the case for you. Whether due to reaching enough maturity that you developed enough of a consciousness, or perhaps having a strong previous recording in the Throne of Heroes, it seems that you have retained all the above benefits, while also maintaining a strong personality even under this manifestation.

And with its very nature, such a thing poisons its host, ensuring that they will not survive for long. In fact, it is exceedingly rare for an Obscurial to live any longer than ten years. But you?

You are a special case.

Somehow, the dark force that is the Obscurus has formed a sort of symbiotic relationship with you. And so, you have become quite a foe to be reckoned with. As an Obscurial, you have gained the ability to transform into the Obscurus within you, a writhing mass of darkness. In this form, you are capable of flight and rampaging across an entire city is well within your purview. In such a state, it would take a team of Aurors in order to bring you down.

And this is without a wand. Once you have a wand to call your own, you will now have the capacity to focus and control your tremendous power beyond letting it rage out at your foes. With such control and power, the number of foes who could be considered your equal can be counted in one hand and fewer still are those with the ability to surpass you.

Finally, we come to what is possibly the greatest aspect of your newfound might. It is a curious thing but the might and size of an Obscurus is based on two factors. The first factor is magic, more specifically the host’s magic. As your skill and power over magic grow, so too will your Obscurus, ensuring that it shall always be mighty enough to stand at your side.

The second factor, however, is just as important and due to your strange circumstances, you are probably the one most well-poised to take advantage of it. Ordinarily, the Obscurus will poison its host as they grow older until eventually, they can no longer handle the strain. But in your case, with your graceful union, your Obscurus shall only grow stronger with age, becoming mightier and mightier with every year that passes by. Small increments yes, no more than a fraction of a fraction at best, but with someone like you, such a thing can make all the difference in the world."

A young witch with this power could easily earn the “Top Student” spot, while a fully grown witch with this boon would be something amazing indeed. The Emperor will watch your future with great interest. See the Notes section for additional details & interactions.

This perk puts your magical abilities at the upper edge of your age group, relatively speaking. A young witch could compare themselves to Willow or Gus in terms of talent and power with room to grow, while a fully-mature witch with this perk would be on par with the Clawthorne sisters. Specializing further (and making the right political connections) could even land you a job leading one of the covens. Note that, unlike Multidisciplinary, this perk does not affect your magical expertise in the Skill Level section of this Jumpdoc. It only affects your natural reserve of magical energy and the raw power you can throw behind a spell.

Combining the magical ability boosts of the Grimwalker and Prodigy would likely make you the most gifted witch on the Boiling Isles. Only Belos, with his centuries of experience, experimentation, and outside help from The Collector would surpass you in application and technique, but you’d have a solid shot at matching him in pure magical tonnage.

Boosted: A Lord must have subjects, and you are no different, but in a world that attempts to keep humanity beaten down, perhaps the only one you can trust to do things properly is yourself. You are capable of splitting off parts of yourself, creating completely new and separate entities that are nonetheless tied to you. Their memories are your memories, their growth is your growth, their goals are your goals. Should you so desire, you can merge together once more, not only restoring your spent strength but also adding whatever they gained while separated to your own.

597,,600,Ancient Tradition,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Source,"It is in the soul that the Lords and their subjects gained power, and it is not something that should be so carelessly abandoned, even in death. As such, you have learned a rite to directly absorb the souls of the fallen, whether allies or enemies, granting you a boost in power proportional to how powerful they were in life. This power can be directed towards certain aspects of yourself, like physical strength or speed, granting you a higher boost at the cost of everything else.

Boosted: To consume something is to know something, to have it become an undeniable part of your very being. Such was the thought behind this tradition, one in which you exemplify. When you absorb the soul or life essence of the fallen, you take everything within you. Their strength, their knowledge, their skills added to your own. Even their memories will be granted to you, muted and disconnected to the rest of you. After all, why should a Lord be influenced by others, and not the other way around?

Thanks to Millenium’s attack, the reserved Seras eventually reached her vampiric potential. Pip transformed from a common mercenary to an indispensable asset. Even Alucard got stronger by the end of the series, somehow. With power-scaling like this, can anyone challenge these characters?

Well, maybe now you can. Your final seal has been broken and your chains sundered, rendering you well and truly limitless. All of your abilities have grown in both strength and versatility by at least an order of magnitude, and will continue to improve so long as you seek out new challenges. You won’t be as hilariously overpowered as Alucard, at least not right away, but all of your powers and perks, even the usually untrainable ones, will continue to improve. Now your powers can be bullshit too!"
599,,600,Schrodinger’s Cat,Hellsing,Source,"In every place and state and form and style, you exist. A living embodiment of the titular problem, you exist through your own belief that you exist. To be in a certain location, you must only think that you are there and you will be so. Instant transportation across a world is as easy as appearing within the mind of a living person or even inside of an illusion created by your ally. A location is a location, regardless of it’s actual nature. It is even possible to exist in multiple states at once, if you can wrap your head around it, watching over all kinds of entertaining events around the world. 

Your powers aren’t quite limited to just your place in the world, as you are also able to make some alterations to your physical form through this quantum quality. For the most part, these are limited. Taking on the traits of a cat, such as their cute ears and fuzzy tail, is simple. But you could not simply imagine yourself an invincible warrior or eternal vampire. On the other hand, maintaining your own life only requires the belief that you are healthy and unharmed. Your head being blown off with a blessed gun won’t stop you from reappearing in a moment, unharmed and unbothered. But this ability requires either an iron will or mental derangement, as it relies on your thoughts both positive and negative. So long as you maintain your sense of self and beliefs about your self, it is an invincible power. 

But the loss of either can be a great danger. A being who contained many other souls as part of him might be lost to eternity if he can’t find an escape, a way to reclaim his collective will. Whereas someone who, with this power, believed for a few moments that they would certainly die may very well make that fate come true unavoidably."

There’s quite a few differences, which you should especially appreciate, since you’re one of the latter now! Instead of a lesser god, you’re a proper Olympian or equivalent God of your pantheon, standing heads and shoulders above other divinities.

This grants you several benefits. The first is that your raw power as a god, and indeed, any powers you use that originate from divinity, are boosted massively, at least one whole order of magnitude if not more. You’re stronger, your fires are hotter and there are more of them, so on and so forth. Your control over your domain is similarly boosted, as are all other parts of your godliness.

Besides this, you’re now truly a god, and a god of... well, whatever you can control. Anything you have exceptional control and ability at, no matter how you acquired it, now counts as a godly domain for you. This means you can benefit from it just the same as you would from any Domains you bought with CP, and control and influence it in the same way."

Because of this imbuement the spells become immensely more powerful than their standard counterparts bypassing the normal limits of magic. Whether through practise or even a teacher you have learned how to tap into the energy of the underworld amplifying your spells and forms of magic beyond what they were capable of. However, be warned channeling this energy is not without risk if you are human you will be inflicted with the curse of Weg, for other races your magic and soul will be forever altered, the state of which will depend on the amount of energy you channel. For Demons who can already channel this energy naturally, you have learned to through some way amplify your own magic past what it was once capable of for example Kotodama magic being unable to manipulate Dark Magic now it can do so , so long as you are drawing upon the negative mana.

Boosted: Forbidden Jumper:
The further exposure to the negative mana has as aforementioned altered you now no matter your race you are immune to the side-effects of the negative mana able to channel any amount of the negative mana straight through you amplifying not just your magic now but also your very being passively amplifying your physical condition to equal the usage of reinforcement magic and if taken with negative mana enforced reinforcement magic your condition is enhanced even further. Again for the Demon race this has changed you unlike above the magic of the underworld bow passively runs through you bolstering your physical abilities past even what the above is capable of, your increased status has also changed you for the way you manipulate the mana of your home is second to none with just a thought you can now flood any area with your negative mana and cause any spell powered by the natural mana of the world to fizzle and dissipate into nothingness.

Some of the first beings to appear at the dawn of this world, they were immensely powerful even in their infancy. These days, few of these old gods remain, having been corrupted into more demonic forms or consumed by their fellows or Atum the God Eater. But some still remain: Gaia, the spirit of Earth and the mother of most its pantheons, still watches over the world. Oshtur left the world to study the paths of magic, but acts as protector in her role as one of the benefactors of Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme. Chthon and Set took to evil and were banished to other dimensions, though they long to return.

Your mother or father lay with one of these beings, seeking an heir that surpassed their own kind. And in birthing you, they have succeeded. All aspects of your godly heritage are enhanced. Your life force burns brighter and will not be weaker in dimensions outside of your home. Your physical abilities are enhanced many times over, being to others of your kind as they are to mortals.

You are attuned to the forces of nature, able to manipulate plants, summon tendrils, and shape the environment to your advantage.

How much so, is to be determined below.

For 600 CP like Surtur (once he was reunited with the Eternal Flame) you have become a threat to entire planets. Growing vaster than the mountains, so tough that a punch from the Hulk is little more than an annoyance and strong enough to obliterate a planet with a single strike. Even if you are not wreathed in flames and armed with a blazing sword, rest assured that whatever theme your transformation runs on (preferably inspired by your condition) will be just as impressive inpractice. It might be  wise not to unleash force great enough to shatter a planet without good reason though-for also like Surtur, your chances of surviving the power you yourself unleash at that scope are dubious."

Eternity is so unfathomably beyond Thor and the others that I’m describing him with all caps, bold text that’s underlined and in italics. What’s this got to do with you? Good question. It turns out that you died and Eternity resurrected you. Or you could’ve been infused with his essence. The cosmic energy within your body grants you great power, which stems from an impossibly miniscule fragment of Eternity’s being. This grants you physical abilities, lifespan, and healing factor on par with a strong Asgardian. In addition to these gifts, you can fly at hypersonic speeds and shoot beams of cosmic energy from your eyes. This, like other abilities, grows with practice, but it can also develop through other means. As I said, Eternity is the embodiment of the universe. As you travel to different jumps, dimensions, or universes, you will passively absorb some parts of that universe as well, bolstering your powers and unlocking new capabilities. A plane of fire might unlock pyrokinesis, or a visit to an afterlife may result in you discovering latent potential in necromancy."

You are intrinsically linked to a concept of your choice, whether it’s something concrete like fire or ice, or something more abstract, like beauty.

Likewise, the more specific you choose, the stronger you’ll be."

That is Jeannie Strange as she was in the original run of Marvel 2099. This doesn’t really give you much in the way of magical skill, Metalscream appears to have been more than your equal in that regard, but you possess the talent and raw sorcerous power to potentially claim the title of Sorcerer Supreme in this age, and to become worthy of that mantle with time and study as shown by Jeannie Strange in some of the other versions of 2099, Earth-928 or otherwise."
619,,600,Great Power Yet Untapped,Heroes Reborn,Source,"You possess great magical potential and talent. While this won’t give you any actual skills with sorcery, you possess the raw talents needed to master it. Any magic you do learn is stronger than that used by most, and you will find your reserves of energy for magic far deeper; this applies to magic from other worlds as much as this one. In addition this makes you sensitive to magical energies, you are able to feel a peeking God of Trickery wandering around in spiritual form - at least after a few moments - and to sense flows of magical energy. You are also able to release this magic in semi-controlled bursts; this is not an energy efficient use of your magical talents, but can cause things to explode, teleport allies to your side, make low scale changes of reality according to your will, or if a more experienced and even powerful sorcerer was working a particularly complicated spell to banish a god to another dimension and you did so at a notably vulnerable moment you might even make their spell backfire. Of course, don’t get cocky, this power coupled with training is something that the important magic users in this universe possess."
620,,600,Power Absorption,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Source,There are a wide variety of powers that are possessed by a multiple of individuals in this world. So many of their users waste their potential however. So why don’t you take their powers and show them what they could have been. This perk grants you the ability to absorb the powers others possess by draining them. The main limit is that it takes a certain amount of time depending on the strength of the power. This also must remain uninterrupted to be successful. This means that you must subdue your target and isolate them during the process so that you are not interrupted.
621,,600,Externalized Power,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Source,"Few mortal mages of this world are capable of purely relying on their own internal magical power. Even the Sorcerer Supreme relies on external sources: pacts with spiritual entities; objects of power; and drawing on the mystical energies of the Earth itself through its ley lines are all common sources of power. And even without this perk you could use these external sources to power your magic of this world.

You however are particularly skilled at utilizing external sources of mystical power whether with the magic of this world or another one. You know how to make pacts with mystical entities, and even in future jumps will be able to craft spells that draw on their energies much like the spells of this world do, adapting your magic to the powers of entities of other worlds with ease.

With ley lines, and other sources of magical energy, you seem to be able to handle larger quantities than would otherwise be expected, and to take to them more naturally. You are also particularly adept at using various energies to fuel your magical abilities, even bridging the use of more ‘scientific’ energies for magical means. You can even handle channeling often dangerous or maddening energies more easily than others. It’s still probably a bad idea to try and channel and harness the full energy of the life force itself, but you’d do better than most.

You are of course talented at drawing energy from objects of power. Particularly you are skilled at working around mystical limitations on their use, and tapping into their powers even if you are not quite the proper variety of entity, or don’t quite fit the restrictions. This does have its limits. You might manage to use the norn stones as a Celtic goddess instead of an Asgardian one, but Surtur’s Twilight Sword would likely require some more effort - maybe tapping into Cthonic chaos magic and the capabilities of a nexus being. Similarly you might manage to use the Eye of Agamotto which cannot be used by beings who are not ‘good’ but has a history of being fooled, but Mjolnir would likely prove a more difficult proposition, though not necessarily impossible and even if you couldn’t force it to allow you to lift it and wield its power directly you could tap it for its energies.

This even extends to other, unwilling beings. You are capable of tapping into the mystical energies of other individuals. While this is easiest with willing individuals, you know how to do so even with unwilling ones."

As a resident of New Asgard or Apokalypse, you embody a single concept over which you have perfect comprehension and vast, vaguely defined control. Besides being immortal, with immense strength and endurance, and access to advanced magic and technology undreamt of by mortal man.

You are not just flesh, but the embodiment of a concept. It could be a natural force, like the storm or a volcano, or an abstract concept like tyranny or rhetoric. Either way, your understanding of your domain and all things related to it is absolute, you can sense any related phenomena at great distances and control your domain, though at times it may be... complex. A war god could cause war to taper off or kill less innocents, but might find it difficult to stop a war altogether, for instance."

This energy bursts out from within you but the gateway within appears to be modulated by your current confidence in your own abilities. Being confident will increase your powers and losing faith in yourself will weaken or negate them entirely. While the energy is at your fingertips, even at a reasonable level of confidence, you’ll find yourself endowed with immense physical attributes. You’ll have the strength to easily compete with and overpower Miss Marvel and come close to the Hulk at his base, along with a maintained forcefield around your person that can stand up to even the full Phoenix Force for a few seconds. The forcefield can be controlled to let through specific substances, such as oxygen and light, without letting in harmful things or too much of a specific material. Your powers allow you to travel at extreme speeds and even fly through space, along with enhancing your senses the more energy is flowing through the rest of your body.

You have a long and intense training in the arts of magic, placing you as an equal to both Magik and Doctor Strange in this time, though it is important to note that Strange at this point has lost much of his power and that while you are very powerful, you are far from the match of the cosmic entities that Strange once equaled. You have vast skill and knowledge of the arcane and contracts with several mystical beings of great power, perhaps even of infernal power should your affinity go towards that direction. However, more uniquely, you have access to a special dimension of your own. Like Magik rules over Limbo, you have access to and ruler-ship over a moderately sized dimensional realm. This is the realm in which you are Sorceror Supreme and it supplies no small amount of mystical power to you, enabling you to use magic without such heavy reliance on tools or contracts if you please. The realm is currently the size of a large city such as Sydney or Melbourne but could potentially grow if more magical power were supplied. The denizens and theme of the realm are up to you, though by default they are demonic beings of low to moderate power. They are somewhat loyal but will require a display of power to keep them in such a way. You can shape and control much of this realm with just thought, shifting landmasses and sculpting life within it, but these abilities and the potential magic and powers you can develop through mastery of this plane of existence must be developed further as they currently are. Perhaps you could even learn to summon your personal kingdom to the real world in part."

These powerful objects are the remnants of the singularity that predated the universe and possess universal power when combined. The Power Gem gives its user access to all power and energy. Its basic use provides unlimited stamina and limitless strength depending on how much power is drawn from the stone. With more practice of its use it can unlock any physical based superpower. It produces a feedback circuit with the other stones, being further empowered if you possess the Mind Stone and being able to in turn further empower the Space Stone. If you combine all of the infinity stones together you become an entity capable of completely controlling a single universe. Whichever primary universe you inhabit at the start of each jump is considered the prime universe for stones and is thus the only one you can manipulate.

The Black Vortex appears as a large ornate mirror that shows one what they would look like if granted the mirror’s immense cosmic power. If you or anyone else stands before the mirror and says “I submit to the Black Vortex” they will be granted massive and thematically appropriate cosmic powers. The cost for these powers is usually a massive change to a more egotistical and dangerous personality but since you are paying for it feel free to toggle that side effect. You can also restrict who can use the mirror. The immense powers granted by the mirror dissipate with time and exertion but there is no limit to how many times you can submit to the mirror.

However, whilst normally these would function as nothing more than harmful extra circuits, yours are special. Not only do the worms within you make no physical change or discomfort on your body, they can in fact be converted into independent stores of energy for any form of supernatural or mundane energy, not just magic. So long as you can produce it, you can convert any of the worms within your body to also produce that energy, along with being able to use it as easily as you could use your own stores. You could even have the worms crawl out of your body and implant themselves in another to give them use of the energy. Crest Worms create and store relatively little energy on their own, the equivalent of one magic circuit each, but it is possible to increase this over time with study and experimentation. These Crest Worms are also capable of laying an egg every few months to breed more of themselves, taking around 6 months for each egg to hatch. Finally, in an emergency, each of the Crest Worms is capable of fighting on their own, being capable of flight, covered in nasty spines and having around the attack power of a mid-sized dog."

It feels like a gaping maw within you, devouring everything it can to feed itself at the cost of everything else. Perhaps you may never sate those dark urges of yours but you have become able to placate it for a while with a nice round of evil acts. You regain energy by committing sins and causing pain and misery to others. The worse your crimes, the more energy you’ll regain from them. This is not merely limited to restoring your stamina either but can be channelled into any form of energy you produce, including magical energy. You’ll be able to go all day and all night, so long as you keep the cruelty turned all the way up.

Boosted: Your evil acts can now increase your overall physical or magical power. Instead of gaining back energy, you may choose to channel it into either of the above, slowly increasing them the more evil the act and the more evil acts you do. These boosts are temporarily and will not last long. You may customize the way the boosts work to an extent, putting it all into one category or partly into both. You may also choose to concentrate all the evil energy into one short boost that only lasts a minute or greatly lessen the power you gain in exchange for almost an hour of strengthening.

632,,600,Family Crest,Fate,Source,"The most treasured possession of any magus family, this is the source of all their knowledge. Taking the form of an engraved marking somewhere upon the body, it gives a significant boost to your magic circuits, enough to equal 60 or so extra circuits in output, and can help sustain you life at a critical point but it's real advantage lies in the ability to store spells in it, and activate them merely by running power through the seal. It is also possible to store other types of knowledge within, with some effort, and when you have a child, you can pass down this Crest as their inheritance."

Regardless, you’re a Level 1 Esper now, with an immense capability for growth. Choose a power on the Raildex Science jump’s Esper ability list, except for Imagine Breaker. That’s not really an esper ability. Bear in mind that mana and an Esper’s altered brain don’t mix, and you’ll likely need regeneration abilities, a healer, or simply timely visits to a hospital to make effective use of magic. Your growth rate is far beyond that of most Espers, so expect to hit Level 5 before the jump ends."

Hextech may be more reliable, and able to be put in the hands of any, but this power can be commanded by nothing more than word and will, and the possibilities it presents are vast.

It will take time to devise new spells based upon the runes you know and can discover, and you’re still limited by the power sources you have access to. Your own internal energies will suffice for basic spells, but for grander works, such as long-distance teleportation, you will require equally-grand sources of power."
637,,600,The Greatest Fae Male ,A Throne of Glass,Source,"You now possess magic on the level of the Greatest Fae male in existence, a massive well of magic oriented towards: Air, Ice, and Lightning. With this magic, and a few days delving you would have more than the power to fight an army, you could freeze an armada in place. Even with other magic users trying to break your hold, you would be able to hold them in place, and while it would be tiring, the armada would be within your grasp. More however than simply power, this comes with skill, a skill that would spread and increase any other magic you buy in this jump to an equivalent level of skill. Where others after many years of practice would be able to pull the air out of someone’s lungs or create a powerful gust of wind. You have the skill the rip the very oxygen out of their blood, use focused air as a potent form of telekinesis, or create vacuums by pulling away the air, able to snuff out even the hottest fires. More than that however this level of skill is easy for you to use, not requiring much focus or effort. What others would consider skilled and taxing for a master to use, you can achieve casually with your magic."

Regardless, for you the bloodline has come roaring to its full power in your veins. You have gained an immense gift for Raw Magic, the most versatile form of magic in this world, with a potency expected for the descendent of a one of the most powerful Fae to ever exist, and an enfleshed Goddess who descended from heaven, you gain a well of magic that is bottomless. While you are limited in the amount of magic you can channel at a time, you will never truly run out of magic. Your capacity for magic is immense, able to destroy a large castle or fortress with no preparation, causing you only mild exhaustion. With a few days of preparation, you could bring a castle crumbling to the ground with no apparent drain to yourself. Raw magic is considered to be the best form of magic due to its versatility, able to take on any elemental form of magic naturally, those with Raw magic can learn to have their magic copy any other magical gift it gets exposed to. Allowing raw magic wielder to learn how to use even the more esoteric forms of magic such as shape-shifting, and teleportation if they simply have a chance to let their magic read the shape and flow of other magics. Skillful users of Raw magic have also been able to learn how to steal parts of others esoteric powers, ripping it away from an individual and integrating it into their own power. Because of its mutability Raw magic allows greater flexibility with some magic’s, such as by allowing those who shapeshift using this power to seamlessly have their clothes and carried items integrate into the shift, and re-emerge undamaged whenever the shift is completed.

Users of Raw magics also have several potent forms of magic that only they can use, they are able to directly and consciously increase their physical speed, and strength proportional to how much magical energy they use. They are also able to form invisible hands of force, these hands give the wielder the full feedback of a normal hand apart from pain. A Raw magic wielder may generate as many of these hands at a time as they want, of any size they wish, and the hands have been shown to be as strong as the magic fed into them, able to do things like tighten so much that they near instantly sever the limbs and head of monstrous creatures like Ilken that are greatly resistant to magic.

639,,600,Alpha Rune ,Ben 10,Source,"A fragment of the legendary Map of Infinity and a powerful artifact on its own, this is the Alpha Rune. Aside from being a stone with a very pretty purple symbol on it, it has a very special property within it: The true name of magic. With this stone in hand, magic itself is at your beck and call. Acting as a keystone for Ledgerdomain itself, even a non-spellcaster is able to use magic and the massive amounts of mana within the Rune. You can also manipulate the spells of others or shut them down entirely with an act of will alone, your own magical might amplified a hundred times over. While some beyond your power may be able to resist this, you are indeed a ruler of all magic with this in hand...just don’t let it go to your head. This Rune’s power has had a history of driving its wielders mad."
640,,600,Manablood,Ben 10,Source,"Well, that explains where all of your confidence is coming from. Not only are you a native to Ledgerdomain (even if you’re an alien, somehow!), you’re among its royalty. Perhaps you’re a missing child of Spellbinder and thus a sibling to Hope, or belonging to some bloodline made extinct many years ago? Regardless, your capacity for magic is well above even some of the greatest sorcerers around...your body can channel and store twice the amount of mana it normally could, and wield it with fantastic amounts of precision and efficiency. You can likely sling spells about for hours before noticing any fatigue entering your body. Likewise, learning new magic or individual spells and enchantments comes easily to you, accomplishing in weeks what would take the average wizard centuries to pull off. It’s unwise to underestimate you, isn’t it?"
641,,600,Where The Heart Is ,Ben 10,Source,"One problem with magic, particularly in this world, is that it’s not quite as powerful outside of its dimension of origin: Ledgerdomain. You often have to make use of some lengthy rituals or magical implements in order to use it to its full potential, and even so it tends not to have as much oompf as in its home plane. Not anymore! Whether your body is a natural conduit for mana or you just found an intricate loophole, when you draw magical energy from Ledgerdomain or any source of magical power you can reach into, it will always be at its full power and potential. Even if you’re trapped somewhere without a drop of mana, you will still be able to sling spells about like no one’s business. Who’s helpless now? "
642,,600,Job Offer,The Dresden Files,Source,"One of the big dogs in the Supernatural world has taken a shine to you, and made you an offer that you didn't refuse. You've become an Emissary, the representative and agent of one of these powers, and in exchange, you gained a substantial benefits package. Inhuman strength, supernatural knowledge, amazing artifacts, and even a portion of your boss's magical power can all be yours. Exactly what you get depends on who you choose, but it'll always be thematically related to them. A God of Thunder might give you some of his strength, let you call on his lightning, and even borrow his hammer.

Of course, there's one big downside to this. You're now bound to whoever you picked as your patron, which means you've got a ton of responsibility. You're basically their hand in the Mortal world, managing their interests, striking out against their enemies, and doing their dirty deeds. Refuse to obey them, and they can cut you off, leaving you to twist in the wind when you need them the most. They can also send out some supernatural knee-breakers to make you understand the contract you agreed to. On the other hand, if you advance their interests, they'll be rewarding you appropriately, which means you could conceivably wind up with a lot more power than you started out with.

When you pick this option, you'll have to choose a Patron. This can be any of the huge entities we've run across: The Erlking, Ferrovax, Donar Vadderung in either of his guises, or even the Red King if you're a masochist. You could even pick someone who might theoretically be interested - I've heard the Buddha mentioned a possible opening, and there's always a chance the Hindu Pantheon might wake up. There's only four you can't pick: Summer has a Knight, Winter is scouting another candidate, and the man upstairs and the guys below both have their own recruiting procedures."

According to ancient traditions, gods would put dying allies out of their misery to take their power, making good use of the waning soul within them. Following the old ways, you too have taken to following this practice and the benefits it implies. By being in physical contact with an enemy on their death, you are able to absorb their essence into yours directly. What exactly this entails depends on those you slay/are touching when they die. Normal souls simply empower you a little, or en masse will begin to make you grow larger. Truly numerous souls can even cause you to double or triple in size. Those who would have “Boss Souls” as identified in the “Soul Collector” general perk can impart entirely new abilities and skills that you didn’t have before. Based on power in relation to your soul, they can even give considerable enhancement to power. It’s important to note two things however. The first being that souls with natures in direct opposition to your own, such as belonging to someone with a polar opposite mind, or belonging to a being completely unlike yourself, can have subtle unwanted influences as well When purchased with Knight of the Lord, you can instead direct the absorption of a soul into a piece of equipment you currently have on you, such as weapons, armor or miscellaneous objects, to enhance those things instead.

This is not the Cauldron, as the Cauldron could remove curses, restore youth, recuperate mortal wounds, and even revive the recently dead to fully living beings. But this is a treasure none the less. This grail has the capacity of a soup bowl, and has a shimmering liquid eternally filling it...this liquid is capable of restoring the youth of whomever drinks it to the prime of their life, and in addition is a potent source of necromantic power, capable of giving the necessary mana to perform some of the restorative and necromantic magics of Locthwhain."

The hedrons that keep the Eldrazi bound were once full of magic, but some have faded over the years. That doesn’t stop you getting one last use out of them, grinding them up and using the very last dregs of their power to drive back the Eldrazi. You find this applying to any magical artifact: so long as even a sliver of its power remains, you can crush it up and get some use out of it, no matter how broken it is. Even the bottle that held a potion once might find some use, so long as there is a trace of the potion still there stuck to the bottom. With years of practice you might be able to use these dregs as though they were the original a single time, before all remaining power is lost."
648,,600,Primal Power ,MtG - Shandalar,Source ,"Mana is power, and power is life. This is not a universally accepted truth, but even the Black mana of brackish swamps still hews to this principle to an extent. Consequently, the mage with more mana holds more power... and is more likely to stay alive, regardless of how they wield it. This Perk grants you no additional means of using such power, but your mastery over the wild, untamed forces of magic have granted you a major increase in wielding power nonetheless. Whenever you draw upon any source of magical power, whether it’s a bonded land flush with mana, a magical artifact of some sort, or even innate magical forces never seen on Shandalar, you can draw twice as much raw power as you could before, without any restrictions or downsides. Your immense talents at channeling such vast quantities of energy also grant you complete immunity to the so-called ‘Mana Burn’ lesser mages might experience if they lose control over their unspent mana, and may even aid against similar problems you might face elsewhere."

When you attempt to cast huge spells, the kind which takes concentration and lots of energy, you can get other people to support you. If you do so, then you can divide the ‘cost’ of casting the spell among you, significantly decreasing the amount of energy and time you will have to spend on it as an individual. With only a few friends helping this would make a huge difference."

Not only are you swearing to live your life by their rules and whims, but you are exposing your soul to theirs - something that is by no means safe, especially if there is even the smallest fracture in your oaths. Still, the risks are almost always worth the power to be gained, and so you have entered into one such contract with a Kami that is supportive of your faction. You might have a small fragment of one of the Myojin feeding power and duties into you, or you could have something smaller like a Kami of Hot Springs empowering you to defend the waters from pollution. This is very much up to you to define, though do be aware that the actual power this grants is very much dependent upon your relationship - the more respect you have for them and they for you, the more you understand each other, the more power they can grant and you can draw upon. In future jumps, you may choose between having an automatic offer of employment with a similar deity should one exist, or simply keeping the Kami you have now."

This is the lesson that teaches how to feast upon the flesh of Kami and gain some whimsical shadow of their powers. This power allows one to, once the foe is defeated and before they are slain, use a series of rituals to prepare the foe before consuming them alive so as to take on some of their power.

With this, one’s life will know age only when one wills it so, wounds fade within hours that once would have taken days, and the power of this stone can even be used to seal away a single being you personally defeated in battle. This sealed being can then be used as a source of Mana, though a strangely Colorless kind which isn’t known well around these parts, tapping the beings lifeforce for power as if it were a land. The greater the being sealed the more Mana can be tapped, though it would take a being on the level O-Kagachi, a being who was the Kami of the Border between the human world and that of the spirits and one of the strongest beings in Kamigawa besides, to get even three Colorless Mana per tapping. Once sealed the being stays within That-Which-Was-Found until such a time that you seal a different being into That-Which-Was-Found at which point the being returns, diminished to it’s original world with no chance of being caught or used in any other way."

They can feel the deep magic coming off you in waves, forces churning and pooling against your considerable surface that are not natural but supernatural. Ancient beings amass huge stores of knowledge and magic over the course of their long lives, and you now count amongst the most ancient of giants.

You were born on a day when everything changed, during an aurora long ago. It was not your fault your birthday was special, it just happened that way. Now centuries later, your venerable age is perhaps only rivalled by the oracle Rosheen Meanderer and the yew treefolk Colfenor. Your very presence continually affects an area the size of a valley around you, concentrating the local arcane energy and perhaps even altering it.

Should you decide to take a long rest somewhere, whether you slumber in an isolated valley or someplace else, the sheer concentration of arcane energy swirling and accumulating around you might even start to draw in changelings in droves, as easily influenced by powerful magic as they are. It also provides a rare opportunity to the mages amongst the small folk: What is impossible anywhere else in Lorwyn might well be achievable in your shadow."

As a result of this unnatural augmentation, you attained an incredible level of regeneration, able to heal from minor injuries nigh-instantly, recover from being stabbed through the heart in just a few seconds, and regrow lost limbs in about a minute.

But, as strange as it may sound, your regeneration is the lesser of your new powers. The other benefit this perk gives you is that you are now empowered by the negative emotions of those in your vicinity - Whenever someone succumbs to such feelings, the black Rukh they generate bolsters your physical abilities. While a single person’s despair won’t strengthen you all that much, a crowd of people filled with hatred or despair can grant you the power you need to fight on equal terms with an experienced Metal Vessel user."

Whatever power they gained in their worship, whatever names they took and causes they championed, are now their chains. Rumor, myth, and legend give them power, but a power without one of those is one they cannot possess. Even the queen of the divine ancestors, Guinevere, accidentally created a new god during an attempt to empower her king. You might know him as Arthur. Rebelling against their own story, or perhaps more importantly, the fact that it is over, caused the gods to transition from truly divine to ‘heretic’. You, however, have actually succeeded. You are capable of growth even when growth ought to be impossible, of changing your nature as a God without becoming [Heretical] in the process. This power bleeds out to the rest of you, letting you overcome any set limit, like striking twice with a weapon only usable every ten years, or maybe something as simple as learning a skill that you do not meet the requirements to learn.

As a Campione, you gain an all-around stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn’t have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay.

Forget about being “average”, you are not a high rank Servant, placing you somewhere among the top of power that Servants can rest at. Comparable to the likes of Karna and Gilgamesh, the abilities and potency that your Matrix can afford you with this purchase is far greater than before. You have quite a bit of leeway when coming up with conceptual abilities, and as long as you are no weaker or stronger than a high rank Servant, you may customize your Matrix as you wish. Additionally, you possess a trump card of sorts. A Noble Phantasm greater than what is supposed to be wielded by Servants. Perhaps it’s an enlightened state of nigh-omniscience, a mirror that reflects life and death, or a primordial weapon that rends asunder reality itself. Merely using it at full power will be so straining that using it for longer than a few seconds will kill you, but that is simply the limitations of the high rank Servant vessel you occupy with just this. Perhaps with the right methods, you’d be able to upgrade your Matrix to the point of more effectively wielding such a powerful weapon. There certainly seem to be plenty of such opportunities in the Moon Cell."
662,,600,Unchained,Fate/Extra CCC,Source,"How did BB cause this much trouble? She wasn’t just a rogue AI, but she consumed other AIs, and even Servants, to increase her memory capacity, her processing power, which resulted in her being able to hijack the Moon Cell’s systems in the far side of the moon, and caused the entire conflict that you now find yourself in. She consumed most of the Servants of the Holy Grail War, created the school building the Masters took residence in, expanded the Sakura Labyrinth to tunnel through the Moon Cell’s defenses, and eventually broke through and infiltrated the Core of the Moon Cell itself. Now, you know the trick she used to consume and grow. 

You are able to consume someone or something that you have within your grasp, absorbing their body, their mind, their soul, all of their abilities, and turning them into more power for yourself. You can’t copy or obtain abilities this way, it just translates into raw power, but a very versatile yet weak victim will yield as much result as a less versatile but equally as brutally strong one. Eating humans and normal AIs barely yields any power, but eating Servants carries a notable boost. You would need to consume more than a hundred Servants to become the powerhouse that BB had to be to whisk away the Masters of the Holy Grail War into the far side of the Moon, but unfortunately most of the Servants that were around have already been consumed by her. Not just beings, but you can also absorb objects, but those will yield far, far less energy and power. 

However, there is a catch. There is a price to rising above your station to such a degree. It won’t be too much of a problem until you start approaching the level of the Moon Cell itself should you have begun as a simple managerial AI, but if you grow too much beyond your base state, too quickly, you will start having issues with your personality. Losing yourself to your power, you would slowly become more and more robotic, and unless you stop consuming for a while, your own artificially inflated mind will break down into being little more than a dumb machine. Of course, if you take this slow, it won’t be an issue. Spacing out your growth over years and decades, instead of rushing into it in weeks, would be a good start."
663,,600,ROMA,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Source ,"It is no ordinary man that can found Rome. It is a man of power, of great fate, of pure purpose, that
can accomplish such a deed. A noble beast in human flesh, with a connection to the very land on
which his eternal kingdom will reign. When your future people look on you, they’ll see a founder
they can worship. You have the physical power to compete with anyone short of Heracles, tearing
through mountains like paper and reshaping the landscape with your foot falls. Even whole countries
tremble at your hardest blows. Your power is not limited to to the purely physical either, as you have
an enormously powerful innate ability to create plant life. From raising ordinary plants out of mud, causing gargantuan trees to violently burst from the ground and crush all your foes to even create
enormous magical beings that can dwarf castles, you easily bring forth new life. Your magical
reserves are great enough to create dozens of such large creatures without rest, though you lack any
other magical training.

However, your role as a founder is something important in itself. Nations that you found find
themselves blessed with good fortune and all those who are born into your nation will look up to
you as like a living deity, a beloved grandparent to be respected, emulated and even worshiped. Even those who are merely distant descendants of those of your nation will feel a strong affinity for
you. In return, you have a strange awareness of all of your ‘children’ across the world, telling you
their location and their health, as well as the ability to significantly but temporarily increase the

664,,600,Top Five,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Source ,"It was Hecate herself who saw the great potential in you for magic. It was also that Goddess of Magic
that decided to take you under her tutelage and see how far you could go, perhaps even alongside
your fellow pupils Circe and Medea. To say you impressed would be quite the understatement.

You’re every bit the fully realised equal of both possible peers, at least when it comes to magic in
general, given you lack their particular specialties that are detailed in earlier perks. You have a very
in depth training in dozens of different areas of the magic found in the Age of Gods, letting you warp
the natural world with ease and quite capably handle yourself even in the company of demigods like
Heracles or Achilles. From curses and the elements, to enchantment, supporting spells, alchemical
creations and all sorts of minor and major disciplines, you’re one of the greats. It’s helped along by
the very high amount of magical power at your command, both within you and the energy you easily
command in the world around you, that makes even melting down a mountain a matter of moderate
effort.

The High Speed Divine Words taught to you by Hecate also mean that for all but the most complex
spells, and for actual rituals, you can cast spells with just a single word, even if they would normally
require several minutes of casting and lengthy chants. A wonderful aid when dealing with heroes
fast enough to race the gods themselves. Finally, Hecate’s favour has resulted in a fair amount of
similar favour when dealing with other deities of magic, or those with similar power or authority
over such things, letting you much more easily befriend and enter contracts or services with them. "
665,,600,Saver,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"At the origin of the world, there lies truth. Only through a perfect understanding of yourself, the
world around you and the nature of existence can it be reached. A level beyond mere enlightenment
in a religious sense, it is an achievement of spirituality that only Shakyamuni has truly reached. And
now one other. The universe is forced to acknowledge what you are now, a golden light emanating
from your presence that brings all things to peace before you. Demons are reduced to the strength
and will of babes, the chaos of the natural world calming before your path and the flowers of the
lotus blooming in your footsteps. Only those with enlightened natures of their own, for peace or
perversion, and those of enough strength to operate at the level on the scale of celestial objects
themselves can resist this light fully, though those of a inhuman nature are less effected than full
humans.

Towards your inner self, your enlightenment has also led to an understanding between your body
and the rest of the world. Offence against you, from normal blows to conceptual attacks or magic, finds itself reduced in power by your own overall endurance before it is allowed to strike you. In
effect, if something cannot kill you in one strike at least, it will not hurt you at all, and would need to
do so twice over to kill you. An effect of this protection that reaching Humanity’s truth has granted is
that outside forces are unable to interfere with your mind at all and those who are named as the
Beasts of Humanity, and their like, can be understood and connected with in ways not normally
possible for the mad creatures.

To know Truth as you do is to rule, to be placed at the throne of existence. Because of your nature
and the light that shines from you, you have the right of governance over reality around you. Through the light of your sagacious soul, you command the universe to act in your wishes and it
responds with eagerness. Reality itself warps, in similar ways to the use of the powerful Authorities
of the Gods, though your governance takes precedence over even their commands. Your rights
extend to the scale of the entire Solar System, allowing you to manipulate events within such an
area and on the scale of whole worlds. However, this is true governance, not only your powers. It relies on you requesting this of the world around you and while it will listen, it can struggle to act on
an incredibly fine scale. Yours is a being that exists beyond human imagination and that can cause
conflict if you wish to interfere in the lives of individual humans, your powers struggling to go
beneath the scale of a village in what they effect. However, because it is the universe acting in
response to your commands, it is a simple matter to give many orders in quick succession, as it is
carried out in accordance to your will by reality. Commands could even be set up to have conditions
or go into action at a certain time. And, as before, those who share enlightenment in their own right
can resist or fight back against this control, perhaps using their own powers in spite of your abilities. "
666,,600,God King,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"In times of dire need, the gods have shown the ability to become a pantheon in a much different
sense of the word than normal. Instead of acting as a loosely linked group, divine spirits have the
ability to combine into a greater form, adding together their Authority to create a far more powerful
singular result. You are, in particular, a perfect host for such a task. You can accept into your being
the divine, taking in gods and divine entities into yourself to combine and become greater. It
requires consent from the deity, though this needn’t be willingly given consent, or utter defeat of
your target before you can force the transfer on them and the results are impressive. Not only do
you take up their powers, knowledge and their Authority but the more that combine together within
you, the greater each part becomes on their own. A pantheon that continually raises itself up, each
component supporting another. You’ll remain in control of yourself and of the absorbed gods, though you can find that they influence your personality in small ways, especially when combining
with particularly potent gods. 

This process has already been started, willingly by several moderately powerful gods of the time. Enough to grant you three Authorities on a scale able to affect whole continents at once, having
boosted each other to significant levels already. Your raw power, in the form of your body and magic, has grown to match this as well. You’re well familiar with whatever you gain from your chosen Gods
and will find yourself particularly gifted when it comes to learning to use divine abilities, like
Authorities. A helpful aid when you may soon gain many more."
667,,600,Universe of Love,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"As your body burned away, scorched by the gods as punishment for your sins, you found a
connection. As each limb turned to dust, something replaced it, something infinitely greater than
before. The universe reached out to you and you took hold, becoming a part of it more than any
other being. Though your limbs have healed now, it takes only a thought to activate that connection. Your arms and legs fade to mere outlines, becoming Ether Clumps that appear to be filled with stars. Your hair reflects the galaxies of the universe and your body shines with cosmic light. In this state, your body is the universe and the universe is thus your body. To manipulate the universe is as easy
as moving your own body, an obvious fact that you could change it as certainly as you could move
your fingers. Not only does this allow you to manipulate reality, it allows you to act as if your body
and the universe were one. Spreading your senses through all your body covers, to cast magic from
any point in your grand scale or affect the universe with something that would only target yourself
or anything you are touching.

But as you become magnificent, you are also limited. As grand as it is to describe yourself as a
universe, you are not quite that in reality. Your powers begin to fade quickly once they reach beyond
the scale of the solar system, limiting their effectiveness enough that it is unlikely you will be able to
effect even the nearest other system. While your control may be greater than that of a Saver within
this scale, you are limited due to it being your own body. While your body has expanded, your mind
has not. Spreading your senses through the universe would still rely on how much you can
concentrate on at a time. When you alter reality, you are again still limited to your own mental
abilities. Making two or three alterations to reality at once may be possible but it’d stretch the
extent of what you can reasonably keep in mind at once. If your mind grew greater, you would be
able to keep more in your awareness and control more at once, as logic would dictate. 

As you control the universe because it is your body, it also means that others can strike back at you
through the universe. While simply cutting space on a small scale would be an unnoticeable pinprick, others can use magic to counter you as if you were at your normal scale and strength of magical
power. You could create an entire world in minutes but a powerful magician could still cripple you with a curse if you are not careful and aware, especially when targeted against your normal form. Should you lack power of your own, it may prove to be a double edged sword."
668,,600,Crown of Light,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"Horns of light, bone and metal above the brow of a calamitous Beast. This crown of horns is the sign
of the Evils of Mankind, resting on the brow on one of the creatures who are charged with punishing
humanity. Through some means, you became a candidate in your own right and ascended to
partially take on one of these positions. A new Beast of Mankind. The horns of your design that
sprout from your head represent that position now. 

The act of becoming this grants several unique abilities. The first is Independent Manifestation, allowing the transportation and materialisation of the soul across time and space. Travelling
throughout the timeline and across the world is easy for you, taking a few minutes to discorporate and reincorporate when you do so. While the accuracy in location of arrival can leave something to
be desired, the time travelling aspect is pinpoint.

Second is the Authority of the Beast that you gain, an ability through which an enormous advantage
is gained against all beings classified as Human. Any being such as this finds your powers to be far
greater against them than against anyone else. Not to a degree that great heroes could not put up a
fight but enough to make that same fight feel almost impossible even for the greatest of the human
masses.

The final aspect of all Beasts is the Nega attribute. Each Beast is a counter to a specific category of
being, against which they receive additional and enormous advantages. A counter to Servants that
negates their greatest abilities and grants the Beast additional buffs when fighting against that
category of being. Negating almost all powers of those that qualify for the Saver and Ruler classes, with similar buffs as before, showcasing a narrower focus. You may create your own Nega skill here, composed of negating some aspect of the power set of your chosen target range and gaining large
increases in effectiveness against them. The smaller your range, the greater your negation and
benefits will be."
669,,600,Arms of Heaven,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source ,"Within your arms lie miracles, the holy power of the lord. In the left is the foundation of holy power,
in the right the destroyer of wickedness. These arms are weapons that turn you into a holy warrior
against your enemies, allowing you to make use of their magecraft and empowering your body and
mind against them. The left arm reinforces your physical body, granting both eternal youth and
enough capability to fight powerful demons and heroes, albeit well short of the Three Great Youkai. The right allows you to heal yourself and to see a short distance into the future, predicting what
moves your opponents will make in battle. Each arm implants a wealth of experience in combat into
your mind, granting you powerful instincts to see through trickery in war. They also significantly
empower any holy abilities or arts you may already be familiar with, particularly the magecraft of the
church.

But the core power of these two arms is to turn the tools of the magus against them. Linking to the
foundational theory of all magecraft, they allow for you to make use of any magecraft that exists
even without knowing anything on how to use them. Esoteric and complicated spells can be cast so
long as you provide the needed materials, even the most complex magical tools can be commanded
at your touch, bypassing restrictions on the user. The level of use allowed by this almighty key to
magecraft is basic, outmatched by true masters of these fields, but your capabilities are
comprehensive. If you can provide the power, almost any task can be accomplished, and you can
easily turn the magic and tools of enemies against themselves with a touch.

In future worlds, you will be able to connect to similar foundations of magic but the arms will not be
able to go beyond what is possible through magecraft here. The strain is simply too great as they are
now."
670,,600,Nine Tails to Be,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source,"Great power is like a wall, bringing both safety and separation from those without it. It’s not surprise
that many of the most powerful creatures here have reduced their might in order to experience life
again, living among humans as equals or near-such rather than standing above them as a goddess. In
the past, you used to be a being of importance beyond the scale of this world, but your past self made the choice to reduce to a fraction of their power. For whatever reason, your current state is
the result.

Originally, you were a divinity related to a stellar object, capable of manipulating a star or some
other equivalent astrological object. Now you are ‘merely’ a mighty Youkai, equal to the Three
Greats of Japan. A demonic fox that can reap armies with fire and claw, a gargantuan skeleton with
the strength to cleave castles with a twitch. Your physical prowess is immense, the sort that would
require teams of heroes to challenge, and you have a varied set of magical abilities of similar
potence to match legends like Tamamo no Mae, Yamata no Orochi and similar beasts. All is powered
by vast well of magical energy and mystery within your body, more than almost any non-divine being
in Japan. But your original power is not locked off from you forever. 

With time and intent, as well as experiencing many struggles in life, you can slowly regain your loss
glory. This occurs in nine stages, like a kitsune slowly regrowing their lost tails until they have all nine
once again. Each stage greatly increases the power this option provides but takes progressively
longer to unlock. The ninth stage is unlikely to happen before a thousand years have passed but
would make you an equal to Amaterasu herself, the original form of Tamamo. "

done your body well. You’ve got the speed to fight entire armies at once, cleaving through hundreds
or thousands of men each second, and the strength to pick up and throw a hill over the horizon to
wipe the smirk off that smug bitch’s face. Even those fancy pant’s guys over at Britain would find you
a tough opponent just based on your physical might but given just how long your stamina lasts, that
might be the scarier part. You could fight without sleep for seven years straight, fighting hours and
hours each day and eating as you go. Even if an enemy does manage to hurt you, short of ripping
apart all your muscles and grinding your bones to dust and pulping your organs, it won’t stop you
from continuing to swing your blade at them. Lastly, as a bit of a blessing from whoever your parent
might have been since they didn’t leave you with anything else, you’ll find your body is perfectly
suited for fighting inhuman monsters. The energy that pumps through your veins sings at the chance
to carve up some beasts, driving you to much greater heights of strength and speed when you pit
yourself against creatures of the night and of evil."
672,,600,Small Divinity,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Source ,"Most holy of holies, what queen is more deserving of the right to rule then one that is literally divine?
A minor divine spirit you may be but to the mortals around you, the distinction is often hard to see. As a Divine Spirit, you receive numerous benefits. Your body is significantly greater than that of any
normal humans, so you should have no issue splattering them about with your fists, but you are not
so strong that a capable warrior like the Knights of the Red Branch include cannot harm or beat you. Your magical essence is much greater however, matching the magical energy stores of someone who became a Runelord with that preceding perk. What makes you unique is your Authorities however, three domains over which Gaia has given you a fair degree of control over. By utilising these
Authorities, you are able to command and control expressions and instances of the things within
that Domain, at a scale of a mountain range or significant section of Ireland. A Domain of War would
enable you to incite battles and warlust, exert influence over how battles and wars play out such
that it would take mythic heroes to turn the tide against your wishes or summon forth soldiers and
weapons to do war with. Your domains are not without limit and the broader the domain, the less
control you will be able to exert. While you are not subject to being changed by the worship of
mortals by default, you will find that your divine spirit nature may have strange reactions with the
world around you. You are now a being of magical/spiritual energy and divine belief, after all. "
673,,600,Two Thirds Divine,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Source,"Unique blood runs in your veins, as you are the child of a God and a Demigod. Two-thirds divine and
such an occurrence was no accident. Like the King of Uruk, you were a project by the Gods, designed
to be as close to perfect for a mortal being in body and spirit as they could achieve. That body of
yours is extraordinarily powerful, though it is not quite the level of certain kinds of beasts that may
be encountered here, it can still result in the destruction of cities and mountains should you grow
careless in your brawls. While your body may lack slightly in raw power, your magic more than
makes up for this. You were not yet given any knowledge of magic but the ocean of energy that
floods from your being at all times means even the smallest shreds of magical knowledge can be
turned to terrifying effect. Even the ancient dragons that can be found in these early times would
find their energy stores can only barely match your own and your magical energy will grow in
quantity even more over time.

Your position as a two-thirds divine being has also seen you take on a role as a mediator of sorts
between the divine and the mortal. For Gods, this appears as a unexplainable fondness and desire to
work with you instead of acting against you. For Mortals, it is an unnaturally powerful charisma that
swirls around you, affecting humans almost as if you were casting spells on their minds. Should you
spend any time around other people, this is likely to see you almost trip into becoming a ruler of
men and a prophet of the gods."

Emperors once shared between them. You have the ability to use this Privilege to temporarily grant
yourself new powers, skills or traits. The traits cannot be greater in strength or scale than your own
general level of power and must be at least somewhat justified. Having many scars from survived
wounds might justify a regeneration ability, a history of studying magic might allow yourself to gain
actual magic casting abilities even if you had only a scholarly knowledge of it before, while a year’s
lessons on horse riding might translate to magical levels of horsemanship. You have two slots to use
for these temporary abilities at a time and each one can be filled for several hours, before the
specific ability you used the slot on cannot be used again for a day. It is also possible through
significant mental disturbances, to forcibly shake your hold on the powers. They are otherwise
instant for you to change, taking only a mental thought."
675,,600,Eldritch Vessel,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Source ,"You weren’t meant for this world. You weren’t even made in it. An Eldritch Vessel, a being intended
to take on the power of the gods from outside of this reality, is what you were made to be and only
recently did you begin to awaken to your true nature. Physically and magically, you are quite
enhanced. You’d hardly be shaking mountains but mundane man-made weapons of these times cease to pose a threat to you and your magical power could at least turn most towns into smoking
craters, though you have little knowledge to use that with. Your powers are primarily linked to the eldritch being that created you. Being created by the Key and
the Gate would lead to powers over space and time, such that you could warp them across an entire
town, travel great distance instantly or rot foes to dust in minutes, along with many more
applications. An association with Shub Niggurath may allow for the creation of house sized monsters
in their dozens in just seconds, spreading viruses for miles around you or warping the flesh of any
you see, again, with more potential to be seen. The powers, while strong, are hardly earth shaking at
the start. With time and practice, you could awaken more and more of your potential power, until
you could easily pose a rather Beastly threat to this entire world. Perhaps you may one day grow
even further and become something like your creator. You may also summon the servants
associated with your parent to serve you, as well as the more generalised monsters of the
Lovecraftian mythos, though doing this requires magical energy to create them. However, you can draw on more power without waiting year and years for it to ‘naturally’ grow. By
loosening your hold on both your own sanity and form as well as drawing yourself closer to what
your parent is like, you can draw on more and more power. Truly giving yourself over could even let
you come close to the above potential but doing so would require other people to bring you back
over to sanity if you wished to recover. While you are very favoured by the parent God that created you, and it’s servants, being an eldritch
being is not all positives. Abilities that work well against such things will do grievous harm to you
while using these powers, your powers are often very dangerous for any of your allies to even see,
let alone be near the use of, and you may find yourself pulled into schemes associated with your
parent, from cults summoning you by accident or intention to your patron wishing you to summon
them into reality."

can unlock any lock and open any gate regardless of place or physicality, the Crimson Staff of
Cthugha can create blood-red firestorms that scorch armies of men, entire lakes or even other fires
till nothing remains and so on. Whatever the artefact is, it will be a highly powerful weapon for these
times, and also have the ability to awaken any latent eldritch powers when touched to a being, such
as distant heritage to a Lovecraftian beast in their familial past. If they already had such powers, combining the artefact with their bodies could not only massively enhance those otherworldly
abilities and make them far easier to control but also grant them new ones similar to what the
artefact itself possessed or enhance further still the ones they already have if the being already had
similar powers. The Silver Key with a heir of Sut Typhon could result in a being that can travel to any
place, any time, any dimension with ease and little time spent. "

Morgan’s level, you can certainly claim to equal her as a Witch, having immense skill in curses, charms, potion making and all sorts of nasty rituals and monster based magics, enough to threaten
an entire country with the right preparation and resources. As well, the curse that lies deep within
Britain, a black energy of hate and fury, now infects you as well as it does Morgan, the evil sister of
King Arthur. This black energy has suffused you totally, imbuing your supernatural abilities and
magical energy with many times their normal intensity and weight, despite not increasing the
amount itself. Thus the energy is several times more powerful and just as much more efficient. Just
contact with this energy can harm others as well, as it corrupts, warps and destroys that which it

You find that when your body suffers and parts are lost to you, your magic will soon compensate, providing not only additional talent in a related field of magecraft to whatever part of you has been crippled but a sudden breakthrough to effectively replace it. The loss of your sight may result in developing a sudden breakthrough in clairvoyant spells or magecraft that allows for ESP that not only replaces your lost sight but may outright surpass it. A mangled arm may provide the inspiration to greatly increase your level of skill with telekinetic magecraft or some other kinetic field, allowing you to manipulate things from afar with natural ease and immense force, seemingly costing little energy to do so. It takes time, weeks or even months, for these talents to bloom but once they do, they will remain even if you regain what you originally lost. "

When it comes to magic, you’re the same way - even if you’re cursed with a total lack of talent in magic or even a tiny handful of magical circuits, you know how to get the best result out of it sheerly through efficiency that defies all expectations. To put it more simply, a single ‘drop’ of prana can generate a result that would normally require one-hundred, greatly enhancing simple spells and letting you easily pay for more expensive ones without draining your body completely. This doesn’t change what a human body can safely output, but when you have reserves to spare and destructive power to give weight to even the simplest spells and curses, what can stop you? You’re a living artillery platform, loaded and ready to fire."
681,,600,The Rituals ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Source,"You’ve done it. After all this time and research, it’s been made clear. The secrets of the universe have revealed a set of amazing powers to you. The first ritual is but a taste of the power, the ritual to create a Doll. Dolls are reanimated replicas of people, dead or alive. They constantly burn up small amounts of mana to sustain themselves, but are otherwise completely believable and in many respects “people.” The ritual to feed them mana is also included, and the materials to create a Doll are not difficult to find all things considered. (Insert your own comments about human transmutation.) However, that’s not where the interest lies. The REAL interest lies in the Ritual of the Sabbath. You may through a half hour of preparation make a pretty wide area, about a city block, the location of a Sabbath. When a time of simultaneous day and night(Eclipses, Sundowns, Sunsets) happens, the Sabbath will occur and one of two effects of your choice will take place. You may either initiate a “White Sabbath” and have the Sabbath infuse and create Gates, or begin a “Dark Sabbath” have everyone in the Sabbath face their Phantom. By creating Gates, you’ve essentially introduced magic potential into a wide amount of people at once...even in worlds where magic doesn’t exist. They won’t be able to use it at first, but any system or method of magic becomes available to them and perhaps they’ll even develop their own if left alone. However, creating Phantoms through the Sabbath is a much more immediately rewarding from a research point of view. They are able to directly tap into the power of Magic in ways Gates alone cannot, and as magically potent beasts with unique powers and capabilities...There’s a lot of benefits to having a large number of Phantoms around for those who seek opportunity. Spare parts, a magically delicious snack, test subjects, new abilities to absorb or pure muscle...They can be a lot of things, if you’re willing to have others pay the price. Unfortunately, the Dark Sabbath has two drawbacks. The first is that the Phantoms are not loyal to you as a matter of course, and may see you as just something in their way or to be used. Secondly, not everyone in a Dark Sabbath will die and become a Phantom. Though the capability is rare, those with the strength of will to survive and become Hope can tame their Phantom and become a Wizard. While this may be a benefit if you can get their loyalty, they will often also be the type to oppose you for initiating a Dark Sabbath.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.)

There is a “Missing Piece” to these Rituals that could complete their usefulness…

Well, of course you’ve found it.

When initiating a Sabbath, an additional component or two will allow you to create a Sabbath Seal on the Phantoms or Gates created in the meanwhile. Sealed Gates will already have a stronger idea of how to use their magic immediately, while Sealed Phantoms will become loyal to you (though they can break free if they are stronger than you, and Wizards will always be able to break the Seal.)

You understand the flow of the energy, and what gives a star seed the ability to project a physical body to protect itself from the corruption of the outside world. You can now rip out the star seed of someone, and use it for your own gain. When you blast someone with a special ray, A flower will bloom from the person’s forehead. Their star seed will float out for you to collect.

Khandaqi Gods like Teth Adom, an eclectic group of memetic heroes from Greece, Judea, and
Rome like Billy Batson, the Source and the Silver City, the Sabbac, the Olympians or their
Progenitors, or some other existing pantheon, you have been blessed with immense durability,
arcane strength and durability, perceptions in line with your patron(s), alongside several
thematic powers. A champion of Shazam gains the ability to call arcane lightning. Those blessed
by the Silver City gain healing and cleansing power. Those blessed by Hell gain infernal fire. If
you pick a different pantheon or divine power to grant your strength, pick an appropriate
power to gain. For example, a blessed of Helios may gain the ability to spew solar plasma from
their eyes. Your patron(s) will not (and cannot) revoke your power against your will.
Please note that regardless of what divinity empowers you, the metaphysical power
granted by this purchase remains constant. You do not get stronger or more resistant to magic
by picking Odin as opposed to Bacchus, only the thematic aspects of your power change based
on your patron.

Additionally, note that while it is possible to gain power from universal and non-
purposive entities such as the Source, Presence, or even Anti-Life, such power must come from
an intermediary that is purposive in a manner that is understandable by humans. For example,

685,,600,Down The Rabbit Hole ,DC Occult,Source,"You have the peculiar ability to borrow power from others. By touching someone – or something – else, you may temporarily steal any and all magical abilities they have. There is theoretically no true limit on the number of powers you can hold, but the more you steal, the less time you will be able to hold it. For instance, power stolen from the Spectre would flee your grasp in mere moments, where power stolen from a normal magician could be used for hours on end.

You also gain all of their knowledge relating to the use of the stolen powers. Be aware that this may also result in other odd reactions; stealing the power from a rhyming demon would compel you to speak in rhymes, for instance. Stealing power that is sufficiently alien to you may result also in catatonia or damage to your sanity.

And one final thing: your clothes transform into a hybrid of yours and those of the beings you steal power from while you retain the power. Not that big of a deal, but stealing from a ton of different people may result in some horribly unfashionable outfits.

You cannot use the power you steal to permanently increase your own power in any way.

You can weave this power into vast spells capable of amazing things greater than the sum of its parts, and you can handle far more of this power than would otherwise be possible. But even then, it puts a great strain on your body and mind, and even you have limits - limits that it will push you past if you're not careful.

Your skill with this can grow in time, allowing you to reach over truly vast distances to draw power. Should the need be great enough and you have some method of reaching out to them, you could spread your net over the whole of the world, asking thousands of magical beings and sorcerers to lend you their power. Of course, you’ll need to actually convince them to do so, but if the entire magical world was putting up a united front, you could be a valuable player in such a game.

This also allows you to power magic with other forms of supernatural energy. After all, when you really get down to it, there’s not that much of a difference in the power inherent in a soul or the chi that rests within the body from the energy you use to cast your spells, is there?

It does not, however, possess the more esoteric abilities of the true Starheart.

Though it is powerful, a simple shard will not have the power of the entire Starheart. On the upside, you'll never have to recharge it, and it is not weak against wood like the complete Starheart is.

689,,600,Ruby of Life ,DC Occult,Source,"​The Ruby of Life is an ancient artifact created over seven thousand years ago. The ruby is a small crimson gem with the shape and size of a small egg. Wielding the gem gives several mystical abilities. Namely, the creation of illusions, blasts of magical energy, and the control of inanimate objects.

The Ruby can also be used simply as a magical battery of sorts, amplifying the power of a magician or allowing those with no magic of their own to cast spells, though this requires practice or training as opposed to the innate abilities the gem grants. With training in its use, someone with no potential of their own could be a powerful spellcaster on par with the likes of Zatanna.

690,,600,Magical Blood ,Justice League Dark,Source,"You’re no two-bit magician plying parlor tricks and making pacts with bottom-feeding spirits. In your veins flow the blood of old – the blood that flowed in Atlantis before it sank beneath the waves. Drawing magic is as easy for you as drawing breath, casting spells is no harder than flexing your hand.

Not only is your talent impressive, but you also have advanced training in some type of magic. There are any number of magical disciplines and traditions you could have been trained under, from backwards magic, to traditional eastern magic, to some hodgepodge style all your own. Whatever the case, you start off comparable to Zatanna in strength and skill, and have roughly the same potential she has. Given effort and training, you will grow to be one of the most powerful mortal mages alive.

Or... you could take shortcuts, make deals and pacts. Take on the boons of outside forces to enhance your innate power. Though this, as I'm sure you can ascertain, would be costly and fraught with great risks.

But remember, your power may be grand, but that means the cost of your power is, too, all the more grand.

691,,600,Pandora’s Box ,Justice League Dark,Source,"The real Pandora’s Box was long believed to be a chest which held within it all the evils of the world and was opened by the eponymous Pandora -- because goddammit, you don’t just give someone a box and expect them to not be curious, right? In reality, the box was a portal to an alternate universe, where everything was twisted and villains ruled the earth. In any case, this is not that box.

It’s not a box at all, point of fact. This is simply a replica of the real thing, which takes the shape of a human skull – with the addition of a third eye socket in the center of the forehead and the fact that the top of the skull is removeable. Instead of leading to an alternate earth, this particular skull simply acts as a doorway to a dimension of endless pure magic. Any attempts at travelling through to this dimension will inevitable fail, but when opened, the magic will flow unceasingly from the skull – at least until it’s closed again.

You can use this magical energy for whatever, from powering artifacts or rituals to simply
recharging or amplifying your own power. Just so you realize, just because the amount of magic in the other dimension is infinite, the amount that can flow through at once is very much not so. After all, just because you hook a fire hydrant to the ocean doesn’t mean you can instantly flood a city, does it?

You can substitute any required ritual for some of your inner energy, making a spell that would require hours of work happen instantly at the cost of making you extremely tired. If you happen to have mana or other magical energies like that within you, you can substitute those instead. Burning through all your energy in a short span of time can be dangerous and possibly fatal if you push it too far, but experienced magic users are unlikely to do so accidentally."
693,,600,Order/Chaos Magic ,Young Justice,Source,"The forces of Order and Chaos have always been at war with each other, and you’ve just picked a side. You can only choose one type of magic by purchasing this, and you can’t make this purchase multiple times. Order magic has a focus on protection and restoring the natural balance of the world, and is capable of negating and reflecting destructive magic and energy as well as repairing objects and healing others. Order magic is also capable of undoing the damage that Chaos magic and other corruptions have done, and can ward against it with near perfect ability if used preemptively. Chaos magic on the other hand is about corrupting and perverting nature and the elements to suit the user’s will, and can be used to cause plants and animals to grow in size and hostility, as well as to create powerful magical constructs to harass and attack your enemies. Chaos Magic is also capable of transmuting objects, though not into or from materials with supernatural qualities. Both types of magic allow their users to create force fields, shoot magical bolts, as well as fly. Users of Order Magic may be stronger than Dr. Fate or on par with him depending on his host, but users of Chaos Magic are much weaker than Klarion."

These are intense and powerful emotions, things that would usually make one spiral into despair, and spell doom for a Magical Girl. But you, you’re something else. You’re a Devil, the very antithesis of how magic in this world works. You may greatly enhance any magic you use, from this world or otherwise, by channeling your most intense emotions into it...though this has a bias towards things like ‘murderous insanity’ or ‘obsessive love’, being most powerful when those are in use. This even has the luxury of making your Soul Gem completely separate from your emotional state - even if it is on the verge of shattering from energy loss, you’ll still be your old self. The same goes for any force that dares to try and change your emotions against your will, finding your mind and heart will be as still as a stone.

Your magical potential is much greater than the average Magical Girl, whether from winning the superpower lottery or some twist of fate. All magical abilities you have from this world or otherwise greatly increase in potency, and you will find both your Soul Gem and internal energies in your body will have much more energy available to burn for said magic. This is enough that you could potentially fight a swarm of the strongest Wraiths and live to tell the tale, and you will quickly become both admired and feared for this might. Imagine if all that potential went to waste, huh? Good thing you made a contract.

And such a thing could perhaps change the world. Holding onto this pink shard increases your own magical power greatly and gradually replenishes lost energy. ‘Burning’ this shard will let you dramatically increase your magical power tenfold, though the boost is temporary and will be lost afterwards until your next jump. Notably, any magic given towards aiding or healing others without any expectation of a reward, karmic or otherwise, are most powerful when used with this Shard.

Your entire body races with power, granting you increased strength and speed but the real advantage of this trait is what those allies around you will gain. As a conduit, you will not benefit yourself, but you will greatly empower the magics of all friendly magic users within a good distance around your own body. The open connection to the spirit realm bolsters their energy, reduces the strain they must meet to cast and allows them to do so with much greater power than normal. This conduit hood seems to affect even magics from other worlds or things that are not strictly magical in nature, yet still operate on similar principles."

You also have access to a technique that involves temporarily converting part of your nervous system into an artificial magical circuit, a very dangerous procedure with a very high chance of death. If you were to use this technique to its fullest, converting your blood, muscles, nerves and everything you have into a magical circuit then for a brief instant you would be able to overpower even Ea, the sword that divided the heavens from the earth. Of course such power doesn’t come without a cost, utilising it to its fullest will damage your body to the point that without some means of healing the damage it causes to your body utilising it more than once per jump would prove fatal."

What this means is that given sufficient magical energy you can skip the thaumaturgical processes and steps that a magus would usually need for Magecraft and recreate miracles through the use of magical energy, allowing you to achieve magical feats through sheer power rather than skill. What this means is that you are capable of performing spells without knowing how to cast them at a cost exponentially greater than the amount someone who knew how to perform the spell would pay. Given that you are an existence born to bring dreams into reality you are also able to bring hope to those bereft of it by showing them the hope that they had lost long ago."

The Empire will learn to wail at the signs of your passing, the Wood Elves will know to scream in horror at the abominations you bring to their door, and the Dawi will shrivel their beards as they cower in their tunnels and hovels, for your presence is a portent of disaster for any foes. It matters not the event that occurs - where you walk, where you act, where you cast, will be a site of terrible doom against those you hate. Beastmen will venerate you, and Mankind will hate you."

For some, getting angry may see only a small boost in power. For others, it may be quite massive indeed. And for some, the difference becomes incomparable. You are able to channel any of your emotions into raw power, greatly enhancing your ki or similar supernatural energies with even weaker emotions. Drawing on every day anger may multiply your ki two or three times over, whilst seeing a loved one harmed could invite thousands or tens of thousands of times as much power as you normally have access to, depending on how deeply you fall into that rage. The abilities linked to the energy you supercharge with your emotions, such as combat techniques or special powers, will also grow in scale with the energy. If you can learn to control yourself even while feeling immense rage or hatred, you could even maintain these boosts for long periods of time, as otherwise they’ll be very tiring to keep going.

This also affects any spell you cast. The spell might fail, or be delayed, or hit a different target, or even invert its effect. That’s not even getting into crazier possible effects such as making people and/or their body parts change size, summoning elemental spirits, causing snow or rain, or making shoes turn into wooden clogs.

If you are not a Card to begin with, then you get the Major Arcana Tarot Card as an extra form. Either way, the actual power associated with the card remains with you across forms.

Magician- This Tarot Card could be Queen Victoria’s greatest boon or enemy in her goal to conquer the real world, for this card overcomes Wonderland’s usual weakness to disbelief in the outside world. The power of the Magician lets you fully access and utilize belief-based magics and powers without rationality, disbelief, and the like interfering with the magic.

This is a most holy artefact of the Great Maw, one granted only to those favoured as its prophets. The cauldron empowers the cook in charge of its magic. The more meat and peoples butchered and thrown into it, the greater the power it stores becomes. Gut Magic receive by far the greatest benefit, becoming capable of terrifying spells hundreds of times beyond what an ordinary Butcher can manage with a fully filled pot but even unrelated magics can be empowered many times over with sufficient sacrifices to the cauldron. When that power is used up, the corresponding amount of meat will disappear from the pot, sent to the Great Maw as a sacrifice.

Some Great Fairies will refuse to so much as speak to mortals without the proper bribe, and I can’t quite imagine them spending it on a night out on the town. For you though, this applies to anything that is offered to you, be it Rupees other Fae desire or a more traditional offering of a newborn goat or something equally silly. These offerings create an extra store of energy within you, one you can spend on anything you like. It even comes prefilled with enough energy to turn a farm boy halfway into a hero from sheer ‘blessings’ alone, as befitting your new status as a Great Fairy. Speaking of blessings, you’ve also learned how to spend this energy on people, places, even certain pieces of equipment to upgrade them.

By harnessing the life energy and light of the the land around you, you can gain greater physical and magical might, allowing you to perform destructive magical attacks and float upon your own power - this draining process turning the land into darkened wasteland fit only for the dead and the dying. Though if you wish to spare the land this destruction, you could take this suffering upon yourself - forcing yourself to suffer the inner pain and darkness of the people in order to claim this strength. This is more merciful and seen as noble - but if you lose your composure in the face of this agony yo could cause even more damage in your panicked throes.

You could easily replicate Ganondorf’s prime strength in combat by taking this to its limit and as part of this set of abilities, you can tap into this strength without restraint for the final burst of power -transforming into a monstrous titan capable of sending even Hyrule Castle crashing down.

Or maybe you simply siphoned off a small part? Either way, the Flame of Sorrow can best be described as ‘things get worse’. Young people make poor decisions, married couples break up, lifelong friends try to kill each other, the arrogant become caricatures of their former selves. Not all at once, mind you, but little by little it builds up. And as it does so, it converts that sorrow into magical energy for you to use.

With the blessing of the Season Spirits - something you are assumed to have by default - and a small application of the Golden Goddesses beloved time travel, you can force the seasons to change in an instant. Smaller usages of power are possible, but the staff specializes in wide area effects. A simple fireball is far harder to pull off than a raging fire storm powered by the spirit of summer. However, given that the Rod of Seasons need a contract or blessing to have any power, I have adapted it slightly to become capable of channeling more than just those four spirits powers.

There’s probably something to be said about light casting a shadow, or how shadows are created by the presence of light. Ignoring such tripe sayings, as a being of the darkness you’ve found a way to make yourself stronger via the light. Most demons would crack and break, turn to dust and dwindle away, but not you. Of course, you will need something between you and the light, because as a demon it’s still the bane of your existence. If you weren’t one it would be fine, but alas. Perhaps if you were to possess a body of someone talented in the manipulation of Light magic and its derivatives? Yes, if you were to manage that, your own dark powers would surely rise. In fact, any stolen power now shares this effect, your stolen ‘light’ only serving to amplify your ‘dark’ powers. Or fire and water, or wind and earth, those rival elements and their ilk.

You can also use this to take that power away from other users, or usurp their control. After all, you rule Power, so it's not like it could disobey you.

While you would lose the ability to update your Falna until you leave the jump, it would be better than losing everything and needing you to join another Familia to access your powers granted by your Falna again.

You’d have to forgive us for thinking so, when you draw power in a very similar way to how the Gods do. You draw power from being worshipped, naturally and on an active level if need be. Just having worshippers will naturally add a little pool of magical energy that you can draw upon but in emergencies, you are able to ask for them to offer up more to you from their personal stores. More worshippers will increase your base pool of energy but the level of faith and fanaticism that each worshipper has will also increase the amount they give. A large number of casual adherents to your faith may still give a sizable pool of energy to draw on but it’d be nothing compared to a similar sized number of believers that are genuinely faithful and reverent of you."

Suffering improves your power and speed and durability, both physically and with your magic or powers. The greater you suffer, be it physical or emotional pain, the greater the benefits you will receive from this. The best gains can be made when it comes from other people or enemies rather than yourself, though hurting yourself will still see you receive a lesser benefit from this ability. Putting you down will be a very tough task as only the strangest of attacks will not cause you to grow in power, such as those that cause no pain and cannot be noticed to be embarrassed over.

combinations of your six spirits working together. The first requires only one spirit, Koten Zanshun. The one spirit becomes a shining golden blade who
rejects all it touches, perfectly cutting in two any target regardless of power. It rejects both sides of
the shield, splitting things in two. It’s power waxes and waves with your confidence and aggression
in battle, meaning that someone with a weak stomach for a fight may be unable to access it’s
limitless blade in full. The second requires two spirits, Soten Kisshun. A oval shield which rejects the inner side of the
shield. With this it can reject, reverse and reconstruct phenomena that occurred within the shield’s
limit. Damage can be restored, lost limbs healed or sicknesses undone, even death itself reversed
until the subject breathes life once more. It goes beyond reversing time or space, quickly becoming
an absolute and terrifying ability. While inexperienced, this power can often encounter limits in the
face of powerful effects or reiatsu, and take time to do it’s work. The third initial power requires three spirits, Santen Kesshun, the shield that repels the outer side. A
triangular barrier that rejects what touches it, it becomes a theoretically absolute barrier that no
attack can cross. Even negative effects should be rapidly negated in face of the barrier.

As your experience with these powers grow, it will be possible to unlock further uses. Shaping and
adapting your existing formations as well as creating entirely new ones, such as making use of more
than three spirits at a time. Already your powers are immense, who knows what all six spirits at once
may be capable of? When not in use, your spirits are able to store themselves in separate or
combined small physical objects that always remain near you. If hurt or destroyed, they will return
slowly as your spiritual energy replenishes them. Your powers as a whole are dependent on your
conviction and belief in yourself. A wavering confidence will do more than just weaken your Koten
Zanshun, your shield and rejection powers will also grow weaker. But if you can maintain that
confidence, there’s no denying your potential to be one of the mightiest beings in these worlds."
732,,800,Absorption,Marvel Zombies,Source ,"At first glance, it might seem like you’re a regular member of your species without any special abilities or powers. That’ll be disproven the moment you make physical contact with someone else, what makes them them is yours. Memories, expertise, psyche, powers, the whole shebang is now yours, temporarily. You hold the powers of whoever you touch for a duration of sixty times how long you were in contact. This will weaken them, potentially to lethal levels - you could render somebody comatose, or worse, if you used your power too much. In these prolonged cases, the power will rise above the sixtyfold limit, potentially making what you took yours, permanently, at the cost of permanently putting the original owner out of commission. Unlike Rogue, you can activate and deactivate this effect at will. There is no limit to the amount of powers you can drain, though too much will lead to repercussions. 

For all the benefits this brings, it’s a double-edged sword. Absorbing someone’s psyche and memories has its consequences, namely that each time, you’re sharing your mind with a whole load of new experiences. The minds of stronger people could potentially overwhelm yours, potentially making you a prisoner in your own body. Beings that dwarf you in power are resistant or immune to contact."

Whether a God, Titan or Giant by this option, you may choose up to five different concepts to base yourself around which will make up your domains for this setting, along with the theme your powers will take on. In addition you’ll find yourself with additional powers depending on which subchoice you make here, such Gods having their True Form which atomizes mere mortals upon eye contact, the Titans with their supernatural manipulation of their domains to the point of causing major disasters with ease, and Giants being unkillable unless laid low by both mortal and God. While this option can be taken alongside other parentages, at least two of your domains must me in the same ‘thematic’ as your ancestor to reflect the closeness in bloodline. A God who is the child of Zeus might end up as the God of rain, for example. Godly Restraint (if you are a Demigod) or Wrath of Olympus (if Titan/Giantborn) must be taken for this option, with no points extra to reflect your unique origin."
734,,800,Everyone’s Hero: The Ultimate Good        ,Avesta of Black and White,Source ,"What a grand figure you have become. Or will become, in due time. You are one gifted the fate of becoming the most brilliant light against the forces of darkness, for you have found yourself in the role of the greatest of the Ashavan as ‘everyone’s hero’. Yours is a destiny of greatness, one that collects all the hopes, dreams and prayers for a brighter future around you, and uses them to shape the path to the most magnificent epilogue. The more heroic acts you perform, the greater feats in battle you partake, the more this image of you as the greatest hero that ever was extends like wildfire, covering nations, even entire planets in mere weeks, growing faster and faster in what seems to be an endless momentum. And the more people join this collective ‘prayer’, the greater your power becomes, making you a living ‘miracle’. The unreachable Arch-Demons become just difficult threats, and even the dream of an ending to the eternal conflict of black and white seems like an actual possibility.

But this is far from your most potent ability. As the hero, it wouldn’t do if your victories were to go unrewarded. And what better place to start amassing your power than from your defeated foes? Each time you claim ‘victory’ over another, you take something special from them, and incorporate it into yourself. Be warned that this ability doesn’t make distinctions between foe and ally, as anyone that is ‘defeated’ by you gets something taken from them. It may be a special item, a power, a commandment or even things such as emotions, loyalties or a cosmic ‘role’.

Furthermore, it doesn’t even require that you defeat someone in a physical confrontation. As long as you prove your irrefutable victory over them, you will still take something from them. The more shaking and absolute your defeat is over your enemy, the more from their own core you can take. With time, even having the thought of admitting defeat before you will be enough for you to strip them of everything that makes them.

Now, once you have claimed your victory, these stolen abilities don’t stay as they were, and instead they are changed to suit your nature. You have little to no control over the result, but you can be sure that whatever you gain won’t be saddled with any weaknesses that it previously had, and at times you may find them even increasing in potency. As it is your right as the victor, you only take the good portions and leave the rest to your defeated foe. Using this privilege, you could take Commandments from others, without needing to abide by their vows, nor suffering any consequences of breaking the original restriction."
735,,800,Shinigami Skull,Kurohime,Source ,"This is the skull of the Shinigami, the God of Death, also known as Darkray. After his death, his power was congealed within this skull, which would have the ability to elevate someone else to the position of God of Death. Now, normally this would need to be another dead soul, but your skull is special, and can turn anyone into a God of Death. Just remember—you only receive one Shinigami Skull. Ever.

As the God of Death, you gain a massive increase to your physical and magical power, and have the ability to summon the acidic “waters” of the Sanzu no Kawa, the river that denotes the boundary of the underworld. You can summon the spirits from hell, forge souls into weapons, shields, or bullets, and can manipulate, summon, or destroy souls freely. Additionally, your arms and legs disconnect at the elbows and knees, with the ends of your limbs floating around your torso, which floats as though still supported by your legs; you can also create more limbs if you need them, and can manipulate your skeletal system to create spikes of bones. You may additionally summon bones, creating spikes from the ground or forming a barricade composed of skeletons.

This appearance can become an alt-form, if you so desire."
736,,800,Blood Of Gods,Honkai Impact 3rd,Source ,"Fifty thousand years ago, those who would push back against the advent of Honkai were known as Fire MOTH (Myrmidons of Taskforce Honkai). With the technology they fielded, and the augmentative process known as ICHOR, they could fight the corruptive force on a much larger scale with soldiers that the present day can only dream of, but despite that, it still wasn’t enough as the Herrschers adapted and attacked their weaknesses. One by one they fell, until only 13 remained. They were called the Flame Chasers, and those 13 eventually sealed themselves away for the next era... And some did things the others felt unforgivable. Thus, only two survived to the present day: Kevin Kaslana, progenitor of the House of Kaslana, and Fu Hua, currently a class representative at St. Freya’s after a long and painful life trying to live up to the objectives laid down to her by MEI and failing. Even then, with the betrayals and manipulations Fu Hua suffered, and the sheer length of time Kevin was sealed in the Sea of Quanta, neither of them really are at their best in the current era. Well, maybe you can make that count three. Either you’re actually another Flame Chaser who hid themselves away until now, or an extremely rare successful attempt at recreating the process, because you can truly claim to embody what a Flame Chaser is in all its entirety. To put it simply, an ELF based on Kevin with only 1% of his power was able to completely stalemate Durandal, Schicksal’s strongest Valkyrie at the time, while destroying a huge chunk of the city of London in the process, the battle only ending because his battery ran out. While that is, again, based on Kevin, who is inarguably the greatest warrior the Previous Era ever knew, it is a testament to how much power Fire MOTH held at its disposal. You’re nowhere near his height, sure, but you’ve got more than Fu Hua has at this point in time."

743,,800,Divine Origin,Fate/Extra CCC,Source ,"The cause of your birth, and what you will return to in the end. That is the Origin of being. You are not merely what you seem to be, for you have great potential in you, potential able to contest even against the absolute. Should you perform the right ritual, involving letting someone dive into the deepest recesses of your own soul, and defeating the incredibly powerful guardian within, you will unlock a power beyond even the most powerful Servants. You would be able to contest against the Moon Cell itself on equal terms with such power, and any abilities that reject events, such as the Domina Coronam, will be unable to deny you. Additionally, you have a greater self, of sorts, a being even more powerful than even your unlocked potential, on the scale of the Goddess of the Sun, Amaterasu herself. There are caveats to both of these paths to your potential.

First, unlocking your Origin is a power greater than yourself. Without some way to upgrade your form, your soul, your mind, using the power of your Origin will strain you greatly, and you’ll only be able to use it once a fight in every jump lest it destroys you. Surely not a great downside, unless you are ambitious. Second, your Origin provides raw power, not scale or versatility. It’ll let you fight against the Moon Cell’s power concentrated into a single form, but the Moon Cell’s capacity to witness and record the past, present, and future, and to maintain an entire digital reality, are things your Origin has nothing to do with. Third, growing into your greater self will render the power of your Origin redundant, yet will require more than a simple ritual to obtain. An unbroken thousand years of daily effort will be required to reach the daunting scale of the Sun itself. Fourth, even after reaching the scale of a true Star, you might find some of your limbs obtaining minds of their own, based on fragments of your own personality, who will possess a measure of your own power. They are not guaranteed to be loyal or even able to get along with you, or each other, but they are based on you, so surely you wouldn’t be the kind of person to be intolerant of other instances of yourself? You could eject them from your being, but that would diminish you, and they might come back, angry at the betrayal. Perhaps it’d be best to learn how to get along."
744,,800,Fleshly God,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Source,"A mere worshipper? How blasphemous, implying a true God of this world would ever bow their head
to another in supplication. Certainly not you, as you are an existence that may not have been seen
in this world for a very, very long time. An enfleshed God, a true and original form of what are mere
Divine Spirits in the later days of this world. A being of incalculable power and, perhaps, a similar
level of arrogance.

The base of your power is terrible indeed. While you may not possess the sheer versatility of some
of the other great beings to be found, you are nigh-unmatched in raw power, be it physical or
magical. The destruction of an entire continent would not require every bit of your power, just a
great deal of it, and it appears that the wells of energy you draw upon for magical uses are similarly
vast in scope, replenishing far quicker than most mortals would see due to your divine nature. Befitting your power, you need not remain in a human form. From a enormous, demonic dragon to a
mechanical alien, the Gods can take many different shapes and sizes, as you too now can. You may
design with very few restrictions your new physical form as a God. 

But brute power is far from that which makes you a god. That would be your place in the world. As a
true divine entity, you are the very highest class of natural spirit of the World. The World may not
love you but it certainly treats you as one of it’s most important agents, something that appears to
carry over to future worlds to some extent if you continue to act in your role. Alongside this place as
part of the World are your Authorities. The areas in which you have the right to govern and
command the World, what some may call the Domains of the Gods. You have three in total, for too many Authorities can cause divine beings like yourself to undergo unpleasant transformations of the
mind and soul. An Authority of Fire would grant near total control over fire and things linked to it, such as summoning blazes that envelop entire nations for years without burning out, igniting fury in
the hearts of men or enhancing the results of any forging efforts, along with likely countless other
potential uses. An Authority of Magic would allow for the manipulation of enormous amounts of
external magical energy, even within others, so that the God could easily defeat all but the greatest
mortal magicians, though the Authority may not be capable of much more than that due to it’s
breadth. The more broadly applicable that Domain is for any one God, the less depth of power it will
be capable of doing. Domains after all, are not dependent on your personal power. You are merely
commanding the World to change and it thus becomes so.

You are somewhat unique amongst Gods, having a certain attribute more commonly associated with
the terrific creatures that were Gods even before humanity began to worship them. Like these
beings outside of the Human Order, you do not depend on the worship of humanity for power and
neither would you change if their beliefs about you do change. You may optionally rid yourself of
this protection, allowing you to gain power as humans devote more faith and belief towards you but
this will also open you up to changing based on their beliefs. You might change in physical
appearance to match what your devotees consider to be the divine appearance of their God or even
change in personality to fit what your cult believes is true about you. "

Destruction, Dream, Desire, Despair, and Delirium don't just represent or watch over their

imagination, and Death is the force without which nothing could ever pass on to the next world.
Long ago one of these beings conspired to create the ultimate expression of their concept, but
in doing so something backfired. For the Endless don't just embody their concept, but their
opposite as well. Dream can make dreams a reality, and Death is the one responsible for
breathing life into everything that lives. The result of their grand experiment was you, and as
such you carry their greatest failure with your every step. Your very appearance brings
freedom, or life, or sanity, and you alter the course of history wherever you go in doing so. For
example, if your existence was orchestrated by Despair, you could inspire a whole world simply
by being yourself, bringing people hope and changing their lives by saving them and showing
them that no, things really aren't so bad, and leaving your undeniable mark on the universe for
millennia after you'd gone. Be careful with what you set into motion. As Lord Dream found to his

For untold millennia, they have been locked in a metaphysical war, attempting to further the cause of Order or of Chaos. Primarily, this is accomplished by empowering mortal agents to act as proxies.

The most powerful and well-known example of this is Doctor Fate -- the manifestation of Nabu, the greatest and most powerful of the Lords of Order -- who channels his power through the Helm of Fate and those who wear it. But Nabu is far from the only Lord to empower his agents through artifacts and one such item has fallen into your possession.

You have some wearable object that contains the essence of a lesser Lord, whether of Chaos or Order. This item is bound to you, allowing you to summon it at-will, and when worn, grants you access to a large sum of magical power. This would be a formidable amount of power even in the hands of a mortal with none of their own, but it truly shines when worn by an already powerful being. The more powerful the person wearing the Vestments, the larger the increase in power will be.

As well, when worn, the ghost of the — now long-dead — Lord will whisper into your mind, teaching you powerful magic and prompting you to follow their agenda. The ghost will be completely unable to possess you unless you allow them to do so and the possession may be revoked by you at any time. You don't have to advance their cause, but they will be much more willing to teach you if you do so.

After this jump is over, you can silence the ghost or awaken it as you please.

With a second purchase (discounted if the first purchase wasn’t), you may gain the Vestments opposite of the ones first purchased, but both cannot be used together. Or, in place of having one for Order and one for Chaos, you may instead spend 1600 CP (prior to discounts) to purchase Vestments containing the power of a Lord of Balance, which will be half again as powerful as either of the others and allow you to wield both Chaos and Order magic at once.

has disappeared. And not every time you might go to in this world is so empty of wonders. A divine spirit is among the greatest of beings in this world, the gods and greatest monsters of legends. Those
that represent the mythologies and histories of each country and people. There are young such
spirits, those linked to the country of America, and older beings, such as the Mesoamerican
Pantheon, and not all are even from this world. But as a member among their ranks, you’re pretty
special now. Two options are before you now.

For 1200CP, you’ll be a match for the Sun God
Quetzalcoatl, at least in it’s current incarnation. More on that later. Right now, it’s all about you and
just how amazing you now are. It’s time to think more planetary. Your arms are the arms that can
smash the moon to pieces or shatter the planet into a bunch of big bits. If nothing stops you, the
planet probably isn’t going to accept you doing that and she’s a fair bit stronger than you still. But
you can still roast everything on the surface of the planet with your magical power, since that’s
about equal to your physical abilities. The Authorities you hold are still three in number but they’re a
lot bigger now. An Authority of Water previously may have let you drown a town or send a tidal
wave alongside a lot of the American coastline, one of them anyway. Now that same Authority
would let you freely command every drop of water on the planet while still allowing you incredible
control over associated concepts, such as exerting significant influence on civilisations by controlling
the flow of people and ideas across the world. But as great as these powers are, you may find it
difficult to exert them. Using your Authority on such a scale will invariably mean intruding on the
plans and dominions of countless lesser beings, divine spirits included, and even some of your peers
at times. You have power but you are not without peers nor is it impossible for those much weaker
than you to still pose significant threats. There is a final path available to you, should you take this
option, but it will be revealed to you in the Challenges section near the end of this script. Whichever path you choose, it’s worth talking about your heritage. Wherever you call your home as
a Divine Spirit, it turns out you’ve got a little bit of Mexico in you. The blood of the Mesoamerican
Pantheon flows in you and there’s something a little special about that. These Divine Spirits aren’t
from Earth originally. In fact, they crash landed via a meteor from space, arriving as or alongside all
sorts of space germs. No one’s really sure and it looks like the ones that know get all embarrassed about it when you ask. For the most part, it’s more of an interesting dinner topic but the one notable
effect it has on you is that you find it astonishingly easy to inhabit mortal vessels. So long as they’re
willing, you can slip into them with ease, though depending on quality and compatibility, you’ll only
have access to some smaller portion of your power. Even if they resist, you also find it fairly easy to
possess most living beings too, though a good fight can keep you out.

751,,900,The Flower ,Drakengard and Nier,Source,"You want this? Are you sure? Why don’t I explain first and let you know why this is a bad idea. 

This might look like a beautiful white and pink flower, but in reality it is an infection. Sent to this earth by the Grotesqueries, which are Angels created by God to annihilate the arrogant human race, the Flower is a beacon and serves as their way into our reality. When it finds a host, it will bond with them, granting them divine power and pushing them to eliminate humanity. Once the host has either given in or lost the will to resist, the flower will bloom into a giant monster, open a way in for the other Grotesqueries and proceed to destroy the world. 

You still want this huh? Man, you must really be starved for power. Whatever, your funeral. 

First off, if you weren’t an Intoner before, you are now. Go back up to the Origins section, everything under Intoners now applies for you, except for a few things. First off, you don’t have to change your gender to female if you’re not. Second, ignore the uncontrollable libido thing, you don’t have to deal with that. Finally, that part about being the weakest of the Intoners? Wrong, you’re the strongest. (You still have to get the perks if you want Intoner Mode or a Disciple though.)

Now that you’re the host of the Flower, you are the origin of a new batch of Intoners. This means that you’re as strong as Zero was at her most powerful. There is literally nothing a human or anything else that weak can do to harm you.Your strength, speed and Song are all boosted. Additionally, anything that actually is strong and fast enough to damage you will find their efforts for naught. Forget the healing factor and added endurance (though you still have those so, you know, don’t actually forget), the Flower straight up will not let you die. If your body is ever damaged enough that you simply can’t survive anymore, the Flower will semi-bloom until it’s the size of a man and simply spit out a bloody new body for you. Very gross, very lovecraftian. The only things that can permanently kill you now are Dragons or anything made of Dragon magic. 

However, the main benefit of this perk is that you now have the Flower’s ability to make new Intoners. If you choose, you can create five pseudo-clones of yourself, each an Intoner with all the power that entails. They’ll have their own personalities and hang ups just like the canon Intoners, except the unceasing lust from Zero will instead be replaced with whatever personality fault you chose to magnify when you became an Intoner. In addition, they’ll have a greater ability to resist the Flower’s influence, though not as much as you, and they won’t be suffering false memories. Maybe, if you make the effort, you can be the type of family that Zero’s Intoners only had delusions of being. 

You’ll need their power though, even if the whole family thing falls through. LIke I said, the Flower acts as a beacon, an advanced scout. The Grotesqueries can see you now. They’re watching you. And even if you can resist the influence of the Flower, they won’t give up. Not until they’ve exterminated humanity. They’re coming. They’ll find their way in, with or with your help. Not just here, but in every future Jump you make as well. Everywhere you go, divine vengeance and slaughter will follow. 

So take all that power you wanted, Jumper. I hope it was worth it. 

Oh, and I almost forgot. The Flower is now blossoming from one of your body parts. You can copy Zero and choose your eye or pick somewhere else. Whatever the case, you’ll sure stand out at parties.

hybrids of your existing powers for yourself to use or make weaker versions of your powers before
granting them to others. You can make as many copies of any power you can create as you desire, it
costs nothing and takes nothing more than a thought from you, though having multiples of the same
power will not allow you to use more than the effects of one at a time. When it comes to handing
powers out to others, you may do so instantly provided you can see all your desired targets
presently. This Abnormality also allows you to retake what you have given out even if you cannot
see the recipient at the time."

754,,1000,Skyfather,Marvel Magic,Source,"Like mortals, gods as well have kings. Foremost among their kind and often the progenitors of their pantheon as it exists today are the Skyfathers, gods of immense power, both personally and in terms of that they wield over their pantheon. Odin Allfather and Zeus Panhellenios are two of the most well known. Kings incomparable, gods to the gods. At their word, mortals become gods and gods become mortals. When they do battle, galaxies quake beneath their blows.

You are an infantile Skyfather in your own right, much weaker than these titans of power, but still beyond most others of your kind. In time, you shall father a new pantheon, a race of gods which you will hold divine authority over. Any children you have will themselves be gods and likely powerful ones at that. But your divine power is not limited to simply your own bloodline. Though at the current time it will be greatly exhausting for you to accomplish, you may once a day --or perhaps more if you are willing to face a greater toll -- infuse a mortal with a spark of your divine power, uplifting them to divinity. The life force and power of any gods of your new pantheon are yours to command, allowing you to strip it from them, rendering them mortal unless you return it, or to direct their souls as you choose upon their death.

In addition, your own divine life force is enhanced even further beyond what it was before. In addition to increased magical potency, it is much more easy for you to call upon, allowing you to perform great magical feats under you own power even without sorcerous training. Practically any magical feat you can imagine can be accomplished as long as you have the power for it, though it is harder to apply this in minor efforts than it is in grand ways -- you have great power, but lesser precision. Of course, this power is insignificant before the might of those who wield the Odinforce... for now. But gods live long lives and your power is sure to grow as you do; who knows where you shall stand millennia from now?"

The Power Cosmic gives you an amazing ability to channel nigh limitless amounts of cosmic energy for just about any purpose. Energy blasts, transmutation, energy absorption, super strength, the Power Cosmic can do just about anything limited only by your stamina and ability to channel it.

Over the eons they have chosen many a host to enforce their will, though none were ever as close to the Phoenix as one Jean Grey, who was able to nearly merge and channel all of the Phoenix’s powers. The Phoenix Force views you as an ideal host that compares to Jean and has taken residence within you. In the future, any beings that need special hosts will view you as a proper one and there will be no compatibility issues. This also protects you from being controlled by said beings though they can still influence your emotions.

Not only do you start with much greater power than most, but there is no true ceiling to your growth. You will, for a time, grow in power at a meteoric rate, and then slow. But you will never reach a point where your magic cannot grow further.

the host of one such Cosmic Entity due to your overwhelming affinity with it. Hosting this
entity will grant you its full power and a number of other abilities. Using the Phoenix as
an example again, you would be able to transform into the White Phoenix, gain
unparalleled psychic skills, have godlike fire manipulation, the ability to alter reality
across the universe, and your own abilities would be greatly enhanced. The entity will
remain separate though it will become bonded to you permanently. You however, may
optionally just claim the entity's power if you don’t want a new friend. Some other

Emotional Entities."

looks like one. The second member of the Najimi family has appeared and it’s none other than
yourself Jumper. But what’s this? You don’t have any powers yet. How strange for such a high priced
option. Perhaps you should wait a bit and see what appears to you. You see, the power of Anshin’in
is not one that is immediately expressed but one that is infinite in time. The power to develop more
powers, independently of anything else and at a rate that makes all things outside of it really quite
silly. You automatically develop new Abnormalities at a rate of 3,779 new powers per year. That’s about
10 new powers every 24 hours. A stunning rate isn’t it? Not all powers are equal however. The vast
majority of powers that you gain are ultra-specific to your immediate thoughts and wishes at the
time and quite limited in ability. Looking at yourself in the mirror one morning and wishing you
didn’t need to use a razor to shave would give you Rather Razor [The shave facial hair from faces
with a thought power] while wishing you could punish the driver who cut you off in traffic later that
morning may give you Back Wheel Burnout [The ruin the back wheels of any car you can see power]. Now and then, you can gain powers with greater scope and magnitude, especially if you are
desperately needing them or have a great connection to the potential power. A lifelong pyromaniac
stuck battling a foe in a dry forest has a good chance of developing Foolish Friendly Flames [The
create and control fire power]. These good abilities are quite rare, especially if there’s no pressing
need for them, and even more powerful abilities are even rarer. As you get older, in the scale of
orders of magnitude older, better powers will begin to become more and more common for you to
regularly develop. "
765,,1200,The Power Cosmic,Marvel Zombies,Source,"The power. You’re so powerful that it’s starting to get very vague, and you could reasonably claim the most powerful being on Earth. You have been chosen as a Herald of Galactus, imbued with the Power Cosmic, a godlike, unlimited source of energy granted to Galan of Taa at the end of the sixth multiverse. What does that mean? What are you capable of now? The answer is, well, pretty much everything. The expected stuff is tremendous. Your body is among the strongest in the universe. You are immortal and regenerate instantly. You’re a rung up from the Hulk-Thor weight class, and you could throw down with the Hulk at his strongest. You can withstand black holes, supernovas, and cosmic phenomena in the deep reaches of space, and fire off energy blasts powerful enough to core out planets. You could cross hundreds of thousands of lightyears in a mere instant. You do all this through the Power Cosmic, and you have mastery over it - you have absolute control over it. For instance, you could pet a dog as effortlessly as you could punch through a mountain of pure adamantium. Both are trivial. But you’re not restricted to such... simple ways of using the Power Cosmic. Not when you can atomize all before you with a glance, or reconstruct it with the same ease. Not when you can sense a being on the opposite side of the universe. Not when you can destroy galaxies. If you were so inclined, you could emulate every single prior power on this list, and more.

Contrary to the name, this doesn’t necessarily have to be the Power Cosmic. Alternatively, you can choose to have your body be enhanced by the Golden Sentry Serum, granting you the power of a million exploding suns, to the same effect.

Either of these are pretty much vast, infinite, limitless. Save for one thing. Keep in mind: This is a Marvel Zombies Jump, from the Marvel Zombies series. Remember what happened to the Silver Surfer."
766,,1200,Phoenix Six,Avengers Vs X-Men,Source,"The Phoenix Force is the cosmic embodiment of life itself. It’s role is to destroy worlds that have come to an end in their growth and to start new worlds where life does not exist, as well as to restart prematurely halted growth. It is currently on it’s way to Earth, soon setting off the events of the series, but now it appears that when the Phoenix would have split apart and created the Phoenix Five a day from now, it will instead split into six and send that sixth portion to you, wherever you may be. Should the Phoenix not be split, you will receive this portion anyway. 

You will then hold an effective one-sixth portion of the Phoenix Force within you, granting you immense and terrible powers. A phoenix host possesses enormous telekinesis and telepathic abilities, greatly surpassing an Omega level mutant in either one. They cease to age and have extremely powerful healing factors, even potentially being revived from death by the phoenix force so long as they continue to have access to the force and their portion has enough power to resurrect. They can also bring back other deceased people. A Phoenix avatar’s physical abilities are vastly enhanced, capable of contending with foes like Thor or the Hulk in a one on one battle, and they have the ability to fly through space at faster than light speeds. Any Mutant powers you have will be supercharged by the presence of the avatar of evolution, greatly empowering them to stand on similar heights as the other abilities given here. 

The most iconic manifestation of the phoenix might within you is the power over cosmic fire. Cosmic flames that consume all things without even leaving ash behind, which perfectly obey the will of the host in what they burn or how they move, even burning in the vacuum of space. They can be used both for destruction and for creation, bringing life and revitalising those touched by the fire if willed by the user. As you only possess one-sixth of the full Force, your powers are only around the level of the Phoenix Five as they appear in this event. By defeating the other members of the Five, their portion of the power will be divided among you and the remaining hosts and defeating all of them would endow you with the power of Dark Phoenix. Should the Force not be split among the hosts, you would need to defeat the Phoenix itself to take the rest of it’s power as a host. 

As great as these powers are, they are not without a flaw. The phoenix will influence your emotions, more so the more of it is within you. Your emotions will often be far more intense then before, easily driving you into rages or bouts of joyful happiness without reason. With great will and self restraint, it is possible to contain the influence of the Phoenix and experience with the power will make this somewhat easier over time."
767,,1400,Sealed True Name ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Source,"Somehow, you discovered your True Name, and, through a process that may or may not have involved temporarily killing yourself and carving a delicate series of runes into your own heart, you have sealed your True Name. This offers a number of considerable benefits. First of all, your name being sealed means it cannot be used against you, even if others know it. Second, it enhances your magic tremendously, affording you a considerable boost in both raw power and your growth rate. While this will not grant you access to an unlimited font of raw magical power until you attain your Spark, it will make it so your well of magical energy grows by leaps and bounds continuously, even without any training or effort on your part. This perk also grants you a notable healing factor, which scales in effectiveness as your overall magic capacity grows larger. With enough magical power, your body could heal itself from being shot in the head fast enough that the entry wound closes before the bullet exits the back of your skull. Even more impressive than this is your ability to copy any discipline of magic by seeing it in action only a single time, though it will take practice and time to build up a greater level of skill in wielding it. Learning your True Name has also given you access to the souls and consciousnesses of others, allowing you to manipulate and destroy them as you desire. This allows you to do things like tearing Remnants from their hosts, regardless of how long they have been fused. You can see the magic of others, and even cycle through their souls, seeing everything they have seen and learning everything they know before absorbing it for yourself, as Darquesse did to Argeddion in Dying Of The Light."
768,,1500,The End,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Source,"The big one. The personal Abnormality of Medaka Kurokami and what has rocketed her towards
greater and greater heights of power. You are now able to copy any supernatural power that you see
and after a year or so of regular use even hear or read about from a second-hand description, gaining use of that power for yourself. The moment you gain the power, you will have mastered its
use and even improved it to be 120% as good as its original version. You are even able to use this on
mundane skills that you witness or hear about, instead of just powers. There are limits to this mighty
power though. You cannot copy the raw physical statistics of people you see or hear about, such as
the raw and natural physical strength or durability of someone, so it may become difficult to
properly use some powers if you do not already have the required physical abilities and reactions to
use it right and you cannot stop yourself from copying an ability when you see or hear about it, not
with this alone at least."
769,,1600,Vestments of Balance ,DC Occult,Source,"​The Lords of Order and Chaos are powerful magical beings that were born at the dawn of time. For untold millennia, they have been locked in a metaphysical war, attempting to further the cause of Order or of Chaos. Primarily, this is accomplished by empowering mortal agents to act as proxies.

The most powerful and well-known example of this is Doctor Fate -- the manifestation of Nabu, the greatest and most powerful of the Lords of Order -- who channels his power through the Helm of Fate and those who wear it. But Nabu is far from the only Lord to empower his agents through artifacts and one such item has fallen into your possession.

You have some wearable object that contains the essence of a lesser Lord, whether of Chaos or Order. This item is bound to you, allowing you to summon it at-will, and when worn, grants you access to a large sum of magical power. This would be a formidable amount of power even in the hands of a mortal with none of their own, but it truly shines when worn by an already powerful being. The more powerful the person wearing the Vestments, the larger the increase in power will be.

As well, when worn, the ghost of the — now long-dead — Lord will whisper into your mind, teaching you powerful magic and prompting you to follow their agenda. The ghost will be completely unable to possess you unless you allow them to do so and the possession may be revoked by you at any time. You don't have to advance their cause, but they will be much more willing to teach you if you do so.

After this jump is over, you can silence the ghost or awaken it as you please.

With a second purchase (discounted if the first purchase wasn’t), you may gain the Vestments opposite of the ones first purchased, but both cannot be used together. Or, in place of having one for Order and one for Chaos, you may instead spend 1600 CP (prior to discounts) to purchase Vestments containing the power of a Lord of Balance, which will be half again as powerful as either of the others and allow you to wield both Chaos and Order magic at once.

770,,1600,Jumper Force,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Source,"The Odinforce, the Thor Force, the Destiny Force, the Life Force... There’s a lot of reality sundering forces around here. And now you have your own. This power functions much like the Odin Force, and if you are an Asgardian almost certainly is the Odin Force in the same way that the Thor Force is. It is a mystical energy force which can be used for nearly any purpose, from augmenting your own power directly, to serving as a truly staggering store of magical power, to brute reality warping. While its functions are nigh infinite, it does have its limits. Overuse will see you left drained of its power, needing to go into a deep, recuperative, often month long sleep.

Like Thor when he possesses the Thor Force, or Rick Jones when he possesses the Destiny Force, you will begin with far from full access or the skill with this power. And (as a human) this power will cap well below the upper showings of Odin with the Odinforce (so you will not be creating suns from the heat of your magical battles, or casually giving Jane Foster powers to equal Thor on the condition she use them as a hero), or even less supreme uses. Even so you could passively increase your abilities from the level of a human to those of an Asgardian, with only a passive drain on this force, create or destroy objects or even entire buildings, power spacecraft, temporarily grant superpowers, and generally use it as a high powered omnitool. You won’t be waving your hand and closing a hole in the Earth after a fire giant ripped out a hunk and tossed it at you making the moon, and then starting the Earth’s rotation, or after an exhausting hours long battle against a planet consuming robot that sees the moon exploded as collateral damage, reforming the moon about the robot as a prison, but by straining the force to the point of needing to enter the jumper sleep you could possibly rebuild an entire city, or empower a group of heroes with the energy needed to temporarily punch through force fields that’d stop even Mjolnir. And with mastery you could obtain substantially more access to this force, and much greater finesse; temporarily calling legions of entities from other possible timelines or freezing entire space armadas in place or destroying them would be well within your power.

If you purchased a more mystically or psychically powerful race in this jump, this power will be expanded to scale. As an upgraded Asgardian you would begin as equal to Thor when Odin died, the passive empowerment enough to allow you to reshape Captain America’s shield with brute, physical force (and Mjolnir), and potentially remaking the moon molecule by molecule. And with the same potential heights. As an unupgraded Asgardian you’d be significantly less impressive, but still somewhere between a human and Odin’s heights. As a full price Kryptonian you would be above an unupgraded Asgardian, and as a reduced price one you’d be somewhat below one. As a Living Planet you would almost certainly be able to surpass Odin and/or Thor given time and learning to shape these energies.
