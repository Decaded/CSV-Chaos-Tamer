1,,Free,Dark knight,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"Dark Knights are melee damage dealers specializing in the use of Great Swords and Scythes. While they have a respectable rating in Elemental Magic, the bulk of their magic usage comes from casting Dark Magic spells to drain or enfeeble their enemies."
2,,Free,Blackmage,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"Through devastating magic spells, Black Mages bring tremendous firepower to the battlefield. A Black Mage's job is simply to cast offensive spells and destroy enemies. Although they are known for their Elemental Magic, they also possess a few highly-valued utilitarian spells. While a black mage cannot attack from the front lines of battle their long range spells are feared throughout Vana'diel."
3,,Free,Skillchain!,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"A Skillchain is the result of performing a sequence of abilities such as Weapon Skills in a certain order with proper timing. When two attacks connect with a target in succession, a powerful surge of energy is released, inflicting additional damage to the target above and beyond what your weapon skill would normally be able to achieve on its own. You can now perform such skillchains in battle, and after this jump there is a chance that should you and others perform such special attacks quickly in succession you may trigger a skillchain to your target, dealing varying degrees of extra damage."
4,,Free,Tactical Points,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"Over the course of a battle every combat class builds what are known as Tactical Points or TP by participating, damaging opponents, being damaged by opponents or even some special skills accumulate TP, once your TP reaches a certain level it can be used to unleash a powerful attack called a Weapon Skill, these skills do much more damage than normal skills and can often turn the tide of a battle if used correctly. Some classes, such as samurai and dancer, rely on TP more than others but also have their own special skills because of it. You also now generate Tactical Points in battle and are able to perform weapon skills when it reaches a high enough level."
5,,Free,Yang it!,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,Any impact that lands on you will be absorbed and increase your strength. It will still harm you as much as the level of impact can. The increase in strength is equal to the power of the impact and lasts as long as you've been hit within the last five minutes.
6,,Free,Magebreaker,Gods of Blood and Powder,Destruction,"A magebreaker is a Privileged who forsook his connection to the Else and gave up his incredible power to cast magic in order to become the opposite: something immune to magic. Magic fire won’t harm you, magic gusts of wind will leave you standing and you can see through illusions and step through wards. In close proximity you can shut off the connection of a Privileged to the Else entirely, making them unable to cast magic. Whatever level of Privileged power you’ve purchased, can be converted into being a magebreaker by giving up your magic out of your own free will. A magebreaker seems to be slightly stronger than the level of Privileged they were before. A subpar Privileged becoming a magebreaker would be immune to the magic of even a royal cabal member. A Peredii would still be able to get past that, so you’re lucky there’s not many left. Powerful Magebreakers, like the gurlish wolf who had been a royal cabal level Privileged before forsaking his magic can cast a net of nullifying power over a wide area, completely rendering his entire company of dragoons and crussairs immune to enemy magic and shutting down the abilities of enemy sorcerers.

Requires Privileged to Purchase"
7,,Free,Base Proficiency,RWBY,Destruction,"Things are about to get heated around here Jumper, with Kingdom spanning conflict on the Horizon. It’s for the best if you could actually hold your own in a fight. As such here a bit of a start to make it easier to keep yourself alive. With this Perk alone your roughly equal as capable in combat as Jaune Arc at the end of Volume 1, alongside knowing how to use your own Weapon and the basis for your own unique style. Training will of course see you improve but you at least won’t be a burden at the start. If you want to start with a bit more experience, there are some options to upgrade this Perk."
8,,Free,Limit Break,Final Fantasy VIII,Destruction,"When you're at the end of your stamina and are ready to collapse in battle, you can activate a special move called a Limit Break. Utilizing true magic, which normal humans can only perform in this situation, you unleash a devastating attack of your own style and choosing. Flying sword or martial arts combos, magical spells, supernaturally accurate shots, huge energy beams, a combination of any of these, and more are just examples of what can be done with a Limit Break. Sorceresses are exempt from the need for a Limit Break to use their true magic, and magic from outside of this setting is also free from this restriction."
9,,Free,Still More Fighting,Final Fantasy VII,Destruction,"This isn't a story about ordinary people, but one about strange and often messed-up individuals fighting for things they believe in. You're also going to need to be able to hold your own in a fight if you want to get involved and stand up for anything you yourself want to believe in. Even ordinary humans who haven't been through the SOLDIER program or touched by some other external power would be considered superhuman on modern day Earth when they're experienced enough.

While it will still pale in comparison to SOLDIER and some of the stronger monsters of this world, you start physically fit enough that you could lift and swing a weapon twice your size and weight without issue, durable enough to survive magical fire and bullets with minor wounds instead of major injuries or death from the get-go, and fast enough that dodging machine gun fire isn't too improbable for you. These physical abilities of yours will grow as you defeat stronger enemies, soon being able to lift something several times your weight and catch yourself from a thousand-foot drop without suffering a scratch. That in mind, you're not invincible or stand a good chance of surviving the deadliest foes without some gear. Having good armor, weapons, and Materia will serve you better than trying to fight giant robots with only your bare hands and grit.

Additionally, you have a unique fighting style tailored to you. Whether it involves wielding a large sword, martial arts, guns, or even something like an absurdly large shuriken, you have a specific weapon type and style that you can wield with ease against all logic. This doesn't provide any obviously supernatural or unique benefits...that's for what comes after this."
10,,Free,Warrior,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"Everyone must have a way to defend themselves. With this perk, you’re a warrior of exceptional skill, able to fight overwhelming numbers and mighty beasts with equal ease. Comes with peak human body and an increased capacity of improving your physical abilities, as well as competence in all weapons and reducing the weight of any armor you wear."
11,,Free,Your Volund,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Destruction,"Ever had a weapon you are particularly fond off? Than you may Import them in this Option. This single weapon will be capable of harming and killing the divine but does not have a Valkyrie within it. Whatever abilities they had or you gave them will also vanish for the duration of this Jump... unless you decide to replace that Items ability with your Greatest Quality. The two are mutually exclusive to one another and you may not have a Greatest Quality and a Volund with Imported Special capabilities. Even than the power that may remain with the Imported Weapon applies to the same rules. If you Partner with a Valkyrie they may become the Item or enter it as a consciousness while granting their power.

Note: Let’s say you got One For All from MHA and Boosted Gear from High School DxD which you Imported to also be the Infinity Gauntlet. You can EITHER have One For All and a Gauntlet that LOOKS like Boosted Gear but cant do any of its powers OR Boosted Gear with no One For All. If you Import Boosted Gear your not getting the Infinity Gauntlet however. You ARE getting Boost and Scale Mail though."
12,,Free,Prismatic Scales ,Super Dragon Sword ,Destruction,"Your Wyrm is now at the scale of an Ancient Dragon, large and powerful enough to envelop a castle in its breath. In addition, your Wyrm Familiar spell now fully matches the power of your breath, and the Wyrm itself can now Breath Change at-will without expending any mana.

Requires Wyrm Familiar(Super Dragon Sword), Breath Change(Super Dragon Sword), Intense Breath(Super Dragon Sword), Fell Breath(Super Dragon Sword) and Breath of Death(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
13,,Free,Starsunderer,Super Dragon Sword ,Destruction,"You are creating a sword-shaped tear in the Rift - any portions of your foe that are struck by this are sent directly to the Rift, resulting in sickeningly clean cuts that more or less ignore physical defenses. It’d require vitality comparable to a God or an Emissary of Shadow to shake this kind of wound off, and they would not do so easily. However, the backlash of the Rift energy will constantly drain your health and mana down at an alarming pace while you wield it this way.

Requires Psychoblade(Super Dragon Sword), Tearing Rift(Super Dragon Sword), Sword Burst(Super Dragon Sword), Portal Jaunt(Super Dragon Sword) and Psychic Battalion(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
14,,Free,Blood Bullets,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“At any time, you may sacrifice a significant, but not life threatening, percentage of your blood to create a small supply of five blood bullets. When loaded into a weapon, they will change shape to match the necessary ammo type, and function as normal. 

A blood bullet loaded into a pistol will match the caliber, become a shell for a shotgun, and even fuel for a flamethrower, though is unable to become anything too complex. This ability is unable to make blood bullets in greater numbers, as using it again will cause previous bullets to lose cohesion. 

A single blood bullet is unable to take the shape of significantly larger projectiles, such as cannon balls, but if multiple bullets with a combined mass equal or at least close to the desired projectile are placed together, they will fuse and assume the proper shape.” "
15,,Free,Rally,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“After being injured in some fashion, you have a short window of time where bathing yourself in the blood of your enemies will trigger mild recovery. Something to the effect of the blood spraying out from viscerally hacking into a target will do.

It's never very much healing, and you’re unlikely to fully recover from anything too significant, but every little bit helps. You don't have to be drenched in blood, but the amount required to trigger Rally will be quite noticeable.”"
16,,Free,Battle Forged ,Valkyrie Profile,Destruction,"Everyone who's anyone here is a hardened warrior, so now you are too. With this comes an average human's talent in melee (including everything from general swordplay to hand-to-hand), ranged combat, or battle sorcery, which focuses on your typical heal/buff/elemental projectile trifecta. Skill in both magic and weaponry can be obtained for a loss in some effectiveness in both due to the split focus. Valkyrie essentially receives skill in all three, though they still must make a choice as to which melee weapon and ranged weapon they use and which combat type they're most proficient in.
"
17,,Free,Weapon ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"You are given a single weapon of your choosing, melee or ranged, to match with your Magical Girl form. You may import a weapon you already owned for free, letting it benefit from your magical energie like a ‘normal’ one would. Muskets, swords, bows made of energy...you can use any weapon of your choosing, just note that anything more powerful or complicated than an infantry-sized item is impractical -at best- and extremely costly at worst. If you forfeited a Soul Gem, you must pay 100 points for this.
"
18,,Free,Leap Across Kilometers In A Single Bound​ ,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Destruction,"Transforming into a Hero gives you great physical power. For example, you are able to bounce across entire kilometers in a single leap and gain powerful physical enhancements, depending on your powers. You also gain a weapon if you don't have one or you can opt out of a weapon to instead gain great physical might to fight with your fists. You may also import a weapon. Pain is dulled to a larger extent, allowing you to continue fighting even when injured. But you are still prone to being knocked around by things bigger than you.
"
19,,Free,Shooting-type Spells ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"The simplest and most common spell used in combat. You focus mana into a sphere or ‘bullet’ and fire it at your opponent. Can be used in various forms - homing bullets, rapid-fire, and so on. The ‘big’ spells tend to fall under Bombardment, so take note of those as well. These can be ‘aimed’ by hand, or ‘guided’ by the right calculations in the spell.
"
20,,Free,Bombardment-type Spells ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"When someone or something absolutely needs to be blown the hell up befriended. Accept not substitutes. By focusing a large amount of mana into a single point, you may fire a large blast at a target, designed to completely overwhelm them via a show of raw power. These are almost always aimed, but if you can get a bit of skill and power for it, you might find a way to make such destructive spells guided...
"
21,,Free,Magic-Enhanced Attacks ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"Need a weapon to hit harder? Need your fist to absolutely break through something? Want to show off to someone? This is where you’ll look. By enhancing your blows or weapon with mana, you can make the blows or strikes inflict more damage, and letting you strike with more force than before.
"
22,,Free,Weapon-type ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"A very common form of Device, and the type often seen as standard-issue for the TSAB. Weapon-type Devices take the form of actual weapons that are wielded as such. Swords and staves fall into this category, which are consequently the traditional forms for Belkan and Mid-Childan Devices, respectively. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. This perk precludes Wearable-type - Lyrical Nanoha and Auxiliary Control-type - Lyrical Nanoha.)
"
23,,Free,Armaments ,Generic MG,Destruction,"For most girls, this is a simple scepter or wand. But different girls are different people with different weapons. Some might have swords, some might use some might just have brass knuckles integrated into their raiment. Take up to as many power packages have been purchased.

You can import any of your personal weapons into your armaments, and can later import armaments into future weapons. Armaments can be materialized to hand while transformed. Materializing a weapon will also repair it, though that will cost a small amount of magical energy.
"
24,,Free,Flamin' 'Ot! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Destruction,"As a priest of The Fire Mouth you are skilled at manipulating the bellyburn, the small spark of fire you believe exists within you and allows you to consume so much. While your magic is bizzare, it is undeniably effective. A few mouthfuls of the noxious, secret brews of your priesthood and you can vomit up sheets of fire, enough to reduce entire formations to charcoal and molten metal, or spew a barrage of fireballs to explode clear on the other side of a battlefield. As your skill and devotion increases you will be able to manipulate these flames you vomit forth into all manner of bizzare conflagrations."
25,,Free,The Might of Monsters ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Destruction,"As a member of the strongest army in Hyrule, you too have an innate strength beyond normal Hylians. You now have a twisted humanoid form, as animalistic as you want in any way you like. This form has the power to deal a Heart Container’s worth of damage with your attacks no matter what, as well as your choice of endurance equivalent to 3 Heart Containers or the ability to marshal together a raw mystical force that could be called elemental magic without using Magic Containers, at the strength of the “Fire” spell. Your pick of fire, lightning or ice.
"
26,,Free,Weapon Materialisation,Genshin Impact,Destruction,"One ability that is not talked about much, yet is worth taking note of, is the ability for those with Visions to store their weapons away in a flash of light. With a simple flick of their wrist, they are able to materialise and dematerialise their chosen weapon away in the blink of an eye. This is not something that all Vision users are proficient in though, a certain red ranger occasionally leaving her bow at home. As a wielder of a Vision yourself, this is an ability that you too share. You can summon and de-summon your ‘main’ weapon away at your leisure. Should you wish, you can change which weapon that you are able to summon."
27,,50,Firework Projection,Generic Superpower Supplement,Destruction,You are able to project bolts of light that explode into various colours and patterns upon contact or when having travelled 100 feet. Contact with these explosions can cause painful burns and temporary blindness or deafness but are rarely lethal.
28,,50,Kahvozein's Fang,TES: Dovah,Destruction,"A bronze dagger made in the standard fashion of the Dragon
Cult, it was used in many arcane rituals utilizing Dragon Heartscales. Their draconic
essence seems to have granted this dagger some manner of power, allowing it to
completely bypass the natural defenses of dragons."
29,,50,Shiba Scorch Balls,Bleach,Destruction,"A small, concealable bag that can be hidden on one’s person reliably. The bag contains various
fireworks produced by the Shiba Clan, each resembling beige orbs of clay with a pattern of colorful
symbols on the surface. Hardy, with a volatile core, these fireworks will explode upon having their
outer shell broken with a bright flash and cloud of smoke. More dangerous than normal fireworks, these things can function as shrapnel grenades; being able to lightly injure Shinigami officers. The bag always seems filled with at least a few balls. "
30,,50,Jack Slash,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You can extend the cutting edge of a bladed object, the longer the edge the farther it extends."
31,,50,Carnelian Signet ,Final Fantasy IV,Destruction,"Summons a MomBomb, which separates into dozens of smaller Bombs. Useful for destroying a large area. If used, a new one will appear one year after it’s been used."
32,,50,Firebombs,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction,"A bisque urn that can fit in the palm of the hand, filled with a black fire, one that explodes upon contact when thrown. They are useful for many travelers, dealing decent fire damage from a range. You will receive a bag filled with twenty of these urns, which will replenish weekly if used or destroyed."
33,,50,Flamesprayer ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction,"A special weapon used by certain members of the Healing Church, one that spits out searing flames with but a pull of the trigger. Not the most efficient weapon by any stretch, but sometimes a sea of flame is just what the doctor ordered. Besides, the beasts of Yharnam can always use a good cleansing."
34,,50,"""Calamity Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A ring made from the orange eye of a calamitous dragon. This ring has no useful powers, and is merely a symbol of dragon worship, a thing quietly passed down amongst its most fervent adherents, some of whom become convinced the task has been bestowed upon them as a sacred duty."" Despite what is implied above, the ring does have one special ability. It causes the one who wears it to suffer from greater pains and injuries whenever they're harmed. Mostly useless for those not of a pain loving persuasion, but no one said the buyer has to be the wearer. . ."
35,,50,“Leo Ring” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"The Leo Ring once belonged to Dragonslayer Ornstein. It increases the penetrative power of your piercing attacks made against the enemy in the same moment they attempt to go on the offense, allowing them to thrust even deeper. Lethal in the hands of a patient, methodical fighter."
36,,50,“Transient Curses”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Cursed limbs of the deceased, when broken they cause their defiler to temporarily gain properties of a cursed being without the degenerative afflictions that come with one. Someone who uses a Transient Curse and gains these properties is able to interact with normally intangible spirits, allowing the defiler to combat ghosts and wraiths with mortal arms."
37,,50,Fist of Gratia,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A hunk of iron with holes for fingers, and a wedge-like face. It was used by the hunter most know as Simple Gratia, who was too lame to wield firearms. With it, she unrelentingly beat beasts to death, and you can do the same. It’s surprisingly comfortable and resilient despite what it is.”"
38,,50,Flamesprayer,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A small, hand-held flamethrower that can run on Quicksilver Bullets. It sprays a small gout of fire continuously for a few seconds for every bullet spent as fuel, as a point of comparison. Not the most efficient weapon by any stretch, but sometimes a plume of flame is just what the doctor ordered. Besides, lots of things around here hate fire, so it may prove useful.”"
39,,50,One-Man Trebuchet,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Hardship breeds necessity, and sieges breed trebuchets. The one you own, like several found scattered across this land, has been modified to be operable by a single warrior. Comes with a supply of heavy rocks perfect for launching at the enemy that mysteriously resupplies every day. “The enemy” being most armed beings still moving in groups, in these grim times.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
40,,50,Thunderstaff ,MtG - Shandalar,Destruction,"This ominous iron staff crackles with barely-contained lightning, hinting at its purpose without so much as a shred of subtlety. When activated, a Thunderstaff creates a roiling mass of lightning and arcane energies, which will seek out your nearest foe with blazing speed, traversing even miles of open terrain without dimming. Upon contact, it will explode into a violent conflagration of lightning, fire, and unrefined Red mana, the thunderous inferno powerful enough to eliminate weaker mages outright and deal enough damage to send more powerful ones retreating.

The Thunderstaff can be used once per day for free, and can be recharged instantly by spending a Red Amulet (such as from the ‘Jewelry’ or ‘Gemcutter’ options below)."
41,,50,Corkscrew ,Neverland: The RPG,Destruction,"A magic corkscrew that can drill a small hole through any non-magical material.
"
42,,50,Iron Magic Foci ,Endless Legend,Destruction,"The crudest foci, this club of a scepter adds a bludgeoning force to all your spells, knocking back and staggering foes hit by them.
"
43,,50,Sorcery - Conjuration Ritual (Shitstorm) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Destruction,"This path allows the sorcerer to summon objects to themselves, whether through a form of telekinesis or apporation.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Shitstorm(4): The caster creates a whirlwind of random debris that strike and
injure anyone within the affected area, which, depending on the sorcerer’s skill,
can be anywhere from two to twelve yards in diameter.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Conjuration (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
44,,50,Bullet Patterns ,Undertale,Destruction,"Magic is part of being a monster- It's literally a part of you! As such, all monsters have at least a rudimentary understanding of White Magic- That is to say, they can use magic to attack. Like almost all magic, this magic directly attacks the SOUL of an opponent and does not actually physically harm them- They might show bruises, cuts, or other superficial signs of damage, but otherwise the pain is all felt on a spiritual level. Since magic is so tied to their being, a monster's innate magic is invariably representative of their personality or appearance- A frog-like monster might use flies to attack, a skeleton might use bones, or a dog might use... dog-shaped attacks. This innate magic is typically rudimentary and easy to avoid, but many monsters prefer to use their bullet patterns as a way of expressing themselves rather than use them as actual attacks."
45,,50,Magic Weapons (Basic) ,Terraria,Destruction,"Can take the form of wands, books, or other items that the wielder channels mana into to cause an effect. It is possible, though not suggested, to take an item from a lower ‘rarity’ when purchasing at a higher price. 


Can pick two weapons that are made with wood, made with cactus, made with an early pre-Hardmode ore [Copper, Tin, Iron, Lead, Silver, Tungsten, Gold, Platinum], or which are listed here: Wand of Sparking, Thunder Zapper, Amber Staff, Gray Zapinator, Book of Skulls

See Magic Weapons for more information."
46,,100,Dipping Weapons,Baldur's Gate 3,Destruction,"You can dip any weapon in your hands to any kind of harmful surface. When dipped
this way, for a time that increases with your dipping duration (1 hours of duration per 6 seconds
dipped, capped at 24 hours), they will deal the extra damage according to type of surface they
were subjected to. Dipping in burning fire? Fire damage. Dipping in caustic liquids? Acid
damage. And so on... Your weapon will gain resilience to that element to prevent harm to it, if
you are actively and intentionally attempting to dip your weapon."
47,,100,Improvised Weaponry,Baldur's Gate 3,Destruction,"You are great at using random objects that litter the environment around you as weapons
ready for swinging and throwing. That chair over there, you can smash it on somebody’s back.
This salami here? It will make a good bludgeoning weapon. And this goblin I am holding up by
its ankle? It is a visionary siege weapon. Each time grab something absurd like these and attempt
to use it to hurt someone, you’ll find that they are surprisingly easy to use and require a half of
its normal the strength requirements to wield properly. Oh, and they deal double damage to
people who get surprised by your choice of weapons. Only requirement for this ability is that
you must have the strength to lift the target object in some capacity."
48,,100,Breath Attack,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"There are several different species of Danger Beasts that
have some form of breath attack, like the Nubis that is able to breathe fire and the
Death Tagools that are able to shoot raw, destructive energy. You’re no exception to
this rule, having your own breath attack, be it elemental, like fire or electricity, or
even made of pure energy. However, your breath attack’s power will depend on your
own relative strength."
49,,100,Consecutive Strikes,Rapturous Rhapsody,Destruction,"True masters of combat not only develop their skills but also hone their very beings.
One of the greatest representations of this mastery is the maximization of attack
efficiency. Warriors like Mikael and Malenia exemplify this level of combat expertise.
You, too, can be counted among their ranks. With this ability, your strikes become faster
and more powerful the longer you continue attacking. As long as you maintain your
momentum, you will grow deadlier with each successive hit. You can pause or take
damage momentarily without losing this effect, but if you halt for too long, you will need
to rebuild your momentum from scratch."
50,,100,Power-wrought weapon,The Wheel of Time Jump,Destruction,"You now own a Power-wrought weapon of your choice. The weapon will
be made perfectly for you, being the perfect weight, size and balance for
you to wield it like an extension of yourself. And because it’s power-
wrought, it will never break nor blunt, and needs no maintenance to
keep in order, never need any sharpening while being immune to
corrosion and rust. If the weapon has a blade then it will be sharp
enough to shave with. It will also be extra effective on Shadowspawn and
similarly creatures in future jumps, as well as seeming to burn anyone on
the receiving end of it. It will also prove capable of permanently killing
beings with immortality. You can import any weapon you own, and can
choose to make it have the heron mark."
51,,100,Bomb Balls,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"Pockets full of trouble, you’ve got. You hold in your hands a variety of coloured balls and small
square shaped explosives. These are the usual weapons of one Myouri Unzen, a special sort of
weapon normally usable by only those with the right Abnormality. You might not use them as well
but they remain very handy weapons. The coloured balls are very bouncy, except when impacting
flesh when they then become as hard as steel. The square shaped explosives are as powerful as a
modern fragmentation grenade and almost undetectable as explosives. You get a pocketful of each
every week. "
52,,100,Stymphalian Feathers,Greek Mythology,Destruction,"You have the unique ability to weaponize parts of your body
(feathers, fur, hair, scales, quilles) by launching them out from your body like arrows from a bow.
[Can have parts or all of your body take the appearance of metals]."
53,,100,Heilig Bogen,Bleach,Destruction,"A Spirit Weapon, the main tool of the Quincy. Formed by gathering and focusing reishi from the air
into your hands. Through these spirit weapons are channeled many of the Quincy techniques, particularly their methods of attacking with holy arrows. Every Heilig Bogen is unique, a personal expression of the Quincy who uses it and the way they were
taught. They can be formed as desired, with designs often changing and improving as a Quincy
becomes more experienced and realises what kind of weapon they prefer. A young Quincy might go
through seven or eight variations before settling. Every form has it’s own benefits. A bow is
traditional and has great power and a long history of techniques but a spiritual gun might often
greater range and rates of fire. Despite their classic image, even melee weapons can be manifested. Weaker Quincy will create weapons that appear to be formed with blue energy but more powerful
or skilled Quincy are able to condense this to solid form, creating weapons that appear to be made
of fully realised metal. A Quincy is not naturally drawn to the perfect tool or form, this is not some innately gifted power. A
Quincy has to find his own path and take his chosen weapon for himself, master it himself. It’s up to
you what your choice will be. "
54,,100,Slaughter Mode,Bleach,Destruction,"With a few modifications, even a normal child can be made into a deadly warrior. A few spiritual
alterations and a new state is unlocked, a mental mode that can come over you when hostilities
arise. Provided you don’t hold yourself back, you’ll enter a trance state that enables you to fight at
full efficiency. Fear, worry, kindness and any sort of risk erased from your mind as you are turned
into a perfect killing machine. Pain and damage won’t slow you down as your mind sharpens to the
best uses of what you have available, as well as to how best to cause damage to anyone in your way.
It’ll help you fight at the best you can without character flaws getting in the way but it can also make
you recklessly pursue foes until destruction, especially without an ally to pull you out early. Who
knows what Urahara was thinking, doing this sort of thing to kids."
55,,100,Blood Reaper,Bleach,Destruction,"You kill, you die, you live, you kill, you die. The cycle continues forever and the only thing that’ll
remain the same is death. Why not have a little fun along the way? If you let it, the fight for life will
really start getting your blood going. It’s a whole lot easier to push yourself further and ignore the
pain when you’re having such an absolute blast butchering everything in front of you. This bloody
way of life you can let yourself indulge in heightens your instincts in combat, naturally guiding you to
cause more damage and fight on longer. The natural intent you can put into every blow can even
leak into your Reiatsu as it emits, shaping it into a fearsome shape. "
56,,100,Miss Militia,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,You can form weapons from a semi-sentient blue-black blur of energy. These weapons have unlimited ammo and can only be mundane in origin.
57,,100,Combo,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,Your melee attacks get stronger in a geometric progression the longer you attack the same target without stopping. You have to continue hitting your opponent with pauses no longer than 5 seconds between the strikes or your combo will be broken.
58,,100,Mutation,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You gain a short-ranged Blaster power, taking the form of writhing, near-invisible ""whips"" of energy. These whips are Manton limited, allowing them to pass through inorganic matter only. The whips work by inducing debilitating, permanent physical mutations on those struck. Examples include: having the targets legs fused into a single mangled, paralysed limb or having heavy tangle of bone snakes grow between the targets ribcage making every breath a struggle."
59,,100,Orchestra,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You have absolute control of all sound within 100 feet of yourself, or about 30 meters. You can not create sound using this power, but you can absorb it for later use. Technically, you can absorb enough sound to equal the energy in a large thermonuclear warhead, but since you can only absorb energy from sound, you'd need millennia to absorb that much without special assistance. "
60,,100,Area of Attack,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You are able to create a field with a radius of 100 feet where any living organisms you choose are attacked by small physical projections every 10 seconds. You are able to control the rough shape of the projections, choosing whether they are blunt or sharp, for example. The projections are able to hit with enough force to easily break bones. The projections disappear after impact. You can dismiss this field at will."
61,,100,Minefield,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You can create floating opaque spheres in the surrounding area. Anything that touches a sphere causes it to explode with the force of a grenade. You can fill a 30-foot radius in 10 seconds, packed at a distance of 4 per sq. yard."
62,,100,Hotwheels,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You can convert and store heat energy and later release it as kinetic energy from anywhere on your body. The release of kinetic energy won't hurt you... directly. If you release the force of a bomb from your hand, your hand will be fine, but if you hit a wall, you will be hurt by that. The energy required to crush a car is equivalent to five hours next to a large fire."
63,,100,Stealth Efficiency,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Destruction,"The strong rules the weak, so how can the weak
defeat the strong? Like how two brilliant NEETs from another universe always say,
the weak’s weapons against the strong are their intelligence and strategy, not their
power. Apparently, you learned a different lesson from this ideology: no one,
regardless of their power, can prepare themselves from an attack they don’t know is
coming, including those stronger than you. Your attacks are twice as effective and
powerful when used against an unadvised opponent, but this power boost loses its
effect once they perceive your presence. This is perfect for a first surprise attack to
end a fight before it starts, letting even a weaker servant defeat a stronger master."
64,,100,Tsukumo,Naruto,Destruction,"A powerful needle barrage that can be fired from the Susanoo’s ribcage or its weapons.

Requires Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan to purchase."
65,,100,Tsunade,Naruto,Destruction,"Ever since you were young, you were gifted with immense physical strength, even when you were only a few years old. As you grew, so too did your strength, and it has advanced to the point where you can split the ground with just a finger, break a Sannin’s ribs, both their arms and rupturing several of their organs with just a punch, and even break through a Susanoo with only half a dozen punches."
66,,100,Specialization Is Actually For People,Bofuri,Destruction,"Someone once said specialization is for insects. That’s not true - specialization has worked extremely well for you, and you’re definitely human (at least.)

Choose one type of damage, like Blunt for Mai and Yui, or Fire for Mii. This is your specialization damage. Whenever you receive an attack boost that does not affect your specialization damage, you can convert that boost into one for your specialization damage, giving up the original attack boost in exchange for one that fits your build much better.

If you receive a general attack boost, you can convert it into a boost for your specialization damage only, being twice as strong in exchange for only affecting that type of damage."
67,,100,Purge Order,Final Fantasy XIII,Destruction,"You belong to PSICOM, and when your superiors need something eliminated, you’re the man for the job. The more you kill of a single thing in a row (a single type of monster, only humans), the stronger you get until you are at double your original strength. Also, if you weren’t already aware, you’re a monster you know that?"
68,,100,Path of the Storm Lance,Cradle V1,Destruction,"A path of storm and force madra that focuses entirely on striker and forger techniques to destroy the enemy before they can resist. There is no problem this path can’t solve with a giant explosion.

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
69,,100,Path of the Void Blade,Cradle V1,Destruction,"Users of this path of shadow and sword forge black swords of darkness and can affect both the real and spiritual world with their attacks. One technique is the nine blades of the underworld, where 9 black blades stab up in perfect circle to skewer an opponent from every direction. Gold sign is a spinning black halo that hovers around the head and cuts anything that gets near it. Pillows beware.

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
70,,100,Path of the Sandviper ,Cradle V1,Destruction,"Poison. The sand viper path imbues every strike they use with poison madra, corroding the bodies of those they attack. A path that uses bows and spears to attack and can multiply such strikes with forger techniques.

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
71,,100,Keys,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Destruction,"A set of Keys used as weapons against spiritual or demonic beings. Capable of affecting or harming them, but only as useful as the priest wielding them."
72,,100,Golden Knife,Egyptian Mythology,Destruction,"Every night, the renewed serpent Apep (Apophis) attempts to consume the sun as Ra travels with it through Duat. And every night, the gods aboard Ra’s barque defeat him with weapons just like this one. No matter how many times this curved gold blade cleaves into horrible demons such as the mighty Apep, its polish never dulls, its edge says honed to a razor’s edge, and it keeps parting the hide, flesh and bone of your enemies like new. Also, and don’t think about it too hard, this knife may be wielded without needing opposable thumbs, in case you choose to fight as a cat or a bird. At your option, this may be another weapon with a cutting edge, such as a khopesh, axe or spear."
73,,100,Bite of Uraeus,Egyptian Mythology,Destruction,"While the bite of a normal cobra is burns well enough in the blood, the monsters of Duat are described as having venom even more fierce. Your teeth are now capable of producing potent venom and spitting it from your mouth, but this venom also ignites on contact with air, erupting into a great spray of flame. You are immune to the toxin of your own bite, and resistant to accidentally scorching yourself when spitting fire."
74,,100,Energizer,Marvel Zombies,Destruction,"This probably came from an white, horselike alien called a Kymellian. Your power converts matter to energy, before absorbing it. It can then be fired from your chest as orbs of energy, called “power-balls.” You will often be at least a little luminescent when you do this. The energy you’ve currently got tucked away is directly correlated with the strength of punch your power-balls pack, but you have a limit. If you absorb too much it’ll be difficult to control and might even harm you."
75,,100,Black Hole,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction,"You open a dark vortex, which sucks up inanimate objects within a close distance to it. We do not currently know how to get things out, so be careful when using this magickal trash can. Animate objects take gravitational damage as they resist the vortex."
76,,100,Quickening,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction,"You’ve learned the ability to invoke a Quickening, or some may call it a Mist Knack. Each Quickening is distinctive to its user, but generally revolves around a single element, and a very destructive attack on the enemy.

You may choose to take a Quickening that already exists in this world. Quickenings are best used amongst those who also know the art, for Quickenings chained together are stronger than those used alone. 

While the enemy targeted may be frozen in place, beware that their allies may still move freely."
77,,100,Mist Drive,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction,"Most Viera go into a state of frenzy when they are exposed to an extreme concentration of Mist. You've developed an ability to control that through rigorous trial and error. When exposed to an extreme concentration of magic, you move extremely fast and even armor does not seem to stop your fists, but you temporarily lose the use of weapons and magick."
78,,100,Strength Of The Adversary,Slay the Princess,Destruction,"Strength calls to strength, those with power drawing more power towards themselves in an endless self-fulfilling cycle. You can break walls with a mere flex of your muscles, shatter stone in your palm with ease, mold iron like clay, etc. Raw power brimming within you makes your muscles bulge with ferocity with every motion you make, and your skin is almost impossible to damage or break. Of course, the nature of this ‘strength’ also means you have an obsessive tendency to seek greater and greater heights of violent excitement, your search for ever stronger opponents motivating you to take on any challenger you encounter. Such is the nature of this desire to test yourself that even should you ‘die’, your body may surge to life once more so long as the burning yearning to face a worthy Foe boils in your blood."
79,,100,Gift of Hate,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"Tonberry are known and feared throughout the lands of Vana'diel as dangerous and deadly foes, this reputation is well earned. When you fight with someone you may channel your anger and hatred into your weapons to slightly increase the amount of damage they can inflict. The more hate you feel the more powerful you are."
80,,100,Gobbie Bomb,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"Goblins are a type of beastman that has recently started to integrate into common society, because of this they are often seen with eyes of distrust or even fear. In such a world where everyone could potentially be out for your blood goblins have learned to keep themselves prepared. At any moment you can summon a small hand grenade sized bomb to throw at your enemy, you can only do this once an hour however and they cannot be stored. Be careful with this please, if you drop it you could be the one going boom."
81,,100,Tampered Guns,Dies Irae,Destruction,"You’ve got your choice of two special guns here. A Desert Eagle, one of those massive American guns or a classic Colt .45 revolver. Both guns have been magically enchanted to be able to harm the spirit as well as the soul of those they hit, though unfortunately the bullets aren’t any stronger than normal for it. It doesn’t look like they run out of ammunition though, needing just a few seconds to fully replenish itself before you can send off another volley of shots. You can buy this again to get the other gun if you wish. 

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
82,,100,May I Die In Your Arms,Dies Irae,Destruction,"Go too high and you might find that you regret the place you found yourself in. Power and knowledge can be all too alluring, the realisation that you have lost everything once you achieved those things all too heart breaking. Strong as you might become, you’ll never be unable to end your own life should it come to that. This can only be done willingly by your own hand, not through force, manipulation or trickery by any outside source. But so long as it truly is your own choice, you will be able to end your own life no matter what tries to stop you from doing so, physical or not. "
83,,100,SUMMONER’S STAFF,Final Fantasy X,Destruction,"A staff that every summoner seems to carry around could be a good walking stick too. It has a natural banishing effect against undead, and hostile undead are typically pacified when they come within visual range. Against stronger undead however, or any undead possessing substantial will power, you might find that its effects weaken, or that it will become a contest of wills."
84,,100,TINY BEE,Final Fantasy X,Destruction,"This small handgun fires mystical bullets, completely removing the need for reloading, though you can always pretend to empty your magazine for dramatic effect. Being enchanted as it is, you can enchant and fire a wide variety of rounds – and shots fired in rapid succession will result in a slight acceleration of subsequent shots, as well as an increase in accuracy overall."
85,,100,Dragonman axes,Gods of Blood and Powder,Destruction,Enchanted by privileged and blessed by boneeyes. These axes made of swamp dragon bone can cut through steel and magic wards alike. You also get a knife with the same properties.
86,,100,None Shall Pass,Fate/Stay Night,Destruction,"A somewhat ornate halberd formed from enchanted iron. Close enough to unbreakable to anything short of a Noble Phantasm, able to slice through metal like cheese and unfortunately, just a little too long for someone your size to wield comfortably. In fact, it seems like this Halberd has some sort of strange curse in which it is always slightly too long for anyone who uses it to use properly for someone of their size. I'm sure someone with magical abilities might be able to use it right or maybe just find some use for that increasing size. "
87,,100,Cards(Weapons) ,Final Fantasy IX,Destruction,"These Tetra Master cards have been enchanted such that they can be used multiple times without vanishing as normal Tetra Master Cards do. There is a time in between the card’s usage, and when the card will reform. Without the Tetra Master skill however, they will only project in solid construct form for a short time.

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Save the Queen, Masamune, Mythril Sword cards. Similar to the Airship line of cards, these weapons stay concrete for substantially longer periods of time in the hands of a Tetra Master."
88,,100,Cards(Spells),Final Fantasy IX,Destruction,"These Tetra Master cards have been enchanted such that they can be used multiple times without vanishing as normal Tetra Master Cards do. There is a time in between the card’s usage, and when the card will reform. Without the Tetra Master skill however, they will only project in solid construct form for a short time.

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Holy, Meteor, Flare cards. The card can be used to cast the spell, though it takes some time to regenerate – and the spell is slightly weakened."
89,,100,A Flair For Thrown Things ,Final Fantasy IX,Destruction,"Sure, you could toss a knife or a bomb, but why settle for such...generic things when you can be tossing pianos, kitchen sinks, monsters and other such things? Anything you can lay your hands on, you’ll be able to toss at an enemy. Don’t say we didn’t warn you, but that Behemoth will struggle as you lift it up and toss it."
90,,100,Infiltration ,Final Fantasy IX,Destruction,"In the eyes of magi, sometimes a foe’s armor can be thick enough that it can resist the effects of magic. While the first conclusion one might draw from that would be to increase the spell power, for Black Mages this is not always possible due to their inherent limitations as constructs.

But if magic could wear away at the armor, then perhaps we’ve found a bypass solution in the process. Spells cast by you are not simply slightly stronger than they were before – they also corrode enemy armor slowly over time."
91,,100,THE HAMMER,Inscryption,Destruction,"Sometimes you need extra space on the board, or the current state of your lanes is inconvenient for you. This special hammer allows you to instantly kill any of your own minions, making room for another. Don’t worry, their card isn’t gone forever.

Requires Inscryption to Purchase"
92,,100,"Murder, personalized to your taste!",Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Destruction,"So, you wanna become a murder professional like us? This perk allows you to do that, for the low price of 100CP! We'll even throw it in for free if you decide to stick with us! Pick one way of murder, such as completely silent, sending a message, accidental death, etc., and you'll become a master at it, satisfaction guaranteed! If you're not, no refunds cause fuck you, this is hell and nobody gives a shit. Go complain to Lucifer for all I care."
93,,100,Evil Destroying Warrior: Yazata,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction,"You are one of the warriors of the side of good. While your power is usually below that of the average Daeva, your physical abilities are still remarkable and put you quite above the regular man. You have enough agility to run faster than most wild animals, and enough strength to destroy buildings easily. You have also trained in the way of the sword, and are quite competent with it."
94,,100,Heavy Weapon Master,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Destruction,"Most would say carrying a sword the size of your body into battle isn’t a wise move. Most people aren’t SOLDIER. Thanks to careful training, you now have the ability to wield absurdly large weapons as if they were normal. Everything from Cloud’s buster sword to Sephiroth’s odachi would be within your purview, and would require only a little time to acclimate to. So long as a weapon can physically fit on your person, you can wield it without issue."
95,,100,Lockhart’s Legacy,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Destruction,"Beautiful, badass, sexy; you embody it all. You’re endowed with many incredible features, from a stunning face to stylish hair to impossible proportions. Such beauty comes effortlessly to you, whether it be on the beach or the battlefield.

Of course, there is more to this perk than simple looks. Like the powerhouse of Avalanche, your stellar looks are matched only by your staggering strength. Both of these traits are now linked, letting you enhance your power or looks by improving on the other. Yet, for all your brawn, you’ll never lose your sweet appearance. You needn’t carry Barrett’s bodybuilder physique to powerfully pummel your foes. Whether by your strikes or by your style, you’ll always leave others stunned! See the Notes section for additional details."
96,,100,Fireball!(Charged),Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction,"For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you can now ‘charge’ this move, by holding it in place for a few moments before releasing it. A charged attack is far more powerful than normal, and is capable of launching other Fighters. You are able to ‘bank’ a charged attack, causing a fully charged, but not released projectile to disappear. The next time you attempt a normal fireball, you will instead perform the charged version, without any delay.

Requires Fireball! to Purchase"
97,,100,Fireball!(Charged Plus),Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction,"For yet another 100cp (undiscounted), an even more powerful version of your projectile attack
becomes available. This attack, similar in scope to Mario Finale, covers a wide range and a very long distance. Not only is it highly damaging, but it also has a powerful pushing property to it. Even if someone is capable of guarding against it, they may still find themselves pushed far away from you. Performing this version of your attack is exhausting, and pulling it off more than once in a fight is probably beyond you.

Requires Fireball!(Charged) to Purchase"
98,,100,Slaughter Demon,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction,"A wide-bladed dagger, shaped almost like a cross between a butcher’s cleaver and a combat knife, with a wooden handle and a guard of black fur. A basic cursed tool, Slaughter Demon does little more than act as a weapon capable of harming cursed spirits, even in the hands of a non-sorcerer. It won’t be of too much use against a powerful curse, but against an average or weaker one? It’ll slice or stab through them with ease."
99,,100,Improbable Weapon User VII ,Final Fantasy VII,Destruction,"As you may already be aware, fighting styles in this world range from sensible to extremely bizarre. Giant swords the height and weight of their user tend to be a little impractical to wield in most cases. Most cases that aren't you, anyways. In addition to your personal fighting style being easier for you to master, you will find you can wield any weapon you can get your hands on and swing effectively regardless of practicality. Chainsaw? No risk of hurting yourself and a good chance of hitting your target. A machine gun arm with a huge amount of recoil? Recoil nothing, you can hit your enemies just fine. An absurdly large spoon? Why not! So long as you can hold and pick it up, you can use just about anything as gracefully as a well-made sword."
100,,100,Elite ,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"Demacian soldiers are a cut above everyone else. They’re just a little faster, a little stronger and a little tougher than anyone else. They also have excellent teamwork. Now you do too. If you have the Warrior Perk, the effect is increased even more. If you have the Mage or Inventor Perk, you gain basic competence with weapons and armors. Nothing much, but still enough to let you survive a melee if necessary."
101,,100,​​Corporate Worker,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Destruction,"Amazones is the greatest delivery company in the galaxy. If you need it, they have it and you’ll have it too no matter where or when you order. The glories of Amazones is made possible only by the hard working Amazons, the delivery workers who sort and deliver until they drop unconscious. After their company mandated break time, the period of unconsciousness, they return to work ready once more. Born into this dominant business clan, you have all the strength and endurance of a loyal member of the Amazones family. The stamina to work 20 hour days, seven days a week, and the strength to drag even a full sized factory to a customer when ordered. Company lessons on applying the art of war to the business sector have informed you of many efficient ways to brutally slaughter anyone who tries to interrupt your deliveries, making you an exceedingly vicious combatant. Surprising almost everyone that hears, these lessons also somehow actually do help you in running a business. A cut-throat business that laughs at the idea of workers’ rights, yes, but how else does one reach complete galactic domination from a mere start up?"
102,,100,Super Ball,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction,"This coin-sized ball of rubber looks like nothing more dangerous than a child’s toy. However, given a simple command word, the toy can transform into a dangerous weapon. Once activated it will bounce off every available surface until it reaches truly insane speeds before launching itself at your enemy. After impacting with bone crunching force, it will fly away and become lost for an entire day. At which point you’ll find another one in your pocket."
103,,100,Duncan’s Training,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction,"The art of physical violence comes in as many forms in this world as it does in any other. Using your bare fists may be seen as a little old fashioned in a world with swords and Magitek, but at least this way you’ll be a lot harder to disarm. Whether you trained under the great master Duncan himself or a different martial arts master, there’s no denying you learned the art well. Pick a martial art from our world. You have ten years experience in practicing a slightly more fantastical version of that martial art, including a small measure of chi control to enhance yourself."
104,,100,A Whip,The Song of the Nibelungs,Destruction,"A long seven tailed whip with heavy gold balls on its end, it will tear even a big shield into bits and pieces if wielded by the right hands and you automatically know how to use it with great skill and accuracy. A cruel weapon indeed."
105,,100,Battlemage Basics,HighSchool DxD,Destruction,"While magic is great by human standards, this alone won’t help much against other supernatural creatures. To help a bit with that, become a master of a mundane weapon or martial art of your choosing, at least by human standards. In addition to learning how to weave your own magic into your physical fighting style, you are able to use the two seamlessly together. For instance, if you prefer to use a sword, you can use a fire spell to provide a way to create distance or heat up your sword with very little loss in focus in doing so. This obviously doesn’t mean much if you don’t have much magic to use in the first place, but you can combine magic and your physical fighting style together with very little trouble and learn how to do the same with others in the future."
106,,100,Towards Zero,HighSchool DxD,Destruction,"Protagonists and do-gooders are all too predictable, they will beat the snot out of their enemies, but they only kill as a last resort. Forever letting their enemies heal and try again later on. Enough with such nonsense! You know better than to allow your foes to challenge your might again and again. For that, you have learned a particularly vicious way of defeating others, geared so that even if you don’t kill them, you permanently cripple them, with them losing powers, limbs, or even their very own potential. They will learn the hard way to not mess with you."
107,,100,Fatal Gap Beyond Senses,HighSchool DxD,Destruction,"Touki, the technique to create an aura of your own life force around your body to strengthen it beyond the limits. An incredible increase in offense, defense, vitality, and speed; making the user even capable of punching out magic when using it. While those who have trained in Senjutsu know somewhat how to use it, it’s not a real requirement to learn to use Touki, and even an untalented individual can achieve it by training their bodies to the utmost. Lastly, one can channel Touki into weapons to enchant them and fill them with numerous effects."
108,,100,Trophies of the Slain,God of War,Destruction,"When the dead actually stay dead, their tools are left behind, fated to rust and decay. At least, they would if you weren't around. When you slay certain enemies, you will often find something on their corpse that would prove useful. Be it a weapon, a tool, a piece of armor, or maybe even a new magical ability in a few rare cases, you are certain to have all the right tools for the low cost of a river of blood."
109,,100,Power Shriek,Adventure Time,Destruction,The most shameful sort of magic. You can shriek at people close by with such power that they become unconscious.
110,,100,"Exagryph, The Adamant Rail",Hades,Destruction,"Few remember the part Lady Hestia played in the battle against the Titans. She prefers it this way. Her weapon was Exagryph, an engine of metal and flame so destructive that the moment the battle was finished, she cast it aside and left it where it lay. Hades locked it away as even he was fearful of what terrifying crimes of war mortals would unleash ifi ts design reached them. Sadly, that may only be a matter of time.

Aspect of Zagreus:
All the Infernal Arms show a fondness for the son ofHades and each have a form inspired by his essence. The noble gryphon adorning its frame makes light of the destructive power held beneath. This is a weapon that rarely, if ever,lets its own clip run empty.

Aspect of Hestia:
Before she was the Goddess of the hearth, she was first goddess of the flame. She never fired this weapon more often than she needed to and exercised rigid control of its power. Thus her version of this weapon shows similar restraint, reducing clip size to a single shot in exchange for a massive increase in its destructive capabilities.

Aspect of Eris:
Lady Strife herself once stole away with the instrument of war, so great is its destructive power. Her mischief was halted but not before her essence infused the weapon. This aspect craves destruction so much that it protects the wielder against its own explosive capabilities, as well as similar blasts of power.

Aspect of Lucifer:
An angel, one who served a God with no peer, was cast down into the underworld for his pride. He turned it to rage and took up arms, swearing to bring down the kingdom of light that had forsaken him. This terrifying but beautiful weapon emits, not hunks of leads, but a beam of brilliant, demonic light and balls of exploding flame."
111,,100,The Twin Fists of Malphon,Hades,Destruction,"Few would expect the Goddess of Life, stately Lady Demeter herself, to be the first to wield such a brutal and violent weapon. Yet her relentless, overwhelming assaults were much of the reason the Titans were defeated in the first place. The pair pulverized the undying TitanHyperion single, or more accurately two, handedly until nothing remained to toss into Tartarus. Since that time, no other living being has dared to wear Malphon for fear of the primal strength housed within these gauntlets.

Aspect of Zagreus:
All the Infernal Arms show a fondness for the son ofHades and each have a form inspired by his essence. Sensing the prince’s thirst for freedom, this aspect has adapted itself to his needs. No less lethal but their primal instincts are focused on getting the bearer out of the path of strikes than raw strength.

Aspect of Demeter:
The goddess of life used these terrifying gauntlets to end it instead. Such a natural fit is rarely seen. In her hands, the flurry of her blows rarely had a pause. Her strikes were quick and relentless yet lost none of their power. Some even claimed she could throw two punches in the same moment.

Aspect of Talos:
A giant bronzeman once walked this earth. Hephaestus used the twin fists for his hands so that he would have the strength to protect the isle of Crete. As the golem was slow in movement, the gauntlets granted him the ability to haul enemies closer instead.

Aspect of Gilgamesh:
Legends of this God-King, first of all stories committed to memory, are known even to us in this age. His wild friend often lent him his ferocity and thus Malphon now lends it to you. These weapons prize the destructive power of its claws and dangerous bursts of speed, drawing blood with the slightest of scratches and causing it to flow freely."
112,,100,"Coronacht, The Heart-Seeking Bow        ",Hades,Destruction,"First of all bows, Coronacht was initially held byHera alongside her husband in the war against the Titans. Since that age she has cast aside her warlike ways and the bow fell into many other hands. It ended the life of Achilles after being held by Chiron the Centaur. Since then it has continued to hunger for further bloodshed, eventually falling into the Underworld. Here it finds torment enough to satiate.

Aspect of Zagreus:
All the Infernal Arms show a fondness for the son ofHades and each have a form inspired by his essence. Its thirst for blood finds a willing partner in the Prince. Arrows released from its string have an uncanny accuracy when it comes to striking the vital points of foes.

Aspect of Hera:
Those who still rememberHera’s violent past have good reason to hesitate to approach her now. Terrifying, lethal, this aspect also serves as conduit for magic of all shades. Its arrows all but soak up spells its bearer casts, detonating them with destructive force when they find their target.

Aspect of Chiron:
Wisest of all the centaurs, Chiron advised many heroes in his time. Yet he did not hesitate to pick up a weapon to defend those around him. The tales depict his accuracy as unerring. This bow allows its wielder some of that same skill. Arrows fired from it will twist and bend in flight to find the target, not impossibly, but improbably.

Aspect of Rama:
Far to the east, midway down a road paved with silk, the seventh incarnation of a protector deity will one day hold this weapon in his hands. His marksmanship is only one of the qualities he will be known for. Those struck by its arrows will share a small portion of the suffering of others
around them."
113,,100,"Varatha, The Eternal Spear",Hades,Destruction,"Once wielded by Hades, Varatha was the thrusting might that tipped the battle in the last push to lock away the Titans. The lord of the Underworld used it for long after the battle ended. Eventually he traded it for a larger, more terrifying weapon that better suited his station. The Eternal Spear, never broken, was left to rust in the treasury of theHouse ofHades. Now it seeks a new owner and eagerly reaches for any who once wielded a spear with the air of an old friend.

Aspect of Zagreus:
All the Infernal Arms show a fondness for the son ofHades and each have a form inspired by his essence. Prizing technique over raw strength, this Aspect promises speed in both movement and thrusting motions. Strangely, it also seems to strike foes further away than its length suggests.

Aspect of Hades:
Hades spent much time with this spear, imprinting it deeply with the hatred he had for those who spawned him. The fact that he discarded it for another weapon has only made it burn brighter. Those who are struck by this weapon feel the sting of its edge more fiercely with each successive swing.

Aspect of Achilles:                        
Though Achilles only touched this weapon briefly, so instant was Varatha’s desire to be held in battle by the greatest of the Greeks that this aspect was born. It houses a need for never ending battle, growing in strength the longer one spends rushing from one fight to the next.

Aspect of Guan Yu:
Halfway around the world, in a distant age, a crimson phoenix will take up Varatha and unify his people. Unmatched ferocity will be his hallmark and none will be able to stand before his charging forces. This aspect offers unrivalled strength to its bearer, even to a divine being, at the cost of slowly draining their vitality"
114,,100,"Aegis, The Shield of Chaos",Hades,Destruction,"Born of Chaos, the original creator of all, Aegis found its way into the hands of Zeus. In the war against the Titans he used it to defend his brother and sister divinities. The shield was shattered in the final push to drive the Titans into the lowest reaches of the Underworld. Destroyed, but not dead, the Shield of Chaos raged against its own demise.Now it has been reconstituted using the blood of the Titans. No longer a manner of defense, Aegis all but hungers for its chance to harm.

Aspect of Zagreus:
All the Infernal Arms show a fondness for the son of Hades and each have a form inspired by his essence. It’s gnashing mouth shudders and shifts at times, as if attempting to let loose its rage upon the world. Few would doubt its capacity for destruction.

Aspect of Zeus:
The God of Gods used this aspect of Aegis in the war against the Titans. Infused with his lightning, his rage, and his strength, it eagerly awaits the moment it can unleash all three in battle once again. When held aloft, one can call down bolts of Zeus upon foes both near and far.

Aspect of Chaos:
It existed when all sprang from the primordial depths. It watches for its creator who can only do the same with all it made. When thrown, this shield splits and multiplies, seeking out any foes it can spy with its massive eye.

Aspect of Beowulf:
Born in an age that does not exist yet and possibly never will, this shield was borne by the first hero a different people revered. How or why it has appeared here only Chaos knows. This heavy shield is capable of absorbing magical energy from its bearer to sheathe itself In fire."
115,,100,"Stygius, The Stygian Blade",Hades,Destruction,"Broken and shattered after the war with the Titans, this finest of swords was reborn from its crumbled existence by the combined effort of Zagreus and Achillies. It is a blade that revels in battle and gives off a sense of eagerness for blood no matter what form it takes. Impossibly light, eternally sharp, this sword leaves no question as to how the Titans were defeated.

Aspect of Zagreus;
All the Infernal Arms show a fondness for the son of Hades and each have a form inspired by his essence. This blade seems incapable of remaining idle for any length of time, spurring its wielder into swinging and moving faster and faster the longer a fight drags on.

Aspect of Poseidon:
The original owner of the Stygian Blade enjoyed making a splash with his power even before he ruled the seas. This sword is saturated with the magical might he focused through it in his battles against the titans. Its wielder can draw on that energy themselves to enhance their magic.

Aspect of Nemesis:
Nyx’s daughter once held the Stygian Blade. She punished the wicked and those filled with hubris in a zeal that few others were ever able to match. Her sword shares a similar lust for violence, always seeming to find the weakest points in an opponent’s armor.

Aspect of Arthur:
Far in the future, a great king will use the Stygian Blade to unite his country and bring about a peace rarely seen in that era. How or why this aspect of the blade has awoken so early is a mystery to even the greatest of gods. It’s swings are wide and powerful, but slow, and it can generate an aura of protection around it’s bearer for a short time."
116,,100,Yoichi’s Bow,Final Fantasy II,Destruction,"A bow with a draw you will struggle with, but when used in battle against a hated foe, it empowers you, it draw feels weightless but retains its power."
117,,100,Rune Axe ,Final Fantasy II,Destruction,"A gold-colored axe with runes inscribed upon it, fog emanating from it. The more magical the target, the more damage it will deal to them."
118,,100,Gungnir,Final Fantasy II,Destruction,"A spear wielded by several might warlords. Wielding this increases your strength and speed, letting you move quicker and strike harder."
119,,100,Masamune,Final Fantasy II,Destruction,"A katana unparalleled in both sharpness and speed. Simply holding the blade increases your attacking speed by a great deal, letting you move like the wind for brief periods."
120,,100,Sword,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"It is only through a blessing from the Winds that this is even a ranged weapon, much less a 'gun.' The blessing makes it so that slashes from the weapon travel a short distance, though the blessing runs out of steam rather quickly. A spin attack will restore the power of the blessing to allow more slashes to be launched forward."
121,,100,Crossbow,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"This crossbow can charge its shots to increase damage and pierce though targets. It has high base damage and can fire quickly, through given its nature it takes a while to reload and can only have a single bolt loaded at a time."
122,,100,Bow,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"While it may at first appear impractical, the arrows that are fired by this bow will magically return to the quiver when called. They return rather violently, being capable of causing additional injuries on the return trip. In terms of capabilities, it has above average damage, below average fire rate, and a small number of arrows."
123,,100,Returnfire,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"This upgrade wasn't originally meant for fighting hordes, instead was for setting up traps. While arrows become ethereal when fired and passing through foes, they are far stronger when called to return. While only hitting once the wounds they inflict are more grievous than being hit three times.

Requires Bow to Purchase "
124,,100,Elemental Blessing,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"Can be chosen up to four times, purchases past the first are not discounted Choose one of the Elemental Powers: Flame, Wind, Lightning, or Frost. You have either received its blessing or studied it to master its power. At its base, this gives you the ability to call forth minor effects of the element, such as a fireball, a bolt of lightning, or a shard of ice. With time and effort, your power will grow, making these effects more powerful, eventually even being able to throw waves of fire, summon arcing lightning, or freeze foes solid. 

Additional purchases allow you to select another Elemental Power to gain this perk for.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
125,,100,Explosive Apples,Disney’s Aladdin,Destruction,"You have a bag full of bright red apples, with a small length of stalk poking out. When You eat them, they're sweet and delicious, absolutely wonderful apples. But snap the stalk with a thumb and throw them,and they explode with some considerable power. One apple is enough to kill a man. You have 99 in the bag,and it refills every day."
126,,100,Stormhawk Axe,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction,"Battle axe designed to resemble a hawk, with its wings comprising the blade. Signature weapon of warriors who strive to remain one with the storm, despite being so far from their place of birth. Their hearts are proud, and thereby easily undone. The wing-blade is imbued with lightning and can be swung around to create a tempestuous lightning storm."
127,,100,Frozen Needle,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction,"A razor-thin piercing blade of ice that was forged by Iji, the Carian Royal Blacksmith. It can inflict frost damage upon struck enemies, and launch its blade with a strong attack. If it is shattered or melted, the blade will immediately regenerate."
128,,100,Fireball!(Charged),Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Destruction,"For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you can now ‘charge’ this move, by holding it in place for a few moments before releasing it. A charged attack is far more powerful than normal, and is capable of launching other Fighters. You are able to ‘bank’ a charged attack, causing a fully charged, but not released projectile to disappear. The next time you attempt a normal fireball, you will instead perform the charged version, without any delay.

Requires Fireball! to Purchase"
129,,100,Fireball!(Charged Plus) ,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Destruction,"For yet another 100cp (undiscounted), an even more powerful version of your projectile attack becomes available. This attack, similar in scope to Mario Finale, covers a wide range and a very long distance. Not only is it highly damaging, but it also has a powerful pushing property to it. Even if someone is capable of guarding against it, they may still find themselves pushed far away from you. Performing this version of your attack is exhausting, and pulling it off more than once in a fight is probably beyond you.

Requires Fireball!(Charged) to Purchase"
130,,100,Golden Hammer,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Destruction,"For an additional 100cp (undiscounted) you instead get access to the Golden Hammer. This hammer has a few differences. It spawns on top of a small podium, delaying its arrival by a second. Although the duration of the continual swinging is the same, the actual speed of the swing is noticeably faster. Instead of the Headless Hammer, the Golden Hammer has a one in eight chance to be a Golden Squeaky Hammer, which deals no damage and instead produces a squeaking noise on a hit. As there is no head lying around to be thrown, this backfire is marginally safer for the wielder. 

As this purchase is merely for access to Hammers or Golden Hammers, not the hammers themselves, you may not import any similar item into this option.

Requires Hammer to Purchase"
131,,100,Erdsteel Dagger ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction,"An erdsteel dagger with a grass crest engraved upon its blade. Carried by the Erdtree royalty for self-defense in times of peace. Though forged to a high standard, the weapon is difficult to wield. The power of its strikes also scales with one’s faith."
132,,100,Magic Sword,Disney Princess,Destruction,"Standard issue sword blessed by holy magic. Will always follow the most direct path to the target when thrown, but it can be blocked."
133,,100,Ring of the Sun's Firstborn,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction,"Lord Gwyn's firstborn, who inherited the sunlight, once wore this ancient ring. Lord Gwyn's firstborn was a god of war, but his foolishness led to a loss of the annals, and rescinding of his deific status. Today, even his name is not known, but wearing this will see all of your offense focused miracles and holy abilities improved in potency."
134,,100,Draconic Breath,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction,"One of the easiest and most common displays of a dragon’s power is through their ability to exhale a torrent of flame. So it is that one of the first steps in the process of dragonification is to gain the ability to breathe fire yourself. As an added bonus, you will find your mouth exceptionally resistant to heat, as well as handling spicy foods much easier."
135,,100,Yumie,Hellsing,Destruction,"In this dark world, it can get so very lonely.The demons circle, laughing in the night, and your friends fall one by one to their deaths. But there’s no need for you to be alone at the end nor to ever feel like you are without someone there watching out for you. In the depths of your mind lies another you, a much deadlier version of what you are now. They’re far from hostile or unhappy with your current situation. It’s not impossible to communicate with them within your mind if you reach out. They seem satisfied as long as you are safe, happy and successfully achieving your goals. If these conditions aren’t met, they’ll start to become more and more insistent on you letting them out to fix things. Or just to play.

It’s up to you if you let this happen, they can’t force the issue. But whatever your skills or abilities happen to be, they somehow manage to be far more dangerous and deadly than you in applying them. It might be their complete lack of fear or hesitation, the endless bloodthirst they exert in a moment or just simply being that much better at killing things than you. They’re quite creative about it too, so the squeamish might find it worth shying away from what your inner self inflicts on others. Once they’re all finished up, or you insist too strongly for them to ignore, they’ll let you take back control. They have your best interests in mind, they’re just very energetic in how they bring those interests about."
136,,100,Agent of the Vatican,Hellsing,Destruction,"The glories of the Holy Spirit have been with you since you were young, a standout among the rabble that has the fortitude and faith to bring war on the enemies of good Christians. Iscariot noticed this and brought you into the fold. While combat training will come later, you are still an agent of the Vatican through this, an ordained member of the clergy in some fashion. You have a comprehensive knowledge of both the public and private doctrines of your Church, as well as significant information on the many threats you face. The ways to use various holy symbols and purifying tools against monsters, such as effective use of holy water or the cross, comes along with the natural faith to somewhat ward off the unholy. It won’t stop the attacks of a vampiric menace but it may allow your blows to harm it more than before. "
137,,100,Spanish Splinter ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Destruction,A Spanish splinter is when you get a splinter that digs underneath the nail in your finger. It is said to be one of the single most painful things that you can experience. Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws employ a similar tactic against giant enemies to great effect. By studying their strategies you have figured out how to wound anyone and deal critical damage to them. At the very least these injuries will be debilitating and in the worst cases they can be outright crippling. Even a tower giant wearing armor could be wounded by an ordinary man with this technique. Just keep in mind that you still might have difficulty actually pulling your attack off in the first place.
138,,100,Rosmarinus,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction,"A special weapon used by the Choir, high-ranking members of the Healing Church. Sprays a cloud of sacred mist, damaging the enemies with its arcane energies in a similar fashion to flame. Arias are heard wherever sacred mist is seen, proving that the mist is a heavenly blessing. ""Oh, fair maiden, why is it that you weep?"""
139,,100,Lightning,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Destruction,"Much more common now than it was seventy years ago, this power allows firebenders to produce lightning by separating positive and negative energies internally, before directing them up through the arm and out the fingertips. Generating lightning requires peace of mind and control over one’s emotions, however this can be overcome if a firebender is particularly skilled. In addition to lightning generation you’ll also be granted the ability to redirect lightning.

Requires Bender(Fire) to Purchase"
140,,100,Hellfire Chain,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Destruction,"The fires of the damned are a powerful force, as those who have been burned by it can testify. But fire is often uncontrolled, wild, and untamed as a force. That is why it needs guidance, to be chained and directed. Sometimes literally, as this tempered metal chain will show. When those of a fiery or infernal nature hold this chain, they can channel abilities of those natures through it to augment their strikes and the force that hits their enemies. Let the motherfucker burn!"
141,,100,Hipshot,Marvel 2099,Destruction,"You are able to psychically generate ammunition for any weapon you are able to carry and fire unassisted or without mounting it on the ground or a vehicle. The ammunition is made of telekinetic force instead of traditional matter so won’t melt or easily deform, though it will only last until they are stopped and will only be a basic kinetic projectile without explosives or other special properties."
142,,100,Clarion,Marvel 2099,Destruction,"You possess the ability to turn ambient sound and noise into energy you can release as destructive blasts. A speaker playing music could allow you to blast someone with enough force to stun them for some time, or the din of a loud battle could give you enough power to destroy a small civilian vehicle, or blast a man in battle armor. As things get louder you can theoretically get greater power, though reaching the destructive power of Hands That Ravage will be very difficult for you."
143,,100,Cry ,Amalgam Comics,Destruction,"You can make a fearsome noise, a sonic scream like Canary, which is a devastating short-range weapon."
144,,100,Combat Magus,Fate,Destruction,"You aren't like the squishy mages behind their desks, you've been born and raised fighting. You have a great skill for adapting magecraft to combat situations, something that comes naturally to you, and you possess the equivalent of 5 years of experience in any one mundane martial art."
145,,100,Reaper Shroud ,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A disturbing mask paired with a dark mantle and necklace of bones; enhances damage and offers a slight increase in the odds of a critical strike, and boosts accuracy greatly against opponents that are a little more than half dead."
146,,100,Beast Slayer’s Ring,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,A golden ring with rubies inlaid into a wolf’s head; when worn the wearer does increased damage to beasts of all types. 
147,,100,Hell’s Hairpin,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,A hairpin depicting a goat- or perhaps a devil. When worn in the dark it boost accuracy and grants a substantial increase to the odds of doing a critical attack. 
148,,100,Man Slayer’s Ring,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"An intricately designed ring depicting a miniature sword, the band studded with tiny skulls; when worn the wearer does much more damage against human foes."
149,,100,Eldritch Slayer’s Ring,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A ring set with a pink ruby, it enhances the damage one deals against eldritch and alien targets greatly. "
150,,100,Unholy Slayer’s Ring,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"Although disturbing in appearance, this metal ring greatly increases the damage one does against the unholy, making it a potent weapon against darkness."
151,,100,Sun Ring,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A memento of the Light; this ring, inset with a golden gem, increases the strength and accuracy of one’s sword arm in the light- making it an ideal accessory for the religious. "
152,,100,Sight Prey,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"“Death waits for the slightest lapse in concentration.” Hunters of men and beast are more alike than they may first seem, though their methodologies may differ. Track them down, and bring them down with precision and power. You may have more of the former rather than the latter, but being able to swing a weapon and not miss even when your enemy tries to evade is just as valuable as being able to land a shot from a bow or rifle. You take it a step further than most, being a champion marksman (or markswoman). It may be harder to hit a target in the heat of battle against the forces of evil than a stationary target, but a moment of clarity and a little luck may give you the perfect shot. As a bonus, your nature as a hunter of man or beast has given your attacks especially effective against one of the two."
153,,100,Gaze of the Abyss ,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"“The abyss returns even the boldest gaze.” It is said that when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back. But you will not be the first to blink. Your mind is made of sterner stuff, and fear and panic has less sway- even eldritch forces will not distort your sanity as it would the uninitiated. Your own spells and blows also seem to cut especially well against eldritch forces, perhaps as a consequence of your familiarity with them. But be wary; a death of a thousand cracks in the mind can kill just as easily as a thousand cuts to the flesh."
154,,100,Crusade,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"“Behold- righteousness and zealotry- gleaming in the morning sun.” There are few things that can be said about the Light; that it is anathema to the wandering dead is one of them. Although not necessarily opposed to the eldritch- which may have some disturbing theological implications if one thinks about it- the Light does indeed scour the clattering bones and rotting flesh of the undead and the unholy beyond what ordinary swings of a weapon should accomplish. As one of its champions, you will find yourself capable of imbuing your attacks with its power to bring the Light’s judgement to forgotten crypts and the lairs of necromancers. Furthermore the rigors of long campaigns has strengthened your body, giving some small protection against blade, arrow, and other physical methods of spilling blood."
155,,100,Odette,Bayonetta ,Destruction,"Why wait for winter to skate around and feel the wonders of such elegant movement? An unusual set of ice skates that can be equipped to the feet, this bladed footwear allows you to essentially 'skate' across surfaces or even lava, while increasing your speed. Furthermore, it grants access to ice magic and attacks for all your melee kicks which should help if you're into that."
156,,100,Nothingness,Bayonetta ,Destruction,"Pick a card, any card! It's only going to end in fun and pain no matter what, after all... this enchanted deck of throwing cards is as deadly as it is ornate. Gilded with the emblem of Aesir himself, these cards not only can hold a small charge of energy but will also regenerate any spent cards a few moments later. Enemies who are killed with these cards will dissolve into golden dust as well... what you'll do with the dust is your problem."
157,,100,Scarborough Fair,Bayonetta ,Destruction,"When you need to be unorthodox, look no further. A quartet of large caliber, ornate pistols that can be attached to the feet and the wrists, yet can be detached upon the whim of the user. They can channel the magic of the user, and somehow they're capable of understanding when a shot needs to be fired, and so the wielder can even lift their legs and fire the gun without needing to reach down. Don't ask me how, it's hilarious watching you ponder it."
158,,100,Holy Glaive,Bayonetta ,Destruction,"The ray of a sun can be beautiful, my friend. However, just because something is beautiful doesn't mean it isn't dangerous. This double bladed staff is as deadly as it is elegant, being unnaturally sharp and capable of channeling the magic of its user. It can even split apart and be used as two weapons, further increasing the attack capabilities available."
159,,100,Blood is Flame,Ragna Crimson,Destruction,"A very straightforward power, and the magic commonly held by all the Seija. It is the power to create large blasts of fire. As simply as it sounds, this power as its base can be used to demolish entire buildings and melt armored warriors in seconds.

More advanced users of this power, such as a powerful Seija, may use it to concentrate their flames into more destructive fire cannons."
160,,100,Keep It Clean ,Generic Alchemist ,Destruction,"When any bit of contamination can have drastic results in the final product of alchemy, usually disastrously so, it pays to make sure your equipment and workspace is clean and sanitized. You are able to render a surface or object completely clean and sterile with a touch. You can use this to clean yourself as well, leaving you cleaner than if you had taken a shower. This also neutralizes any odors lingering on your body."
161,,100,Magic Bolt,League of Legends,Destruction,"Why dirty your hands with physical combat, when this alternative works just as well? You're capable of conjuring bolts of magic in your hands to fire at your enemies. Extremely easy to use, these bolts of magic hit just about as hard as a good solid punch, and have a maximum range of around five meters. You can only throw one every second or so, but so long as you keep your opponent at a distance you won't ever have to worry about busting your knuckles ever again."
162,,100,Sword of Orynth,A Throne of Glass,Destruction,"You now possess a copy of the Sword of Orynth, the ancestral blade of the Terrasen dynasty. This is a magically enchanted blade, to such an extent that even when magic was turned off across the continent the power in this blade was maintained. This blade is indestructible and supernaturally sharp; it also acts as a perfect channel for its bearer’s powers."
163,,100,King’s Cutlass,A Throne of Glass,Destruction,"You now own a master crafted sword with a pommel in the shape of a sea dragon. This sword was forged with magic, and is not only ever sharp with the edge never dulling by time or combat, but has been seemingly touched by the god of the sea. Should it ever be dropped in water the cutlass will float even if it should sink."
164,,100,Earthfang,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"You are capable of calling forth the earth’s rage more directly than the Earthspirit, expending a minor portion of mana in order to use a purely elemental burst of damaging magic based on the current terrain, around the level of the first tier of each Element’s magic."
165,,100,Knife Throwing Act,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"It’s a useful trick, and diversity of spectacle is always welcome for a Trickster’s repertoire. You are well trained with daggers, even capable of throwing them as pinpoint accurate projectiles - able to use them with such effectiveness that you have a high chance of critically hitting with them."
166,,100,Nothing Up my Sleeve,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"The first secret of being a trickster - good magicians borrow, great artists steal. In your case, you know how to make your enemy’s strength your own. Your attacks have a high chance of having a form of mana leeching, sapping the victims of their mana and restoring your own mana by that amount."
167,,100,Condemnation,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"Knowing the stories of eld has also taught you how to curse people out with the weight of magic behind it. You are capable of expending mana while laying into someone, the mental attack having a high chance of inflicting the Despair and Revulsion status effects, and a low chance of inflicting the Doomed status effect."
168,,100,Blade Test,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"You are capable of striking much harder while you’re undetected - dealing vastly more damage with your melee strikes against an unsuspecting target. If they’re weak enough, this could even defeat them before they realize a fight has occurred."
169,,100,Psychoblade,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"By dipping your weapon into the Rift temporarily, you are capable of wreathing your weapon in Psychic energy, granting it magical properties without any elemental damage. This energy allows it to penetrate physical defenses easily, ignoring armor with quite a bit of effectiveness."
170,,100,Verblade,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"In order to further iterate on the ancient ways, you must be willing to diverge from them. You are highly athletic, and capable of interweaving your spell-crafting with your melee combat styles to enhance the effects of both."
171,,100,Blood-soaked Knuckles,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"The power of blood, both yours and the enemy’s, enhances your natural weapons. Your unarmed attacks do a great amount of damage while you are “bloodied”, or damaged to approximately half of your peak vitality, and can overcome magical defenses in the bargain."
172,,100,Bloodlust,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"By harnessing the power of blood sacrifice, you can expend a significant amount of your vitality to enter a Bloodlust state, a form of Berserk that amplifies your strength immensely. Taking any damage while in Bloodlust grants you the Courage status effect, increasing your damage done with physical attacks even further. "
173,,100,For the Grace of the Creator,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"Your weapon can be infused with Light, allowing you to inflict the Silence and Sleep status effects on your foes with your strikes. These effects have a growing chance of being inflicted with each successive strike. In addition, as you take damage, you gather Darkness into your blade. After losing half of your vitality during the course of the battle, your blade is fully enshrouded, dealing Dark-type damage as well as inflicting the Poison and Blindness status effects. This stacks with the former ability, allowing a blade to inflict both Light and Dark damage."
174,,100,Dive Kick,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction,"A signature technique of the Cavalier, you can fly high into the air with a single leap, propelling yourself into the air and coming down with a mighty force, channeling the kinetic force of the fall directly into your foe. In addition, you take no fall damage from this leap."
175,,100,Ghost Dust,The Dresden Files,Destruction,"Primarily consisting of depleted uranium, cold iron, basil, and dung, this pouch full of dust weighs maybe a pound in the real world, and at least thirty to forty pounds in the Nevernever. It's made to be realer than real, and if thrown into an incorporeal critter, will give them the same properties. It'll also cause them a hell of a lot of pain, and considering how much iron's in it, you can expect the same reaction from any Faeries you hit with it as well. The pouch never quite runs empty, and if you leave it sitting for a full day without making use of it, you'll find it full to the lip."
176,,100,Coming of Age Present ,Frozen,Destruction,"Ah, what a fine blade you have there. A gift from your father, though he might have only done it grudgingly. It’s a very sharp, very sturdy and quite fancy thing, not the sort a commoner runs around with. You could definitely sell it for a fair sum but if you do choose to use it in combat, you’ll find the blade will never break or shatter no matter what you hit with it. It might just bounce off your target but at least you’ll be able to turn around and stab the next target without scrabbling around for a new weapon."
177,,100,"""Executioner Greatsword""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Greatsword of a debauched executioner used for beheadings."" A greatsword whose weight and shape makes it more of a bludgeon than a cutting weapon, though when wielded with great strength it is capable of cutting in a similar fashion to a guillotine. This sword retains a keen memory of its executioner’s duty, and absorbs a slight amount of magical energy from each defeated foe."
178,,100,"""Rose of Ariandel""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A flail used by the bulbous Father of the Painted World to shred his own skin, producing blood to appease the flame. Both a weapon and a miracle catalyst. Ariandel, being the restorer of the Painted World, knew that it was painted with blood, and only blood could protect the secret."" With a design based off of the Cat o’ Nine Tails, its clear this is a tool for punishment rather than something created as a weapon. If used as one it will be hard to parry thanks to the lashing cords, though overall damage will remain low since riposting is impossible to pull off as well. It’s also unremarkable as a catalyst, though it does possess one ability of note- is used to flail oneself the Rose will trigger a spiritual awakening, temporarily boosting the strength of miracles at the cost of blood to the user- just as the good Father used the rose himself."
179,,100,"""Storyteller's Staff"" ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Staff of a heretic storyteller who shares tales of the Painted World to forlorn souls. The storytellers, too, are wretched beings with no place to go. Their bodies, souls, and even their staves are all tainted through and through."" Although it is a fine staff for casting Sorcery, it also has a secondary ""very"" notable ability. By feeding the parasites your spiritual energy, they'll expel a purple cloud of poison from the top of the staff. This poison is unique as the absolute most lethal in these lands, highly dangerous for all manner of enemies from undead to drakes."
180,,100,"""Millwood Greatbow""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Greatbow crafted with black oak and wielded by Millwood Knights. Only specialized great arrows can be fired from the bow. It is said that the Millwood Knights used these to face their sworn enemy, the Abyss Dragon."" Fueling the massive bow with the power of your soul and a simple prayer will infuse the next arrow shot with great power. When the arrow buries itself in the ground, the ground will rumble and shake before exploding in a shower of dirt and rock, blowing nearby enemies away."
181,,100,"""Gargoyle Flame Spear""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Stone torch spear wielded by gargoyles of the Profaned Capital. The Profaned Flame, which never goes out, imbues this weapon with a fire attack."" Resembling a great lance with a burning, lantern-like core it paints an intimidating image. Fueling the spear's flame with your soul will make it explosive, volatile, causing the very next strike you to deliver with the spear to be joined with a dangerous, fiery boom. As with the Gargoyle Flame Hammer, the flames of this weapon are empowered by the same forces that strengthen Pyromancy."
182,,100,"""Quakestone Hammer""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A Stonehammer wielded by the Millwood Knights, with a head of naturally-formed stone. The Knights of Millwood would fight hand-in-hand with the earth itself, and this weapon, among the oldest in Millwood, is symbolic of that relationship."" Bury the weapon in the ground with a mighty slam while fueling it with your soul, and the upheaval will be infused with an explosive shockwave that throws surrounding enemies up into the air. The head of the weapon will also fly up faster from the explosive burst, becoming more dangerous for anything in the way."
183,,100,"""Gargoyle Flame Hammer""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Stone torch hammer wielded by gargoyles of the Profaned Capital. The Profaned Flame, which never goes out, imbues this weapon with a fire attack."" By stimulating the hulking weapon with your soul, you can project a dangerous stream of flames. The fire burning within this weapon is empowered by the same forces that strengthen Pyromancy. (The power of your mind, and the strength of your faith.)"
184,,100,"""Black Knight Greataxe""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Greataxe of the black knights who wander the lands, used to face Chaos Demons."" The huge, heavy axe can cause more serious wounds against demons compared to similar weapons. Even by itself against non-demonic enemies it's a force to be reckoned with, in the hands of those who can swing it anyways."
185,,100,"""Earth Seeker""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""This large twin-bladed axe forged with bronze is a ceremonial weapon normally used in sacred rites. Millwood is a land of primitive earth worship where chieftain knights served as high priests."" This great, heavy axe can be thrust into the ground while being fueled by your soul to trigger tremors and earthen explosions around you that can throw enemies up and around, pummeling with large stones at the same time."
186,,100,"""Eleonora""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A strange weapon found among malformed inhabitants of the Profaned Capital. The Profaned Flame was triggered by the curse of these women, relatives of a certain oracle, but despite their culpability, they went on living, without any cares."" You may stimulate this weapon with the energy of your soul while waving it above your head to release the sound of an ominous bell. This infuses the weapon with a warping blade that causes jagged, lacerating wounds and recovers a bit of your damage with every attack. The ""buff"" lasts half a minute, plenty of time to make use of it."
187,,100,"""Bloodlust"" ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Katana of the old Mound-maker. The Mound-maker piled sacrifices upon the altar, but became the final offering himself, leaving this katana as a gift for his dear family."" Appearing to be made of bone, this weapon holds a dark power. Should the wielder of this weapon injure themselves and bathe it in their blood will temporarily grant it uncanny sharpness, making it far more dangerous than usual."
188,,100,"""Crescent Moon Sword"" ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Ringfinger Leonhard's weapon of choice, a type of shotel imbued with the power of the moon. Leonhard set out on a journey of rebirth, but decided instead to serve the goddess as a knight, and inherited this weapon."" An odd weapon infused with magic, its unique shape makes blocking it with a shield difficult. If the stimulated using the energy of your soul, you can project crescent blades of magic with it."
189,,100,"""Pontiff Knight Curved Sword""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Curved sword wielded by the Pontiff’s knights, frigid spirits that linger in Irithyll. The large blade appears to be eaten away by insects, making it lightweight but also brittle."" When stimulated with the energy of your soul, it will temporarily be infused with the power of cold. The first slash after this power has been infused into the weapon releases a large blade of ice."
190,,100,"""Black Knight Sword""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Greatsword wielded by the Black Knights who wander the lands. Designed to face chaos demons. The Black Knights constantly faced foes larger than themselves, and this sword's unique attack greatly reduces enemy poise."" You may stimulate the sword with the power of your soul while raising it into the air, granting you a few seconds where it's far harder to halt your advance or attack. The sword also hurts demons more than similar weapons."
191,,100,"""Hollowslayer Greatsword""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"Greatsword used for a lifetime by a masked knight. Harbors the fears that lurk within the mind of Hollows, and is particularly effective against them. Bestowed to a proper Mirrah knight long ago."" As above, the weapon is a glaring weakness for all hollow-kind, dealing significantly more damage against them compared to similar weapons. It remains an excellent standalone weapon outside of this ability too."
192,,100,"""Valorheart""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Weapon once wielded by the Champion of the Undead Match. A special paired set consisting of a broad sword and a lion shield. The champion fought on, without rest, until he lost his mind. In the end, only his page and a lone wolf stayed at his side."" In addition to being a vicious weapon combo, the shield bares a special ability. When stimulated with your soul, you can empower the next shield thrust with the roar of a lion, throwing vulnerable enemies struck by the bashing attack flying backwards."
193,,100,"""Gotthard Twinswords""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""The hunters known as the King's Black Hands wielded paired weapons. These belonged to Gotthard, who fled the castle. Gotthard rose quickly through the knighthood, no surprise to those who have witnessed his swordsmanship."" A powerful pair of swords whose true potential reveals itself only when they're dual-wielded."
194,,100,"""Scholar's Candlestick""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A candlestick covered in ivory scales once used by the Scholars of the Great Archives. This served as their guiding light, as well as a tool of self-restraint. Even today, wielders of this weapon benefit from the resulting sorcery-strengthening properties."" While the dagger itself doesn't make an amazing weapon, it has several special abilities. When stimulated with the power of your soul, it can provide enough light to illuminate a room. It also empowers the wielder's Sorcery as long as it’s held."
195,,100,"""Winged Spear""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A long-hilted spear with winged lugs. Long reach, and can be used with a shield up. Spear attacks are centered on thrusting, but can inflict high damage when timed with the end of an enemy’s swing."" A simple, yet efficient weapon, the winged spear isn’t anything special on its own other than being a practical, light-weight weapon for nearly anyone. The spear shines when infused, however, and scales well with strength, dexterity, faith, and intelligence depending on how it is upgraded, making for an excellent main weapon for honest folk and rotten clerics alike."
196,,100,"""Follower Javelin""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Light spear wielded by the Farron Followers. Balanced to allow for throwing. The Followers attack in groups, shielding themselves, and thrusting their spears at their foes. On a final command, they hurl their spears at their fallen foe, to give the retired warrior an honorable send-off. "" A basic weapon with decent scaling in magic when infused, the Follower Javelin wields some strange magic that enables its wielder to create a temporary, illusory copy of itself, enabling the wielder to emulate the funeral practice of the Followers."
197,,100,"""Follower Torch"" ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""An offensive weapon used by the Farron Followers. Provides light and doubles as a weapon. Some forms of the Abyss manifest as pus within the body, treated from ancient 
times with fire."" A surprisingly good weapon, though it may serve better as torch for those with greater than average strength or skill. Sturdy enough to be swung like a club, the torch never seems to go out unless it is set aside or dipped in water, and is easily relighted even then. It comes with a small, refilling pot of oil that can be held in one’s mouth and spat across the torch to breathe flame in a front-sweeping motion, which can also be used to relight the torch."
198,,100,"""Saint Bident""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A silver bident decorated by a holy symbol, formerly wielded by Saint Klimt. He discarded this weapon, that draws upon one's faith, on the day that he put his own faith behind him."" An ornate weapon, though not the strongest around. It becomes a bit stronger with the wielder's belief in it."
199,,100,"""Knight Slayer's Ring""  ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Ring of the savage Tsorig, more commonly known as the Knight Slayer. Long ago, Tsorig engaged the guardians of an ancient city in a bloody confrontation, and returned with their rings as his prize, still frozen on their dismembered fingers."" Causes the shock of your attacks to dig and reverberate a bit more deeply, causing enemies to tire a bit quicker when attempting to guard against you."
200,,100,"""Pontiff Knight Great Scythe""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"“Great scythe wielded by the Pontiff's knights, frigid spirits that linger in Irithyll. The large blade appears to be eaten away by insects, making it lightweight but brittle.” Can be stimulated with the power of the wielder’s soul, imbuing it with cold for a short time. When this is done, the wielder releases a freezing shockwave around them."
201,,100,"""Morion Blade""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A twisted sword resembling the towers of Londor's Sable Church. Eight branching blades and thorns induce bleeding. The church's blessing makes the weapon revel in the agony of its owner."" The barbed sword can easily tug, pull and rend at flesh to make nasty wounds. Additionally, the dark power it carries empowers the one with it on their person when they're in a state of near death, making all forms of attack more dangerous. Has less use when neither of these abilities can come into play."
202,,100,"""Aquamarine Dagger"" ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A dagger fitted with aquamarine crystal. Engraved with a prayer in the old tongue to ward off incident. Perhaps it was a parting gift given to one sent off on great travels. "" A short straight dagger that can be infused with magical energy to create a temporary blue crystal blade that extends from the hilt to increase the reach of the dagger, making it comparable in length to a straight sword. The dagger in both forms is quick and deals inherent magical damage, making it a good weapon for sorcerers looking for a weapon to fall back on or warriors looking to trip up their opponents with a weapon of variable size."
203,,100,"""Boulder Heave""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"As the chaos flame faded out of existence, so too did the inner fire of many demons, leaving their semi-molten bodies to cool and harden. In this state, some found a way to use it. This perk allows you to generate and mold a pebble in your mouth, that, when spit out will rapidly grow in size into a small boulder. The boulder behaves like a normal stone for its size and keeps the momentum from being spit out, becoming a frightening projectile. While the stone is heavy and dense, it's also brittle. That being said, it's extremely dangerous when allowed to fall on someone from above."
204,,100,"""Leverage""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"The Abyss Watchers confound enemies with movements and techniques reminiscent wolves hunting and cornering prey. Through specialized equipment and leveraging their own strength, they perform disorienting flips and spins to attack and evade at once. By purchasing this perk, your joints are strengthened and you gain the ability to build your strength for a moment before committing to an action, increasing the force generated like a spring loaded trap. You also gain an affinity for abusing centrifugal force. These abilities allow you to more easily make use of techniques employed by the Abyss Watchers, using the weight of a large weapon to hurl your body around smoothly from one attack to the next. Using a wedge of some sort to aid you is recommended."
205,,100,“Darksword” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Once known as the blade wielded by the knights of the Four Kings, it is now just another infamous symbol of the Darkwraiths. It hosts a wide, thick blade and spiked guard. Due to the weight and balance of the Darksword it takes both strength and skill to wield properly. Any Darkwraith who can still remember knows the strange techniques associated with it."
206,,100,“Sunlight Straight Sword”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A longsword with a bit more heft than the average one. It is of quite high quality, very well forged. It’s an easy to use and dependable weapon, though not quite as grand as its name suggest. Somewhat more receptive to miracles that can bless it than other swords."
207,,100,“Zweihander”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A gigantic, straight greatsword that you found plunged into the ground near your bonfire one day. The first half of the blade is blunt, allowing you to rest it on your shoulder. Although quite large and heavy, for those who can properly swing it, even a single clean hit can send an enemy flying. The craftsmanship on the simple blade is excellent."
208,,100,“Black Fire Bombs” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A small satchel filled with black fire bombs. Each bomb takes the form of a roped up black urn containing a greasy black powder, though you’ll likely never be inspecting them. Thrown without need of a fuse, when the brittle container fractures it triggers an intense, incendiary explosion. Anything that hates fires, despises being hit by one of these, truly dangerous."
209,,100,“Writhing Bile” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Not everything that gets banished is dangerous to the gods or committing some grave sin. Sometimes things are thrown into this Painted World for being. . .disgusting. Your lungs now swim with churning red bile. This doesn’t harm you, seeming not to do much more than make you cough most of the time. It’s very easy to spew the red bile out in absurdly copious quantities that shouldn’t fit inside of your chest though. The thick red bile is incredibly flammable, allowing you to light it with a torch to potentially ignite enemies or the ground. Alternatively, spewed slime will slowly grow animated and can slowly crawl across the ground, throw its weight around or pick up and swing things within its viscous body."
210,,100,“Duelist” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Those who walk the Path of the Dragon, require scales of the Eternal Dragons. With scales being a rarity, honorable combat over them is common among those who share the same goal. On purchase, you become more well suited to such challenges. Passively, you’ll gain a cooler head that can think clearing even during periods of action and intensity. Your hand to hand combat skills will also improve, making you well suited to brawls. It is when you engage in a contest, competition or duel however that your true talents shine. During any prearranged, mutually agreed upon form of contest or combat, you will actually become more capable of complex thought and action than outside of it. A definitive edge, no?"
211,,100,Kos Parasite,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Long ago, near a humble Fishing Hamlet, the carcass of the Great One called Kos washed up upon the coast. Its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. More resilient than it appears, when clutched in one’s fist it can imbue arcane energy to a punch.

Its true power may only be revealed under specific circumstances however. Able to ‘stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood,’ when used in conjunction with a specific rune, writhing tentacles and great, arcane power may be wielded. Should you desire this power, seek the Milkweed Rune.”"
212,,100,Beast Cutter,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A thick, iron cleaver with deep serrations meant for hacking and grinding through even the toughest of beasts and their leathery hides. Inelegant, and quite heavy, but very useful in the hands of an especially strong hunter. 

When transformed, the blade separates into sections connected by resilient wires, allowing it to be lashed like a heavy whip. Although functioning similarly to the Threaded Cane, its crude design make it a mid range option for more brutish hunters who can afford to exert the necessary force for its swings.”"
213,,100,Church Pick ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. The weapon takes the form of a large, ornate, bladed spike that can be used for vicious thrusting attacks or crushing swipes. 

Those who master the transformation process can fluidly extend the shaft and rotate the head in one, clean motion to transform it into a war pick; deadly and capable of puncturing the hide of beasts like a knife through frayed cloth with a good swing.” "
214,,100,Blacksky Eye,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A soft eye playing host to phantasms, and discovered by Byrgenwerth’s attempts to contact the arcane. Deep within the eye lies a vast stretch of dark sky that rumbles with an endless meteor storm. On use, one of these cosmic stones will soar out like a vicious cannonball. 

Requiring a single bullet’s worth of blood, the arcane meteor projected from the eye will deal considerable damage to those vulnerable to such things. As with the Augur of Ebrietas, the nature of those with a deeper connection to the eldritch will coax out even greater power.” "
215,,100,Kirkhammer,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A matching pair of Silver Sword and stone sheath that together make up the Kirkhammer. The sword is nicely balanced, light weight and easy to use. When locked into the sheath however, it transforms into a large, heavy hammer that overflows with style. It’s a very strong, versatile weapon overall, though the hammer form is a bit slow if you're lacking in strength.”"
216,,100,Church Hunter,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Once, hunters were able to operate under veil of night, using skill and discretion to go unnoticed. As beasts became bigger and stronger, and hunters became more publicly acceptable, new weapons were required to continue the hunt. 

Whether your preference lies in the Kirk Hammer, or Logarius’ Wheel, you will find much greater prowess in wielding larger, and frankly unwieldy weapons. Your advantages stem from a combination of greater muscles and control over your weapons, aiding in your slaughter of Yharnam’s brutes.”"
217,,100,Hunter’s Skill,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“There once was a time when hunters had training beyond a weapon in hand, and more guidance than a pointing finger directing them into the dark night. While you may not compare to those hunters of old, you do find yourself a step above those numerous, wandering mobs. 

Finesse finds its way into each movement, and you find yourself possessing agility competitive with that of the beasts. This helps you dance and dodge around the mindless foes you’ll often find in the hunt, evading their haphazard attacks long enough to cut them down. 

What it also helps with is wielding some of the trickier implements of the hunters, though there may be a mild learning curve at times. Never worry, there’s plenty of flat footed prey to practice on.”"
218,,100,Black Knife,Elden Ring,Destruction,"A ritual was performed on this curved, jagged-hilted dagger to imbue it with a portion of the stolen Rune of Death’s power. Only through it were Godwyn’s assassins able to strike down a divine being. The imbued power can be unleashed as a blade-like projectile, and both it and strikes delivered by the blade hasten mortality beyond the norm and continuously wreck harm on inflicted wounds for some time."
219,,100,Axe of Godfrey,Elden Ring,Destruction,"A colossal axe representing Godfrey’s nobility, the sheer strength alone needed to heft such a massive weapon makes of it a formidable force for those who can wield it. But beyond that, a measure of the first Elden Lord’s fighting spirit lives on within it-letting wielders let out a damaging battle cry that raises their might as a warrior. This purchase also comes with the Ash of War that represents Hoarah Loux’s Earthshaker, a technique that briefly grants the strength to slam the ground hard enough to violently shake it and unleash a powerful shockwave."
220,,100,Sanctum Repeating Crossbow,Dark Souls 2,Destruction,"“A curiosity from the kingdom lost to the toxic tide of the ancient dragon known as Sinh. This appears as a bulky crossbow with a magazine affixed to the top. It has the capacity to fire three bolts at a time, and reload itself. That all said, the string must still be manually drawn, preventing it from being called a real automatic weapon. From its exposure to the depths, or possibly from blessings applied by the old kingdom, it also has the ability to spray an inaccurate barrage of dark orbs from where bolts would fly.”"
221,,100,Shield Splitter,Dark Souls 2,Destruction,"“A member of the old guard, what once was recognizably human has aged strangely in undeath. It’s not all bad however, what once would have pained and hindered you before the curse now feels at home and light in hand. You have great skill with large weapons and equipment of all kinds. Whether that’s a sword longer than you are tall, or hammers with heads larger than your own. Along with your excellent proficiency with such heavy arms, you have the almost inhuman power to swing and carry such things like with all the fear inducing power they deserve to be wielded with.”"
222,,100,Morgott’s Cursed Sword ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"What madman could yearn for this, the warped blade in which Morgott recanted and sealed away his own accursed blood? A weapons suited to great finesse above all befitting it’s rapier-like shape, though it still benefits from twisted arcane insight. With skill and focus, a slice of cursed blood can be delivered followed by a trail of arcane flame."
223,,100,Hand of Malenia ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"A blade identical to the one built into Malenia’s prosthesis (and somehow touched by a similar magic), through consecration it is greatly resistant to the Scarlet Rot. Some have claimed to see wings of fierce determination when it is raised aloft, and whatever the truth when you wield it you feel lighter on your feet, faster, able to unleash a swift yet graceful array of slashes too quick for many to keep up with."
224,,100,Godslayer’s Greatsword,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Long ago, the Dusk-Eyed Queen commanded the Godslayers before her defeat at the hands of Maliketh. While the curved prongs of this greatsword may make it seem unwieldly, it is a fine weapon capable of channelling a fraction of the queen’s godslaying black flame which even in diminished state continuously depletes the health of those it strikes. Great faith by the wielder enhances this weapon’s deadliness, as well as the strength and dexterity typical for it."
225,,100,Lion Greatbow,Elden Ring,Destruction,"This is a rare treasure indeed-one identical to the one once wielded by General Radahn himself. Imbued with his gravitational magics, a flurry of arrows fired into the sky will rain down on foes with a meteoric impact. This comes with several crates of great arrows that allow the bow to exhibit it’s true worth as a weapon-each of which is, in fact, the many spears Radahn was stabbed with by the Cleanrot Knights. Perhaps inadvertently imbuing them as well with a fragment of his power."
226,,100,Loretta’s War Sickle ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"This intricately crafted silver war sickle is a perfect match for the one wielded by a certain knight of the Haligtree. The blue glintstone adorning it’s blade has been replaced with unalloyed gold, yet it remains a formidable weapon of Carian make-capable of infusing it’s slashes with a gleam that inflicts additional magical damage alongside the sharpness of its blade. Moreover, though not it’s primary purpose the polearm can also be used as a sorcerous catalyst to channel various glintstone sorceries through. You may import a similar weapon to gain this item’s properties"
227,,100,Moonveil,Elden Ring,Destruction,"The masterpiece of a Sellian swordsmith, this katana is forged wholly of glintstone. Light wreaths it when sheathed-and when swiftly drawn for a few seconds it can be used to launched waves of light following the motion of its slashes. A sorcerer’s weapon first and foremost, while the strong and the dexterous handle it well it is one gifted in intellect that brings out it’s full worth as a weapon."
228,,100,Ringed Finger,Elden Ring,Destruction,"You are now the proud owner of an enormous finger sheathed in several large gold rings. Thought to have been severed from an ancestor of the hand-like Fingercreeper spiders roaming these lands, a vestige of life remains in these enormous makeshift bludgeons-letting them well and flex to build up strength before giving enemies an almighty flick. Be mindful about how adherents of the Golden Order might look askance at you for hoisting around a grotesque parody of the divine messengers as a blunt weapon."
229,,100,Rosethorn Halberd,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"An enchanted spear created from druidic magic, this spear has the unique feature of being counted as ‘part of your body’ - training your strength makes the spear more effective, and what’s more, it shifts to be usable by any form of creature, from the humble fox to the grand dragon."
230,,100,Blow Your House Down,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"Walls and doors, the ever so loyal shields of peasantry and noble alike. Wood and Stone are all that remain between them and the wolves - while meager feral animals may scratch at these, you care not for their feeble shelters. With a howling cry, you are capable of rattling stone and wood, and striking fear into the hearts of humans who hear you - weakened or ramshackle buildings may even collapse of their own accord."
231,,100,BOROS GUILDMAGE,MtG - Ravnica,Destruction,"The Boros act as a police force, and to successfully enforce law and order in the very often lawless streets of Ravnica, you need to have the strength to support your words. You are now much physically stronger! Use this gift to go forth and punch the criminals of Ravnica with the iron fist of the law. You also have a very strong sense of justice and union."
232,,100,Mana Fount,MtG - Kamigawa,Destruction,"You are an amazing individual who can call forth the innate Mana of a land, allowing you to ‘tap’ into the land for huge gains. Like Ichiga [Who Topples Oaks] you can store this power away for later via keeping ‘charges’. This can allow for a massive boost in one’s personal physical prowess if you are willing to expend ‘charges’ to do so, though using more that four charges at once or storing more than eight is currently beyond you, though with time you could train to increase your capacity at both containing and utilising them several times over. The monks of Budoka were able to become hulking beings able to smash down even an Oni with this power, however tapping land in this way is heavily draining. Unless the land is hugely mana rich like those tapped by Planeswalkers you may only tap into such power from a land once every ten years, a land in this case is approximately at minimum four kilometers squared land."
233,,100,Sudarshan Chakra Yamaraj,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction,"Now here’s a real weapon, a worthy force for any heroic figure. A massive chakram, bigger than a
grown man and made of impossible heavy metal that allows it to crash through even enchanted
steel with ease. Despite this mass, it feels light as a feather to your touch and as easy to manipulate
as your own limbs. The chakram spins at incredible speeds with a twitch of your wrist, allowing the
blades that sprout from it’s rim to cut through most material. When spinning like this it can even be
unleashed to roll towards enemies at high speeds, homing in and returning to you via magic. The
final aspect to this divine weapon is the holy fire that can be summoned from it. Never harming you
but growing in size and intensity the faster the blade spins, it creates a combination tool that crushes, cuts and burns through all enemies that stand before it. "
234,,100,Agni Gandiva,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction,"A gift from the God of Fire, this ornate bow forbids the hands of any human but it’s chosen wielder
to lift it or draw back it’s string. Taking the same form as the favoured weapon of Arjuna himself, the
bow will grant great force to any arrow loosed through it and is capable of wreathing these shots in
heavenly flames. A mortal man could shoot through thick castle walls and unleash fireballs that melt
down dozens of men at the target point but it will only give greater results when wielded by one
with already great strength or abilities relating to fire. Arrows will form at the side of the bow if none
are given by the holder, pure fire solidifying into an arrow for your use. "
235,,100,True Strike ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"Your attacks now possess an unique quality, allowing them to pierce past the corporeal world and strike directly at your targets. This doesn’t guarantee that your enemies will die, only that you can hurt them.
"
236,,100,Military Discipline ,Sonny,Destruction,"The ZPCI is effectively a PMC, so you must have had some experience to get in. This is where you got it. You have the skills of an average ZPCI Elite (despite the name, there are a lot of those running around) and have skill with the gun foci used in this world, along with being moderately fit, and knowing some weak offensive spells. Might sound like a lot, but as broad as this skillset is, it’s only enough to let you fight weak zombies on it’s own.
"
237,,100,Storm Rifle ,Sonny,Destruction,"Seems like a ZPCI product to me, but the ZPCI aren’t the only ones using guns as magical foci. The storm rifle is a good foci for the sake of just about any spell, but it helps better with lightning spells.
"
238,,100,Physical Boost ,Generic Magical Girl,Destruction,"In your magical form, you're easily five times as fast and strong as a normal person your age and size, and can jump twenty feet in the air, and land without breaking your legs. You're also much more resistant to damage. If you focus your power, you can exceed even those limits, but doing so is tiring, so you should save it for emergencies. 
"
239,,100,Basic Elemental Zap ,Generic Magical Girl,Destruction,"This is your standard magical girl magical energy blast attack – follows whatever theme you and your team use, be it the classic elements, colors, fruit flavors, or something else. Starts out pretty weak, able to knock out a normal person, a low level mook, or break a window, but still weak enough that major enemies will be able to just swat it aside. Grows in power the more often you use it, but using it more than a few times in a fight will tire you out. Work at it enough, and you'll be knocking holes in brick walls when you want to.
"
240,,100,Magical weapon ,Generic Magical Girl,Destruction,"An enchanted weapon of some sort, which lets you hurt even magical enemies who ignore normal weapons. Will never need sharpening or get rusty. Ranged weapons like bows and guns will still have limited ammunition/arrows, but you'll be fully restocked when you transform the next time. As an added benefit, you don't have to cart it around town in your backpack, because it vanishes when not in your magical form, and always reappears with you when you transform. If you took Always On Duty, you'll be able to make it appear and vanish at will, and ammunition will restock after about an hour. 
"
241,,100,Enchanted Zippo ,Justice League Dark,Destruction,"Got a light? Now you always will. This classic Zippo has been enchanted, turning it into a mystical flamethrower. Just flip the lid, start the flame, and you can manipulate the fire with your will. Also comes in a Bic version, if you prefer to flick your Bic at ghoulies instead.
"
242,,100,A Good Blade ,Justice League Dark,Destruction,"A fine sword, forged by a master blacksmith and woven with enchantments, it is preternaturally sharp and durable and will never dull or rust.
"
243,,100,Twin Pistols ,Justice League Dark,Destruction,"A bit unorthodox, perhaps, but undeniably effective. These m1911s are copies of the pistols wielded by Pandora. Made by Wayne Industries with shock buffers and new polymers to allow reduced recoil and impressive accuracy, these are very well made weapons. But that’s not all, because they’re also enchanted to allow you to channel your magic through them for increased effectiveness."
244,,100,Element Scepter ,Valkyrie Profile,Destruction,"Mostly alike the scepter sorcerers receive for free, this one has the added ability of allowing you to convert spells from this setting into their Great Magic variants during a PWS. The only downside is that it has a roughly one in three chance to break after every use, but at least this one will repair itself over the course of an hour once the battle ends.
"
245,,100,Grand Wheel ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"When you focus for a moment, time slows down and you can see a wheel of sorts in your mind’s eye. Using the magic of the wheel, you can store and retrieve up to twenty weapons at a moment's notice, swapping between them freely. 
"
246,,100,Enhanced Strength ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"In your Magical Girl form, you are much stronger than you look. You can lift up about two tons and can probably rearrange someone’s face with a well-placed punch. You can buy this ability multiple times.
"
247,,100,Ancient Traps ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"The Necrotects built countless automated protections into your tomb, to guard you even as you and your army slept. This option has multiple tiers of traps, in lethality and quantity. You and any of your servants will know the ways to easily and quickly bypass these traps, ways very difficult to find for any unwelcome visitors. For 100TP, the tomb will be filled with a great variety of mundane but effective traps. Pitfalls filled with spikes or snakes. Boulders rolling down hallways. Poisoned Arrow traps linked to opening doors or pressure plates. Rooms that will shrink, the walls moving inward or the room filling with sand to suffocate intruders. Whilst only a limited number of these traps may be taken, there is still enough for at least one per room and per hallway. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
248,,100,Ancient Traps - Boosted (Unlimited),Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"For an extra 100TP, you may remove this numerical limit and fill every room and passage with deadly traps. (CG Note: Requires base Ancient Traps - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
249,,100,Physical Enhancement ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"You have knowledge of a form of magic that enhances your physical abilities; Reinforcement, Runes or some other magic of your choice.
"
250,,100,Ancient Belkan ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"This was the dominant system used by the Belkan Empire during its glory days, and fits the ideal of a knight of Belka - up close, personal, and unsubtle. Practitioners, often called Knights, would eschew ranged attacks in favor of melee combat and antipersonnel techniques, designed to shut down opponents through a combination of mobility and fighting power. It lacks the utility and flexibility of the Mid-Childan system, but compensates for this through raw power and monstrous combat ability in close quarters. Notably, it is fairly easy to adapt this style for use with the Cartridge System, adding to the prowess of a Knight in their prime."
251,,100,Modern Belkan ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"This system currently doesn’t exist except in a few esoteric pockets of Belka’s former worlds, but will soon become popular after the introduction of the Cartridge System to Intelligent Devices, which should be happening about a year after your arrival. Much like its predecessor, it’s almost completely combat oriented, but instead focuses on enhancing one’s physical capabilities using magic and Cartridges, sometimes even in hand-to-hand combat or using melee weapons like the prior system. It’s not good for much outside of combat, but is excellent for one-on-one duels or quickly shutting down an unprepared and squishy opponent.
"
252,,100,Shooting Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"Technically, you can cast any spell in any Device mode. However, it is far more efficient to reconfigure the Device to maximize the power and efficiency of a spell rather than casting it through brute force. Your Device gains a ranged mode, which causes it to reconfigure to better support ranged attacks, specifically bombardment-type spells, although shooting-type spells might also gain some benefit from this.

When reconfigured, the weapon will generally become more cumbersome, weighty or otherwise awkward for anything other than ranged attacks. A sword would lose its edge, perhaps revealing a gun in the blade or combining with it’s sheath to form a bow. A simple staff could become heavier, needing an entire trigger assembly to support its weight. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

You’ve been trained in the legions, and are proficient with rank-to-rank fighting with the gladius and scutum, the usage of goblin munitions, and mass spellcasting (assuming, of course, that you’re capable of spellcasting). Furthermore, you know how to create goblin munitions, including the magic-eating goblinfire. While this won’t let you stand up to a Hero on it’s own, the discipline of a legionnaire and their skill against others on their level is not to be doubted. As one of the Named yourself? Well, this level of skill can be quite effective, though it’s enhanced with the assistance of fellow warriors.

"
258,,100,Enchanted Zippo ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Destruction,"The blade is covered in glowing blue runes and feels much easier to handle, making the weapon more quick. If it could not before, the weapon is now capable of dealing damage to beings that are not susceptible to mundane weapons like spirits. If it already could, it becomes far more powerful against these creatures. (CG Note: Requires Daemon Weapon: Lord of Change or Daemon Weapon: Drach’nyen first.)"
259,,100,Firestorm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Destruction,"The weapon has been enchanted with the soul of a sorcerer who failed too greatly to be allowed to live. The weapon’s blade will erupt into flames when drawn, and it burns so hot that when it hits its target it often causes them to erupt into flames as well, potentially causing a slow and excruciating demise.(CG Note: Requires Daemon Weapon: Lord of Change or Daemon Weapon: Drach’nyen first.)
"
260,,100,Cursed ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Destruction,"Great magics were used on the weapon during it’s forging, and as a result each strike carries with it a curse that causes wounds to refuse to heal. The wounds will remain open regardless of how much time has passed or what medical practices are used. This curse can be broken or overpowered, but the curse is unique and it would take some time researching the curse before a magical cure could be made, and the magics required to simply overpower the curse would have to be immensely powerful. (CG Note: Requires Daemon Weapon: Lord of Change or Daemon Weapon: Drach’nyen first.)"
261,,100,Weapon of Choice ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Destruction,"Ganon’s Trident is a fearsome weapon, but truth be told there’s very little about it that stands out as special. Oh, it’s finely made, and a weapon suitable for a king, a warlord, and a monster is equal measure, but that’s all it is. Still, pick a weapon, it need not be a trident. In your hands, this weapon moves far easier than it ought to - you could spin it in place with no skill in doing so, or throw it faster than it should reasonably be able to move. It will even come back to you afterwards. Oh, and with the injection of some magical energy, your new weapon can put out small fireballs, or coat itself in flames.

Moblins used spears, dark knights used Flails with an extended chain, but you could be able to use a sword, axe, or other medieval weapons like a bow. Any weapon found in the game is a fair pick, really. Mind you, you only get one, so pick wisely. In addition to that, you also get one of the Specializations below, according to your origin for free. All others cost 100 CP.

Weed Whacking Way of the Blade 
I’m not sure where you have learned your swordcraft, but no one can deny that you do actually have no small level of skill with the blade. Maybe it was practicing sword swipes in tall grass, or out of a book somewhere. Whatever the case, you have the potential to learn a few uniquely powerful basic skills, like using your magical energies to enhance your sword dashing, and how to complete a Hurricane spin with enough force that you could theoretically get some air time  over a chasm if the angles were good. It’s not a lot, but you could rival a Knight Trainee if you were back in Hyrule proper instead of the more wyld regions.

Keen Eye  
You have quite the keen eyesight and kinesthetic sense my friend. I guess it comes with the territory of having to avoid things in flight. But in concern to martial skills it’s really helping with your aim - be it spellslinging, healing, offensive magics, or even any form of projectile based weapon. Perhaps you have a fairy sized bow, or slingshot? Your ranged skills would be quite good, easily the equal of any arbalist. This slightly boosts your abilities with other medieval level ballistic devices used to launch projectiles at greater ranges, like catapults and onagers. You’d do wonders helping defend a place against a siege. After all, it helps when you have the skills to actually hit a distant target.

Green, Fire, and Ice 
Your magical abilities are by no means Vaati’s equal, but perhaps you would qualify as someone he would willingly call ‘acceptable’. Perhaps you are one of his followers who helped keep the Palace of Winds free of pesky adventurers in the time since his sealing? There are certainly enough magical tomes locked away up there for a decent education on the mystic arts. This comes with basic Elemental Magic Training for the elements of fire, ice, and lightning. You can throw lightning bolts from your fingertips, create a cone of ice, or fling fireballs. If you wish, you can trade away two of those for even more skill on the third.

The evil soul within the lantern can also be used to project volatile balls of dark magic at enemies, though they’re neither fast nor far reaching. Useful for lighting your way and as an improvised weapon.

Or if you happen to be something odd, like a kangaroo, a fighting style which is similar to, but not quite, boxing. Sadly, the effect only lasts as long as you wear the gloves. Additionally, to help that style actually be of use, you also receive a Fist Ring, allowing your blows to deal the damage of a well placed sword strike with each blow.
"
267,,100,Bombs ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Destruction,"Simple yet effective, the Bombs that you purchase here do one thing and one thing only. They explode. Mind you, they do that one thing very well. You now have a small bag of them, ten in total, at your disposal. Please be careful not to blow yourself up, alright? In addition to the bombs themselves, you also have a Bombproof Ring, which prevents your own bombs from blowing you up. Don’t ask me how it works, it just does.

269,,100,Boomerang ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"This isn’t so great a weapon, but the Boomerang makes for an excellent weapon for someone with more brains than brawn. It’s power may be lacking, but it’s more than capable of stunning any foe that it smacks into. It doesn’t last long, but that's more than enough time for you to land a few good blows. In addition to the Boomerang itself, this also comes with the Rang Ring, which allows you to use it as an actual weapon, dealing slightly more than no damage to anyone you hit with it. Stunlocks are awesome, no?

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
270,,100,Slingshot ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"The slingshot forms a happy medium between the Bombs and the Boomerang, retaining the long range of the Boomerang and the capacity of the Bombs to deal noticeable damage. A very straightforward weapon, you merely point and aim, pull back your ammo, and let it fly. This also comes with a small bag of ten Ember and Pegasus Seeds to use as ammunition, and a Pegasus Ring that lengthens the effects of Pegasus Seeds on you. To help with hit and run tactics, because close range isn’t something you want with this.

287,,150,Sword of Prismatic Flames,80s Sword and Sorcery,Destruction,"This sword can cover itself in color shifting flames on a mental command from the wielder. While it will not cut through metal, or other swords, these magical flames are capable of inflicting visible burns on a mighty demigod, or a monster that would be immune to common weapons, and of burning a mortal man down to the bone with ease. If held against steel it could melt it, and given many clashes it might heat up an opponent’s armor or sword to unusability.

This is of course a magic sword and able to harm creatures that would resist non-magic injury, though the sword’s own magic is weaker and will not harm most spiritual beings. Likewise, these are magical fires and as such can inflict some burn to even most creatures that would be immune to traditional fires, and can even burn spirits."

292,,150,5th-Generation Energy Blades ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"Despite all the advantages offered by strength-enhancing magic, some Mages simply don’t want to spend all the magical energy to enhance their swing and instead opt to enhance the blade instead. An energy blade is a relatively simple mass of fields shaped into the confines of a blade that is both superheated and preternaturally sharp. The ‘hilt’ of the blade is simply used to provide directionality to the fields, with the actual blade being generated in place by the Device, which confers the advantage of the blade being effectively ‘weightless’. In addition, the energy consumption of the blade is directly linked to its size and output energy, meaning it’s relatively simple to ‘overcharge’ an energy blade.

For all of it’s advantages, however, energy blades are severely weakened under the effects of AMF compared to physical blades, and being mana-based tend to be more easily blocked by magical defenses. To counter these effects, fifth-generation energy blades instead generate a blade made out of kinetic energy, instead of using the magical blades used in older methods. The practical upshot is that they become much harder to counteract with anti-magic, while still retaining their properties. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

Stylish during some time, because you’ve acquired a lot of experience in creating
and working with several kinds of poisons, toxins and other more exotic and
potentially harmful substances, with some examples of Stylish’s poisons being an
invisible, odorless gas that could paralyze even trained assassins and an insecticide
chemical capable of repelling Wrigglers and destroying their eggs. In addition to
having the skill needed to replicate such substances, you can also design your own
poisons with unique effects on par with the doctor’s toxins. Furthermore, your
experience with poisons also taught you the best ways to provide immunity to others
through careful, controlled exposure to them, being also an expert at the art of
exposing people to something to build an immunity to that or other related things,
such as carefully exposing a Kryptonian to green kryptonite in order to make them
develop resistance or even immunity to its radiation’s effects for example, as long as
that specific thing can have an immunity developed against it and that you actually

barest scratch, your weapons can deal death from just the slightest prick. With just a bit of
focus, you can cause your weapons to become coated in a potent venom, that will leave your
foes gasping for breath and teetering over in short order after being exposed. You can package
this toxin into a capsule with a few moments of work, which will burst into a poisonous mist
when thrown. You, of course, are immune to this toxin, and you know how to create an antidote,
should you need to do so."
299,,200,Burning Passion,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Destruction,"When most people talk about stoking the
fires of war, they aren’t being nearly so literal. To put it simply, you are capable of lighting your
weapons on fire and still managing to fight effectively with them in that state. With just a bit of
focus, you can cause the blade of your sword to burst into flame for a minute or so, or cause the
tip of your arrow to ignite before loosing it from your bow. You can even take a few moments to
prepare a small ‘bomb’ that can be thrown and will burst open to cover a decent area in burning
oil. You are protected from your own flames, though if they spread, this protection won’t extend
to the new flames that are birthed."

you make a gun shape with your fingers and then have that hand fire off invisible bullets of force at
the enemy. Each bullet is about as strong as one of your own punches but you're not limited to just
firing invisible pistols. So long as you can roughly mime the use of the sort of gun, you're able to use
that instead. You can cock and fire an unseen shotgun or ready up an entire chain gun, though you
are limited to real world guns in this way. "
301,,200,Ad Hoc Attack,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"What goes around, always comes back around. What goes up must come down. When you hit
something, they'll always find themselves coming back for a second blow. Any attack that you make
against someone is repeated against them a second later, whether it be a punch or a spell or a use of
your powers. This secondary attack costs nothing from you but will only target the same place as the
initial attack and be the same in every way as that attack. "
302,,200,Killing Impulse,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"Born to kill, you’re better than anyone can be at it. You’ve got an instinctual desire to kill everything
you see but unlike Munakata, you are in full control of this desire. The benefits you gain? That same
desire results in an effortless mastery of every form of killing. You are naturally talented in the
extreme at all forms of combat, assassination and murder and find it even easier to improve your
talents to greater, physics-defying degrees such as becoming good enough with a sword to cut
through sound. You are also exceptionally good at avoiding being killed, knowing exactly how to
maximally reduce the damage you take from blows, even if you can only shift a few inches at the

A dark and terrible weapon acting as the perfect catalyst for any type of magic or weaving or death; it will improve all aspects related to such things by three fold and any wounds and curses inflicted by its wielder are equally enhanced. Knocking upon any door, even at the gates of death, shall open the way to its would be traveler. And so, it bears the runes of Lopt, with which comes the 17 rune mark charms taught by Odin. This is a powerful artifact of death and if used properly can permit the wielder to kill any living thing.  Comes with a snazzy gold rooster phoenix familiar."
305,,200,Fragmentation,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You can alter any object you touch to momentarily act like broken safety glass that is easily shattered. You could walk through a reinforced metal door or person like they aren't even there, and also works on forcefield effects. Unfortunately, the stronger your opponent relative to you, the weaker this effect is. The property wears off a few seconds after contact with you."
306,,200,Cutthroat,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You can create near-invisible claws and teeth at your nails and in your mouth, respectively. The claws and teeth can slide between atoms and sever molecular bonds. In addition to that, your physique is slightly enhanced. Your jaw is greatly enhanced, making it possible for you to crush reinforced steel with your biting force. "
307,,200,Just Fireball,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You can create fireballs in a wide variety of types and sizes. You can generate them in sizes anywhere from a baseball to a meter in diameter, create them out of either burning gas, oil, or plant matter, and can control how they move, such as having them fly in a straight line, obey gravity, follow a set path, or even chase after specific targets. You can also set how they interact with others, such as having them disperse on impact, bounce off of people and/or the environment, explode and spread their contents over an area, or stick to whatever they contact.

There is no hard upper limit to the number of fireballs you can have generated at a time, but you can only generate about one maximum-sized fireball a second, or however many other, smaller fireballs that make up the total size. The fire is no stronger than normal flames."
308,,200,Lighthouse,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,You can fire beams of light out of light sources you can see or within 50 feet. the strength of the laser is relative to the strength of the light. A typical lightbulb will fire a blast strong enough to stun a human or kill with repeated fire. This power does not work with celestial bodies.
309,,200,Stellar Fragments,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You can slowly form and grow small roughly spherical crystals out of starlight at night. You’d usually be able to form roughly 15-20 pebble sized crystals per night (if you did nothing else, like sleeping).

These crystals, when broken, violently “explode”, directly applying varying amounts of heat and outward force to anything nearby based on how close it was to the crystal and how large the crystal itself was, with crystals the size of a pebble equalling a strong grenade. The absolute nature of this explosion means it ignores the protective capabilities of any armour.

You have telekinetic control over these crystals and can break them at will. You also have a vague understanding of the location of these crystals relative to yourself."
310,,200,Lord of Cinder,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"You gain pyrokinesis focused around cinders and ash and the ability to summon cinders and ash, along with near immunity to heat and fire. The cinders and ash you can summon can melt steel within moments of contact, and alongside this, you have the ability to transform your body into a living mass of superheated ash and cinders. In this state, you cannot be hurt except by the destruction of the burning core, which is normally located inside your head, but with training and experience, you can learn to move it around your body to protect it from damage.

You can also create constructs that are strong as steel out of your ash and cinders, and you can heal yourself from anything using ash and cinders that you did not create so long as your brain remains fully intact."
311,,200,Scorch Release,Naruto,Destruction,"A combination of wind and fire, this Kekkei Genkai allows for the creation of heat orbs. These orbs are incredibly powerful so much that they with just one touch can incinerate all the moisture in a person's body. By bringing a minimum of three orbs together a gigantic orb can be created with power great enough to scorch a large portion of an immense forest."
312,,200,Storm Release,Naruto,Destruction,"A bloodline hailing from Kumogakure that allows for the user to fire potent beams of electricity which flow like water. These beams can change trajectory mid-flight and boast considerable destructive potential. In particular, their speed is immense, with this bloodline’s strongest techniques traveling at the speed of light. This bloodline is a combination of Lightning and Water nature affinities."
313,,200,Hanzō’s Touch,Naruto,Destruction,"Much like the Salamander himself, you were implanted with the venom sac of an incredibly poisonous salamander. Aside from granting you an enhanced resistance to poison, this procedure has rendered your body so toxic that a single breath is able to kill anyone in the nearby vicinity. Your poison causes excruciating pain and paralysis, with even the hardiest of individuals being incapable of fending off death for more than two days. However, unlike Hanzō, you can control the poison, allowing you to control who you poison and letting you live without a respirator. This comes with free vials of the cure."
314,,200,The Thunderbolt,Bleach,Destruction,"An element manipulation ability, common in this tier. The Thunderbolt allows for control over lightning itself, to a fantastical degree. The use can generate and control powerful blasts
of lightning, for both attack and likely many utility purposes. The general power of the electricity will
rise with the user’s Reiryoku but it retains all it’s great speed. The Quincy can even transform into a
lightning bolt themselves to travel at incredible velocity. In Vollstandig, far more lightning of much
greater potency can be produced and controlled at once.

315,,200,The Fear,Bleach,Destruction,"Anyone pierced by the Reishi thorns created by this power is tortured with terrible fear. The weak willed often die outright, hearts stopping from terror, and even the most strong willed are filled with such doubts as to quickly fall apart. The thorns can even spread through objects, a black
substance corrupting the area near them. In Vollstandig, the Fear can work simply by sight of the
Quincy, the fear trapped forever in their minds once they glimpse the wielder. The schrift can even
manifest eyes in the air around the victims, making it impossible to not look at the user.

Requires Soul Letter to purchase."
316,,200,The Explode,Bleach,Destruction,"A Schrift which allows the user to create reishi bombs of a unique nature. Rather than
exploding on contact, these projectiles convert anything they touch into bombs themselves, which
then explode with incredible destructive force. The ground, other living beings, spiritual attacks, even the air itself can be converted into a bomb. The user appears immune to both their reishi conversion and the explosive force of their attacks. In Vollstandig, the explosions become far more
powerful and can be released en masse from the angelic wings.

317,,200,Desperate Struggle,Final Fantasy XIII,Destruction,"You grow progressive faster and stronger as you become more injured. When you reach a critical point in health, you are nearly twice as fast and twice as strong."
318,,200,Savage​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Destruction,"Not only are you now extremely skilled in both unarmed and armed melee combat, your skills with fist and blade translate to a kind of instinctive way of fighting in all other forms you might be able to take. You are as comfortable wielding tentacles, claws, wings and other natural weapons as you might be with your fist or a sword."

320,,200,Path of the Ringing Blade,Cradle V1,Destruction,"A sword path that excels at single strike combat. Every enforcer technique and striker technique causes a twinkling bell sound after the fact.

321,,200,Path of the Twisting River,Cradle V1,Destruction,"A path that combines forger, striker and ruler techniques to accelerate madra so fast it can be used to slice enemies.

322,,200,Path of the Golden Sword,Cradle V1,Destruction,"A Path of sword madra that uses Enforcer techniques on their weapons. The name of their Path comes from the goldsteel swords they use more than from their techniques

323,,200,Steel born Iron Body         ,Cradle V1,Destruction,Attained by submerging oneself in a black pool of liquid that burns like a live flame. Must be completely under the surface of liquid (using an apparatus or reed of some sort to breathe) for three days and three nights. This pool was reported to cause extreme pain to the point that the individual exposed to it thought they were dead. It only shows its real use past the True gold level and generates increased amounts of power via momentum. The longer the fight the stronger the body becomes.
324,,200,Boom Boom,Marvel Zombies,Destruction,"You can make balls of plasma and detonate them at will. The power of these can range from harmless to blowing through concrete, so be careful. It depends on the size of the bomb you make. You will have to throw these, so I suggest you work on your pitcher’s arm. You can also reabsorb your creations. In time, you could learn how to direct the plasma into a forward stream as an energy blast, which means that you won’t have to chuck your bombs like baseballs anymore."
325,,200,Shear,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction,"Arcane energy tears away at your target. It can tear off armour without significant difficulty, and has a low chance of removing barriers the enemy may have. Has no effect on a barrier stronger than your own magick prowess."
326,,200,Breakart Pentagram,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction,"Summons and magickal constructs all draw energy from an arcane source, one which you can disrupt. Your attacks naturally have a chance to banish beings composed entirely of magickal energy."
327,,200,White Hole,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction,"You open a white vortex, which spits out everything that a dark vortex sucked in, at an extremely high speed. You could use this as a portal presumably, but it would probably hurt quite a bit. If there was nothing inside the dark vortex, a bunch of rusted steels knots come hurtling out."
328,,200,Seitengrat,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction,"You conjure an invisible bow that has no firing motion associated to it. It fires when you actively think it fires – and the arrow strikes when you think it strikes. As the whole process is invisible, it is difficult to block unless the opponent can see through invisibility or negate magic. It has a terribly slow firing rate however, and seeing as you can’t even see the arrows, you can’t really change the rate it fires at either."
329,,200,Dagda’s Club,Irish Mythology,Destruction,"You have a great club of black iron, with a white handle. You can slay a hundred men with one blow, if they be packed together in the way of armies. But fear not, for each man slain with the club can be brought back if you only rap their foreheads smartly with the handle."
330,,200,The Pristine Blade,Slay the Princess,Destruction,"A gleaming silver blade lies here, glistening in its spotless elegance. Pick it up. It will be your implement, you will need it in order to slay the Princess. As a weapon, it is specifically designed to make it possible for you to kill something capable of ending worlds and is remarkably durable. Other than that though, it is fairly unremarkable."
331,,200,Terror Of The Nightmare,Slay the Princess,Destruction,"(Heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerves.) Around you, the world becomes dark and chill, threatening to unwind upon itself, stretches of nothing twisting in the dark that barely resemble those roads and walkways they once were and floating above it all...is you. A masked shadow stretched on the skin of the world, broken and fragmented (Heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerves.) and radiating an aura of fear so permeable it seeps in and corrupts all it touches - people near to you feel their heart, (Heart.) their lungs, (Lungs.) their liver, (Liver) and nerves (Nerves.) all shutting down all at once. It is an agony that you cannot imagine, a creeping chill that will swallow them up bit by bit until finally the darkness takes them. And you will remain, alone. But your mask, what's hidden beneath the mask could-No...No...No..."
332,,200,Unmatched Violence,Slay the Princess,Destruction,"As one would expect, you're a violent unfocused brute when it comes to actual fights, but your sheer ferocity places fear in even the most vicious of fighters. Even when bloody gashes nearly split your torso in twain, you'll still keep going with unnatural ferocity and a yearning desire to see your opponent dead. One would almost call this unnatural, but so long as it enables you to slay the Princess, nothing else matters."
333,,200,A Wooden Sword?,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"A Katana wood instead of steel is still a katana nonetheless and as a master of the blade you may use it as such, when using a wooden weapon in the shape of a blade you may use it as if it was made of folded, well crafted steel, use a wooden katana to cut down your foes or maybe use a wooden knife to cut vegetables. Doing this also has the effect of honing the spirit of the Samurai within you, and also makes you look really cool."
334,,200,Favored Enemy: Undead,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"The undead are creatures of darkness and decay while you are an agent of the light,and life. Your attacks are more damaging to undead and your very touch can harm them, all of your abilities can be charged with the holy light of white magic allowing you to harm those of the darkness much easier. This ability may be toggled on or off at will and will not harm you if you happen to be a creature of the darkness."
335,,200,Hexing Swordsman,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"As a hybrid caster and swordsmen the redmages found that often times it is easier to weaken your opponant from afar then finish them up close. To this end the red mage became a master of enfeebling magics paralyzing, blinding, and confusing their enemies. Each of these could change the game adding to their chances of survival and you are better than most at this art. Debilitating or inconveniencing through magic is something you are just good at and your spells are slightly more powerful than others when they are used to cause such effects."
336,,200,Three Letter Word,Dies Irae,Destruction,"There are certain truths in the world that people don’t want to admit to themselves, even when you speak them out loud to those people. What you now know is not one of those things. The single piece of knowledge you have, the true nature and name of God rolled into a single word, is something so nightmarish that it can drive any man into a maniacal frenzy of rage in an attempt to stop you from saying that one word. You yourself are immune to and seemingly cannot hear the word you speak but it will drive any who hear it to temporary insanity, lasting a few minutes of murderous rage at most and a few seconds for those of great power and mental fortitude. "
337,,200,Vampire Night        ,Dies Irae,Destruction,"The presence and hostile intent of those with Ewigkeit is an awe-inspiring thing to see. These are beings that walk with the weight of thousands and who can, with enough power, shatter concrete or reduce a man to bloody pulp just with the force of their bloodlust. Even among these brutal warriors however, you would be renowned for the sheer lust for violence you possess. You have an overwhelming amount of killing intent for your level of power, such that even before taking in any souls you can force the hearts of normal men to explode under your gaze. As you grow stronger and take in more souls, you will retain this unnaturally high level of bloodlust. This bloodlust does not influence you mentally unless you allow it to and you find it effortless to entirely hide your killing intent from any external being. "
338,,200,Significant Sword ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Destruction,"Ah the sword of the quest, the blade that will allow the hero to prevail, the sword with the marvelous power of... being able to cut through other swords? This is the generic special sword of these films, the ones that had a less than iconic example shown that is. Now, to be fair, that is the power of Excalibur in the oldest stories where the blade has a power at all, and it can cut through more than swords, cutting through human bodies, metal shields, and armor all with the same approximate ease, it might even be able to cleave through an anvil. So it’d be more fair to say it cuts through metal like a hot knife through butter, which means it makes real quick work of flesh.

Also this sword counts as magical allowing it to damage entities that would resist mundane weapons, potentially even hurting ghostly and spiritual beings. This same magical nature means that it will always be durable enough for you to use it effectively as a weapon, no need to worry about it breaking because you hit something too hard with it, though if the god that gave it to you parries it with their magic spear it might just still shatter."
339,,200,Revival Taekwondo/Northern ITF-Taekwondo,The God of High School Jump,Destruction,"Two forms of martial arts developed in this world, based on enhancing ITF style Taekwondo. Originally, Northern ITF Taekwondo was developed by the North Korean Government, designed to work as a killing skill rather than for competition sports. Terrifyingly effective, it allowed incredibly high speed movement while losing none of the power of the user’s kicks, letting users of Northern ITF Taekwondo tear through even armed soldiers like paper.

Revival Taekwondo, also called Re-Taekwondo, was South Korea’s answer to this. Created by Taejin Jin with WTF Taekwondo as a base, it focused on eliminating what weaknesses remained in Northern style and enhancing the art as a whole with stealth techniques. A perfect counter to the Northern style, it progressed greatly under the hands of its founder, with techniques to manipulate air pressure or apply the force of singular attacks multiple times over being created.

340,,200,Kyokushin Karate,The God of High School Jump,Destruction,"Otherwise known as Full Contact Karate, it is one of the most popular Martial Arts in the whole world, having many millions of practitioners counted and likely even more uncounted. The version you have learnt is far above the normal art that is taught however. You have learnt the Four Pillars techniques, moves that involve the manipulation and enhancement of your life energy to create incredibly destruct blows or blasts or energy. You could even unlock the final secret technique in time, built on using all Four Pillar moves in concert to hit with the force of an entire mountain."
341,,200,Time to Pull Out My Big Gun,The God of High School Jump,Destruction,"You really weren’t kidding when you told those guys you weren’t left handed. One of your limbs is way, way stronger than the other. This isn’t just about which hand you write with. If your left hand could break a brick in one punch, your right hand could smash a two story brick house in one go. Hell, if you’re not careful about remembering which is which, you could really do some damage by just shaking someone’s hand. Which limb is this much stronger is up to you and you can even buy it multiple times, though you’ll only be able to buy one side of any pair or group. You can’t have both arms be much stronger than normal but you can make an arm and a leg be this much more awesome.

342,,200,Put to Rest,Final Fantasy X,Destruction,"When the deceased cannot be reached in time by a Sender, those lingering sentiments will eventually form a fiend – turning what was once a part of Spira into a creature that threatens all other life around it. You may not be a Summoner, or even a Sender, but if you can wield a weapon, you can at least put down the dead. You may charge your weapons with energy, such that monsters they kill will dissipate, preventing them from rising again."
343,,200,Sphere Break,Final Fantasy X,Destruction,"Hopefully you should never find yourself in a situation where breaking a Sphere is your only resort, but if you do find yourself in a pinch maybe the only option remaining is to do so. Normally breaking a Sphere releases the pyreflies within – but for Spheres that you’ve personally created, the magic that was contained inside will be released, showering the area with magical force equivalent to how developed the Sphere was."
344,,200,ChayShan,Elantris,Destruction,"A slow, meditative martial art practiced by the JinDo people, ChayShan can be channeled through focus and effort to enter a trance-like state. In this state, the practitioner has greatly enhanced strength and speed, to the point where Shuden could break the supernaturally strong spine of an augmented Dahkor monk with a single blow. This state also grants an innate perception of one’s surroundings, letting you navigate through a crowd of enemies with your eyes closed. This doesn’t make you unbeatable, but a devoted practitioner of this martial art would be a force to be reckoned with."
345,,200,Beast Warrior Ever,The Games We Play,Destruction,"Hmm? Okay, interesting. You are now the heir to an ancient figure, Jumper. The
skills of an old Faunus martial artist warrior-king have fallen into your possession,
whether through a long line of hidden heirs, scrolls discovered in a random basement,
reincarnation or something else entirely is up to you to decide.
These are thematic styles based on the four chinese symbols, the White Tiger, the
Azure Dragon, the Vermillion Bird and the Black Turtle. You have the skills up to the
level of an absolute master, though not to the level the originals did, though you have
all of their potential and more.

In future jumps this translates into a generally top-level talent towards Martial Arts
of all kinds but especially ones based on animals of some kind, the kind that would
make you into a figure inspirings legends millennia after your passing."
346,,200,Monster Hunter,RWBY,Destruction,"You hunt Monsters for a living. That’s what you do and you’re good at it. You have an innate talent for dealing with Monsters like the Grimm in combat and even after leaving this World, you will always be able to make a job out of hunting humanities monstrous enemies."
347,,200,*Little Red,RWBY,Destruction,"You are roughly equal to Ruby Rose during Volume 1 in combat abilities. This is a fair bit above the normal Student, not quite the peak, but a good way towards it. The acrobatic fighting style of Huntsman and Huntresses won’t be so out of reach for you, as is your own way of combat.

Requires Base Proficiency to Purchase"
348,,200,*Invincible Girl ,RWBY,Destruction,"Why hello there you rising star! You are frankly put a prodigy in the arts of combat. Like a certain Nikos, you seem to be made for this profession. On top of fighting being easy for you, you’re already a fair bit above your fellow students, starting out on the same level of skill as her, capable of giving a Maiden a good fight with your technique alone. You’re definitely going to be the powerhouse of your Team and most likely perfected your own brand of combat style.

Requires Little Red to Purchase"
349,,200,Black Mage,Final Fantasy IX,Destruction,"Destruction is the basic tenet of Black Mages, such that by default, a Black Mage would be somewhat proficient in basic black magic. Should you yearn for further education however, we have an instructor fit for you. By the end of our course, you’ll be proficient in all the basic aspects of black magic up to the intermediate concepts.

Sadly, we don’t have enough time to give you a thorough lesson on the advanced concepts – but with what little understanding you will gain, it should just be a matter of time for you to learn advanced spells"
350,,200,[Sword] ,Final Fantasy IX,Destruction,"He’s not so much an instructor as a drill sergeant, but he’ll be willing to teach you the basic fundamentals of using a sword, in a set of Sword Arts. He’s a very thorough man...but also ridiculously strict in what he’s willing to teach you and what he’s not willing to teach you.

Should you accept his teachings, he’ll instruct you in the fundamentals behind the Thunder Slash and Stock Break, but then you’ll have to find other Swordmasters and Knights to learn the rest. Naturally, your proficiency and power with a sword will increase dramatically."
351,,200,Hellfire,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Destruction,"Oh yeah, this is where it's at. You can now control Hellfire, an extremely powerful flame that burns the soul as well as the flesh. This is one of the only things that can put a demon down for good. Remember that this also puts a small target on your back, as many here in hell want this kind of power, whether that involve recruiting you or slicing you open. However, The undeniable boost in strength this gives is staggering. You don't need to pick up the sloppy seconds of the angels anymore."
352,,200,Combat Training,Final Fantasy VIII,Destruction,"It's a dangerous world out there, and so plenty of people have basic combat training. You've taken it a bit farther, though, and are very competent in general. Small unit tactics, personal combat, hand to hand, melee, and ranged, you have basic experience in all of these, as well as the physical fitness to properly utilize it. While not a bodybuilder or anything so specialized, you're at the generalized peek of human physical health and ability. What's more, you've chosen a particular weapon to focus the bulk of your advanced training on. Weaponry here is mostly mundane, with the rank and file using machine guns and rifles, but melee weapons such as flails and swords are still viable and popular. A rare few individuals make use of outlandish weapons like gunblades and giant anchors to great effect as well."
353,,200,An Instrument for Murder: Painter’s Brush,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction,"Much like the Man-Murdering Demons, you also have found a tool that seems to fit your ideal for murdering. It may be an actual weapon, or just a regular item. It may have some special properties, such as a blade that it’s capable to freely bend and move as you command it, or a saw that actually cuts through distances, but what’s matters more is how well attuned you are to this item: you are capable of channeling any and all of your abilities to an increasing efficiency whenever you are using this weapon, and the weapon will survive whatever you use through it. You may import any item that you own on this option."
354,,200,Regend Come Back to Life,Fate/Grand Order,Destruction,"You were born with a special talent. A talent for dealing death to a certain kind of being. Your skills sharpen, your blows deal greater wounds and the attacks of your foes feel lighter than they should be on your skin. Whereas you might normally only take on a single foe of that level, when it comes to your preferred prey, you could take on a half dozen with just as much ease. Humans, Dragons, the Undead, any limited classification like this would be applicable. You’ve got the talent that could have people singing songs about the battles you are in one day, long as you can find enough worthy foes."
355,,200,Unlocking Trace,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Destruction,"As you keep doing something it doesn’t just become easier, but also you see details that someone less experienced might miss. Similar to how the ones who best understand the Prescripts are the Messengers and Proxies who have obeyed their will for so long, you will see more meaning or be able to do unique things with a task or subject the more familiar you are with it. For example, after fighting for a certain amount of time you will be able to break through defenses more easily or nullify something your opponents are using for more power."
356,,200,High Caliber Body,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Destruction,"Those who fight for the resistance are NOT your average cityfolk. Whether they look like it or not, these brave men and women can keep up with the best troopers Shinra can field, and most of them are cyborgs! Whether you want Barrett’s rippling physique or prefer a less obvious look, you have the strength, endurance, and durability to fistfight giant robots. Heck, you could even keep up with a SOLDIER, for a time. There are still some challenges that are beyond you; the monsters of this world can only be matched by SOLDIERs and their enhanced bodies. That said, pushing your physical form to its limits has yielded some incredible results. After all, if your body is your weapon, you might as well have the best available."
357,,200,Yamato Dragon Blade(Ultimate Sword),Kurohime,Destruction,"If you purchase the power of all four spirits, then you can spend a final 200 BP to upgrade the blade—and its accompanying gun—to the Ultimate Sword, a sword whose base resembles a revolver cylinder, and from the six “bullet chambers” produces a stream of energy that forms together to become the Ultimate Sword. The Ultimate Sword can cut through absolutely anything that exists, and can kill even that which cannot normally be killed. If you also have the advanced form of the Magic Bullet perk, then you could even use the Ultimate Sword to cleave through the entire planet all at once.

Requires Yamato Dragon Blade to Purchase"
358,,200,Shinigami Scythe,Kurohime,Destruction,"A curious mix between a double-ended scythe and a tonfa, this is the traditional weapon wielded by the Shinigami Angels in service to Darkray, the God of Death. Not only can it disappear to be stored within your soul, but it itself is capable of interacting with the souls of others, and should you cut someone down with this scythe, even their soul can be torn apart, permanently destroying it and removing them from the cycle of reincarnation. You can decide to limit the damage to a purely physical level, if you would prefer not to destroy someone’s soul, however."
359,,200,"Worldwide Unique Gun of Illusions, Senryuu ",Kurohime,Destruction,"An enchanted revolver wielded by Kurohime, it vastly boosts the force behind any bullet fired with it, letting ordinary bullets punch with as much force as a cannon without any increased recoil."
360,,200,Majura Clan Mage Uniform,Kurohime,Destruction,"The Majura Clan was the first to attempt to create the Kokushinbaku, and had a number of weaker derivatives. This uniform is capable of extruding a number of branches, which will after a couple of moments curl up around glowing magical spheres; between 8 smaller spheres, or up to one large sphere, as big around as a human. From these magical spheres, you can fire large crystals with great force. Smaller spheres can produce more crystals, while a larger sphere can produce a bigger one, more suited to siege weaponry. With a moment of focus, you can change what type of sphere your uniform’s branches create."
361,,200,Kaon’s Might ,Kurohime,Destruction,"You have the sort of ludicrous strength required to lift up a sword longer than you are tall, with a blade as thick as your fist, and swing it around with a one-handed grip."
362,,200,Goddess Bow,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction,"A bow of divine origin, not unlike the one wielded by Pit.

This bow is capable of creating and firing arrows of light. Though the bow lacks a string, it is nonetheless possible for you to ‘charge’ shots from the bow, increasing the power slightly. Whilst the arrows of light are only moderately damaging, and offer little in the way of a knockback effect, you are able to guide these shots to a great degree; with a decent amount of space, you could even get the arrow to completely turn around and travel behind you. Only a single arrow may be fired at once; you must wait until the first arrows lands before the bow will create the next one.

Your bow is also capable of easily separating into twin short swords, and recombining again with ease, all without sacrificing the bow’s integrity. This allows the bow to provide both melee and ranged options in combat.

Should the bow be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
363,,200,Fireball!,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction,"A classic fighting game skill. You have gained the ability to throw a projectile of some kind. It need not be an actual fireball either. It could be another element, like electricity, or something a bit more esoteric, like ‘Aura’.

The properties of the attack are also not set in stone. You may decide whether the attack flies
through the air, bounces along the ground, or clings to the ground completely. 

Regardless of these choices, the move is not a game changer. It will hurt, but isn’t likely to defeat another Fighter."
364,,200,Elemental Attacks!,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction,"Upon purchase of this perk, you must choose a single fantasy element, such as fire or ice. Something more esoteric like darkness is also acceptable, but if you’re looking at the periodic table, you’re looking in the wrong place.

You have gained the ability to apply this element to your attacks, making them slightly more powerful when you do so. The primary advantage for this is the interactions these elements have with your enemies. For example, enemies weak to fire would obviously be threatened by fire- augmented attacks. You may even apply this to any melee weapons you wield, though only when you are attacking with them.

You may purchase this perk as many times as you like, each time choosing a new element you may apply to your attacks. You can only apply one of these elements at a time, but switching between them is effortless.

365,,200,Recovery Special!,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction,"You have gained the use of a rising attack, capable of the dual purpose of both hurting your foes, and covering a great amount of vertical distance, in a short amount of time. You may decide what form of attack it is, be it a punch, kick, uppercut, or something else, but aside from the great vertical climb the attack makes, it is no different from a standard attack you might perform.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you may add a minor effect to this attack, such as causing opponents hit by it to drop some money (even if they had none), or cloaking yourself in flame for the duration of the attack. You may instead elect to turn your attack into a rising, explosive grab, in the same vein as Captain Falcon’s Falcon Dive, or Ganondorf’s Dark Dive."
366,,200,Surprisingly Skilled Teenage Fighters,Miraculous Ladybug,Destruction,"You’ve been expertly trained in some form of combat. This could be one of many specific martial arts, fencing/swordplay, or even military training. Your chosen skill will be taken to a level that surpasses casual ability and becomes enough for a normal human to be on even ground with a Miraculous user in a fight, not counting super powers. You may purchase this Perk multiple times (discounts persist), selecting a new combat discipline each time.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
367,,200,Variant Detonation,High School DxD,Destruction,"This Sacred Gear doesn’t manifest as an item, but instead a glowing aura of power around the user. The ability of this Gear is simple but powerful - it can generate explosions on whatever the user comes into contact with. If you can close distance between you and your foe, this Gear can make the unprepared and unprotected bite the dust."
368,,200,Just One Push,High School DxD,Destruction,"All things hold weakness. Human hearts are frail, Angels can fall from grace, and Dragons are tempted by petty amusements. Humans bleed, Angel wings can break, Devils can be struck down. Where there are friendships or love, you also know where there is envy and hatred. With time to study, you know how to twist both the literal and metaphorical knife where one feels weakest - weakness in their fighting styles, their words, their beliefs. With a whisper or a dagger, you strike where scars are still healing, and where relationships would shatter if enough pressure were applied. The end result is out of your hands and there’s always the chance some are too strong...but an entire Peerage can be made to tear each other apart with enough provocation. All while you watch with a smile on your face."
369,,200,Magical Warrior,High School DxD,Destruction,"Whether you are part of a peerage or a lone wolf, there is one constant in this world - if you do not fight, you will not survive. Luckily, you’re not someone who was born yesterday - you’re already a master of a mundane weapon or martial art of your choosing, at least by human standards. In addition, you know how to weave your own magic into your physical fighting style, able to use the two seamlessly together. For instance, if you prefer to use a sword, you can use a fire spell to provide a way to create distance or heat up your sword with very little loss in focus in doing so. This obviously doesn’t mean much if you don’t have much magic to use in the first place, but you can combine magic and your physical fighting style together with very little trouble, and learn how to do the same with others in the future. Unfortunately, this doesn’t quite play as nicely with supernatural martial arts or any other ‘exotic’ abilities...you’ll have to practice using those in tandem by hand."
370,,200,Human Bomb,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction,"You can make any part of your body explode, the size of the explosion depending on how much cursed energy you put into it. This can be anywhere from a relatively small right up to the power of a decently powerful missile strike. There’s no need for the body part to be attached to you either, so it’s frequently used by ripping out an eye or tooth, throwing at the opponent, then detonating it when they get near. This technique doesn’t come with any way to regenerate anything used for it though, so try not to use anything you can’t replace."
371,,200,Rot Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction,"With this technique, your blood has taken on corrosive properties, capable of burning through clothes, skin, and even stone to an extent. It’s not a huge threat to a sorcerer – it’d take drowning in it to kill one – but if you manage to get it inside someone’s body, the next stage of the technique can be activated. Known as Decay, floral patterns spread along where you hit them, and their bodies begin to decay from the inside out. It’s not a hugely fast process – even if you manage to get a fair deal inside someone it could still take ten or more minutes before killing them, and hours until their bodies become naught but bone – but it is highly painful, regardless.

It's worth noting that while it doesn’t have a maximum range, the Decay technique needs to be actively maintained – if you release it at any time, the decay will instantly stop and you’ll need to get your blood into your target once again. You also don’t have much control over your own blood: you can spew it from your mouth in a spray, or shoot out many fast-moving lines of blood from yourself if you truly master the technique, but that’s about it. Regardless, it’ll never be capable of the same level of control and versatility of Blood Manipulation, nor reach the same raw power as Piercing Blood – and with this technique alone, you’ll still need to worry about running out of blood."
372,,200,Ratio Technique ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction,"You’re able to score critical hits on anything you attack by striking them at a specific point. By visualising your target as being divided into tenths along their length, you can forcibly create a weak point at the ratio of seven to three, which deals much more damage when struck relative to the energy you used. Notably, you can use this on things other than just a target’s entire length – if you strike the 7:3 point on their torso, their arm, their forearm, or any other part of their body, you’ll score a critical hit as normal. This can also be used on inanimate objects just as well as living creatures."
373,,200,Straw Doll Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction,"This technique functions similarly to the common interpretation of a Voodoo. By taking a part of someone’s body, putting it into or against a straw doll, and then impaling the doll with a nail, you’re capable of injuring that person by causing spikes to suddenly emerge from their body, skewering them from within. So long as you have a body part to use, the range of this technique if theoretically without limit – though you can always skip the doll part by just driving the nails into someone’s body directly. While any part of the body can be used by this, the larger it is, the more effective the technique will be: a hand or internal organ will make it much stronger than a hair or some blood, for example. Also, the stronger an opponent is compared to you, the less damage they’ll take."
374,,200,PROPAGATE,Final Fantasy VII,Destruction,"Why wait for them to come to you? The deadliest virus is the most proactive one. This ability is simple yet terrifying: By touching or inflicting damage using your body on another living being, you may freely choose to 'infect' them with any disease or biological agent contained within your body, such as the effects of HERITAGE. This ability may be toggled on and off freely. The only conditions to infection are that you're able to make skin contact with the enemy, with open wounds being the fastest to complete the process."
375,,200,Sun and Moon Infusion,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"You obtain or import a weapon infused with the power of the Sun and the Moon. During the day, the weapon roars with incandescent flames hot enough to melt stone. At night, it’s able to shoot rays of moonlight that are able to cut through metal like butter. You may be able to unlock more powers as you become more familiar with them, or to separate the effects of the weapon from the time of the day. It’s all up to you."
376,,200,Orrn’s Blessing,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"The disciples of Orrn were the best smith of the Freljord... until Volibear killed them all. The Fire God of Freljord never took more discipline... until now. You’re blessed with an inner fire that protects you from the heat of the forge and sustain you in the cold. With time, you could also learn how to channel this fire in your strikes of blow guts of fire at your enemies."
377,,200,Stun,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"Either through magical powers or simple skill, you have the ability to temporarily incapacitate an enemy. You could hit them in the head or use magic to blind them, or even use wind to make them fly away, but the end result is the same."
378,,200,Overwhelm,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"You’re either absolutely gigantic or so ferocious and violent that your attacks just shred the enemy defenses, even with glancing hits. You just punch through their armor like it’s paper and inflict tremendous blows against their flesh. Be cautious to not destroy everything in your way."
379,,200,Lurk,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"Seems like we have an ambush predator here, uh? You’re extremely adapted at catching your opponents with their guard down, exposing the weak points of their defense so you and your allies can sink your fangs into it and slowly, but surely, erode their ability to defend themselves."
380,,200,Impact,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"You possess some quality that makes your strikes very difficult to completely negate. As long as your attack hits your target, some damage will be applied, regardless of how tough the enemies’ armor and defenses are. It's not a lot of damage, but it’s something."
381,,200,Fury,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"The fury of a dragon is stuff of legends. The more the fight, the more their blood boils with power. As long as you continue to fight and defeat enemies, your power increases, slowly but steadly, until you’re an unstoppable engine of destruction. Just be cautious, for while you become tougher the more your fight, this power doesn’t heal your wounds."
382,,200,Fearsome,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"Your imposing physical presence, overwhelming power or raw brutality instill fear in the heart of you enemies, paralyzing them in fear. Unless the enemy is physically able to match you, they cannot defend against your assault."
383,,200,Brash,Legends of Runeterra,Destruction,"You possess exceptional mass, extreme speed, or are skillful enough that you can overwhelm your opponent's defenses. Dodges and parries are useless against you, only great endurance can protect you from your attacks. Let’s hope you have the strength to actually do damage."
384,,200,The Saber To Rule Them All,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Destruction,"Legends speak of a dreadful Saber who exists only to hunt others of their kind. A golden-blue beast who gobbles up naughty Sabers that stay up past their bedtime and don’t eat all their hamburgers. Though you are not the mysterious hunter, you share her Anti-Saber power. Against any being that is or is like a Saber, you receive a potent advantage. You strike harder and faster while their blows land with lessened force and energy. Powerful instincts guide you to avoid their attacks and even sense what move they’ll make next. Any beam clashes, especially with magical swords, leans much more in your favour. You can even sense their presence on a world, allowing you to slowly narrow down the area and track any Sabers down for hunting. 

These sort of Sabers are almost always hostile to others of their kind, whatever the reason is. Only the cutest Sabers can break them out of their grim mission to hunt down Sabers. They usually have a bit of a complex about themselves too, whether they think they’re the best Saber ever or secretly hate themselves as a Saber too. Poor girls. "
385,,200,Advanced Combat Training,Honkai Impact 3rd,Destruction,"You’re relatively good at combat – enough to classify as an A-Rank Valkyrie. You’re able to deal with most Honkai Beasts below Templar-Level by yourself, and if you work in a group with several other people of the same level as you in terms of combat capability, then you might even be able to take down an Emperor-Level Honkai Beast – though with significant injury to almost all of the members of the group taking down the Honkai Beast being almost guaranteed."
386,,200,Bloody Effective,Library of Ruina V1.0,Destruction,"Sweepers need blood to fuel themselves, and somehow you seem to get more out of people than you otherwise would. Whether you’re making light cuts or shredding someone to pieces, the amount of blood that flows is roughly tripled. This doesn’t actually change the amount of blood loss from the target, making it no more dangerous to them."
387,,200,Beatdown,Library of Ruina V1.0,Destruction,"Most low level syndicates don't have the money to buy weapons or modifications, and they certainly don't get the weapon training fixers do. Thus most make do with what they have: their body. You gain proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and the strength to pick up and throw a man your size. Every part of your body (modified or otherwise) is a lethal weapon capable of breaking bones and cutting off limbs. If you know any fighting styles, this will amplify their effects."
388,,200,Gauntlet,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction,"A single metal gauntlet that is intended for those who focus solely on attack. It greatly boosts the strength of any who wear it, but only when it comes to striking a foe. Strangely, it makes the wearer weaker if they attempt to wield a shield while wearing the gauntlet. Odder still, any blood splashed onto the gauntlet will disappear. Almost as if the metal is drinking it in."
389,,200,Combat Sorcery,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction,"Blending together steel and magic is what makes a Magitek Knight truly dangerous. Regular soldiers have a hard time dealing with blasts of fire interspersed with thrusts of steel or parries punctuated by bolts of lightning. You have several years of practical, battlefield experience killing people with a melee weapon of your choice combined with your magical talent. Guaranteed to make you a match for any two dozen normal soldiers in a fair fight."
390,,200,Bifrost ,God Of War (2018),Destruction,"Much like the Einherjar, you are able to channel the Bifrost into your attacks, be they ranged or melee. What this does is it grants your attacks a two step effect, on the first hit it does normal damage though it does heal over time, but the second strike will detonate for extra damage. For 200 cp, your skill in the usage of Bifrost matches that of Heimdell’s, being able to create spectral armor and even make a prosthetic limb if the need arises."
391,,200,Elemental Juggernaut,God Of War (2018),Destruction,"Your ability to manipulate the elements is immense, though limited in some ways. With this perk, you are able to channel the element of an attack that harmed you. Any example of this would be if the Leviathan Axe was used to harm you, you would be able to channel the power of frost into your attacks be they through your body or through your weapons. In contrast if the Blades of Chaos were used against you, you would be able to channel fire."
392,,200,Magical Strength,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Destruction,"Genetic inheritance can include quite a bit more than simple appearance and nature. In some cases, the children born of unions between humans and non-human beings such as mermaids can have some innate supernatural advantage over their more mundane kin. You seem to have benefited from such a strange ancestry, as your might surpasses that of any human. You could be compared to a dozen men on your own, and your strength, endurance, and agility are such that you could beat a whole group of experienced pirates alone, as a child. As an adult, your might will obviously be even greater than this, and should you commit yourself to the arts of war you’d make for a fearsome warrior indeed."
393,,200,Hit It Where It Hurts,DxD Universe,Destruction,"Pick a target, now not only do you get lucky in finding his weakness, but more chances to exploit that weakness presents themselves to you, with this you could for example kidnap Asia Argento without getting caught by anyone until hours later."
394,,200,Practical Application ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Destruction,"Sure, you might be a Magus, but this is a war. Now you not only have the nerve and physical fitness to at least participate in combat, but you can apply whatever your speciality is in combat very effectively. Maybe you’re an Alchemist, so you now know how to create and manipulate familiars out of wire? Or you specialize in storing magical energy, so you can turn all those expensive gems into grenades and batteries for potent spells at the expense of your wallet? Even a Necromancer could come up with a few useful if gruesome tools, like weapons made out of body parts. Whatever you hit the books for and researched in your lab, you can turn all that theory into a practical way to defend yourself and go on the offense. Now, knowing really is at least half of the battle."
395,,200,-Gladiator-,Final Fantasy V,Destruction,"Masters of combat, the Gladiator excels past all others in physical might. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Gladiator’s abilities, while Mastery allows Bladeblitz to work at full power, striking an area for full damage.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
396,,200,-Samurai-,Final Fantasy V,Destruction,"Noble warriors who are skilled in bushido and other unique styles. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Samurai’s abilities, while Mastery gives you unnatural speed with your iaijutsu, able to draw your blade and kill a foe in an instant if they are unprepared.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
397,,200,-Dragoon-,Final Fantasy V,Destruction,"High-flying warriors that take a great deal of inspiration from wind drakes. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Dragoon’s abilities, while Mastery allows you to apply Lancet to all attacks, each one draining your foe’s energy.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
398,,200,-Mystic Knight-,Final Fantasy V,Destruction,"Weapon-focused mages who channel their spells through their blades. Purchasing the job will allow you to imbue your weapons with any spell you can cast, while Mastery makes the imbue last indefinitely, until you imbue it with another spell. You can also remove the spell stored if you wish. This allows you to imbue your armor in the same way.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
399,,200,-Berserker-,Final Fantasy V,Destruction,"Light-armored warriors who use rage as a weapon, a wild frenzy iis what gives them their strength. Purchasing the job will let you tap into that wild, bestial power, while Mastery will let you retain your mental clarity while doing so.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
400,,200,-Black Mage-,Final Fantasy V,Destruction,"Spellcasters who harness the power of the elements to rain destruction on their foes. Purchasing the job will allow you to learn Black Magic, while Mastery will vastly increase your MP/Mana/etc pool.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
401,,200,Educated in the arts of war,The Song of the Nibelungs,Destruction,"You are skilled in all matters of the battlefield. You are a masterful swordsman, know how to fight with spear and shield, ax and hammer and all manner of war gear. You can shoot your bow and arrow while riding bareback on a horse and hit moving targets, but even unarmed you can prove a deadly adversary. You are not only a dangerous man on the battlefield only due to your skill, but also because of your fearlessness and ability to keep a cool head in the most terrifying circumstances, quickly adapting to new situations on the battlefield as they arise. You could hold your own against even a dozen opponents at the same time and with the might of the Völsung perk, you could beat 12 giants and 700 men single handedly in a single battle."
402,,200,Count to Seven,Library of Ruina,Destruction,"Here in the City, sometimes you have to fight some truly weird stuff. Sapient puddles of goop in suits designed to maintain their cohesion, that used to be people and speak only in numbers for instance. As a veteran of many strange cases, you’ve got an eye for figuring out where and how to stab things so that they stop fighting. Or slash or bash, depending on the needs. Even in the event that there’s no obvious weak points, your intuition extends to flaws that could be used to create ones, mild imperfections in their armor that could be blown open, or noticing a weird hangup in a distortion’s attack patterns that could be used to attack it uncontested."
403,,200,Bare-Handed,Final Fantasy IV,Destruction,"While the other classes utilize swords and staves, you don’t bother with them. You don’t need a weapon- you are a weapon. Your fists and feet are dangerous in their own right, and your physical strength behind the blows only makes them that much more effective. Not only that, but you can also strike twice as fast as those wielding weapons, often getting in two strikes to their one against a foe with speed equal to your own."
404,,200,Lancet,Final Fantasy IV,Destruction,"Empowered by the dragons you’ve come to emulate, you’ve also managed to take things a step further. Lancet is a unique strike that allows you to damage a foe’s physical body as well as their mental psyche, and bolster your own, effectively ‘draining’ health and mana from your target."
405,,200,Archery,Final Fantasy IV,Destruction,"Many White Mages shy away from the front lines, preferring instead to play doctor, but not you. Using your eye for anatomy, you can deliver decisive, painful strikes via virtue of a mastery of the bow and arrow. Your accuracy is also quite high, and you will never miss a shot you take aim on."
406,,200,Excalibur Destruction,HighSchool DxD,Destruction,"Sometimes simple is best, and what’s simpler than a big sword that can smash a room-sized crater into the Earth with its strength? This two-handed weapon’s power is simple: a fantastic amount of destructive power in each swing of the blade. Naturally, it will hurt Devils and their kin all the more with a direct blow."
407,,200,Mana Burst Pumpkin A,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Destruction,"A special technique invented by Elizabeth for the 2015 Halloween, it lets you form pumpkins out of pure magic, and lets you use more magic to turn any pumpkins (real or magic copies) into powerful bombs even able to injure Servants easily."
408,,200,Breath of the Chimera ,God of War,Destruction,"One of the most deadly abilities of the chimera is undoubtedly its ability to breathe fire, incinerating anything in front of it. Much like that three-headed monstrosity, you possess an elemental breath attack of your very own. It could be fire, ice, lightning, or something even weirder, like shards of metal or beams of light. You can take this option multiple times for different elements.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
409,,200,Blood of the Hydra,God of War,Destruction,"It was not any great weapon or feat of strength that killed the mortal Hercules, but poisonous blood. Blood much like yours, as a matter of fact. Your blood is so poisonous that even the gods would fear being under its effects, and capable of killing mere mortals with but a touch. This doesn’t affect you at all, of course, and you are able to toggle it on and off, if you desire to give away your blood for other reasons beyond assisted murder."
410,,200,Thera's Bane,God of War,Destruction,"The titan known as Thera is the living personification of volcanoes, one of which is potentially responsible for the destruction of the Minoan civilization. Perhaps some of her blood runs through your veins, or you have been blessed by her. Either way, at will you can ignite your weapons in divine flames hotter than magma, as well as finding any fire based abilities you possess twice as effective as before."
411,,200,Pouch of Destruction,Final Fantasy III,Destruction,"A small pouch, with a strap so that it can be attached to a belt. When you reach into his pouch you will always find a grenade type weapon containing a basic fire, blizzard or thunder spell. A new one will appear in the pouch after the previous one is set off, and it will always have the element you want."
412,,200,Thundercrasher,Hades,Destruction,"Few mistake the crash of thunder and destructive might of a lightning bolt as anything other than Zeus’ wrath given form. Having such a potent force imbued into each and every weapon you pick up is a boon not to take lightly. Your blows strike with the added jolt of electricity, causing those on the receiving end to suffer burns and possibly convulsions in their limbs.

Just as the lightning bolt splits and arcs to find its intended target, so too does the energy in your strikes lash out from your foe to any other enemies nearby."
413,,200,Wavesmasher,Hades,Destruction,"One of the more irresistible forces in this world is the beating of waves upon the sides of cliffs and mountains. Even stones that withstood time for unknown ages crumble against the relentless force of water. Your blows will come to embody this same unstoppable force, striking with an insistence that propels even the sturdiest of foes aside like pebbles in a storm.

As if pushing your foes around like leaves in a current weren’t enough, your blows now continue pressing against foes even after your swing is complete. Those that find themselves wedged between that force and a solid object will discover just how painful a squeeze between a rock and a hard place can be."
414,,200,Winehound ,Hades,Destruction,"Few regret a night of festivities with the God of Wine for he serves only the most potent of refreshments. So potent, in fact, that one could dip their blade in the fermented grapes and come away with a poison. Your blows each impart a burst of alcoholinto the bodies of your foes so intense that it acts like a toxic substance. For a short time their vitality itself is harmed as the drink eats at their body.

Normally the alcohol wouldn’t have time to impair your foes as normal liquors would. However now it speeds through their blood to their minds, causing a very short lived drunkenness with each strike."
415,,200,Wintertouch,Hades,Destruction,"With springs so short and winters so long, it takes little effort to draw upon the deepest chill of winter’s wrath and infuse it into your weapons. Your blows infuse those you strike with a bone deep cold that builds in their joints and muscles, slowing down their movements.

Enemies affected by your hindering blessing discover their wounds biting at the mall the harder each time the chill builds in their body. Every tenth strike causes their wounds to erupt in a blast of winter chill, spreading the curse to others nearby while freeing them from it."
416,,200,Huntmaster,Hades,Destruction,"The hunt demands patience, planning, and prizes the careful strike born of skill rather than the savage blows of fury. Your strikes reflect the hunter’s careful eye, seeming to find weak points and chinks in armor much more easily.

When the prey grows thicker fur, the predator sharpens his teeth. Your blows do not simply snake past the armor of your enemies. They also strip some of it away each time you come away with your enemy’s blood."
417,,200,Dreadbringer ,Hades,Destruction,"Warriors all fear the reaper. They fight eagerly, passionately in the hope of living for one moment more. Your blows leave behind a lingering dread just as deadly as the wound itself. Seconds later your enemies will discover the wound far deeper as the emotion bites like steel.

The last traces of a foe's life spurs your weapon towards your next foe, seeking, hungering for another taste. Your next strike after slaying a foe will be a terrible blow indeed."
418,,200,Heartbreaker,Hades,Destruction,"Those you strike feel the sting more deeply than merely their skin and bones. Each blow will temporarily weaken your opponent as they struggle with thoughts of loves lost or cast aside.

Those you slay can no longer contain the bitter emotion you impart with your blows. They crash upon all nearby foes to torment them in equal measure."
419,,200,Draining Touch,Final Fantasy II,Destruction,"Your touch isn’t quite necrotic, but there are many who think it is. In reality, you’ve become a siphon for the force of life itself. Unfortunately, this touch doesn’t transmit through a weapon, but if you were to strike someone with your fists or feet, you can pull their life force into yourself. Roughly half of the damage they would take from your blows is converted into life force that you absorb, restoring your own damage and fatigue."
420,,200,Batgun,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"A peculiar type of weapon, instead of bullets if fires spirits that seek foes. Boasting relatively high power, but a slow fire rate, it's not something to overlook. The projectiles looking like bats is optional, another animal can freely be chosen. ananana..."
421,,200,Hellfire,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"Not necessarily Fire per se, but one of the Elemental Powers has blessed your weapon, granting the spirits that are fired elemental attributes. Which Power that is is up to you.

Requires Batgun to Purchase"
422,,200,Shadow,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"The weapon of choice for an aspiring witch. A simple curse is imbued into each of the spirits, allowing them to inflict spiritual wounds, and compound with the curses of a witch.

Requires Batgun to Purchase"
423,,200,Vampiric,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"While not as powerful as the witchcraft of vampirism, the spirits are imbued with a similar magic, allowing them to siphon small amounts of vitality from those they hit before they return to bolster the user of the gun

Requires Batgun to Purchase"
424,,200,Light Blade,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"Imbued with vitality and holy power, this weapon does two things. First it bolsters the vitality of the wielder, and secondly will unleash holy power to strike nearby foes. 

The weapons with this power are said to have originally been wielded by the angels.

Requires Sword to Purchase"
425,,200,Death Scythe,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"A secondary enchantment from a witch imbues the blade with a curse so that it can strike the soul and cause a secondary more powerful strike like the Curses of a witch. This enchantment is much stronger during a spin attack

In the hands of a witch who knows how to curse, the curses applied with this weapon are much stronger than those they are usually capable of.

Requires Sword to Purchase"
426,,200,Volatile,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"Your arrows have a bit more kick to them, given, you know, that they now explode. Strangely, the arrows still 'return,' they just do so by having the scattered shards return and reform the arrow, ready to fire and explode again.

Requires Bow to Purchase"
427,,200,Magical Return,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"The arrows siphon magical energy from whatever they strike. While this doesn't disrupt effects much, it does imbue the arrows with magical power. Meaning that as they return they will strike with weakened copies of spells they have absorbed. As you use magical abilities, the arrows will soak in those as well, though the way the enchantment works limits them to unleashing their power only on the return.

Requires Bow to Purchase"
428,,200,Holy Weapons        ,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"In your hands, your weapons are imbued with holy power that is enhanced by your vitality. This grants the weapon a subtle flickering glow and enhanced capabilities that grows stronger the greater your vitality is.

One mortal once tried to explain it as, ""The more HP you have, the more damage your weapon deals."" an apt description."
429,,200,Combative Cosmology,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"Normally, Astrologers don't focus on the combat applications of their studies, instead investing time into research. Possibly due to your participation in these nightly fights, you've turned to using the beauty of the cosmos to strike down your foes.

Having mastered your Phenomena for combat has made it easier to apply a similar process to other areas of your study. What this means depends on the area of study and what you are weaponizing in particular, but if there is a combat application you'll find it if you put in the time.

If you have the Cosmic Phenomena perk, while the effects still pale compared to the real thing, your Cosmic Phenomena is able to dish out damage quite nicely. Additionally, you'll find summoning it takes less time between uses, making it more combat applicable."
430,,200,Strong Soul(Offence),20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"While it is the most essential part of you, making it a weakpoint should it be targeted, your soul seems to be uniquely strong. In fact it is strong enough that it confers a protective aura that can absorb physical blows. With each blow this aura takes, it weakens until it is completely broken. Over time this aura does regenerate, but there is a limit to how often this aura regenerates before one's soul becomes exhausted and must rest and recover.

For an additional 200 CP, you are capable of using this aura offensively as well. Passively you will find that your attacks are stronger the stronger your aura is. As a secondary effect, when your aura is damaged excess offensive energy is discharged from it pushing foes away while also lashing out at them.

Requires Strong Soul(Defence) to Purchase"
431,,200,Evil Eye(200),20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction,"""If looks could kill"" is a common expression; for you, however, there is no 'could'. By giving a sufficiently focused look you are capable of physically harming those in your view. While this isn't too tiring to do for a moment, you'll find holding the effect for extended periods of time does hurt your eyes. As a secondary effect your vision is notably good, especially your vision in the dark.

Cosmetic glow, as well as if you only want it in one eye are up to you. (If you choose to have it in one eye and lose that eye the power will transfer to another eye without issue). Comes with an optional eyepatch to 'seal' it if you choose."
432,,200,Runeblade ,Final Fantasy I,Destruction,"A glowing blade with strange markings drawn along its steel. This blade is otherwise the same as an ordinary sword, but with an added bonus - it is incredibly damaging against those who primarily use magic, such as spellcasters or monsters that make considerable use of the ability. A paper cut against a practiced mage will open into a wide gash. It does nothing extra to normal physical durability, sadly. Still, a good way to get those pesky wizards off the field quickly, right?"
433,,200,Shard of Alexander,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction,"Shard of the late Alexander, a shattered warrior jar, it will greatly boost the attack power of all weapons when held. Scraps of stewed flesh cling to the shard, and tatters of ornaments can be seen mingled within the slime. Relics of a red-haired champion, it would seem."
434,,200,Icerind Hatchet,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction,"A hatchet with a frost-coated blade. One of several gifts given by Castle Sol in the distant north. Known as ""freezing fog,"" the blade is thought to be a dragon's scale. Each hit inflicts potent frost damage, while stomping the ground while holding it will send out a wave of frost."
435,,200,Full Moon Crossbow,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction,"One-of-a-kind enchanted crossbow of exquisitely detailed craftmanship. Made to celebrate the matrimonial union, and reconciliation, between the houses of the Erdtree and the Full Moon, Leyndell and Raya Lucaria. The two rings dance when reloading the weapon, and it imbues its bolts with a holy element."
436,,200,Black Keys,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Destruction,"A favoured weapon of Holy Man, used by choice for devoted adherents only. Taking the form of long and slender rapier-like swords, the blade measuring over one meter with extremely short hilts, their true nature is much more sacred. They are weaponized sacraments of the Holy Church, created with the lament for the dead as their base. Designed to be thrown instead of being used as a melee weapon, the Black Keys are akin to anti-heresy poison, making it very effective against Dead Apostles, Vampires and undead. You can summon a nigh infinite amount of these sacraments from your person, using them with expertise instinctually like the most dedicated of Executors."
437,,200,Universal Principle of Divine Retribution ,Godbound,Destruction,"While some Gifts are more martially inclined than others, woe be to any who think Wealth, Passion or Deception entirely defenceless in a stand-up fight. Certain Gifts are so common as to be part of all Words: Namely, the power to smite a chosen foe within sight using the raw energies of the Word, and creating a torrent of your Word’s energy to blast nearby foes while sparing allies. You are particularly good at channelling such crude but effective shows of divine power, and have the unique talent of developing new ways to use your Word to inflict sudden, generally explosive harm regardless of its nature. In future worlds any divine power you gain can have similar Gifts developed for it to punish those foolish enough to think the divine power of Peace can’t hurt."
438,,200,Hammer,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Destruction,"By purchasing this option, you ensure the availability of the Hammer in all of your future battles. Sometime during each battle, the Hammer will spawn on the battlefield. It will always spawn closer to you than to your opponent(s), though it may not always spawn at your feet. If you have no desire to use the Hammer at all for a particular fight, the Hammer will not spawn for that particular fight, preventing its use against you. Should the Hammer spawn, your opponent does have the opportunity to use it, if they can get to it first.

When picked up, the wielder of the Hammer is locked into a continual swinging motion for the next eight seconds. The damage and knockback caused by the hammer is tremendous, allowing the wielder to quickly and easily KO even fresh opponents. The Hammer cannot be released during this time. After the eight second period, the Hammer will disappear for the rest of the battle.

Using the Hammer is not without risk. Being locked into the continual swinging motion can hamper your agility and platforming ability. There is also a one in eight chance the Hammer is actually a Headless Hammer (discoverable only when the Hammer is picked up). This will cause the head to fall off the Hammer, the wielder to be stuck swinging a weak stick, and allows someone to pick up and throw the head at an opponent for massive damage.

As this purchase is merely for access to Hammers or Golden Hammers, not the hammers themselves, you may not import any similar item into this option."
439,,200,Fireball!,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Destruction,"A classic fighting game skill. You have gained the ability to throw a projectile of some kind. It need not be an actual fireball either. It could be a ball of spiritual energy, such as a Hadoken, another element such as electricity, or something more esoteric, like a Shadow Ball.

The properties of the attack are also not set in stone. You may decide whether the attack flies through the air, bounces along the ground, or clings to the ground completely. It may be a shock wave, like Terry’s Power Wave, if you wish.

Regardless of these choices, the move is not a game changer. It will hurt, but isn’t likely to defeat another Fighter."
440,,200,Elemental Attacks!,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Destruction,"Upon purchase of this perk, you must choose a single fantasy element, such as fire or ice. Something more esoteric like darkness is also acceptable, but if you’re looking at the periodic table, you’re looking in the wrong place.

You have gained the ability to apply this element to your attacks, making them slightly more powerful when you do so. The primary advantage for this is the interactions these elements have with your enemies. For example, enemies weak to fire would obviously be threatened by fire- augmented attacks. You may even apply this to any melee weapons you wield, though only when you are attacking with them.

You may purchase this perk as many times as you like, each time choosing a new element you may apply to your attacks. You can only apply one of these elements at a time, but switching between them is effortless.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
441,,200,Recovery Special!,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Destruction,"You have gained the use of a rising attack, capable of the dual purpose of both hurting your foes, and covering a great amount of vertical distance, in a short amount of time. You may decide what form of attack it is, be it a punch, kick, uppercut, or something else, but aside from the great vertical climb the attack makes, it is no different from a standard attack you might perform.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you may add a minor effect to this attack, such as causing opponents hit by it to drop some money (even if they had none), or cloaking yourself in flame for the duration of the attack. You may instead elect to turn your attack into a rising, explosive grab, in the same vein as Captain Falcon’s Falcon Dive, or Ganondorf’s Dark Dive."
442,,200,Grafted Greatsword,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction,"The storied sword of Castle Morne. A revenger's weapon, it is burdened with oceans of anger and regret. One of the legendary armaments. A lone surviving champion from a country now vanished was so determined to continue fighting that he claimed the swords of an entire clan of warriors. Swear an oath upon the greatsword to avenge the clan, temporarily raising all attributes for a certain duration. While the oath's effects are active, poise will also be increased."
443,,200,Erdtree Greatbow,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction,"Greatbow featuring Erdtree styling. In times of old, when faith and battle went hand in hand, this weapon was created in tandem with the Golden Great Arrow, of which you will receive a replenishing amount. All arrow damage will scale with one’s faith, revealing its true worth when used with holy-infused arrows."
444,,200,Bloodhound’s Fang,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction,"Curved greatsword with a gently undulating blade that is typically wielded by Bloodhound Knights, trained as hunters and are known to be unshakable trackers. Without the use of language, they choose their own master which they will stay loyal to for the rest of their life. This fearsome blade capable of brutal airborne attacks, it will enhance the agility and acrobatic abilities of those who wield it."
445,,200,Decimite,Gummi Bears,Destruction,"Geode-like rock that grows in two halves, magically “magnetically” attracted to its other half. A small separation of a few feet will cause them to snap together; a larger separation of twenty or more feet causes them to explode with great force as the recombine. Basically naturally growing binary explosives that act like grenades. You get a set of ten Decimite every week and you can stockpile these."
446,,200,Gravelord Sword,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction,"This sword is wielded only by servants of Gravelord Nito, the First of the Dead, and was crafted from the bones of the fallen. It is imbued with a fraction of the Lord’s power, coating it in a toxic miasma of decay and death that lingers and harms all living things that are struck by it."
447,,200,Raging Inferno,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction,"Fire is a dangerous thing, as deadly as it is helpful. Just as easily as it can warm a home within a hearth, so too could it burn that very same home to the ground. It can be a hungry thing, consuming all in its path, something you have more than readily harnessed. All of your pyromantic abilities, regardless of their origin or fuel, are capable of ignoring whatever resistances your target may possess. Even those that claim immunity will still fear your flames, though nowhere near as strongly as others. So long as you desire for them to burn, so they shall."
448,,200,Fire Sorceries,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction,"Just as normal sorcery seeks to understand and manipulate the natural laws of this world, so too do those who practice fire sorceries attempt to understand and manipulate Fire. You are one of the original practitioners of this magic, utilizing a catalyst to fire off chaotic orbs of lava, or summon up torrents of the planet’s lifeblood to scorch away your foes, reducing them to little more than ash. These are more powerful than the pyromancies of the future, but require stronger wills to control."
449,,200,Lightning Spear,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction,"It was discovered that the secret to the Everlasting Dragons’ immortality was their stone scales, and few things are better at peeling them back than Lord Gwyn’s Sunlight Spears. Though you are not privy to those potent divine bolts of lightning, you can manifest a weaker version, striking at enemies from great distances and potent when used against draconic enemies."
450,,200,Moonlight Greatsword,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction,"This sword, one of the rare dragon weapons, came from the tail of Seath the Scaleless, the pale white dragon who betrayed his own. It shines with an arcane light, dazzling many who gaze upon it. As it is imbued with Seath's own magic, it is capable of unleashing a devastating beam of arcane moonlight when swung, allowing you to hit far off enemies with ease."
451,,200,Darkmoon Blade,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction,"In order to deliver vengeance upon those who have sinned, one sometimes requires more power to bring them to heel. You can now coat your weapons in a magical energy that is as dark as twilight itself. Not only will this greatly enhance your attack power, but it will allow even rusted and mundane weapons to strike those normally immune to such weapons, such as ghosts."
452,,200,Hellsing ARMS Anti-Tank Cannon ‘Harkonnen’,Hellsing,Destruction,"If that’s not big enough yet, buy yourself a proper anti-tank rifle. With a length of just under two and half meters, the Harkonnen is a single shot 30mm cannon with the firepower to annihilate from long range anything short of a main battle tank, though even that might find itself crippled with a direct hit. Breech loaded, the cannon comes with several kinds of shells. Silver tipped uranium shells to slaughter vampires, incendiary napalm rounds for wide area destruction and more. At sixty kilograms unloaded, the weapon is enormously heavy, but still light enough for a vampire to easily use over the shoulder. It can pack into several pieces for easier transport, as easy as transporting a 2.5m military weapon can be."
453,,200,Hellsing ARMS Casull        ,Hellsing,Destruction,"A semi-automatic magnum pistol, favoured tool of Hellsing’s most lethal soldier. At over ten inches long and six kilograms in weight, it’s a beast of a sidearm. With explosive .454 Casull rounds, the gun will hit hard enough to make a desert eagle look like a child’s toy, leaving massive holes even in vampiric flesh. With the addition of the same treatment given to Anti Midian rounds above, there’s little the weapon can’t put in the grave with a single shot. But given the strange nature of this weapon, you’ll likely fire a lot more, as the gun only needs to be reloaded between firefights. During an actual battle, as long as you have ammunition somewhere nearby, it’ll fire over and over at high speeds as desired. "
454,,200,Scourge of Pirates,Pirates of the Caribbean,Destruction,"This 16 pdr cannon is imbued by the spirit of a legendary pirate hunter. In addition to a huge supply of ammunition, including case shot, round shot, and chain shot, the cannon has a special quality. The man aiming it has a supernatural understanding of shipbuilding and architecture, which allows his shots to tear through the weakest parts of a ship with frightening ease or knock down buildings with a single shot."
455,,200,Gatling Gun,Marvel Britain,Destruction,"This is a gatling gun, enchanted to be lighter and wieldable by those of standard human strength, it can also magically change size to match the size of its wielder. It never runs out of ammo or overheats. It shoots flechette rounds, piercing armour easily and letting those hit bleed out and die painfully."
456,,200,Bloodletter,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction,"The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
457,,200,Beast Roar,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction,"Normal animals howl to alert their fellows, to call for help or warn them of danger. Beasts, though, only howl out of madness and rage, eager to indulge in the violence and carnage. You can unleash a monstrous roar that can damage and stagger nearby opponents, giving you the perfect opportunity to lunge for their throats. This has the added bonus of being able to increase your voice’s volume, to the point where you might as well be speaking out of a megaphone."
458,,200,Accursed Zealotry,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction,"The Executioner’s hatred of the Cainhurst Vilebloods is legendary, going so far as to invade their ancestral castle and slaughter each and every one of them as brutally as possible. Such hatred, such fanatic zeal is embodied by you, as once per jump, you can designate a group of people that you can deal extra damage to, the smaller the group the larger the increase will be."
459,,200,Combat Bender ,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Destruction,"Despite being useful for more than just combat nothing can compare to the martial applications of bending. You’ve been trained to use your powers in combat, you know how to shape your element into lethal and non-lethal attacks and also how to defend yourself against both benders and non-benders. The hand to hand combat experience you’ve gained from this can also be applied to non-bending combat and any existing martial arts you already know could easily be adapted for bending as well.

Requires Bender to Purchase"
460,,200,Soulfire,Marvel Magic,Destruction,"​Demons are often seen as beings of fire. Hell is thought of as a pit of eternally burning flames by many. Well, while not all demons are of fire, many are and you count yourself among them. You have command of an unearthly flame known as soulfire, a kin to hellfire. You can summon and manipulate this potent infernal flame and while it can function as normal fire, burning matter with heat, its true purpose -- as the name implies -- is to scorch spirits. Magical and spiritual entities will be burned by this fire, not only being affected even if normal fire could not touch them, but actually being particularly harmed by it."
461,,200,Hydra Blood ,Dial,Destruction,"The Hydra Blood is a potent and corrosive substance that possesses the remarkable ability to overcome even divine beings. Enclosed within a small vial, this precious liquid grants you access to its formidable power. With the Hydra Blood, you can unleash its destructive potential in various ways, such as coating your weapons to inflict lethal wounds, utilizing it in alchemical mixtures to create potent concoctions, or conducting daring experiments.

With the formidable properties of the Hydra Blood&#39;s, you’ll gain an advantage in combat and strategic planning. Its corrosive nature ensures that your foes will face the devastating consequences of its touch. Additionally, should you exhaust the entire content of the vial, fear not, for it will be replenished in its entirety within a day, ensuring an uninterrupted supply of this deadly substance."
462,,200,Bow and Arrow of Apollon,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Destruction,"Some relics are dangerous because their wielders know exactly how to use them. But then there are relics which are dangerous because of people who don’t know how to use them. This elegantly crafted bow is one such relic, firing an arrow which soon explodes into several powerful bolts of energy which strike and incinerate its surroundings before the arrow is restored next to the bow. More concerningly, the arrow itself is capable of piercing most mundane defenses which requires a more magical defense against it. It would be quite the nasty surprise."
463,,200,Destroyer Armor Prototype Gun,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 1,Destruction,"A product of the eponymous ""Phase 2"" of S.H.I.E.L.D., this gun retain some part of the Destroyer's fiery core and can discharge powerful bolts of energy, producing heat, light and concussive force in the process. When the weapon charges up it gains a vivid orange glow emanating from between the banding plates around the barrel. It's sufficient enough to even seriously wound an Asgardian, so take that as you will."
464,,200,Power of Decay,Ghost Rider,Destruction,"Like Blackout, you’re capable of harnessing the power of decay; unlike him, you’re able to control it, so you won’t be subjected to an all Twinkie diet. Your touch can rapidly accelerate decay and degradation, killing living beings in seconds and rotting through wood, plastic, and even rusting metal. You’re also capable of limiting the sight of your victims, allowing them only to see their immediate surroundings and the ground while turning everything else black."
465,,200,Hellfire,Marvel Primal,Destruction,"You can conjure magical fire that sears the souls of the guilty, launching it as an attack. Channeled into an object or beast, the hellfire can enhance the subject in a variety of ways."
466,,200,Energy Blast ,Marvel Civil War,Destruction,"Like Cyclops, Havok, and great many others, you are capable of unleashing a blast (either optic or from your hands). The blast’s nature is up to you, however overall strength is able to match the full power blast of Cyclops."
467,,200,December Winds ,Marvel 2099,Destruction,"You are able to project freezing winds which create ice in their wake. This wind is powerful enough to quickly cover a small room in ice, or cover metallic objects in the area in ice. Sustained use might be able to freeze people. Like most Marvel elementals you are immune to cold up to the limits of that you are able to create with this ability."
468,,200,Breakdown(200) ,Marvel 2099,Destruction,"Your hands hold the power to destroy matter with a touch. Whether through molecular destabilization or accelerated ‘aging’ of the matter, you could destroy a man, a car, or even an entire house with nothing more than a brief touch of your hand."
469,,200,Chains of Sin 2: Electric Boogaloo,Helltaker,Destruction,"Remember how the Chains of Sin weren't actual chains? Well now they are! You can call down gigantic chains with as many links as girls and guys you have in your harem. Each link is about 120cm wide, 190cm tall, 20cm in width, and are as heavy as they sound. They take one second to reach the ground and they hit the ground at terminal velocity. If you have ‘Chains of Sin’ then they activate on whoever these chains hit."
470,,200,Brazier of Bom'Galiath ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Destruction,"This brazier is a mystical treasure capable of combating demons and other dark spirits. For example Christine Palmer was able to use it to destroy the souls of the damned when they attacked Strange after he used the Dreamwalking spell. The more power you supply it with, the greater the attack. A normal human might be capable of killing a minor spirit while someone like Strange could kill a Lord of Hell or another truly powerful demon."
471,,200,Bloodaxe,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Destruction,"You have a copy of the Executioner’s Bloodaxe, a massive weapon capable of firing elemental beams of fire and cold."
472,,200,Energy Blast,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Destruction,"You can unleash fast, powerful blasts made of a type of energy (kinetic, elemental, generic, magical, etc.)"
473,,200,Combat Bender,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Destruction,"Since time immemorial, Bending has served as mankind's sword and shield - and now it's yours. You are unusually skilled in using your Bending in combat-shaping your element into lethal or non-lethal strikes, deflecting or countering others, even controlling a battlefield's terrain all come naturally to you. You are even able to adapt your forms into martial techniques, allowing you to use them in close combat even without your element. This runs both ways - should you know any other forms of martial arts, you can adapt your bending forms to them, letting you strike with your element.

Requires Bending Arts to Purchase"
474,,200,My Powers Work,Toaruverse,Destruction,"Fighting an opponent that is intangible or a being of pure energy would only tire you out or get yourself killed especially if your abilities and powers don't interact with them at all. Your abilities or powers now work on abilities, powers and beings that normally cannot be touched, interact with your abilities and powers or have conditions to defeat or harm. It doesn’t matter if your enemy is intangible or made of pure energy your abilities and powers will hit and kill them even if they have multiple bodies as killing one body would kill them all and if they have resurrection ability when you kill them they die permanently."
475,,200,Parrying Dagger,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A duelist’s dagger; offers increased melee accuracy and damage, particularly when countering attacks which are slightly more likely to be critical, and makes deep, bleeding cuts more easily."
476,,200,Duelist’s Pistol ,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A masterwork pistol; offers a variety of benefits, including increased ranged damage, better critical chances, resistance to being moved, and increased accuracy on the front lines."
477,,200,Lioness Warpaint,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"Blue warpaint made from crushed flowers found in the north; when used, it grants increasing bonuses to damage as the wearer takes on more and more wounds. "
478,,200,Piercing Quarrel,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A trio of spiked, wickedly sharp crossbow bolts. Offers a small boost to ranged damage and a sizeable boost to the odds of doing critical damage, and pierces a large amount of enemy armor."
479,,200,Veteran Gauntlet,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A gauntlet that has seen many battles; when worn it gives a small boost to damage, a more sizeable increase to the chances of stunning or moving a foe, and gives a small chance to daze an enemy with a melee attack, sending them reeling backwards or forwards."
480,,200,Crime Lord’s Molars ,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A bag of molars taken from various crime lords. A symbol of brutality, carrying these trophies makes the wielder do enhanced damage against foes that are bleeding, stunned, or singled-out for attack- dealing increased damage with each condition. "
481,,200,Sacred Blade,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A holy blade that gleams with light. Sharper than what should be possible, the light it gives off makes it easier to stun foes and tremendously increases the chance that its bearer will wax virtuous when brought to the edge of sanity."
482,,200,Confessor Gauntlet,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A wickedly-designed gauntlet that somehow exacerbates the wounds of bleeding foes when a blow is struck against them, dealing great damage and increasing the chance of causing critical damage. It also increases one’s accuracy, slightly. "
483,,200,Virtuous,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"“A moment of valor shines brightest against a backdrop of despair.” Driven to the brink, and yet not broken. When stress and fear come to claim their due many fall to their dark whispers, driven mad by desperation and their own will to survive. But you? You tend to surge through it- gaining a second wind, a burst of inspiration, the will to fight. Most stresses fade away when this happens, to make room for your new-found resolve, and even your allies will take heart when they see the shining beacon you have become. For as long as your good mood lasts you will strike harder and faster, words of courage and bravado flowing from your tongue to further inspire your crew."
484,,200,Magic Flute,Bayonetta,Destruction,"When you're in trouble, play a song to lift your worries! ...what's that, your worry is the enemies that surround you? Well you're lucky you're in this setting, then. Said to have been played by mythical Sirens, blowing on this instrument will deal a great amount of damage to any spiritual entity nearby. This item can only be used once every 12 hours."
485,,200,Kafka,Bayonetta,Destruction,"A bow made from a man who was cursed into becoming a horrible insect... hey! That's creepy to use this! You're creepy, man. ...anyway, this item fires poisonous arrows that can hit the enemy with plenty of sicknesses, and if you charge magic into it… well, you can start launching much more deadly arrows with a slow effect along with the sicknesses. That's probably not going to win you any friends, though."
486,,200,細鳳 Sai Fung,Bayonetta,Destruction,"I've heard of 'gun kata' but this is just getting silly by now. Who would use something like this? Accurately described as 'gun-chucks', this weapon is extremely fast both in firing rate and the speed they can be swung around. The bullets may not do much, but by virtue of their speed the rapid succession of bullets can stagger a great deal of opponents while even ricocheting the bullets off of surfaces."
487,,200,Durga,Bayonetta,Destruction,"Claws! Wonderfully armored claws of elemental might. It's a visceral feeling, to be able to tear into others with your own strength. These weapons are terrifying gauntlets that let you summon the powers of fire and lightning, granting a strong set of abilities. Fire is slow but powerful, while lightning is nimble but weak. By switching the elemental traits at the proper times, expect to deal terrifying damage to your enemies."
488,,200,Chernobog,Bayonetta,Destruction,"There's overkill, then there's this thing. It... okay seriously, what IS this thing. Why would someone make it. This scythe has not one blade, but three blades. That's right. Three. Even more strange, its wielder can fire off the blades akin to a rifle before the blades return back via the magics imbued within. It's a slow-moving weapon, but it has a lot of 'oomph' behind it. ...seriously, why would you need three?"
489,,200,Alruna,Bayonetta,Destruction,"I know there's a lot of weapons and equipment that require you to be flexible to use it effectively, but this is getting absolutely ridiculous. It's a pair of thorny whips that can be equipped to your hands or feet, and through excessive use of somersaults, spins, and other such moves can be used to enact a tremendous amount of crowd control in a 360 degree range around you. Even better, should you connect them to two enemies you could swing them to make them collide together or swing your whips to smash them into the ground! On the plus side, it's going to do wonders for your Yoga classes."
490,,200,修羅刃 Shuraba,Bayonetta,Destruction,"Go home, baka gaijin who dare to challenge whoever wields this sword. A demonically-infused katana, this weapon has an extensive reach and rapid strikes in combination with a notable damage potential... making it an all-around superb melee weapon that doesn't excel in any one aspect but is good all around. If you just want a nice, reliable weapon that won't let you down, this is the weapon for you."
491,,200,Impaler,Ragna Crimson,Destruction,"Another pretty straightforward power, it allows you to summon spikes from yourself or any other place you can sense, even creating ‘spike bombs’, balls of mana that will denotate into massive spikes. You can even summon spikes inside of other people and manipulate them as puppets. Optionally, you may instead purchase a different version of this magic, losing the ability of summoning spikes from other’s bodies in exchange of gaining a finer control over them and turning them into something akin to bladed whips, allowing you to finely control and twist these spikes as if they were your own limbs.

You may purchase this option again to gain the other version of the power, if you wish.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
492,,200,Drop Spark,Shovel Knight ,Destruction,"Release a projectile from your weapon/shield whenever you're feeling very healthy. It will be energy, however rather weak. If you kill someone just using it, it would take 30 hits for them to die. It does not matter where you hit them."
493,,200,Holy Sword,Trinity Wonder ,Destruction,"Emily’s world was not without its own share of powerful artifacts. Emily herself, before ending up in a different world, was part of a diverse group of adventurers. The leader of this company wielded a hardy Holy Sword. It was with this weapon that Ashhart was eventually killed by Wujin. Well balanced, extremely sharp, and impossibly durable, this sword really lives up to its name. It was even able to survive the desolation of the Eternal Twilight unscathed. Somehow or other, you have managed to get your hands on your own version of this sword. If you wish, this weapon doesn’t have to be a sword. It could be some other kind of bladed weapon, such as a spear or halberd."
494,,200,Flame Collection ,Generic Alchemist ,Destruction,"A collection of magical embers that can ignite into full flame when fed supernatural power. The flames produced are supernatural in nature and can be used to burn away elements within a material or object while leaving the rest of it intact, such as burning away the poison of wolfsbane but leaving the aspect that cures the curse of the werewolf. The embers themselves are only warm to the touch and will not harm the holder when ignited, allowing them to conjure the flames for other purposes as well, such as light, heat, or even self defense. Skilled users have learned to create patterns with the power they feed the flame to control how it manifests. Each ember produces flames with different properties."
495,,200,Essence Reaver ,League of Legends,Destruction,"This ornate silver rod comes attached to a chain. At first, it seems like nothing special, but when its bearer enters combat, the rod erupts with spectral energy, turning the rod into a scythe on a chain. When the wielder strike a foe with the spectral scythe, the Essence Reaver reaps some of their magical energy and gives it to the user."
496,,200,Wave Clear,League of Legends,Destruction,"You're good at hitting a lot of things at once with your magic. Whether through large areas of effect, sweeping lasers, or spreading fires, you have the skills required to take out large amounts of weak enemies at once."
497,,200,Banner of Command,League of Legends,Destruction,"This red banner stands out across the battlefield, making you a great boon to your allies. When you wear this banner, just being near you will bolster your allies' morale and their resistance to offensive magic, and can even be used to breifly give an ally complete immunity to magical damage."
498,,200,The Base Violence Necessary for Change,Arcane,Destruction,"Piltover fears Zaun - and not without reason. After all, if you keep kicking someone down, sooner or later they’re going to catch the boot and drag you down with them. You could be considered the very embodiment of Piltover’s fears, with your expertise in all kinds of things that go boom. In short, you’re a master arsonist and terrorist, with great knowledge when it comes to creating and using explosives in a fight, as well as just how to use such devices to make the biggest impact - practical or psychological. You can wield other kinds of violence with the same kind of artistry, striking at the foundations of public trust with vandalism, thefts and kidnapping, or targeting assassinations and raids to cause the most impact in an organisation. If they will not love you, they will fear you."
499,,200,Fisticuffs,Arcane,Destruction,"You’ve learned to fight the Zaunite way; rough and tumble, vicious, practical and effective. You know how to disable an opponent, how to use improvised or low-quality weapons to their best effect, and how to use distractions and dirty tricks to get the upper hand. Moreover, your practicality makes your fighting style easily-adaptable to different kinds of equipment, or the integration of new skills or supernatural abilities. Whatever you add to it, there’s no movement or effort wasted in your fighting style. You’re here to take down the enemy before they can take you down, and you’re damn good at it."
500,,200,Breach and Clear,Arcane,Destruction,"You have all the skills necessary to serve as an exemplary member of Piltover’s Enforcers. You’re well-practised in fighting in a dense-urban environment, and in using advanced and complex gear to its best potential even in desperate situations. In particular, you’re skilled in non-lethal takedowns and fighting to capture, and adapting your fighting styles to incorporate new equipment as you get it - and if you really need to, you can pull out skills in riot suppression to put down the rabble. Of course, it’d be better if they just stayed quiet in the first place, but capital peace isn’t going to protect itself, is it?"
501,,200,"Strange Sights, Strange Fights",Arcane,Destruction,"Runeterra is not a peaceful world, so it should come as no surprise that different cultures have developed many different fighting styles. With this perk, you become well-trained in one of these fighting styles, whether the martial arts of an Ionian Kinkou monk, the gladiatorial combat of the Noxian arenas, the knightly chivalry of Demacia, the guns-and-cutlasses battling of Bilgewater or something else. There’s nothing inherently magical about your fighting style, but it’s damn effective at what it does, and within a couple years you could be a real master."
502,,200,Goldryn,A Throne of Glass,Destruction,"You have a perfect copy of Goldryn,a large golden hilted sword, the pommel is a ruby the size of an egg. The blade of this sword has spectral flames that lick along it and it is a perfect channel for your powers. The sword is indestructible and supernaturally sharp, however where it shines is in channelling  fire magic, giving you more control than you would normally have."
503,,200,Spear & Arrows,A Throne of Glass,Destruction,"You have a wonderful horse spear and a bow with a quiver of 20 arrows. These are made to the greatest capacity of mortal masters, and withstand the rigours of combat with great grace. There are two special aspects of this set of weapons though, the bowstring never snaps or weakens, you could leave it strung forever and the power of the bow would never be altered. The other magical effect is that the quiver always holds 20 arrows, should you ever draw and fire one arrow another is immediately created to replace it."
504,,200,Intense Breath,Super Dragon Sword ,Destruction,"The breath of your Wyrm has intensified, becoming capable of utilizing the second tier of whatever element it is currently set to. In addition, it is much faster and much tougher than it was when you first hatched it.

Requires Wyrm Familiar(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
505,,200,Sword Burst,Super Dragon Sword ,Destruction,"Your mastery over controlled tears into the Rift allow you to create geysers of Psychic energy, acting as bursts of non-elemental magic damage that you can produce with an elaborate flourish of your blade. These geysers are more than capable of sweeping away weak enemies on their own, though powerful enemies are not affected by the kinetic force of the energy, they still take the damage."
506,,200,Wrestler,Super Dragon Sword ,Destruction,"You may not exactly be the most bloodthirsty out there, you know how to protect yourself. You’ve got the raw strength and expertise that, while not easily translated into barehanded brawling, is extremely useful for pinning and throwing enemies, capable of flinging grown men like pillows and arm-wrestling with a dragon…and having a good chance to win."
507,,200,Critical Blood,Super Dragon Sword ,Destruction,"You are capable of calling upon a deeper and more primal form of your bloodlust rite, sacrificing almost all of your life to enter a Critical state, with your vitality draining out till you pass out. During your Critical state, the sheer amount of magical damage your unarmed attacks deal is improved, almost triple the amount for a normal adventurer in this world. Your defense is similarly high."
508,,200,Avenging Blade,Super Dragon Sword ,Destruction,"Each time you take damage in a battle, half of the damage you take is stored up as “Vengeance.” You may use an elaborate strike to unleash the stored up Vengeance in one powerful attack."
509,,200,Hope Rides Alone,Super Dragon Sword ,Destruction,"The nature of hunting Gods means one is often put up against the wall, all your allies killed to a man and leaving you as the last one standing. At that last desperate moment…you blaze like a star of vengeance. When you are fighting alone with incapacitated or slain allies nearby, you take on the fighting strength of each of those allies for your own - getting a measure of their vitality and strength in a desperate and frenzied burst."
510,,200,Mighty Weapon,Dracula Untold,Destruction,"This is a sword/spear or any other weapon of your choosing. It looks simple, but that’s just for now. The specialty of this sword is that it grows with you, always growing just as strong as you are. It’s extraordinarily good at channeling whatever powers or abilities you have, or may acquire in the future."
511,,200,Warden's Sword,The Dresden Files,Destruction,"Hand-made by the Captain of the Wardens, these swords are famous in supernatural circles, and the last thing many an aspiring young Warlock will see, or at least feel. Pure silver, they're nevertheless harder than steel and sharpened to a supernaturally keen edge. They're also enchanted to cut through hostile magic, though there's gotta be something for them to cut for them to actually do the job. If you're a Wizard, you can choose to have it come with the job, otherwise, you can expect some serious questions if you ask about it. Either way, I'll throw in a gray, bloodstain-resistant cloak too."
512,,200,"""Demon’s Scar""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""This chaotic thing, the last flame kindled by a demon prince, is shaped like the claw marks of a demon. It is both a fiery bladed weapon, and pyromancy flame."" A special weapon that deals pure fire damage and can be used as a pyromancy flame, both unique qualities; it is incredibly lightweight, though not weightless, indicating that there may be a physical component to the weapon rather than a wholly inner one like most pyromancy flames. In addition to its use as a weapon and a catalyst, the weapon skill allows for the creation of a short- lived lava pool from the blade; a small hint at the life-giving Chaos that birthed demons long ago."
513,,200,"""Moonlight Greatsword"" ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Legendary dragon weapon associated with Seath the paledrake. Oceiros, the Consumed King, was infatuated with the search for moonlight, but in the end, it never revealed itself to him."" A sword infused with powerful magic that translates itself in every strike. Particularly strong slashes unleash crescent blades of magic. Stimulating the weapon with your soul can allow it to release powerful, crushing pulses of magic that can smash the enemy's guard or throw them off balance. Beware of drawing on the power of the weapon without supplying it energy, as this can cause the weapon to degrade. Keep it repaired and in good condition, and you'll have a powerful sword by your side."
514,,200,"""Splitleaf Greatsword"" ",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A long-handled greatsword that made its way from a distant land. Crafted entirely with steel, making it exceedingly heavy. Splitleaf refers to the shape of the great blade, and its resemblance to the veins of a leaf."" A heavy weapon- best wielded like a halberd in spite of its name- the Splitleaf Greatsword can be spun vigorously above the head, and then infused with magical energy for continued spin attacks that whip up wind and gain greater momentum and dizzying strength with subsequent attacks. This flurry of wind can even deflect arrows, though heavier or faster projectiles may slip through."
515,,200,“Ledo’s Great Hammer”,Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"“Great Hammer wielded by the Silver Knight Ledo. Ledo’s hammer is by far the heaviest weapon among those wielded by the knights of Anor Londo. Ledo, an eccentric who travelled across the outskirts, became a close friend to the giants and even Havel, the Rock.” An immensely heavy weapon made out of solid steel, Ledo’s Great Hammer is the heaviest weapon that can still be wielded by Undead of average size. The magic of the hammer allows it to call stones to it when spun, without increasing the weight of the hammer even further, that when slammed into the ground shatters the stones and creates a shockwave in the earth. A peculiar ability for a peculiar knight; perhaps it was his friendship with Havel that gave the weapon its affinity for the earth."
516,,200,"""Frayed Blade""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A dragon weapon symbolizing Darkeater Midir. The once-exquisite blade is now stained black, and frayed at the hilt. Without its sheath, it will soon crumble into nothing."" A nearly-destroyed katana that has been eaten away by the Abyss. Corroded to the point that the blade is at risk of breaking and requiring tremendous dexterity to wield as a result, this sword is capable of unleashing dark shockwaves along the earth when infused with magic. Those who plan to use this weapon will find it swift and merciless, light-weight, and capable of dealing great dark damage- though, they should probably pack some Repair Powder to keep it from falling to scrap."
517,,200,"""Divine Spear Fragment""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A fragment of the matching ritual spears once held by the knights of Princess Filianore. These Divine Spears were placed in the trusted hands of exalted Spears. When Spears of the Church face unduly treacherous foes, this allows them to draw upon former majesty, and summon a row of upward-thrusting ritual spears."" A unique magical tool and artifact of the Spears of the Church, normally only given to the most exalted of their number. When used it either summons a row of lightning-infused spears from the ground, or causes them to erupt around the user to spear through those who would disturb the Princess’s slumber. Although normally it can only be used to fulfill one’s duties as a Spear of the Church, this one can be used at-will. The fragment does not consume one’s magical energy or focus, but does have a short cool- down period between uses."
518,,200,"""Friede’s Great Scythe""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A great scythe wielded by Sister Elfriede, with a curved blade thinly coated by Painted World frost that easily breaks the guard of shields. In the painting, the scythe is a symbol of a long-lost home, possibly explaining Elfriede’s preference for it."" A copy of the unique, magical scythe wielded by the Unkindled known as Friede, or some say Elfriede. When wielded without anything in your off-hand the scythe is capable of conjuring a smaller duplicate of itself, allowing for one to imitate Sister Friede’s fighting style. Cold as ice, both scythes are capable of causing frostbite and can partially pierce through shields. When further infused with magical power they are capable of creating waves of frost, and even small explosions of biting cold. Just like the forlorn goddess who resided in the Painted World long ago, Friede believed that the peace of the painted world was something worth preserving. It is thus fitting that the Sister wields this weapon in effigy."
519,,200,"""Drakeblood Greatsword""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Greatsword wielded by an order of knights who venerate dragon blood. This sword, its blade engraved with script symbolizing dragon blood."" Resembles an ornate, but standard longsword. The engraving on the blade infuses it with the might of magic and lightning, infusing every strike made with the blade with the power of those forces. "
520,,200,"""Demon's Greataxe""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""This greataxe, a favorite among demons, contains the strength of fire. The demons, born of Chaos, harbor fire, and yet they are twisted and malformed, such that they were never meant to be."" One may stimulate the fire still burning within the large, stone axe with the power of their soul. Upon doing so, the axe becomes volatile, letting loose a fiery explosion on the next attack you make."
521,,200,"""Fume Ultra Greatsword""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""This twisted sword, the heaviest of all ultra greatswords, resembles black slate. This weapon, said to belong to a traitor from long ago, was so heavy that it found no owner, and became a forgotten relic of history."" The great, heavy, blunt weapon is so thick and strong that it can be used as an improvisational shield, and doesn't lack too much in that department. Its power only shines in the hands of someone or something with great strength."
522,,200,"""Witch's Locks""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A whip fashioned from the black hair of a daughter of the Witch of Izalith, creator of the Flame of Chaos. The long, shining locks woven together to create this whip are imbued with the essence of fire."" The whip has the power of flame naturally imbued in every strike. If stimulated with the power of your soul, you can bathe the whip in flames for a short time to increase its connection with flame and intensify its lashes."
523,,200,"""Irithyll Rapier""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"“Thrusting sword bestowed upon the Outrider Knights of Irithyll. Every Outrider Knight one day devolves into a beast, constantly hounded by Pontiff Sulyvahn's black eyes.” This sword is forever sheathed in powerful frost. It’s able to lock up an enemy’s body with cold and successive strikes to the same area can even inflict dangerous frostbite."
524,,200,"""Immolation Tinder""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"“Profaned Flame wielded by the Irithyllian witches, frigid spirits roaming the Boreal Valley. This torch, both a weapon and a staff, is enshrouded in an everlasting flame.” A very long rod with a head made of several jagged pieces. The head eternally burns with a profaned flame, which can explode off melee attacks or be projected in waves along the ground. Additionally, the giant staff can be used as a catalyst for Sorcery, and serves well in the role of a spellcasting aid."
525,,200,"""Onyx Blade""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Elfriede, the eldest amongst her sisters and leader of the Sable Church, bestowed this sword to her knight. Only, the sword was a farewell gift, and acceptance signified the knight's resignation from Elfriede's service."" Uniquely shaped greatsword baring two blades coiling around each other, the actual shape matters less than its special powers. Each strike is infused with a great deal of dark's power. Infusing it with a bit of your soul's power can temporarily awaken the blessing Elfriede placed upon it, covering it in a swath of black flames that burn and scorch with every swing for a short time."
526,,200,"""Darkdrift""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""A cursed sword with an unseen blade, the choice weapon of Yuria of Londor. Yuria, a mentor of the Sable Church and accomplished swordswoman, is said to have claimed a hundred lives with this weapon."" A katana with an invisible, ghostly blade. It has quite the deadly edge, but its true strength lies in its ability to pass through shields and armor as if there was nothing in the way."
527,,200,"""Wolf Knight's Greatsword""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Greatsword of Artorias tainted by the dark of the Abyss, and master of the wolf's blood of Farron. The wolf knight was the first Abyss Watcher, and his sword is more punishing against creations of the abyss."" A large, powerful blade like the Farron Greatsword, though a bit smaller and thicker by comparison. Proper technique with this blade equal parts power and dexterity. Like the Farron Greatsword, it cuts deeper and more harshly into dark or Abyssal enemies."
528,,200,"""Farron Greatsword""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Greatsword of the Abyss watchers, usually paired with a dagger. A dagger is utilized as a wedge in the left hand while the greatsword is held in the right, a unique technique that was synonymous with the Undead Legion. Confounds foes the manner of wolves hunting prey."" The greatsword is large, heavy, sturdy, and proves to be the bane of dark or Abyssal enemies, harming them more than others. It requires a surprising amount of finesse to properly wield for something so bulky, at least for true mimicry of Abyss Walker techniques."
529,,200,"""Morne's Great Hammer""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Greathammer bestowed upon Carim Knights who demonstrate outstanding strength and unwavering faith. Decorated by a ward of Carim Temple, and imbued with the twisted rage of Apostle Morne."" A huge mace with a head resembling a temple with the faces of gargoyles on the side, it is truly an intimidating weapon. Can channel the rage of Morne once buried in the ground to emit a bright, forceful shockwave in all directions."
530,,200,"""Spotted Whip""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Whip mottled with venomous-looking spots. Favored by some female pyromancers of the Great Swamp. As its noxious appearance would suggest, damage from this whip poisons its victims, slowly but surely guiding them to their deaths."" The living, flexible weapon can strike from unpredictable angles making it hard to defend against. The poisons dripping from its venomous spots means it doesn't need to hit hard to be effective."
531,,200,"""Frozen Soul""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"Inhabitants of the kingdom of Irithyll, of the cold and dark Boreal Valley, are used to weathering the cold. As a knight of the Pontiff, you not only embrace it, the cold empowers you and your armored form. By purchasing this, you become extremely resistant to any normal form of cold. Not only that, you actually project a biting chill from your body that can numb those used to warmth around you. (This can be toggled.) Your power over cold can be considered somewhat magical, as this perk provides a third ability. You may temporarily empower weaponry with cold, making every chilling strike bite deep into the enemy, even allowing you to induce frostbite with repeated clean blows to the same general area."
532,,200,Moonlight Greatsword,Dark Souls 2,Destruction,"“A wonder of magic recovered from the past, spoken about in ancient legends as being born from a great white being. The blade shines like the brilliant rays of the moon. The great, luminous blade behaves like sorcery made material, ignoring mundane armor entirely as if it was a magical spell. For those not warded against magic, it can cut at their flesh freely. Additionally, those who have the capacity to draw on its mystical abilities may extend their reach with waves and beams of magic to emphasize each of their attacks.”"
533,,200,Smelter Wedges,Dark Souls 2,Destruction,"“This is a small case, and when opened, reveals five crude iron spikes that have been flattened at the tips like stakes or wedges. Despite their less than impressive appearance, each wedge has great capacity for destruction against the likes of spiritual objects and magical constructs. By burying one in the center of such things, it may be sacrificed to bring about the object’s destruction, making it crumble as if touched heavily by the passage of time. Only the greatest of obstacles and wards would stop such things. The case will slowly replenish over time.”"
534,,200,Ivory King Ultra Greatsword,Dark Souls 2,Destruction,"“A huge claymore with a blackened and chipped appearance from being burned in malevolent flame. The righteous heroism of the former owner’s sword still clings to its form even now though. When wielded with both hands, a circuit is completed between the sword and the wielder’s soul. This completed circuit causes a great sheath of bladed light to emit from the sword, doubling its effective range. Should it ever be enchanted, this light will take on the properties of this new magic.”"
535,,200,Bewitched Alonne Sword,Dark Souls 2,Destruction,"“A great undulating blade like those originating in the east. Its long handle leaves it resembling the likeness of Sir Alonne’s own sword. The weapon as with many of eastern origin is exceptionally well made and sharp. More so however, when allowed to drink deeply with blood, the sword gains a menacing aura reflective of its radically increased lethality which it holds for a brief time thereafter.”"
536,,200,Old Sun Ring ,Dark Souls 2,Destruction,"“A bizarre stone ring, plated with gold and slotted with a sizeable ruby. Surprisingly weighty for an accessory, and just full of magic. When the one wearing it is repeatedly harmed, the magic within the ring is stoked, and a great, fiery explosion released from the wearer. The wearer will be unharmed, but nearby enemies will be set aflame and sent back. Although the ring receives minor damage, it automatically repairs itself over time.”"
537,,200,“Dragonslayer Greatbow & Dragonslayer Arrows”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Bestowed upon you is one of the dragon sniping greatbows used during ancient times, so large and powerful that it has to be braced against the ground before firing unless you possess the strength of a monster. The ammo of choice for these giant bows are ‘Dragonslayer Arrows’ that resemble spears more than the kind of arrows you’re used too. You get a trunk full of arrows that’s always full when you check it, giving you a virtually endless amount of ammo."
538,,200,“Demon’s Great Hammer”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A demon weapon built from stone Archtrees, used by lesser demons native to the undead asylum. Surprisingly well made despite crude appearance. Although it has no special powers on its own, its extreme weight means those who can pick it up can quite readily mash their enemies to a pulp. It’s also quite receptive to reinforcement."
539,,200,“Gravelord Sword” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Sword of Gravelord Nito’s servants, appearing as an amalgamation of warped boned with a blade sprouting out of it, all around the size of a greatsword. Despite its strange form, it is exceptionally dangerous. Not only does it make for a fine weapon under normal uses, it leaks a miasma of death from its edge that riddles wounded enemies like a toxin. For servants of Nito, attempting to inflict and spread death, few tools match this gifted sword’s efficacy."
540,,200,“Dragon Bone Fist”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A pair of dragon bone gauntlets designed for beating enemies into submission. Taking use of a transformed apostle’s greater strength, those who wield these see their fists transformed into lethal weapons. Those wielding these weapons are warded against magic and flame."
541,,200,“Murakumo”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Another weapon from the East, a great curved sword. It cuts like a katana, but has such size and heft that someone of incredible strength is required to wield it. As a result, it requires someone of incredible strength, skill and stamina in order to properly wield. The results are clear though for those who can, one smooth chop through most enemies."
542,,200,“Quelaag’s Furysword”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A sword just like Quelaag’s, perhaps scavenged from a distant world. Like Quelaag's body, the sword features shells, spikes, humanity and a coating of chaos fire. The majority of the curved sword’s damage is the result of the flames it ejects when biting into an enemy. That said, it grows even stronger if the wielder possesses plenty of Humanity/Darkness within them, like other Chaos aligned weapons."
543,,200,“Great Lord Greatsword” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Relic of Lord Gwyn, his great, large and mighty sword. It is the only thing he carried with him into the First Flame and sacrificed himself to prolong the age. How you obtained it is as mysterious as the flow of time in these lands. It is of incredible craftsmanship befitting the Lord of Sunlight, though has lost much of its great abilities upon his fall."
544,,200,“Drake Sword” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A mystical weapon born from the tail of a drake. Simply holding it somewhat wards against magic and fire. About the size of a shortsword, it can be easily wielded with one hand. The Drake Sword is able to release shockwaves of power at enemies that can deal considerable damage, but releasing such power tends to release backlash upon the weapon itself. Although made of strong materials and baring mystical powers, the crude craftsmanship leaves much to be desired when it comes to more threatening foes of this world."
545,,200,“Dragon’s Breath” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Drakes and dragons alike are fearsome beings for a great many reasons, and one of those reasons was their terrific breath. Most drakes are limited in a manner of speaking, at least compared to their greater cousins, but not in your case. You are allowed to pick your own breath weapon from those displayed by a dragon or drake within this world. Whether that’s fire or water, lightning or darkness, or even stranger breaths like crystals or miasma. Choose carefully, for this is permanent. Your breath weapon’s potency is at least partially fueled by your biology, but as an adult drake you could easily kill most hollows, knights and common threats wandering these lands with a good spray that can stretch from one side of a bride to the other."
546,,200,“Gravelord Vassal” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Gwyn and his ilk aren’t the only ones with Miracles prescribed to their names. Nito too has divine spells owing to his status as a Lord, and you’re aware of them. Nito’s Miracles are the Gravelord Sword Dance and Gravelord Greatsword Dance. Both are similar, causing gigantic red swords of energy to spear upwards from the ground, with the second obviously making larger and more powerful swords. Unique to this perk, you’ll receive adaptations of this Miracles. Ordinarily both variants have slow cast that causes numerous swords to spear up around you, and you would only be able to prepare a sparse few casts of each. With these variants, you may summon a single precisely aimed sword at a time."
547,,200,“Lambs to Slaughter”  ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A Dark Wraith’s duty is the collection of humanity to further their goal, bringing about an Age of Darkness. Their targets matter little as long as they collect what they seek, so choosing easy marks just makes sense. This perk allows those with it to more easily find, torment and slay those of naïve innocence or feeble heart. Their breath is like a siren’s cry to your ears while they’re in the area, leading you to them. Knowingly facing you in combat will demoralize and stress them out, especially if you stand in their way. As if even their body fears you, their flesh rends more easily than other foes as well."
548,,200,“Toxic Decanter” ,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"As a follower of the Fair Lady, you’ve spent your fair share of time around Eingyi, an outcast Pyromancer who delved into hideous poisons. In this time, you have learned much from your egg infested brother in service. You have an extensive library of knowledge centered around all manner of poisons and their applications. Where to find them, how to cultivate or mix them and the best methods for dispensing them in combat to leave your foe doomed. If you have a working knowledge of Pyromancies, you can likely use Eingyi’s teachings to develop Toxic Pyromancies. If you have Egg Head, your maggot gains the ability to metabolize poisons and eventually develop them into a naturally produced toxic spit."
549,,200,Rakuyo,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower. A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 

Able to split apart into a sword and dagger, or join together into a singular weapon with blades from both ends, it takes skill to wield properly. This unique style demands finesse and control to avoid hurting one’s self. The Rakuyo is also sentimental item of Lady Maria that was tossed away long ago.”"
550,,200,Church Cannon ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“An oversized weapon used by the Healing Church. A type of cannon that fires with a curved trajectory and creates an explosion upon impact. Originally designed for use by brawny men with deteriorated brains instead of ordinary hunters. 

A large ornate cannon with a strap that binds it to the arm, this weapon worked like portable artillery. While it's a bit less powerful than the ‘Cannon,’ it also consumes two less bullets and is meant to be used differently. 

Projectiles have a more predictable arc, allowing you to angle them over walls and obstructions to attack from unexpected positions. Still, this would require one brawny in body, and deft of mind, which certainly wasn’t the focus group this weapon was designed for.” "
551,,200,Piercing Rifle,Bloodborne,Destruction,"""A rifle engineered by the Oto Workshop, the precursor to the workshop of the heretical Powder Kegs. Designed for hunting in narrow streets, this weapon has been optimized to cause perforation wounds, but is unfit for reliably counter attacks. The long design makes it best used with two hands, though one handed use is possible at the cost of being a bit awkward. 

That being said, the advantages are clear; with this weapon possessing excellent stopping power and the ability to puncture multiple enemies with a single bullet. The aim for this gun's use should be crowd control, rather than quick and efficient countering, assuredly.”"
552,,200,Boom Hammer,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A trick weapon crafted, and used, by the workshop heretics called the Powder Kegs. A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. Its purpose simple, crush the beast, then burn them. 

This weapon is like the demented lovechild of a lighter and a warhammer. Wielded with one hand, it can be struck and ignited with the other, causing the furnace in back to glow and crackle with flame. When the ignited Boom Hammer is used to strike an enemy, the fire explodes out and torches them.”"
553,,200,Simon’s Bowblade,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Church hunter Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed. Aside from a few close friends however, Simon was scoffed at for his choice in arms. 

This miraculously dangerous weapon serves as a powerful sword in its default state, hacking through beast and human limbs alike with proper force. Its shape is unique, unseen in other designs. 

When transformed though, the sword splitting apart and forming into a bow with taught wire as a string, requiring strength to properly draw. You're able to transform a single Quicksilver Bullet or Blood Bullet into a powerful arrow with this weapon, and send it flying with surprising precision for its design.” "
554,,200,Tiny Tonitrus,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Tonitrus is a unique weapon crafted by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church; the Tiny Tonitrus is a similar implement. When stuck into the ground, it recreates the blue sparks that are said to surround the darkbeasts, sending them forth instead of holding them.

In more clear terms, when you stab this tool in the ground and activate the effect, at the cost of six bullets worth of blood, a line of blue lightning is called down from above to deal brutal damage to everything in a straight line for a considerable distance. The electrically vulnerable will be especially hurting after feeling the sting of Tiny Tonitrus's ‘sparks.’” "
555,,200,A Call Beyond,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“One of the secret rites of the Choir. Long ago, the Healing Church used phantasms to reach a lofty plane of darkness, but failed to make contact with the outer reaches of the cosmos. The rite failed to achieve its intended purpose, but instead created a small exploding star, now a powerful part of the Choir's arsenal. At times, failure is the mother of invention. 

This item is actually a Hunter's Tool which appears as a galactic slug, a phantasm really. At the lofty price of eight bullets worth of blood, A Call Beyond generates numerous orbs made of white energy that fly away from the wielder a moment after being called into existence. 

Soon after, they will home in on the wielder's intended target doing incredible damage. Due to how long it takes for them to form and subsequently home in on the enemy, this Hunter's Tool isn't good in confined spaces or at close range.” "
556,,200,Evelyn,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Special pistol used by Cainhurst knights. The Evelyn uses Quicksilver Bullets, just as any workshop firearm, but the Cainhurst variant relies more on Bloodtinge. 

What this basically means is that it and the projectiles it shoots scale incredibly with the quality of wielder's blood, especially once Evelyn has been upgraded with Blood Stones. The more ""potent"" the wielder's blood, the more stopping power it possesses.” "
557,,200,Stake Driver,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics called the Powder Kegs. This mechanical, arm mounted trick weapon manipulates a bladed stake to attack. There are two states of the Stake Driver, when the stake is extended, and when the stake is retracted, or ""primed"". 

When extended, the wielder has more range and can attack with sweeping motions, slicing enemies with the stake’s blade. When retracted, the weapon is faster to handle due to having more backward center of gravity, which allows the wielder to make quick punching motions and stabbing attacks. 

Additionally, while the weapon is primed, the wielder may extend it during an attack to drive it into an enemy, thus giving it its name. This namesake attack is both strong and fast, and priming the stake takes relatively little time. 

Through specific preparation taken during the primed state, the Stake Driver will unleash a powerful explosion on impact that will not damage the user. This attack often takes a few seconds to ready though, so pick your time appropriately.” "
558,,200,Tonitrus ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church. Striking this peculiar iron mace like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast, like a much more deadly form of static build up. 

Though possessing the lowest durability of almost any Trick Weapon you encounter here, it also has among the highest damage potential when the blue sparks have been activated. They don't last long, but there is no penalty for continuously lighting it up.”"
559,,200,Rally Kill ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Rally, the means by which a hunter heals their recent wounds with the blood of the enemy who caused them, usually anyways. It’s a term with connotations of back and forth action, perpetuation. The term for the end of a rally is the same for the end of a hunt though, it’s a kill. 

Ordinarily, Rally would provide fairly minimal healing by bleeding enemies out in the midst of battle, splashing your body with their life giving fluids. Now, your Rally has become far greater, and by slaughtering your prey, their blood will forcibly spray out over you and heal even grievous injuries.”

Requires Rally(Bloodborne) to Purchase"
560,,200,Firebombs,Demon's Souls,Destruction,"A bag of fire bombs, enough for 5 uses. Refills 1 firebomb every hour. Predictably throwing it produces a large flame."
561,,200,Dark Moon Greatsword,Elden Ring,Destruction,"A dark blue blade identical to the one ceremonially bestowed by Rennala on her spouse Radagon, this is a true artifact of legend given only on those deemed champions by Carian royalty. Cold and leaden, it is an incarnation of a beam of light from the full moon. By raising it aloft, the wielder can bathe it in moonlight-enhancing its attacks with magical power and imbuing the blade with numbing frost. And with great swings, waves of moonlight can be flung to smite all those who would doubt the night is dark and full of terrors."
562,,200,Sword of Night and Flame ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Forged by astrologers that considered the Fire Giants to be their neighbours, this elegant but deadly straight sword is honed in deadliness by both faith and intellect. It’s true power is to bring forth a mighty night comet with a swing-or with a more powerful sweep, release a burst of flame. A rare treasure entrusted to the Carian royalty, you must have quite the story about how you got your hands on this."
563,,200,Marika’s Hammer ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Oh, what a terrible sight. What a blow to the Golden Order, to even suspect the goddess Marika would strike blows against the most sacred symbol of her own authority. This stone hammer, made in the lands of Numen from outside the Lands Between and now brought to you by some strange quirk of the storm that sunders time, partially broke upon shattering the Elden Ring-becoming embedded with rune fragments. With a mighty smash from on high it can recreate the Gold Breaker: The signature attack of Radagon that releases the Erdtree’s light at all who would defy the Golden Order. As a weapon used to fracture the Elden Ring and directly imbued with a measure of its power, who knows what else it is capable of? 

...how curious, that the queen’s consort be so deeply entwined with his spouse that her weapon should share his attack."
564,,200,Blasphemous Blade,Elden Ring,Destruction,"It seems Rykard has had a bit of indigestion, for somehow he has spat up a copy of his sacred greatsword writhing with the remains of countless heroes devoured by him-and fitted for your hand. Boundtogether, however unwillingly, as family by slaying more with it you can recover health from the fresh life you have taken. And raising it aloft you can ignite the blasphemous flames Rykard breathed in a forward blast that robs life from those it ignites. Surely there is no greater symbol of Rykard’s hungering ambition-especially since it seems strong faith empowers the blade."
565,,200,Keeper of Ghostflame  ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Once, the cold flame in which death was burned was solely in the keeping of the Deathbirds. But others, through desperation or innovation, have discovered it can be wielded-and you have a special bond with this force. You are a vessel for Ghostflame, able to spread it, incorporate it into your attacks or magical abilities, and ignite your weapons or armour with it. Make no mistake-unnatural seeming though it may be, Ghostflame burns no less fiercely than fire of mundane character can potentially be empowered through symbolic rites of death. Or give substance and form to the souls of the dead-and even with the will of an untrained individual, direct them into vicious hexes."
566,,200,Rivers of Blood ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"It’s no secret than some of the greatest Bloody Fingers care not for Mohg’s vile ambitions, but have joined him simply after being lost in bloodlust and the pursuit of martial excellence. Whether or not you are one such warrior, such is your dedication to the way of the sword that you are capable of unnatural focus in battle-sharpening your mind to drown out the absurdities of the world, until the dexterity of your blade reaches beyond those of your kind in exchange for a depleted capacity to focus on other matters. Moreover, some combination of your own bloodthirst and the Arcane magics of Mohg soak any weapon you wield with this battle trance in several battles with a terrible curse that ushers forth unnatural, difficult to quench bleeding in your victims. And while horribly lethal to any mere soldier to come across you on the battlefield, even giants and drakes should fear a few well-aimed life-sapping cuts from your weapon."
567,,200,Insatiable Appetite,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"Dinner is dinner. Those who are picky in the Wilds may find stony hide and spiky bark to be a bit much to chew on. Luckily, you pick the plate clean - you have the ability to actually CHEW most things, for one. Indestructible metals such as the off-world Darksteel may prove difficult, but pretty much any mundane material can be chewed, swallowed, and digested...for minimal value depending, but even simply swallowing dirt and stone allows you to live on with your new sense of palate."
568,,200,Brimstone Trebuchet,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"A weapon of dwarven design, the Brimstone Trebuchet was created to harry the attacks of griffon, faerie, and wyvern by a devilish idea. While aiming is often difficult for a moving target, why not let the target come to the projectile? The trebuchet launches special ammunition that will be produced by a small forge at its side, which detonates mid-air when launched - creating a hellish storm of flaming stone and blistering smoke, enough to send weaker fliers to the ground and cloud the eyes of even dragons. "
569,,200,Steelclaw Lance,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"The Wilds bring their own problems. While many assault the mind and heart, a distressingly great many of them are caused by the fact that the Wilds encourages uninhibited growth, leading to massive hulking creatures with great amounts of natural endurance and vitality. This is a bit of a dark design to handle such problems - a lance that terminates in a seemingly innocent odd cone, but is enchanted to spring out and twist and churn when embedded in a foe, forming a dark spinning claw in the very depths of a monster’s gut."
570,,200,Manavore,MtG - Zendikar,Destruction,"Much like another particular invader, you are able to sustain yourself off the ambient mana of the local plane, taking sustenance from Zendikar's very life-blood - and that of any other place you travel to. You may consume the life force of the world you are in, slowly transforming the environment to dust as its life bleeds out. A small area will sustain a human-sized form for 24 hours and gift you with a single mote of colourless mana. The cost to the plane will scale with you as your size increases, but the area which you need to drain does not, turning it to lifeless dust far more quickly.

You can gorge yourself on the plane's mana to take twice as much sustenance, but this isn’t sustainable, killing the area you feed upon. If you encounter free mana, is also a possible for you to sustain yourself on it in place of food, drink and air. "
571,,200,Annihilator ,MtG - Shandalar,Destruction,"Red magic is the magic of change, of power, of destruction. Is it any wonder, then, that your offensive magics are so potent? All your spells which deal damage of some sort are noticeably more potent, causing more grievous injuries, reaching greater areas of effect, and all without any additional cost in terms of mana (or other power) necessary to manifest them. Where once you might have sent a lightning bolt to skewer a mammoth, now you’ll send a blast of electricity that would fell an angel or even a dragon with a single blow."
572,,200,BLOODTHIRST,MtG - Ravnica,Destruction,"If your opponent is weak, then they hardly deserve to be your opponent at all! Finish them off quickly so you can get round to some good old fashioned smashing of society. If your opponent is already damaged when you enter into combat with them, you gain a significant power boost, meaning that you can deliver them a swift and brutal end."
573,,200,HELLBENT ,MtG - Ravnica,Destruction,"People sometimes say things like “even a cornered rat is dangerous.” And it has an element of truth to it. But what they don’t know is how much more powerful a cornered rat can be! When out of all other options, you gain a significant boost in power. If you’re going out then you’re going out with a fight and a blaze of glory, taking as many people down with you as possible!"
574,,200,EXTORT ,MtG - Ravnica,Destruction,"The best way to win a fight is to outlast your opponent. Over the course of a conflict, you may choose to slowly drain the life of your enemies, to the extent where it’s barely noticeable at first. But over time, this will really add up, until they’re feeling weak and tired and you’re just fine."
575,,200,Manahilt Weapon,MtG - New Phyrexia,Destruction,"This black gauntlet-made of a metal other than darksteel- is used by some of the elven scouts in the Tangle, capable of turning the ambient mana into a cutting edge extending both forwards and backwards along the arm and a good distance past it. Perfectly suited to cutting through the more resistant vegetation of the Tangle, it makes trips into the lush hellscape much more survivable. If there was no ambient mana, you can supply it with a small expenditure of your own."
576,,200,Inquisitor’s Staff ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Destruction,"Wielded by the clerics of the Father of Machines, spreading the word of Elesh Norn, this staff allows the wielder to sap the life out of those struck by it, opening old wounds, or heal the allies of the user in a mockery of divine magic."
577,,200,Tormentor’s Scythe,MtG - New Phyrexia,Destruction,"A painful reminder to the Mirrans that being allowed to live in the Furnace Layer does not mean the Phyrexians under Urabrask will be kind to them, this scythe-like instrument can emit a searing, painful heat it's wielder is protected from, burning their enemies, and holds the strange ability to enhance the strength of their allies."
578,,200,Move Along Please No Tech To See Here ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Destruction,"The Order of Jukai, as a whole, maintain dominion over the forests of Jukai not out of any official mandate or permission, but because they’re the only ones able and willing to live inside a forest absolutely overrun with potentially hostile Kami. The reason they lack official clearance for this probably has something to do with the constant and consistent serial bombings certain fragments of their organization consistently are caught up in. And by caught up in, I mean causing. From here on out, for every iota of skill you gain at working with nature, harnessing its power, or even simply serving a Kami, you gain an equal amount of skill at breaking and destroying the technological “marvels” the Futurists are intent on putting out. At the same time, you also have enough skill at utilizing your supposed respectability that you could easily clear out a city block of its inhabitants, probably by claiming some minor flaw in the latest technology you need to deal with. Via explosions, preferably. "
579,,200,Beastmaster,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Destruction,"Of the many occupations of man, it can be argued that the hunter has the closest connection to Green. A skilled hunter can fell a great many beasts, and in turn follow the rules of nature by cutting the chaff to allow the strong to grow. You have years of experience hunting in the wilderness and the talent to become a legendary hunter. Through these many years you have grown accustomed to the language of beasts, allowing you to communicate with them on a very primal level. Animals whom you assert superiority over are inclined to follow you like a pack follows their family head. While you may not have the skill of a knight, your skill as a hunter makes you predisposed toward defeating more wild creatures. Lastly, your affinity with beasts grants you a special ability, those creatures born from nature of which you are able to conquer grant you a fraction of their strength to add to your own."
580,,200,Current Through the Cracks ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Destruction,"A scholar is often disadvantaged when faced against the sword of a reckless warrior or the jaws of a wild animal. When mind is challenged with brawn it is up to wit and ingenuity to carry one through a skirmish. You excel at finding ways to restrain or weaken the capabilities of an adversary. This can involve finding weak points, restraining their movements or even rusting their sword so it fails to harm you. This works especially well with magic as further knowledge adds to the number of methods you can employ and the range of targets you can affect. With this it is easy to win battles before they begin."
581,,200,Knight’s Bravery,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Destruction,"Paragons of honor and justice, knights are those soldiers who keep the law in check. Their martial skills are nothing to scoff at either, and neither are your own martial skills. You have been trained as a knight and have excelled under the tutelage. This has made you one of the best knights across the planes, through martial skill alone you could hold your own against entire bands of lesser knights and it would take a knight of legendary status to best you just in martial combat alone, your skill is sufficient to easily be knighted in four of the five courts of Eldraine with a good chance at the fifth. In addition to this skill at arms, you also find it effortless to weave spells in the middle of fighting with a weapon, not needing to pause as beat back enemies."
582,,200,Poison ,Warbreaker,Destruction,"Sometimes, a single death can prevent a war, or pay better than fighting in one. You have five doses of a poison that has never before been seen on this world, undetectable, causing death exactly twelve hours later. This replenishes monthly, and in future Jumps updates to continue to be unknown and undetectable."
583,,200,DEADEYE,Wolfwalkers,Destruction,"A normal person might well struggle to hit a fleeing wolf at a poor angle in the dark, or amidst a flock of sheep running every which way. For you the only question is where on their body you’d like to place the shot. With a crossbow or firearm, you never miss nor misfire."
584,,200,Bonebreaker,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"A highly-specialized discipline, this branch of magic allows you to break a target’s bones by touching their body with your fingertips. Bones broken with this power shatter completely, causing serious damage to the surrounding tissues and organs. Using it on someone’s skull or ribs would almost certainly prove fatal, as the shards of bone would tear through the victim’s brain, heart, or lungs. However, only the bones surrounding the area touched will break. To shatter the skull, you must touch the head, while breaking a person’s ribs requires touching their chest. The power can only be transmitted through your fingertips, but even the briefest and gentlest of touches can get the job done. 

Boosted: Ranged Breaking: Your mastery of this rare discipline has grown to the point where you can defy its only critical weakness, allowing you to use the power at range. You can now invisibly transmit your power from your fingertips in a straight line to strike targets at distances of up to ten meters. Each fingertip can fire a distinct instance of your power, allowing you to hit a single target in ten places at once...or ten different targets all at the same time.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
585,,200,Jumper Cleaver,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"Through some special circumstances, you have undergone training in the Cleaver program, turning you into the perfect soldier. This training has augmented you with lower-tier superhuman physical abilities (strength, endurance, speed, balance, etc.) and affords you the skill to wield the Cleaver scythes with deadly skill. These blades are made of woven razor, making them absurdly sharp and strong, while also causing injuries that can never heal. For some reason or another, the mental conditioning part of the program didn’t stick, leaving you with your independence intact. So while you might not be an actual Cleaver, you’ve got all the pros and none of the cons, so who cares? This perk comes with your own woven razor scythe, which may be imported into an appropriate weapon if you so choose."
586,,200,Lightning Slinger ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"The Dungeons contain all manner of weird and wonderful magic items and, while many possess familiar forms such as magic flutes or flying carpets, many more have an unusual form or function which isn’t immediately apparent to the people of your world. You now have one of these items which, due to your exceptional circumstances, you’d recognise as an ornate, golden flintlock pistol with vine-like decorations running along its barrel. Being a Magic Tool, though, this weapon doesn’t fire bullets, but something a bit more effective: Arrows of lightning.

A mechanism atop its barrel allows you to control the power and precision of its lightning, from wide yet powerful bolts capable of blasting apart whole swarms of monsters at once to weaker, more precise arrows that instead merely causes acute pain and temporarily paralysis. Fortunately, unlike regular flintlocks it doesn’t require a lengthy process to reload, simply requiring that you cock it before firing. As you may have guessed, this gun also doesn’t require traditional ammunition, but is instead powered by its inherent Magoi supply. More powerful blasts use up more Magoi, though any expended energy will replenish itself over time."
587,,200,Slaver’s Whip ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"While slavery is an incredibly well-established industry in many parts of this world, there is still one question that plagues even the most powerful of slave traders: What is the best way to train a slave? Though their methods range from simple repeated punishment to the unusual torture/maternal love combo of the Mariadel Company, all agree on one thing, though – you need to break the slave’s will first. And you’ve come across a tool perfectly suited to this job.

This whip, covered in tiny thorns all along its length, is a particularly cruel Magic Tool plundered from a Dungeon that not only causes far greater pain than normal in those struck by it, but also saps their mental fortitude. With each lash, the victim of this whip will feel their willpower grow weaker and weaker, and their desire to obey its bearer become ever stronger. With this, you could achieve the same results in minutes that most slavers would require weeks for. Be careful, though, for just as the wounds caused by this whip will heal, so too will the mental wounds it creates recover with time."
588,,200,Imuchakk Warrior’s Attire ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"In Imuchakk, a man only truly becomes an adult once he’s slain a Rampaging Unicorn, an enormous sea serpent which roams the northern seas, and brought its body back to his tribe. The Rampaging Unicorn’s horns and tusks are then crafted into a pair of items which serve as proof of that man’s achievements. Somehow, even if you’re a woman or not a member of the Imuchakk tribe, you’ve been bestowed them both.

The first of these items is a navy-blue headdress, decorated with designs of the ocean waves, with a pair of Rampaging Unicorn horns worked into the fabric. When worn, none will doubt your status as a status as a mighty warrior, and you can be assured you and your abilities will receive the respect you deserve. All but your most outrageous of boasts will be taken at face value, and none but your worst enemies would ever dare dishonour you.

The second of these items is a serrated harpoon cut from the horn of that same Rampaging Unicorn. Despite its relatively crude appearance, it’s sharper than any mundane blade or spear has any right to be, slicing straight through plate armour, and it’s incredibly durable too. What’s more, this spear is incredibly receptive to ki or magic you put into it, making it a prime weapon for techniques such as Magoi Manipulation."
589,,200,Household Vessel ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"Household Vessels are powerful items which essentially serve as weaker ‘children’ of an existing Metal Vessel. Normally, a Household Vessel is produced when a person forges a close personal bond with a Metal Vessel user, causing a Familiar of the Metal Vessel’s Djinn to imbue an object on the recipient’s person with a lesser version of its magic. Fortunately for you, purchasing this option grants you a Household Vessel without requiring you to befriend or even know someone with a Metal Vessel.

Like a Metal Vessel, the form your Household Vessel takes is entirely up to you, so long as a significant portion of it is made of metal. The powers Household Vessels possess are incredibly varied, though they’re likely to resemble those of their ‘parent’ Metal Vessel. For example, a Household Vessel made using a Djinn of lightning possess the ability to simply channel vast quantities of electricity or have a more unusual effect, such as using an electrical current to remove the limiters of your muscles’ power or even, bizarrely, covering your arms in draconic scales that act as a powerful armour.

All manner of effects are possible using a Household Vessel: Swords that manipulate wind to allow them to cut things at a distance; gauntlets that let you produce bullet- like shockwaves by punching; fans that can use water to heal people; leg chains that allow you to fly on enormous wings of flame; or even flutes that produce tones which let you befriend and control animals. The only real limit is what you can come up with.

A Household Vessel lacks a number of the stronger abilities a Metal Vessel has. In particular, it doesn’t allow its user to perform a Djinn Equip or Extreme Magic, and its magical powers are less potent than that of its parent.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
590,,200,Hihiirokane ,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Destruction,"A relic of the beastmen tribe, formerly wielded by Jubei’s younger brother. No one knows who it truly belongs to, or how it was created, or even why the beastmen have it. Even Nine, with access to all the knowledge of the Magic Association, doesn’t know anything about it other than ‘old’. But even if you don’t know anything about it, it does have a rather useful power. You see, this sword has the power to cut souls. I suppose you could call it an anti-ghost blade. As long as you’re holding the blade, you can even see any ghosts, spirits, disembodied souls that happen to be floating around regardless of your actual ability to do so."
591,,200,I Studied The Sword,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Destruction,"While magic is quite prevalent, lots of people grab a magic sword and then call it a day. Of course, when you have a sword personally made by Konoe Mercury and Yuki Terumi working in collaboration, that probably is enough to call it a day. Two of the six great heroes, Jubei and Hakumen, wielded those blades. But that said, I can assure you they did not call it a day when it came to their sword skills. Much like the two of them, you are now a master swordman. Maybe you utilize a style based on ancient teachings, or maybe you made one up based on your own abilities and that of your blade. Maybe you don’t even have a blade and it’s just pure martial prowess and whatever powers you have. Whichever way it is, it’s a formidable force."
592,,200,Honored By The Stars,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"A constellation representing you has appeared in the night sky above the worlds you reside on, though the truth of that stellar formation may be different on exiting the world. Shaped in a
representation of yourself, it is evidence to all those that can interpret the constellations, such as
magicians and divine beings, that you are a person with a great destiny for heroism ahead of you, one that may lead them to favour you or seek your support in light of your future importance. But
more immediately, the constellation is able to support it’s originator in the form of a limited
conceptual materialisation of itself. By pointing to the sky, a thin beam of light will shoot down near
instantly from your constellation, even in the day, and home in on whatever target you can see. Even
threading through the tiniest gaps to strike, the laser will only miss with magical intervention. The
attack does not have high power, though what it has is more than enough to pierce a thick castle
wall in an instant, and thus you will need to aim carefully. Only one shot can be called down per day
but should you be gravely injured or worse, the attack will automatically activate without you
needing to aim, homing in automatically on the enemy’s weakest point that you know of. "
593,,200,Diatrekhōn Astēr Lonkhē,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"Straightforward is sometimes the best way to go. Rather than rely on special capabilities that form
the core of a fighting style, the best course of action is to have a reliable weapon that enhances what
you can do even without it. The spear of Achilles does just that. A very well made weapon, with a
sharp and sturdy design, with high capability for use as a spear and a throwing javelin. It has two
magical abilities. The first is that the wounds created by the spear cannot be healed without very
powerful magic, so long as the spear exists. Similar to the red spear of the later Irish hero Diarmuid, the wounds this weapon makes become part of the normal state of any victim. 

The second ability is to create a bounded field for dueling. A battleground is created where it
becomes impossible for gods, outside help or luck of any kind to interfere in the battle between the
two combatants. This created battleground is a separate dimension, divided in space and time from
the outside world, ensuring any duel lasts just a brief moment to outside view. The rules of the duel
are decided on by both combatants together, but enforced fully on agreement, and the battleground
can only be summoned provided both agree with full knowledge of the details of this ability. Only
once one of the two are defeated can the field be escaped. "
594,,200,Rule Breaker,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"A jagged, seemingly made from glass dagger that clearly looks unsuitable as a weapon. A powerful
anti-magical weapon that while poor in combat, is superb in tearing down the workings of other
spellcasters. A touch of the blade is able to dispel and return to the original components any magical
spell, any enchanted item or person, magical contracts and bindings, magical connections and even
creatures made or maintained via magic. As the wielder of the dagger, what is affected by the
dispelling is controlled by you, letting you touch a summoned being to remove their contract
without banishing the summon itself. However, as potent as this dagger can be, it is unable to work
on magic of a great enough level, such as the more expensive items found in this list or similarly
powerful spells or beings."
595,,200,Harpe,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"Strangely shaped it may be, this scythe like sword is still a legendary weapon. Harpe is a powerful
magical sword with a inward curving blade, resembling a scythe or hook at the end, with an edge on
the inner curve. Supernaturally sharp as any magical blade is, the special power of this weapon is the
Refraction of Longevity, a divine attribute that allows it to deal wounds to any ‘immortal’ beings and
make it impossible to recover from with any means but natural processes. Regardless of the power
of the magic used, the wounds Harpe inflicts will not close up until and unless they naturally would. Needless to say, Harpe being used for killing blows ensures that the vast majority of immortals will
stay dead once made dead."
596,,200,Works of Death,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Destruction ,"Relics from a time of horrors yet to come to France. A room filled with torture tools and implements of execution fills your mind, an imaginary structure that can be made real as you reach in and pluck out the weapon of choice. Decapitating blades, racks, nooses, iron maidens, boiling pots of water or oil, even the soon to be famous guillotine. Dozens of tools are available and as you mentally touch each one, your mind fills with ways to utilise it in combat, rapidly summoning it partially or fully and making use of it against mobile foes. The tools are magically enhanced so that they perform well even on armoured knights and magical creatures, though they’ll grow sharper and deadlier the more lives each tool takes. "
597,,200,Nega Desire,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction ,"Desire is a part of your being on the deepest of levels, making your actions to spread it ever more
potent. Those you corrupt with that feeling of desire, both sexual and not, are actively twisted on a
much more personal level by the act. A magical corruption spreads as you do your work, affecting
the minds and potentially even the very core of any being you pervert, causing them to become
more and more subservient towards you, easier to violate further. So long as a being can feel any
sort of desire, they can no longer fully resist your wiles and efforts, piercing any magical protection
against the various ways you can corrupt others and forcing them to rely only on their terribly weak
wills. And once they begin to feel desire towards you specifically, they’ll find themselves beginning
to weaken against you, their powers fading in the same measure as their lusts and greed about you
increase. Your own being becomes immune to it all, impossible to charm or corrupt or seduce. You
are starting to represent the very concept of such, to try and corrupt you becomes like pouring
water into an ocean."
598,,200,Nega Saver,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction ,"They’re only there to ruin the fun, to save those that clearly protest any need of it. Would these
exalted savers let their own flock go against their will anymore than you try and protect your needy
children? They forget just who you were born to be and who it is you are best at tearing down. Any kind of religious figure, from a ordinary priest to the most holy of messiahs, is known to you. How
their minds work, their faiths, their flaws, their doubts and fears are all laid bare to your eyes. You
are the devil that challenges them on their path, to whom failure to resist will end their journey as a
Saver and render them yet another sinner. It is even easy to pretend to be one such being yourself, disguising yourself as a simple holy woman and preventing those without great insight from realising
your evil inner nature. To fit your role as the enemy, it is only natural that you are posited as a
mighty enemy. The powers of such religious figures and holy warriors are rendered feeble against
you, not entirely ineffective but reduced to a fraction of their heavenly might. To Shakyamuni you
may remain a little bug but in similar fashion the saints and enlightened ones of a smaller scale that
roam the world are like worms before you. Particularly since, as their powers fade, yours only
deepen. Significantly empowered in any action against these figures, it is any power you have that
would be seen as immoral, corruptive, evil or wrong that becomes many times stronger than normal. "
599,,200,Pashupata,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction ,"A Divine Construct made by the hands of Shiva himself, this tool appears as balls of light that float
around your person and can deliver powerful attacks in the form of blasts and beams of burning light. But these are partial uses of Pashupata. When fully activated and held aloft in your arms, the light
concentrates into a single point and radiates beams of light that attack all within range, easily able to
cover an entire battlefield. Any touched by the light may be crushed, a chance of instantly
undergoing Moksha. If they are unlucky, they will be forcibly removed from the cycle of life and death. The more divine a target is, the greater the chance of suffering death is, while the opposite
applies for anyone of a villainous nature. A tool perhaps not meant for war but effectively against
heroic forces nonetheless."
600,,200,Vishnu Baja,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction ,"The great gallery of weapons that the hero Rama was granted by the Sage Vishwamitra. Stored in a
dimensional pocket connecting to your being, you have access to dozens of powerful divine weapons
with a variety of magical effects, mostly focused on anti-divine and anti-demon combat. They’re easy
to wield for you, feeling natural in your hands, and this only improves the greater your divinity
becomes. Those with the blood of a demigod could easily wield multiple of these weapons at once, floating through the air around you as if through telekinesis. A full god could bring out even greater
power from each weapon and potentially have the two dozen or more tools all attacking at once!
While there are many legendary weapons held within, some appear as inferior copies, such as the
tools of Shiva himself. Vishnu Baja contains powerful tools but individually they would be more along
the power held by the Agni Gandiva or Sudarshan Chakra. "
601,,200,Vasavi Shakti,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction ,"The spear to slay gods, the one shot weapon of the Thunder God that has the legend of destroying
whatever it is used against. This enormous weapon, longer than a full grown man, is an exceptionally
capable tool to slay Gods. The spear itself is more than capable of slicing and piercing most targets
but becomes many times more powerful when faced against anything with Divinity, able to strike at
the very core of such beings and deal wounds despite their protections. But when a vast amount of
magical energy is forced into the spear, enough that a powerful demigod would feel exhausted from
it, Vasavi Shakti awakens to it’s true form. Shattering the thick restraints on the spear, an ungodly
fire is released in all directions, enough to vaporise the land for miles around. Just a side effect of the
power, the spear’s tip will unleash a ray of light capable of killing even the most powerful Divine
Spirits of the land if struck. This ray tears through all things, even magical concepts such as bounded
fields are erased by the power. With even more energy, the power could grow greater and greater. Once used, the spear will slumber in order to repair the damage it sustains from activation, unlikely
to answer your call for a day."
602,,200,Coat of Oaths,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"The official uniform of the Shinsengumi, a blue and white overcoat that carries the beliefs of the
heroes that fought for justice. Wearing it grants enhanced physical abilities, even a sickly young girl
can tear through expert samurai in full armor like this, and ranks up any armaments held by the
wielder. Swords take on a new name and form, gaining far greater cutting power and durability
while held. Other weapons vary, though the results is generally a significant increase in quality from
it’s current form. Once released, the armament will return to it’s original state."
603,,200,Boneless Man,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"A double-edged spear with a long blade, this appears to be quite a sturdy weapon. A button found
on the haft will open the head, splitting it into a cross guard and revealing a smaller blade at the end
of the spear, which can be a brutal finisher if the spear head happens to be impaled in someone
when you split it. But the Boneless Man earns it’s name not for being a trick weapon but for how it
cuts through men. Before the edge of this weapon, it’s targets are cut through as if they had no
bones. Swinging the spear head through a man would be like cutting through a bag of meat and
blood, treating the bones as if they were air to cut through. The defence nullification of the spear
extends to any similar skeletal form, removing the defensive properties of internal structure that
could be compared to bones."
604,,200,Boudica’s Sword,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Destruction ,"A sword that holds no promises of victory, yet remains both holy and strong regardless. Once
wielded by the rebellious queen Boudica, the straightforward blade has practical uses. It’s edge is
potent enough to cut even the best Roman armor easily and with only a slight amount of energy, it
can fire quick blasts of magic across a distance, even at a very high rate of fire. These blasts won’t
knock down castle walls but they can certainly tear men or horses in half with each shot. Calling on
Boudica and the glories of the blade can let you charge these blasts together, pouring more magic in
to create a much stronger attack. The more energy you give, the larger and more intense the blast
will become."
605,,200,Yew Bow,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Destruction ,"A crossbow crafted by the hands of one of the many who took up the Robin Hood mantle. Made
from the yew tree, each shot from this bow contains a terrible poison, which can weaken and harm
even a heroic spirit or powerful demon, with normal humans falling in moments from it’s effects. The arrows appear to the wielders hand when needed, allowing for quick loading for the bow that
can optionally fire at quite the rapid speed.

With a brief surge of energy and calling the crossbow’s name out, a variety of magical effects can be
utilised. The first and most lethal is that anything the next bolt fired touches, will see any impurities, diseases or poison in their bodies instantaneously amplified. Only a touch is required as well, making
defence difficult as the bolts do not need to pierce the enemy. The effect of this can range from
merely intensifying the existing effects and duration to creating an explosion like lightning up
gunpowder within their body. Alternatively, the same calling of the name can cause the next arrow
to create an area around where it lands that automatically transfers a weaker dose of the Yew
poison, strengthening as long as they remain within. 

Finally, through expending magical energy, the Yew Bow can create trees under the user’s command
that originate from Sherwood Forest. These can appear as roots that swarm and bind targets, originating from bolts shot by the bow, or as trees that appear and shape themselves to the
wielder’s wish from around their body."
606,,200,Draconis Destruction,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Destruction ,"People have been telling tales of you, the dragon slayer that wanders from town to town, slaying the
satanic beasts that torment them. Perhaps not entirely true, you’ve not yet met a true dragon, but
you have slain plenty of mighty draconic creatures so far. In fact, you’ve slain so many that it’s begun to affect your being. Your attacks tear through draconic beings like they were made of paper,
ignoring their resistance to physical and magical blows and even ensuring that these wounds stay
unhealed for lengthy periods of time. Your very presence is enough to unnerve even true dragons
and lesser creatures will fear terror well up in their hearts, should you intend hostilities. 

Curiously, you also have a curse of sorts that allows you to transform other living beings into
draconic creatures, activated by focusing your mind towards a being that you are in contact with. It
seems like a way to make them vulnerable to your powers but perhaps certain folk may find other
uses. Finally, you also have the ability to detect if a being is good or evil according to the rules of the
religion you follow, though surely no dragon could be anything but an incarnation of the Devil. "
607,,200,Starmine and Starbow ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"Some Magecraft works through things like the manipulation of one’s time, thoughts, or other esoteric methods designed to eventually form the path to the Root. You just charge up magical energy and use it as bullets by using a system of processing, converting, and then making output of prana through numerology. In less complicated terms, you direct magical energy towards creating a desired mental image or interference into reality - usually things like magical bullets or things that otherwise act as destructive spells based on what you enjoy visualizing most. In addition, you can root yourself into the ground to absorb a high amount of magical energy, or lock onto targets for your bullets with concentration, guiding the shots. It’s a straightforward magecraft, capable of little beyond offense and disruption - but sometimes that’s all you need, isn’t it? With enough speed and magical energy, someone using this art could act as a living human-sized force of destruction and disaster - though it does little else on its own. You’re an expert at this particular, simple magecraft, able to lock and fire shots with great accuracy and a good amount of offensive power, as simple as firing a gun you’ve known for an entire lifetime.
"
608,,200,Blooming Terrorist ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"Taking a knife to someone poses so much unnecessary risk. Getting that close means they have a chance to fight back against you, it means you’ll be at the scene of the crime. Much better to use a more refined, civilised method of murder. High explosives. Most specifically, high explosives in the ways a terrorist bomber would make use of them. You have world class ability with all kinds of explosives, even finding yourself unnaturally talented with explosive magecraft spells, and your best skills lie in using your explosions to cause the emotions you desire. A righteously placed bomb that only spurs a riot of people who feel victimised on, a horrifying explosion that causes fear across the city despite causing no deaths, something to warn and force people to get ready without causing undue terror. Placing these explosives stealthily, even in high security areas, is no major issue for you and you rarely leave many traces. You’re also very good at selling these skills, and any other less savoury abilities you have, to the highest bidder. Finding these clients, picking which ones aren’t a trap and making sure you get paid and maintain good relationships is all in the toolset of a career bomber like you.
"
609,,200,Biedde's Blade ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,A blade with a pristine polish. A cut from this blade will not cease bleeding until the wound is forcibly closed.
610,,200,Lantern Festival ,Sonny,Destruction,"Now you may be wondering: what is a lantern? Well here it shares the ordinary meaning, and it also describes a type of odd glowing mace-wand combo. You have a good, solid collection of lanterns for every element. You have ones for arcane, shadow, electricity, so on. They give a modest amplification to attacks aligning with that element, and despite the heavy club-like design, they aren’t all that great for physical attacks. Every time you enter a new world, you’ll get a set of lanterns aligning with the new elemental system, so long as you can cast those elements yourself.
"
611,,200,ZPCI Sniper Rifle ,Sonny,Destruction,"This ZPCI rifle is a very good magical focus. It provides a modest boost to your speed, strength and durability, but the main draw is that it’s a powerful focus for fire magic. Not the greatest by far, but better than the average stuff.
"
612,,200,Mending Beacon ,Sonny,Destruction,"This Lantern is a focus. It functions well to increase your mana capacity, and slightly increases your speed and durability on top of that. It’s not much, but it’s good and versatile. Unlike other lanterns, it’s also actually decent for bonking someone over the head, though it’s still not a fantastic weapon.
"
613,,200,Weapon of Power ,Generic Magical Girl,Destruction,"This magical weapon has some additional powers, like being able to chop through concrete walls like butter, or parry incoming magical attacks. If it's a thrown weapon, it will always return to your hand afterwards, and ranged weapons like bows and guns will shoot magical blasts instead of arrows, so you never have to worry about running out of ammunition.
"
614,,200,Magic​ ​Weapon​ ​,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"This blessing of Silver Millennium technology is a powerful magical enhancer. It can send blasts of energy, powered by only your emotions, at foes in a great attack. This weapon can range from a lightning rod that extends from your tiara that sparks with energy, a magical chain that can strike with the force of comets, and other things. You carry one weapon on you that is powered by your emotions and serves to augment your attacks. You may import any weapon into this slot. This item also receives the same boosts of power you gain during this jump.
"
615,,200,Sword​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Silver​ ​Crystal​ ​,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"This pale, white silver sword glimmers as if it’s illuminated in moonlight. This is a powerful anti-evil weapon. When this sword is used to pierce someone with evil or selfish intent, it can slice through their magical defenses like a hot knife through butter. In addition, it’s tough, tougher than diamond.
"
616,,200,Sword of Night ,DC Occult,Destruction,"​An ancient artifact forged for a great hero in another dimension. The Sword of Night possesses several powers. First, it is, of course, a very sharp blade and it will always remain so, never rusting or dulling. Among its other abilities are the ability to sense danger and warn its wielder of such, the ability to force people to speak the truth, and the ability to restore its wielder to their prime and keep them there for so long as they wield it regularly.
"
617,,200,Hymir’s Finger ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"Also known as Iron Will or Broken Iron when, er, broken. This stupidly big blade is taller than most grown men and legendarily impossible to wield. Heavy, slow and nearly completely blunt, this weapon is more an iron pillar in the vaughe shape of a sword than an actual weapon designed for humans. But if you do have the strength to wield it, oh boy. Blunt or not, the sheer weight and momentum will fucking split people in half and the the lenght of the sword means that when you swing it, everything generally in front of you is fucked. You can kill an entire mob of enemies in one blow. Plus, it’s magic. Did I mention it’s magic? Cause it’s magic. If you hold it above your head and focus, you can set off a big-ass two stage explosion from your body. Doesn’t hurt you but it does hurt everyone near you. "
618,,200,Dragon Bone Blade ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"A sword carved from dragon bone, obviously. Now, normally bone weapons are a terrible idea when alternatives like metal or stone are available, but in this case that’s not true. Thanks to the toughness of dragons, this blade is incredibly durable, as well as sharp, and will never lose its edge. It can easily slice through steel and stone. Not only that, but it’s infused with the magic of dragons, meaning that it can hurt Intoners and anything else with a weakness to draconic magic. All in all, a very good sword.
"
619,,200,Weapon Summoning ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to always be ready to fight? Your Weapon can normally only be summoned by itself and as a singular entity, but not anymore. You may now summon as many copies of your weapon as you have the energy for, creating your own unlimited works of weaponry. The extra copies tend not to last very long after being used, but if nothing else, you won’t be empty-handed in a big fight.
"
620,,200,Trick Weapon ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to see the look on their faces?​ A spear that can detach pieces of itself and be controlled with your mind? Maybe a hidden blade or chain somewhere? Regardless, your weapon has a ‘trick’ behind it that can make your fighting style more unpredictable, and this ‘trick’ is aided a little by your magic. This can make challenging you in melee (or even at a range) a more difficult prospect."
621,,200,Scroll of the Cursing Word ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"Created as a way to deal with enemy spell casters without wasting the energy of the wizard himself, these scrolls were created to kill those who try to cast a spell in the users’ presence. When the incantation upon the scroll is read out, it will activate and attack any who are actively using magic within the surrounding area. Those who cast in this time will find their lungs filled with burning sand and their mouths filled with biting dung beetles. The scroll is used up by this and will replenish its use a day later.
"
622,,200,Ancient Traps - Boosted (Magical) ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"An extra 200TP will imbue every trap with magic and add new magical spells as traps. Rooms that cast powerful death magic at any who pass the gates. Spears from the floor enchanted to pierce even the thickest steel. Halls that flood with lava or poison or dangerous necromantic energies at a single false step. (CG Note: Requires base Ancient Traps - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
623,,200,Nameless Phantasm ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"You have the ability to create cards containing nameless phantasms, manifestations of black shadowy weapons. The cards can be activated to take the form of any weapon that you choose on when making them. In terms of power they will be the equivalent of five times stronger than a mundane weapon but will break after one use. Making a single card is the act of a few minutes.
"
624,,200,Great Fang ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Destruction,"A pale sword, crudely shaped but sharp enough to cut through the armor of man-filth and stunted dwarf alike without ever dulling its edge. The Great Fang was first ripped from the jaws of an old Dragon Ogre Shaggoth, and over generations was beaten and chipped away by the Bray-Shaman until the already sharp bite became like a razor. Carved and painted with blasphemous and filth-ridden runes in the Beast Tongue, the Great Fang was complete - and has now come to your hands, against all odds.
"
625,,200,Stonecrusher Mace ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Destruction,"A massive, heavy club - its head ringed in bands of bewitched iron, and the steel mockery of a Caprigor’s head at the tip. Enchanted by a Bray-Shaman, this mace is a symbol of the Cloven Ones’ desire to unmake all that Man has created. The club itself is, unfortunately, average when it comes to pulping flesh and cracking bone. It is when the wielder brings it to bear against barricade, against siege weapons, against castle walls and church columns, that it shines and earns its name Stonecrusher. Stone brick turns to brittle powder, wood and forged metal splinter and bend like clay, and monuments reduce to rubble when Stonecrusher is brought against them. All that resists Chaos will be sundered."
626,,200,Rune-Tortured Axes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Destruction,"It’s unclear what culture these shining, rune-covered axes came from. Buical strength and killing instincts,turning an already-frightening opponent into an almost apocalyptic terror - and all abilities geared towards murder and destruction are likewise enhanced, with an attack that could kill one instead killing dozens, or destroying a building becomes destroying an entire block.Strangely, you have enough reason in this state to direct your wrath to those you feel deserve it, avoiding allies and what you deem unnecessary collateral or sadism, and can snap out of it at will. Your kin might be a bit jealous you can so easily free yourself from being rabid...but does that really matter?
"
627,,200,Staff of Panthalassa ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Destruction,"The replica of a legendary weapon used by the clan. It grants the user enhanced physical strength and helps balance the flow of magic in his body. You can also use it to fire bursts of energy or create shields around you and companions.
"
628,,200,Bright Gear ,Dog Days,Destruction,"Your Crest power made manifest as a weapon. This weapon will have some special effect in line with your speciality in magic. Alternatively you can choose to have one of the casts’ Bright Gear. Do note that it is the user, not the Bright Gear that matters in terms of power."
629,,200,Sacred Relic ,Dog Days,Destruction,"A hero's weapon for sure. This magic weapon is stored within a ring and can manifest in an instant. This weapon is especially good for channelling Crest magic, making the use of such much easier. It can be any type of weapon you want, even a gun if you really want but will use mana instead of bullets. You may optionally choose to import a weapon into this slot
"
630,,200,Arcane Attacker ,Generic MG,Destruction,"Let’s face it, shooting your enemy before they can punch you in the face sounds like more fun than getting punched in the face.

You shoot bolts of magic, maybe from your hands, or maybe from a crossbow or bow. It doesn’t exactly matter what you’re using.

You start off with a basic magic attack at range, and with time and practice can figure out new attacks and tricks to make your enemies lives unpleasant (and hopefully short.) The basic shot starts with the power of a rifle shot, an effective range of a couple blocks, and a fire rate of one every other second, on average.
"
631,,200,Melee Master ,Generic MG,Destruction,"You are a martial artist of some sort. Whether that be through a sword, staff, nunchucks, or some other weapon, you get up close and personal with your opponent before beating the stuffing out of them (potentially literally.)

Or maybe you follow the path of Hibiki Tachibana, Kokoro Aichi, and Subaru Nakajima and just CAST FIST. Either way.

You gain proficiency in one martial art, as appropriate for your weapon. Not true mastery, but that will come with time and practice. You also receive a bit of experience in a few related styles, just so you have a few options if your normal moves aren’t working out.

This package also doubles your strength and triples your toughness when active, because you are going to be getting hit quite a bit when you go to zero range. At this level, it takes rifle rounds or similar to leave bruises, and your blows hit like a car crash.
"
632,,200,Long Tom ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"A trusty old cannon that has been modified for shooting upward, perfect for attacking flying boys in clouds. In fact, the cannon ignores all laws of physics, such that cannonball may fly straight up for a mile in a perfect line with no gravity, wind resistance, or anything else hindering its course. Regardless of damage or location, if a shot comes within ten feet of a group of targets, the individuals will be swept away by wind and scattered, and will be unable to reunite with each other for five minutes. Must be loaded manually for each shot, but has unlimited ammunition.
"
633,,200,Woodsman’s Axe ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Destruction,"An ancient heirloom dating back to the time when the High king was saved from assassins by a band of woodcutters this two handed axe is far more than its plain and simple appearance would let on, the axe heavily enchanted to slice through flesh and steel as easily as it slices through wood, and the weapon itself is incredibly light to boot.
"
634,,200,Croquet Equipment ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"Everything you need for a good-fashioned game of croquet: a mallet [flamingo] and a ball [hedgehog]. While generally acting like normal wild beasts, both the flamingo and the hedgehog can function as weapons – a hammer and a projectile accordingly. When used as weapons, the animals take no damage even when they strike targets. The hedgehog works quite well as a ball, in fact, and can be hit/fired/rolled long distances. You could even use the flamingo to bat projectiles, whether your own or an opponent’s. While you can easily handle the animals without much fuss, others trying to use them will find the beasts quite finicky and troublesome. Should you already have a hedgehog or flamingo of your own, you can substitute them as those respective equipment pieces.
"
635,,200,Quarrelsome Crossbow ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"Warped crossbow that is aimed backwards and shoots insults for projectiles. By shouting insults and taunts at a target while aiming the crossbow, the words will fire at the target, with your accuracy and damage determined by the wit and sharpness of the insults. The weapon has potentially limitless ammunition, but you can’t use the same insult twice against a specific target.
"
636,,200,The Bow of Apple Oak ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Destruction,"A renowned weapon wot’s said to have belonged to the infamous Daergal Corngold: A foul-tempered farmer with both supernatural woodcarving skill, and a habit of opening fire on any potential intruder to his fields. This ancient bow, carved from the boughs of a magical apple-oak tree, can hit a target at nine-hundred-thirty paces with barely any effort, and seems to make every arrow fired from its strings multiply into four arrows mid-flight."
637,,200,Golden Blowpipe of P’Toohee ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Destruction,"An uncannily accurate and magically long-ranged blowpipe which always has another (immensely poisonous) dart in it after firing.
"
638,,200,Hail to the God of Fire ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Destruction,"The Fire Mouth is an immense volcano found within the Ogre Kingdoms. It erupts quite often, spewing lava throughout the valleys. A tribe of Ogres started to believe that this great mountain was a God, similar if inferior to the Great Maw itself. Given the existence of other, genuinely living mountains within the Ogre Kingdoms, perhaps they are right. These Ogres devoted themselves to the mountain, eating the blood that split from its body. But even an Ogre cannot eat a handful of magma without dying.

Except some did not die. Some emerged from the volcano’s caldera with incredible powers of fire, bleeding lava when cut and espousing the faith of the Fire Mouth. Now, any Ogre may try his chances to join the ranks of the Firebellies, the believers of this cult. You are one such believer. You can spray fire from your mouth, control the Lore of Fire that grants you destructive fire magic, bleed and spray molten lava on foes when your skin is pierced and shrug off all but the hottest of flames. You are a terrifying sight on the battlefield, wreathed in smoke and fire with glowing eyes and a mouth dripping with molten rock. There’s no denying the horrific toll you can wreak upon the enemy with your powers though.
"
639,,200,Great Gutgouger ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Destruction,"An immense pole arm, similar to the one wielded by Bragg the Gutsman, most feared Ogre alive. A long stick of sturdy wood with a chain at the end, which is attached to perhaps the sharpest and largest hook ever made. A swing of this unnaturally sharp hook can slice through an Ogre like paper, cut magical armour in two or even bisect the horns of a Stonehorn. You’re experienced in its use, enough that you never need fear cutting yourself and you are able to easily direct it against particular limbs or spots on your opponents.
"
640,,200,Oblita’rator ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Destruction,"A monstrously large weapon with a heft so great that even normal Greenskin Bosses would struggle to move it. A slab of dull steel blade which is as long as a wagon is wide, about five to eight feet, which smashes more often than it’s dull edge manages to cut. This heavy weapon is meant to be wielded with two strong orc hands behind it, though a strong enough Big ‘Un could wield it one handed, and it is a weapon that could ruin most folks' day. The weapon has a special property to defeat things like the wardings of luck, magic, and other features. Pure armor and skill is the only thing that can turn this massive weapon away from your foes.
"
641,,200,Defender of the Wild ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"So adept is the Amber Brotherhood at the defense of untamed lands that Imperial nobles with large estates will often offer the Order a hefty sum to acquire the services of just one. They will not find you wanting, as you fight like a Magister possessed so long as you do so in defense of uncultivated, wild grounds. It would take perhaps fifty filthy Gors to equal you when you fight defensively to protect the wilderness from the taint of Chaos. These lands need not be “unowned,” merely “untamed.” An abandoned mansion will not work, but a section of a national park that sees no human alteration would."
642,,200,Burning Blade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"The first Patriarch of the Bright Order led a unit of Greatswords before Teclis recruited him, and even now the Bright Wizards often carry large weapons designed to work in tandem with their spells. In your case, this is a wickedly sharp greatsword, constantly wreathed in flame. So hot does it burn, in fact, that it would cauterize the stump of a Troll’s arm as you severed it, making regeneration of that limb impossible.
"
643,,200,Storm Banner ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"Even the skaven craft banners and flags, much as the other races do. Into these banners are frequently woven magical auras and spells - that the flag-carrier becomes more than just a rallying and coordination point. This one in particular was made thousands of years ago, and while tattered and worn it still bears the power its weaving Seer imbued into it.

You have the Storm Banner, which immediately causes the skies above its carrier to begin roiling and darkening with storm clouds. Upon raising the banner high and yelling, the banner will cause the storm to begin erupting upon the battlefield. Lightning strikes, thunder-claps, and harsh winds that can blow even cannonballs off their trajectory. The storm will last as long as the conflict rages - dissipating when the air of violence fades from the battlefield.
"
644,,200,URUGAN CANNON ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"The conditions in Kislev make it difficult to maintain firearms but the cannons of Erengrad are every bit the equal to those of Nuln. The Urugan Cannon consists of several small, light barrels and a protective screen allowing men to fire it safely and giving it a great deal of manoeuvrability. It fires a virtual hail of lead shot, filling the air with whistling death. The only issue is wasted ammunition but fortunately this one has been cleverly enchanted not to run out or need loading.
"
645,,200,Mithrite Foci ,Endless Legend,Destruction,"A pair of wands that only work when impaled in the wielders hands, these shards of raw Mithrite channel emotions in raw form. With these, you can now hate someone to death. The stronger your emotion, the stronger the effect. The effect of each emotion is purely dependant on the caster. Maybe they have a fiery anger, or a frosty hatred. It is unique to each caster. I am a fan of the wrath that comes to the surface like a volcano, coating in enemies in molten hate.
"
646,,200,Fencer’s Blade ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Destruction,"One might argue that, as a mage, you have no business being within melee range of anything. Maybe that’s true, but such is not always your choice. For those times, there is this magical weapon. While the blade has a, sort of ‘will’ shall we say, that refuses to function when you also hold a shield, it otherwise guides your arm with the skill of the most peerless of swordsmen. Not the strength, mind you, just the skill. Pure DEX.
"
647,,200,Supernatural tactics ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Destruction,"The mages of the Adamantine Arrow are not police, nor are they a riot squad. They are a tactically deployed strike team and their targets are almost always supernatural in nature. Whether they are rogue mages like Banishers, the traitors that comprise the Seers of the Throne, or the cornucopia of other monsters that dwell in the world of darkness, Arrow mages will likely have to deal with them all at some point...if they survive long enough that is. You have been trained in how to fight nearly all the enemies mages face on a regular basis. You know what does and does not work on vampires and werewolves as well as the best ways to hurt, or escape from them. Against other mages you have been trained to identify their casting ability and to use your own magic in creative ways to counter or overcome their spells.
"
648,,200,Flying Spin Attack ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Destruction,"The Knights of Hyrule have long since been their elite fighting force, the best armed, the best trained. One of their ‘secret techniques’ is the spin attack. It’s a fairly easy thing to learn, and with a touch of magic, can turn from a simple spin to a deadly ring that cuts with ease. You however, turn this to a different end, utilizing the spin not to generate more force, but to generate thrust. That’s right, by utilizing the Spin Attack, you can fly for a very brief period of time. And by brief I mean a scant few seconds. Still, a few seconds is enough to force you upwards your own height two or three times over, and that is more than enough to put you somewhere you aren’t particularly supposed to be. Sadly this isn’t so good for distance, and so cannot be used to cross gaps - more than anything else, it’s primary purpose is to go up.
"
649,,200,Flowing Quiver ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Destruction,"This quiver has a simple but very effective enchantment, excellent for any warrior hoping to use a bow for long range engagements - it never runs out of arrows. As long as you reach to pull another arrow from it, there will always be one to nock and fire, though these arrows by themselves will never be abnormal in any meaningful way. You’ll have to rely on the bow itself to make any adjustments.
"
650,,200,A Weapon of Shadow ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Destruction,"Similar to the Trident that Ganon pilfered from the great pyramid, this weapon will be capable of channeling any magic that you can cast through it with one additional benefit. It can also store magical unused energy of yours that would normally go to waste, acting as a battery of sorts. If lost it can be summoned back to your hand, and it would take quite a bit to break... such as a strike from some mystical (or other serious) weapon or ability. Normal weapons would not even be able to scratch it’s surface, making it quite handy as a villain’s main weapon of choice. It’s form may take the shape of a Spear, but if you prefer it to be a different weapon you may choose it’s form and function. Such a form can only be reset at the start of each successive jump.
"
651,,200,Barrier Buster ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Destruction,"You want to know an old favorite of Hylia and her children? Barriers and seals. You want to know what never seems to work? Barriers and seals. Guess what you’re now a master of circumventing, breaking, or otherwise bypassing? Go on, guess. Anyways, any such thing that tried to hold you in or keep you out now requires two or three times as much energy from the simple fact that it’s you they’re trying to hold. And that’s not even with you fighting back. As a side benefit, you actually gain a surge of power during the moment of breaking, when their defenses fail them and you absorb that energy into yourself. Given how freely powerful mages tend to spend their magic, that likely won’t last long, maybe a few days at most, but that’s still enough to kick you back to full power after a hundred years of slow decay. After that, I suggest you git gud again.
"
652,,200,The Warrior’s Tool ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"The warriors of light cannot defeat monsters, spirits and evil conquerors with their bare hands. On purchase we’ll give you something to swing. Choose whatever melee weapon you like within reason. Swords, maces, spears, greater variants of such things, whatever. 

You will receive a magical, masterwork version of the weapon you chose, which comes equipped with enchantments to sustain its condition and edge. It will also have a powerful elemental enchantment of whatever element you like, besides darkness.
"
653,,200,Greater Boomerang ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"This appears to be a wooden boomerang with a red gem in the center of it. More than what it appears, when the Greater Boomerang is thrown it grows several times larger, spins extra furiously and duplicates itself twice over. 

The Greater Boomerang can be used to cut down enemies, though because of its magical nature it has a very tight flight path, quickly returning when thrown.
"
654,,200,Dark Edge ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"Just as Warriors of Light have their finely crafted armaments and Sorceresses have their magical relics, so too must the Forces of Darkness equip themselves for battle. 

Choose whatever weapon or object you like to receive a weaponized extension of your darkness resembling it. A spear, a ring, even a pair of objects that count as one like a sword and shield. The Dark Edge will become more durable based on the strength of your darkness. 

Your tool of choice has acceptable durability. More importantly, you may summon and dismiss the Dark Edge tool of choice as you like, doing so repairs it and allows you to recover it if disarmed. Break, overwork, throw or expend as many of your tool as you like, then simply draw a new one. 
"
655,,200,Fairy Bow ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Destruction,"This reliable bow comes with a quiver of 50 arrows - perfectly balanced and easy to use, you’ll find yourself quickly hitting bullseyes and taking down the more evasive foes you’ll find in Hyrule. As a bonus, this comes with both Fire and Ice arrows already prepared - requiring a bit of magical energy to create more within the quiver, but well worth the price.
"
656,,200,Power Bracelet ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"The Power Bracelets are a pair of thin gold bands with a marking of the Triforce on them. As one might expect, they enhance your power - that is to say, your lifting strength. With proper usage, one can lift up and throw heavy boulders, statues, small trees, even some enemies. Alongside these bands comes the Toss Ring, a magical ring that enhances your throwing skill. As you might imagine this works wonderfully with the Power Bracelets, but isn’t limited to just them - bombs are something else you throw, for example.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
657,,200,Skyward Strike ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Destruction,"Right here and right now is the first tipping point that you will see. Are you like Fi, a weapon forged by the goddess from the fragments of her own blade and given to the Hero? Or are you like Ghirahim, a blade quenched in the blood of thousands? Regardless of which you choose, you have the ability to launch beams of energy from your blade. Holy or Demonic, they both function the same. Point yourself skyward and wait a moment to charge, then unleash a burst of your masters energy. Yes, your masters. You can power these yourself obviously, or you could draw on your wielder's magic, or even from a god or goddess that had previously given you a blessing.
"
658,,200,The Next Swiftblade,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Destruction,"Just as Swiftblade the Second inherited the ability from Swiftblade the First you have a supernatural ability to develop moves and maneuvers that infuse your physical actions with supernatural energies. These move only act as a channel to those energies, you don’t really use any up just have to have them in the first place from what has been shown, to enhance a very specific series of actions. This ability has developed things like the Super Spin Attack and the Attack of Desperation, which allows you shoot sword beams when critically injured, and with some practice and polish you too could create move that equal those legendary techniques. In addition, if you don’t have a generic mana bar you do now, though you’re only aware of how much you have in a very vague sense, like understanding how much blood is left in your body.
"
659,,200,Unmastered Sword ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Destruction,"A way better sword than that dinky old family heirloom this magic sword has no powers! ...Or, it had powers but they kinda faded. Now, it’s merely incredibly receptive. Hook it up to an energy source, or cast a spell though it, either way works. It’s not much for amplification, but it’s ridiculously easy to work with - for you. A spark of divine magic might turn it back into the master sword, or you could twist it to your own ends and empower it with something else.
"
660,,200,Red Candle ,The Legend of Zelda,Destruction,"This magic candle is capable of creating roaring bonfires whenever you blow onto it, allowing you to do a short range fire attack, set ‘fire traps’ as well as burn away dry grass that may hide passageways.

"
661,,200,Magical Boomerang ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Destruction,"This is rather handy...! This enchanted Boomerang will always return to you wherever you throw it, and what’s more it can retrieve items when you do so. It’s strong enough to kill weak enemies such as Octoroks and stun larger ones, when they are hit by it.
"
662,,200,Shehai ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"The Ansei of Yokuda mastered the sword to such an extent that, through sheer force of will, they could create an ethereal weapon of pure thought. Though long thought lost, you have rediscovered this art and are ready to utilize it. Through training and meditation, you will unlock many powerful and useful abilities."
663,,200,Bands of Kwang Lao ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"These leather bands are said to have belonged to a fierce warrior hailing from Akavir. Wearing them not only increases your skill with unarmed combat, but increases the force behind your strikes and makes your fists as hard as ebony. Who needs a weapon when you have your fists?"
664,,200,Deathbrand's Weapons ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"The twin scimitars of the infamous pirate Haknir Death-Brand, Bloodscythe and Soulrender. When wielding the two together, you drain both the health and magicka of your opponents, as well as weakening their armor with each and every hit."
665,,200,Volatile Potions ,Genshin Impact,Destruction,"While those humans without Visions cannot control the elemental energies, they can still make use of items that contain them, with all that entails. The simplest of reactions is often the most violent one. Treasure Hunters will often make use of 'potions' that will explode when the vial they are in shatters, spreading the energy within to the immediate vicinity. When one combines this with the manner in which different elements can conflict, you will find a surprisingly effective weapon."
666,,200,Sunforged Blade ,The Dragon Prince,Destruction,"A knife or sword made by Sunfire Elves, this blade retains the heat of its forging for a thousand years and can easily cut through mundane steel and even stone. Comes with free enchanted scabbard to reduce your chances of burning yourself, can be applied to any bladed weapon you wish to import instead."
667,,200,Magic Weapons (Advanced) ,Terraria,Destruction,"Can take the form of wands, books, or other items that the wielder channels mana into to cause an effect. It is possible, though not suggested, to take an item from a lower ‘rarity’ when purchasing at a higher price. 

Get a Sorcerer Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made with an early Hardmode ore [Cobalt, Palladium, Mythril, Orichalcum, Adamantite, Titanium, Hallowed Bar] or which are listed here: Ice Rod, Flower of Frost, Crystal Vile Shard, Life Drain, Clinger Staff, Meteor Staff, Nimbus Rod, Poison Staff, Frost Staff, Tome of Infinite Wisdom, Nettle Burst, Laser Rifle, Wasp Gun, Leaf Blower, Orange Zapinator, Cursed Flames, Golden Shower, Crystal Storm, Sky Fracture, Magic Dagger, Medusa Head, Blood Thorn, Spirit Flame, Shadowflame Hex Doll, Crystal Serpent, Unholy Trident, Magical Harp

See Magic Weapons for more information."
668,,250,PISTOLS OF PRINCE BOYDINOV ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction ,"A matchless pair of pistols owned by Prince Boydinov of Erengrad who sadly died in a game of Kislevite Roulette. Each are enchanted to produce their own ammunition, fire faster than regular flintlocks without need for reloading, are able to blow holes even in creatures incapable of being harmed by mundane arms and shots fired will actually swerve in the air towards your targets."
669,,300,Boil Release,Naruto,Destruction,"A Kekkei Genkai produced through the combination of Fire and Water affinities, this bloodline allows the user to manipulate hot, corrosive vapour for a variety of different purposes. It can be used to produce acidic gases potent enough to dissolve even the most durable of substances, or to generate powerful steam that can melt the user’s surroundings. Alternatively, it can be used to raise the user’s chakra to its boiling point, massively enhancing their physical ability upwards of fifty times."
670,,300,Explosion Release,Naruto,Destruction,"Normally limited to Iwa but apparently no longer, this is a Kekkei Genkai brought about by a combination of Earth and Lightning. This bloodline exists in two forms. The first version allows the user to produce explosions from their body when they strike a target, while the second version enables the user to infuse clay with their chakra, creating bombs of varying size, power, and range. Those who purchase the bomb option get an unlimited supply of explosive clay, also note that purchasing this version doesn’t grant Iwagakure Kinjutsu (Deidara’s mouths), if you want it then it’s a 50CP purchase of the Jutsu perk."
671,,300,Fog,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,You can turn into living fog that erodes living matter while it is inside. You can shift as much or as little of your body as you wish into a gaseous entity. You can also control your solidity.
672,,300,Wither,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"Anything you touch starts to decay, rot, and/or age at an increased rate. A minute of this on an object would be equivalent to a century, on something dead it would be equivalent to a decade, and on a living being a minute would be equal to a year.
You can do this in reverse. You can choose if memories are affected."
673,,300,Stockpile,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"For every physical strike, you do that misses, your next attack that does hit a target will deal damage based on the cumulative damage of everything you did. It resets whenever you successfully hit a target."
674,,300,Explosive Armor,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,You can automatically create explosions at any hostile force that touches your body without harming you. You can set how dangerous something needs to be in order to trigger this effect. The explosion is as strong as a grenade. You can also create explosions from wherever you want on your body without something triggering it.
675,,300,The Death Dealing,Bleach,Destruction,"A combination of potent control over poison as well as the concept of the
‘Absolute Lethal Dose”, the point at which substances will kill humans, which the user can calculate
perfectly. By consuming significant amounts of a substance, even something like being hit with an
energy attack, the user can raise or lower the lethal dose point for himself and others. The user can, within a minute, make themselves both immune and even able to heal in response to substances or
energy they have experienced in enough qualities. And make it deadly for opponents. Consume
enough blood and turn the opponent’s blood to deadly poison in their veins. The poison abilities that
come with this work both independently, manipulating a variety of toxins, and alongside the lethal
does power. Creating zones of poison, poison bombs, walls of death and so on are all simple feats. The Vollstandig not only empowers the lethality and amount of poison this can control but automatically adapts the lethal dose to any changes, making it impossible to bypass the immunity or
avoid the fatal dose.

Requires Soul Letter to purchase."
676,,300,Snap,DC Comics,Destruction,"Oh. Oh dear, you’re a vicious one aren’t you? The pulsating allure of a throbbing vein, the soft
cartilage and bone of an exposed column of flesh...it sings to you. You’re very good at locating
and targeting the weak points of your enemies with brutal efficiency. With humans, this is often
the neck. If you can get close in a fight it’s a simple matter to position yourself right and end
them in an instant-you could even do it blind, or while facing backwards. Even beings
significantly stronger than you have their weak points appear clear as day to your gaze, and
exploiting them always hurts a bit more extra than it normally would-to the extent that even gods
could be brought to their knees by the constriction around their vertebrae. If you weren’t already,
you may choose to have been trained in the Amazon war arts for a time reasonable to your age."
677,,300,Path of the Blackflame,Cradle V1,Destruction ,"Fire and Destruction. This path is focused entirely on overwhelming the opponent with overwhelming force. Shown techniques include the Dragon’s breath, a black and red Kamehameha that can burn through almost anything. The burning cloak, used to make every movement multiply the force of the user while active, and the void dragon’s dance, which causes pillars of flame to rise form the ground to consume your foes. Gold sign are red iris’s with black sclera eyes.

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
678,,300,Path of the Endless Sword,Cradle V1,Destruction ,"All swords are one. This path uses enforcer techniques to increase your speed and the sharpness of your sword at once, and also uses the endless sword, a burst of sword madra that causes every other bladed or pointed weapon to respond in kind turning every edge in the area into a bomb of phantom cuts.

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
679,,300,Path of the Starseed,Cradle V1,Destruction ,"Light and Fire. Practitioners gather aura of light and heat into a tiny ball of madra that they keep inside their spirits. They can manifest it, like a tiny star in their hands, but any power they use is taken away from the Starseed's growth. As they advance, they also advance their Starseed, but it's far less useful than any similar Paths (like, say, Heaven's Glory) until they reach Underlord. If they continue to advance, their Starseed can eventually burn cities in seconds after manifesting.

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
680,,300,The Voice(Black Bolt) ,Marvel Zombies,Destruction ,"Tremendous sonic power is at your beck and call. Your control over sound waves can be used for a lot of things, not the least of which is a sonic scream capable of shattering glass, metal, bone, and much more. Besides that, you can fly by riding these waves, echolocate, and protect yourself by making some sort of force field. You yourself are immune to all sound-based attacks. Your vocal cords, lungs, and throat have been strengthened to take all this strain. Try not to lose your voice. For an extra 100cp, you gain the additional ability to form energy constructs out of solid sound. You can make forcefields, simple weapons, wings, whatever you can think of - but you have to be making that sound to create the constructs. Additionally, you now possess perfect pitch. Each different musical note can induce various negative effects in those who hear it.

For a full 800cp, your power goes beyond sonic screams. Yours is the power of the Inhuman King, Black Bolt. Your brain can now harness surrounding electrons, through the creation of an unknown particle. It’s fuzzy. What is known is that this makes your voice very, very powerful. A whisper can bring down a city or an aircraft carrier. Talking at a regular volume might shatter a continent. A scream will blow through a planet. You can channel these electrons into your own body as well, granting physical abilities comparable to the Thing, concentrate it into specific body parts for throwing extremely powerful blows or firing concussive blasts, or create an anti-gravity field with which you’ll be able to fly.

However, any use of your vocal cords will activate the voice, so you won’t be able to speak regularly anymore. However, you’ve undergone training to never use your vocal cords unless needed, even when unconscious. Post-jump, this becomes toggleable. Zombies have decayed vocal cords, allowing them to speak normally and use their power.

Requires The Voice(Constructs) to Purchase"
681,,300,Bizarreness Of The Stranger        ,Slay the Princess,Destruction ,"I...have no real words for what you have become. In the most simple terms imaginable, you have become...something that can be compared to multiple distinct versions of yourself being ‘squeezed’ together into too tight a shape, too limited a space. A broken warped caricature of a living body, multiple minds sharing one form and competing for dominance, limbs flowing into and out of reality with no rhyme or reason, multiple heads speaking many thoughts simultaneously. An aberration in every possible sense of the word, just by existing you cause the world to break down - Reality shifts, courses, coalesces, and breaks apart the longer you remain in one place, becoming incoherent and illogical to the point of collapse. A living error in the logic of reality itself."
682,,300,The Most Impractical Sword,80s Sword and Sorcery,Destruction,"A tri-bladed sword, one with not a simple single blade and crossguard, but a wide cross guard from which 3 blades, each with their own smaller crossguard coming out perpendicular to the shared one, rise. Despite this insane design, the sword moves as if it were a normal sword, without the many and varied balance, and cutting force issues you’d expect of such a sword. In fact it cuts quite a fair deal better than most, being an equal to a Significant Sword, or there better in ways. This sword is able to launch its blades, firing them forth one at a time at speeds high enough to pierce through the torso of a sorcerer. Fired blades that are not manually recovered and replaced are restored to the sword within 24 hours.

It also contains an additional short sword built into the hilt which can be drawn forth as an emergency weapon. As this means drawing the hilt out of the main sword it will be hard to wield the main sword and it at the same time. But it may serve as an additional weapon should the sword somehow break (say by clashing against another Significant Sword repeatedly); if it does break it will be replaced within a week."
683,,300,Ssam Su Takkyeon,The God of High School Jump,Destruction,"Created by Park Il-Tae and Mastered by his grandson Park Il-Pyo, Ssam Su Takkyeon was built as a combination of Re-Taekwondo and Practical Takkyeon, using the latter to overcome the weaknesses of the former. It holds all the strengths, speeds and techniques of Re Taekwondo but adds in the special skills to forcibly control the momentum of the opponent’s body, ways to negate the force of opponent’s attacks while striking back at them and even the ability to ignite the air around the user’s blows by grinding their fists or feet against another surface."
684,,300,Soul Divider ,Final Fantasy IX,Destruction ,"Like a mesh weeding out the unwanted, the existence of the Soul Divider alone prevents those exposed to it from healing – reversing their injuries. The concept of “injury” for those within the area is a “one-way street”, such that healing of any sort is rendered impossible.

The original Soul Divider was made to ensure that souls could not return to Gaia, yet in the presence of a world without souls, it sucks up any attempt to heal or regenerate. All of that energy is converted directly into Mist, and the Mist created has the effects of all of your Mist abilities, and also corrodes your foes slightly."
685,,300,Superb Sword: The God of War,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction,"In this land of constant war and exceptional warriors, your way in the arts of combat has few peers. Whether it is thanks to the accumulation of battle experience through the equivalent of several human lifetimes, a natural in-born talent never seen before, or perhaps even both, you have created a fighting style that could be called nothing less than divine. Whatever weapon you specialize in, be it a sword, a spear or a even your own bare hands, you have honed your style to inhuman levels of perfection. Your technique leaves no room for mistakes, every movement has been refined to utmost excellency to the point no effort is wasted, and every attack can be delivered to its intended target, usually your opponent's vitals, with a surgical precision.

Your specialization in this style does not mean that you are inflexible or easy to read. Your style is so all-encompassing that it can adapt to almost every enemy, breaking through any of their defensive techniques and delivering devastating counter-attacks, while standing like an iron fortress against anyone trying to find the smallest gasp or chance to catch a break from your onslaught.

With this style in your hands, you are a deadly fighter indeed. So much so that even when you are far behind in strength or even speed before a much superior rival, you can still manage to overpower them merely by using your superior skill in combat, easily delivering a humiliating defeat to those that would otherwise make a short work of you. Only someone on a near divine level of technique like yourself, or with abilities a few leagues beyond your scope can match or surpass you in a duel."
686,,300,Down Special Defence!(Dodge Counter),Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction ,"Dodge Counter - You are able to adopt a special stance, preparing yourself to dodge. When you would be hit by an attack whilst in this stance, you will automatically dodge the attack. However, you may only remain in your dodging stance for a few moments, after which you will be open to attack and unable to adopt your dodging stance again for a brief amount of time. Further, the stance you take for this dodge technique is always the same, allowing it to be seen through with repeated use.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you may add an additional element to your dodge, making it a true counterattack. For example, you could automatically perform a close-range attack of your own after the dodge. The power of your counterattack will always be slightly more than that of the attack you would have received. Whilst you may be able to dodge some powerful attacks from enemies far beyond your ability to handle, any counterattack elements on these dodges will fail. For example, an average Fighter would not be able to counterattack Tabuu’s full power Off Waves."
687,,300,Nothing There,Library of Ruina V1.0,Destruction ,"A giant fleshy broadsword used by the legendary Red Mist. As a weapon generated from E.G.O, those capable of withstanding Nothing There’s imposing thoughts can wield the weapon as if they had studied how to fight with it all their life. Not just an easy to use weapon, Nothing There’s powers become more pronounced as the user fights. By spilling the blood of an opponent with the blade, an equivalent amount of life is transferred to the wielder, healing them of their wounds. Also, every successful cut makes the next blow faster and faster, turning the heavy sword into a bloody whirlwind of death. The effects are lost if there is a lull in combat or if the wielder fails to hit an organic target within a few seconds."
688,,300,Reverberating Scythe,Library of Ruina V1.0,Destruction ,"The majestic looking scythe used by the legendary Blue Reverberation. This scythe is something like a sonic weapon, causing its namesake reverberations within the objects it hits. These reverberations pass back and forth within the object, causing jitteriness and general discomfort. Likewise, the scythe itself vibrates at various frequencies. If the scythe reconnects with a target that already has reverberations with the precise amount of vibration, it causes massive internal damage, shattering them from the inside."
689,,300,Talon Bow,God Of War (2018),Destruction ,"A yew bow, created with the purpose of harming even the gods if the need arises. Something that is interesting about the bow is that it scales with the level of Divine Physiology that you choose earlier in the Jump. Someone with an Unnatural physiology would find their bow being as strong as the one Atreus uses when it is upgraded to the max, with it being able to cause flesh wounds even on a god. Whilst someone with a God physiology would find that they would find their arrows going deep into the hides of dragons and gods alike. So long as the quiver of arrows is never spilled you will find an unlimited number of arrows, and once every 10 minutes you will find ten arrows which will deal lightning damage along with the damage they would normally do. These special arrows restock once they are depleted. Once-per-Jump you will find an arrow which will dissolve the magical defenses of whoever you declare the target, this would work even on divine spells such as the one which grants Baldur his immortality."
690,,300,The Draupnir Spear,God Of War (2018),Destruction ,"Once Draupnir was an ornate golden ring that would create mundane golden duplicates for an infinite supply of fine golden rings for smithing or for wealth. After being reforged from the efforts of the Legendary Huldra Brothers (who created Mjolnir, the Hammer of Thor), and the efforts of The Lady of the Forge. Now you have acquired the Draupnir Spear.

You gain a ring that can create a golden Spear that can kill even the mightiest of gods. This Spear can multiply itself, whenever you strike or throw this Spear, you can create an identical duplicate Spear, such as when you strike an opponent and leave a duplicate Spear inside of them to explode at your discretion or harmlessly dispel.

The Draupnir Spear having been infused with the power of the wind can also fly much farther and more accurately than a normal Spear, and by slamming the butt of the Spear on the ground or by twisting the handle, the other duplicate spears can explode with enough force to wound and decapitate gods and God like beings. You can also throw the Spear into the air to create a storm of falling Draupnir spears that all can explode at once or in any particular order of your choosing.

The Draupnir Spear has also been infused with the Power of the Wind, allowing it to create vacuums and areas of wind pressure that can launch foes away or pull them as needed. Even swinging The Draupnir Spear can create powerful cyclones and miniature tornadoes that can sweep across the field of battle.

And if all of that was not enough for you, The Draupnir Spear can even empower itself with nearby elements such as Fire, Ice, Poison, Lightning, Bifrost Energy and any other form of nearby Energy to deal that same kind of energy damage with every strike and throw. However it is not capable of making these other types of energy on its own and must have a nearby source to empower itself with. For an additional 100 cp, once you have empowered The Draupnir Spear with a form of energy, you can re-empower it with that same energy with a thought, making The Draupnir Spear even more powerful and versatile. 

The one spear....that is many. A truly formidable weapon."
691,,300,Chooser of the Slain,God Of War (2018),Destruction ,"You have trained in the ways of the Valkyrie to the point where you now match the Queen of the Valkyrie, Sigrun, in terms of sheer skill in combat. While your physical abilities may be greater or lesser, your ability with weapons, both natural and created, now deals far more damage then they would in the hands of others."
692,,300,Store,Final Fantasy IV,Destruction ,"The upper ends of a monk’s power begins with the focus of one’s internal power and using that to destructive ends. With this perk, you can amplify the destructive force of your body. When used, your movements do not appear to have any more power than usual, but you can draw out up to double the force. Useful for shows of strength, punching through incredible defense, and moreso, unlike other monks who practice this discipline, this becomes second-nature to you, with even a second (or less) of preparation."
693,,300,Darkness,Final Fantasy IV,Destruction ,"A wielder of darkness and other negative power. While they still can be good, the power wielded is useful only for slaughter. This allows you to feed your life force directly into your weapon, before unleashing it in a wave of dark energy. The dark-elemental energy will strike all opponents in a large radius for roughly the damage of a full swing of your blade, but will also ignore any armor and physical resistance they may have. Innate resistance to soul or darkness attacks will still protect them, however. Additionally, any other dark (or similar) elemental attacks used will also pierce through physical protections as Darkness does."
694,,300,Black Wizard,Final Fantasy IV,Destruction ,"There are the natural destructive forces that all Black Mages learn, and then there are those that even the most powerful struggle to learn. This perk grants access to the most powerful Black Magic spells, such as Meteor, Flare and Death. Additionally, you gain the innate power of the Hades Eidolon. Your offensive magics will inflict a plethora of status effects (relevant to the spell used) as well. Also, your spells will pierce through any effect that would reflect the spell back at you, as well as ignoring half of any magic protections."
695,,300,Hind-blood dagger,Xena - Hercules,Destruction ,"This simple iron dagger has been soaked in the blood of a Golden Hind, lending it a uniquely platonic quality. This capital-D Dagger can stand in for when you need to kill something that 'no mortal weapon can harm' or even the really fancy 'can only be killed while on a stool, holding a chicken, at 9:00am on a Monday during a leap year' kind of thing that some wizards are fond of. Essentially, the dagger fulfills any kind of unusual catches or conditions required to harm something.

Sadly, it remains a plain iron dagger, no more durable or capable of inflicting injury or piercing armor. Trying to alter or modify the blade in any way more complex than the occasional sharpening will leave you with nothing but scrap metal and a few worthless flecks of polluted gold."
696,,300,Necklace of Harmonia,Xena - Hercules,Destruction ,"After Aphrodite (unsurprisingly) cheated on her then-husband Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths did what any Greek god would do. He crafted a golden necklace that promised eternal youth and beauty, presenting it to the child born from that liaison, condemning her and everyone else who would come into its possession to an assortment of horrendous fates forevermore. Like getting turned into a serpent, getting blasted from existence after making a god a dare, and marrying your own son, just for starters.

There's only one necklace, but you can be sure that the person you give it to, along with everybody in their general vicinity will inevitably suffer terribly before an agonizing and drawn-out death. On top of that, unless destroyed or reclaimed, the necklace may be found by another, starting the cycle of misery all over again. I...I don't know why you'd want this. This is Greek deity-level dickery of the highest order. There must be easier ways to make someone suffer than a method that later professors of history will use to illustrate just how screwed-up the universe can be at times."
697,,300,Divine Vengeance,Hades,Destruction ,"Zeus favors far fewer mortals than any of his related divinities. Yet when one senses the hand of the king of the Olympian Deities on a hero, a wise warrior knows better than to strike at them. Those who do so anyways discover that mortal cloaked in invisible lightning just waiting for an excuse to ground itself. In short, those who harm you will discover a weak bolt of lightning streaking towards them in very short order.

Though the counter attacking bolt may not be as strong as a true bolt of Zeus, it is more than enough to lock the joints and spasm the muscles of those struck for a brief moment."
698,,300,Olympian Bolts ,Hades,Destruction ,"There is always a tingle in the air before a storm that promises the fury to come. Draw in that current, feel it resonate through your body and crawl along your skin, then give it a direction and watch it crackle the air between you and your enemies. The ability to summon bolts of Zeus to strike at your foes is powerful, dangerous, but needs to be aimed with care.

When the bolt of destruction you summoned does strike a target, it will rebound from them to find another nearby foe to assault. Each time it ricochets from enemy to enemy it will grow noticeably weaker until the third foe barely feels a tingle."
699,,300,Tsunami Surge ,Hades,Destruction ,"Feel the waves lapping around your ankles and the sand shifting beneath your feet. Focus the ever changing, ever present, nature of water into your palm and push it outwards. Summon a blast of water to slam against your foes in a wide swath in front of you and watch it batter them against each other or anything nearby.

A force so unstoppable does not halt merely because it finds itself hitting a barrier. It spreads outwards instead. Your enemies that find themselves hitting each other or similar solid objects cause echoes of your spell to cascade out around them."
700,,300,Chilling Glare,Hades,Destruction ,"Demeter was once a happier woman and it gave her blessings a warmth akin to summer’s sunshine. But now they have only a chill and bitter bite to them. Those who strike you will feel its nip, not as strong as it could be, but it is a cold that lingers and slows the motions of your enemies.

That lingering chill seeping into the bones of those who attack you has grown fangs with a fearsome bite. For the moment that the chills from this counterattack lasts, it will continue to slowly wound them from the inside out."
701,,300,Glacial Glare,Hades,Destruction ,"Winter is the season of hatred, especially now, that can be felt with every frigid breath that attempts to steal away the warmth of life. Focus that dire season, give that hatred crystalline form and it will focus its wrath on those who displease you. The large ice crystal will last only for a short time but it will assault your foes relentlessly with a beam of pure cold. It’s only flaw is that it does not track agile enemies very easily.

By adding rage to hatred one can improve the destructive beam the crystals produce. It certainly causes them to track your foes more quickly."
702,,300,Hunter’s Mark,Hades,Destruction ,"Artemis rarely lends her bow to others, though she is always more than ready to join in a hunt. Draw an imaginary bow with your hands and you will find an arrow there ready to strike your prey down. These magical arrows rarely, if every,fail to find their mark.

Never be without a knife for when the quiver runs dry. Should your quarry not fall from your arrows, your other weapons will strike them all the more deeply."
703,,300,Moment of Hesitation,Hades,Destruction ,"A single mistake or moment of weakness in battle is all that it takes to end a life. Those who wound you quickly discover the wrath of Ares falling upon their head. The curse is short lived and harmless until it dies, taking some of their vital essence with it.

Revenge being a dish best served cold is a phrase very familiar to those courting Ares’ favor. The curse Ares lays upon your foes now bides its time, but strikes all the harder for the wait."
704,,300,Battlefield Chaos,Hades,Destruction ,"The frenzy of war, the clattering of steel on steel, and the splintering of wood and bone have a magic all their own. Draw upon it, direct it, and you will find a hundred spectral weapons swirling in a whirling dervish of death. It lasts but a moment,leaving only the wounds behind.

The chaos of this spell, once confined to a small circle, spreads its reach wide to become the bane of whole squadrons.. Those who stand in its way will find themselves meeting the boatman soon."
705,,300,Spurned Lover,Hades,Destruction ,"Those who dare strike you will discover the ire of love turned to rage. Savage emotion will cross the distance to strike back at them, causing no little damage and leaving them dazed for  a moment from the sudden blow.

The surprise those suffer when they strike you lasts much longer as they recall other moments of failed love."
706,,300,Emotional Burst,Hades,Destruction ,"Drawn up from the heart and released through the hand, this wide blast of magic is damaging to both the body and the mind. The body from magical night and the mind due to the wild emotions clouding their thoughts,making their attacks more erratic and weaker for a short time.

Adding hopelessness to the mix of emotions causes those struck to be less capable of defending themselves against the full strength of your blows."
707,,300,Shield Breaker,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Destruction ,"They hide behind their cheat weapons and armor. They believe themselves untouchable... lets test that theory why don’t we? As a weapon there is no defence you cant break, no Armor you cant penetrate and no shield that cant be pierced. This by itself doesn’t kill anyone, but their defences that shield them will be like paper to you. Just be careful that breaking their defences doesn’t make them even stronger."
708,,300,Born a Titan,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Destruction ,"Gods are meant to be the most high... the most powerful. And yet there are humans who are able to briefly rival such strength. All who attempted to outmuscle a God fail tragically, like Lu Bu and Raiden showed. However, the strength to injure and endure does have its obvious perks. Your physical capabilities are roughly of the likes of the aforementioned warriors, allowing you to possible stall even the Mighty Thor and Shiva in battle."
709,,300,Sword of Masters,Katana Zero,Destruction ,"I’m pretty sure this belongs to a kingdom, not here. Regardless it’s a broadsword that shoots out a blue energy projectile if swung every few seconds. Hits as hard as a thrown weapon with “NULL Training.” Otherwise just another Katana in function."
710,,300,Phoenix Blade ,Katana Zero,Destruction ,"Someone stuck a flamethrower to a sword. That’s pretty much it, it’s just a Katana in practicality with steel-melting flames spewing out. Try not to burn your face off."
711,,300,SMG(Elemental),20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction ,"A small rapid fire gun, while each bullet does little damage individually, the principle for this weapon is 'quantity over quality.'

Blessed by one of the Elemental Powers, the bullets of this gun are imbued with elemental energy, increasing the efficacy of each shot, as well as imparting that kind of elemental damage"
712,,300,Rex-Splode,Invincible,Destruction ,"You have been enhanced and powered up jumper. Not only have your physical abilities been enhanced to just beyond peak human and into superhuman for every category, you have also gained the ability to charge up objects with explosive energy. You can decide how this occurs, whether you had cybernetics implanted in you or whether you simply have been augmented in a different fashion. When an object is charged you can throw it (or run) and then trigger it to explode at will. The amount of energy that can be contained in an object is determined by its size with larger objects taking more time and energy to charge while also resulting in a larger explosion."
713,,300,Chi Manipulation,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Destruction ,"A natural energy known as chi exists within all living organisms in this world, and you know the location of critical points on the human body that allow chi to flow. You’ve been trained to utilizes this knowledge during combat to temporarily paralyzes foes and temporarily disable other people’s bending."
714,,300,Staff of the Living Tribunal ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Destruction ,"There are forces in this world beyond imagination, which move and work in ways that the mortal mind cannot perceive. In this way, a soul is always being judged from the moment of their birth to the moment they draw their last breath. For those who want a more localized and satisfying way to sentence someone, this unassuming wooden staff is just the ticket. On demand, this weapon can extend out great distances and strike someone with significantly greater force than the user exerts, allowing your average human to destroy concrete or crush vehicles like one would crush flesh. It can also break into segments held together by magical force, letting it act as a whip or a flail instead for striking or swinging to adapt to its user’s fighting style."
715,,300,Casket of Ancient Winters,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Destruction ,"When Odin took charge over the Nine Realms, he collected dangerous items that could threaten the peace of all who lived within them. He hid these away, to ensure that they could not be used on the innocent. But you know, not like that stopped a good episode of Storage Wars. A small cube the size of one’s head, it contains the infinite icy cold of Jotunheim. Able to summon a blast of icy cold that can freeze enemies solid, or a vortex that could freeze an entire landscape while significantly augmenting any ice abilities you possess. Given enough time, one could theoretically bring about a new Ice Age with this. Just be careful, alright?"
716,,300,Iron Fist,World War Hulk,Destruction ,Everybody was Kung-Fu Fighting! Just like Danny Rand you’ve become a master of martial arts able to fight groups of armed soldiers with nothing but your bare hands. You also have the ability to manipulate chi to enhance yourself in a variety of ways.
717,,300,Thundercat ,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Destruction,"You can control electricity within a fair radius around yourself, cannot be harmed by it, can shock people and even manipulate metal with some effort. At its fullest extent, your electric aura forms the shape of a great cat around you, and can run, leap and fight with yourself safely ensconced inside."
718,,300,Combat Mastery,A Certain Magical Index,Destruction,"You’re a complete monster in combat. Whether you’re most often a whirling dervish, a hulking smasher, or a skillful fencer, you’re a match for some of the greatest fighters who ever lived. Weapons come naturally to you, though you won’t find yourself hindered in the absence of one. Shooting to kill or disable, feinting and defeating guards, or simply smashing past them becomes a piece of cake. Pulling off those insane martial arts moves or defeating a horde of enemies without relying on anything else becomes a common occurrence now. Besides, in a world where people often rely on magic or technology as a crutch, having a very skilled pair of hands is a huge advantage."
719,,300,Infamous Visage,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A helmet and veil that terrifies those who have teetered over the edge of despair; striking them with greater strength, accuracy, and with a greater chance of dealing critical damage. Each blow causes significant stress, to the point where their heart may give before their body."
720,,300,Ghoul Claw,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A cruel ritual dagger, still stained with the blood of its last sacrifice. Increases melee damage and accuracy when held, and heightens the chances of a fatal blow against a marked enemy, as well as the stress they feel at your approach.."
721,,300,Sharpening Stone,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction,"A stone that is exceptionally suited towards the sharpening of weapons. Although maintenance is important, merely carrying it will cause your blows to slice deeper, bleeding your enemies and increasing the chance that you’ll do critical damage. "
722,,300,武甕槌 Takemikazuchi ,Bayonetta,Destruction,"Let the hammer of justice ring down upon the enemy, the roar of its sentence the last thing they hear. A hammer forged from the sword of a thunder god, it's very slow to swing but in exchange it can break through a great deal of magical defenses. By charging the weapon you can also deal increased electrical and physical damage, along with a chance to stun the enemy. Provided you can even lift the thing, it would be a danger to anyone who couldn't avoid its attacks."
723,,300,Salamandra,Bayonetta,Destruction,"No matter how much you ask, I'm not putting a damn chainsaw on your a-...wait, you're spending your points on it? Oh, well in that case I guess I can indulge. This weapon pair naturally does some incredible damage, what with it being two massive chainsaws equippable to the hands or feet. Naturally, the longer these weapons are in contact with the enemy the greater the damage will be... and should you equip them to the feet, you can skate around! It'll be like carving a turkey. Only the turkey is an Angel."
724,,300,Lt. Col. Kilgore ,Bayonetta,Destruction,"When you absolutely, positively have to destroy your enemies AND the environment around them? You'll want this. A twin set of rocket launchers that can be equipped to the arms or legs, it is a slow weapon but it deals a tremendous amount of damage to anyone it hits, while knocking them off balance a decent amount of times as well. Once you've dialed in to the weapon style, you'll be slaughtering hordes of Angels."
725,,300,Pillow Talk,Bayonetta,Destruction,"What is this. What is this doing here. Why is this a thing. A vessel for the demonic being Mahavalrocana, said to have seduced women by whispering sweet nothings during their dreams, this specially forged item seems to be more like an energy sword than an actual metal weapon. Still, it does amazing damage and is extremely efficient in killing Angels, so it might just be worth the unusual functions."
726,,300,Special Delivery,Bayonetta,Destruction,"How do you expect to punch an enemy who's lived for centuries? It's a bunch of angels and demons running around and doing what they want, how could you be expected to battle with them on a regular basis? With this, such issues are trivial. Your lifting strength is increased to around ten to fifteen tons, and if you really exert yourself you can put the hurt on monsters a great deal larger than yourself. But if that’s not enough for you, you can always spend an undiscounted 200CP to increase that strength fivefold so you can really start hammering on others starting out."
727,,300,Nigredo – The Black Art ,Generic Alchemist ,Destruction,"You are practiced in the destructive Black Art of Negredo. Negredo associates with the concept of entropy and works to degrade anything it comes into contact with, breaking down the bonds that hold something together. Using Negredo, it is possible to unravel supernatural effects, tear down barriers, and reduce physical matter to ashes. Life and metabolic processes tend to hinder the effects of Negredo, but it can still be used to harm with relative ease, both directly and indirectly. Negredo requires physical contact to function, at least at first, and is physically draining to the user. See Notes for More Details."
728,,300,Void Staff ,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This plain wooden pole inset with blue crystals may seem innocuous, but it's infused with the insidious energy of the Void. This weapon lends the piercing nothingness of the void to its wielder's magic, allowing them to tear through magical defenses as if they were nothing."
729,,300,Trinity Force,League of Legends ,Destruction,"The Trinity Force is a legendary, shapeshifting weapon that can assume three forms- A mighty hammer, an elegant longsword, and a deadly pair of daggers. An incredibly versatile weapon, just having this thing on your person makes you slightly better at all aspects of combat. On top of that, whenever you cast a spell, the Trinity Force becomes charged with energy, making your next attack with it do tons of damage."
730,,300,Titanic Hydra,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This heavy, pointed axe is a powerful, crushing weapon. When the Titanic Hydra strikes a foe, it will create a shockwave from the point of impact that spreads out in a cone, damaging foes behind the target. The Titanic's blows become more vicious the more lifeforce the wielder holds, the power of its blows increasing with the lifeblood of its wielder."
731,,300,Thornmail,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This suit of gleaming, polished bronze scale mail is a legendary suit of armor, hampering your foes with its grace. This armor possesses a powerful magic that harms all those who harm its wearer - Those who inflict physical injury upon the wearer of the Thornmail feel the pain of the injury as if it were their own. There are tales of entire battles won by a single knight wearing the Thornmail, completely unarmed, allowing all his foes to defeat themselves by breaking their weapons upon his armor."
732,,300,Sunfire Cape,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This gleaming steel breastplate from the Shuriman Desert gets its name from the wreath of flames that surrounds its wearer. Although the wearer is unharmed by these flames, the incredible heat will surely scorch any who dare engage the wearer in combat."
733,,300,Statikk Shiv,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This silver dagger is wrapped in wire, and is abuzz with electric energy. Just by absorbing the static electricity from its wielder moving around this dagger builds up a static charge. Once its wielder attacks with the dagger, it unleashes all of its charge, creating a lightning bolt that arcs across the battlefield, harming all in its way."
734,,300,Runaan's Hurricane,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This scarlet bow is imbued with the fury of the winds. When an arrow is nocked in this bow, two yellow spectral arrows appear beside it, perfectly mirroring the original arrow. Once loosed, the arrows will all fly towards different targets, and while the spectral arrows are only a quarter of the strength of the real one, they will also replicate any enchantments or magical effects from the user's other weapons."
735,,300,Ravenous Hydra,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This massive, double-headed axe is a vicious, sweeping weapon. When the Ravenous Hydra strikes a foe, it will create a shockwave from the point of impact that spreads out in a circle, damaging foes around the target. In addition, the Ravenous Hydra absorbs the blood of its victims- Both those directly struck and those struck by the shockwave- And uses it to heal its wielder."
736,,300,Rapid Firecannon,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This weapon is a prime example of Bandle City engineering: Fast, efficient, and entirely oversized for its intended wielders. A cross between a pistol and a chaingun, as this gun builds up momentum, its maximum range increases and its bullets become charged with electrical energy."
737,,300,Nashor's Tooth,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This gleaming white ivory dagger pulses with an otherworldly energy. Carved from a tooth of The Baron of the River, this weapon uses magical power in addition to strength. Whenever its wielder lands a blow with this dagger, a bright pulse of magic will course through the wound, turning even mere scratches into deep gashes that rend flesh like the teeth of a terrible beast."
738,,300,Muramana,League of Legends ,Destruction,"The edge of this silvery longsword drips with pure, magical energy. This sword infuses your physical attacks with the power of one's untapped magic reserves, turning the innate magical energy in all living things into pure attack power. The greater the wielder's capacity for magical energy, the more energy this blade will use- and the more damage it will inflict on any unfortunate victim."
739,,300,Mortal Reminder,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This ebony bow holds a vicious enchantment that ensures the impending doom of its victims. Any arrow loosed from this bow will burrow into its target's flesh, tearing through veins and preventing the healing of the wound through natural regeneration or healing magic."
740,,300,Luden's Echo,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This violet, metallic staff hums with a faint resonance, whispering the sounds of battles long past. Over time, this staff absorbs sonic energy from its surroundings, and once its user invokes a spell, Luden's Echo uses part of that magic to summon forth a blast of sonic energy to smite its foes."
741,,300,Lich Bane,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This pair of daggers were used by an undead hunter to destroy countless liches. When the wielder uses magic, these daggers become charged with powerful magic, and once they strike a foe they unleash a powerful blast of magic capable of disintegrating bones."
742,,300,Liandry's Torment,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This unsettling porcelain mask carries a powerful, hateful magic with it that punishes those who would claim strength. When worn, this mask imbues the wearer's magic with spiteful fire that burns fiercer the hardier its victim. The tougher your target is, the more it'll hurt- but when the victim is physically hampered, such as by injury, poison, or disease, then the fire will burn even hotter, igniting the vicitim's blood and condemning them to a slow, agonizing death. Don't worry about the black tears that flow out of the mask when this happens. They're probably just for show."
743,,300,Iceborn Gauntlet,League of Legends ,Destruction,"The fabled Frozen Fist, this gauntlet of True Ice is surprisingly comfortable when worn. When the wearer uses magic, the Gauntlet absorbs some of the ambient energy and becomes charged with icy magic, lending the wearer's next physical attack an icy power that freezes an area of land around them to slow opponents."
744,,300,Frozen Mallet,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This great steel hammer is imbued with powerful frost magic. Whenever you hit someone with this hammer, incredible cold will spread from the point of impact, burning their skin and slowing their movements. Enough blows could eventually freeze a victim solid, shattering their limbs entirely."
745,,300,Blade of the Ruined King,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This longsword is the accursed blade of the king of the Shadow Isles. Once a holy blade, this sword is now held in the grip of a corrupted magic that steals the lifeforce of its victims and gives it to the user, slowing their movements and quickening the wielder's as well as healing their wounds."
746,,300,The Black Cleaver,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This ominous black greataxe is a Noxian treasure, and has passed hands from general to general many times across the years. In addition to being a mighty blade, the Black cleaver tears through armor as if it were flesh, surprising all those unfortunate enough to fall victim to it."
747,,300,Elixir of Wrath,League of Legends ,Destruction,"This ominous, wrought-iron flask houses a pulsing red elixir that, when imbibed, imbues the drinker with a terrible ferocity for three minutes. A blood-red mist surrounds them, their eyes fill with an unquenchable bloodlust, and their muscles contort with inhuman strength for three minutes. When under the effect of the elixir, any physical wound the drinker inflicts on another being will heal their own wounds. The flask refills itself after seven days. Tastes like drinking reduced cinnamon mixed with hellfire."
748,,300,Masochist,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Destruction,"When harmed, you respond with reflexive magical outbursts that damages and pushes attackers away. You can injure yourself if you wish. The greater the injury received, the more powerful the blast. "
749,,300,Sadist ,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Destruction,"Killing a living creature (or destroying something animated by magic) fills you with energy. You are healed proportionately to the slain creature's power. Stomping on small animals provide tiny returns, while killing potent monsters and powerful individuals can close major wounds and get you back on your feet after debilitating injuries. "
750,,300,"""Poised For Victory""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"You possess a power closer to that of beasts and monsters than man or woman. Inspiring the image of ruthless aggression, and even aiding such tactics, you can now push through enemy attempts to disrupt you unflinchingly. With this perk, your body becomes much more resistant to outside attempts at stopping or moving it. This allows you to charge through enemy spear walls to chop at their heads, or endure a stab at your chest long enough to get off a spell. This doesn't directly protect you from harm, but it does make pushing through enemy attempts at defending themselves easier. With this, you can force an enemy into your rhythm instead of falling into theirs."
751,,300,"""Simple Solution""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"Survival in these lands is difficult, with most doing so through a sharp mind, fine-tuned skill or a keen sense of caution. As someone who has bathed in war, your secret to survival is simply raw strength and aggression. By default, you're now strong enough to wield some of the biggest, heaviest weapons in this land with relative ease. Your body, scarred and hardened through conflict, kept moving through anger alone at times, has somehow gained some resistance to flame as well. In addition, by tapping into your anger and release a bellowing war cry, you may heighten these passive traits for a short time. In this fleeting state, you may swing clubs the size of men with the ease of a twig, and normal flame will barely scorch you. Entering this state takes effort though, and entering it multiple times within a short time can wear you out."
752,,300,“Dragonslayer Spear”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Great spear born from the soul of Ornstein, resembling the one he wielded in life. Mysterious weapon brought into this world from another. The Dragonslayer Spear is large, long and easily identifiable by its wide cross guard attached below the blade. The spear is imbued with the power of divine lightning that increases in potency with the wielder’s own divinity and faith. In the right hands, this spear can shoot bolts of lightning and serves perfectly as a  slaughtering implement of vaguely reptilian destruction."
753,,300,“Miasmal Censer”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"As censers are used to burn incense during holy rites, this Miasmal Censer can be seen as a way to honor Gravelord Nito, spreader of death and disease. Upon lighting the Miasmal Censer, a virulent black miasma will spread into the area choking light and spreading through the living as a lethal plague that decays the body, continuing to rest in the area and make it uninhabitable for any but the dead for as long as you allow it to burn. Of course, the dead have nothing to fear from disease, meaning it can also be carried on its chain to spread deadly miasma wherever you go. Stay fearful, however, of the things that continue to lurk within the black cloud."
754,,300,“Catalyst of Manus”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Catalyst of Manus, Father of the Abyss. The large, warped, wooden staff appears petrified and resembles a blunted axe. Due to its connection to the abyss, it’s excellent at channeling and casting dark sorceries to exciting potential effect. In fact, it is likely the most powerful catalyst in these lands for dark sorceries. Because of its large shape and great weight, it can also be effectively used to smash enemies in if they get too close for comfort like a proper striking weapon."
755,,300,“Sword of Four Kings”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"One of the massive swords of the Four Kings. The blade is twisted and missing great chunks due to the corrupt abyss and the things that lurk within it. The wielder’s soul is concentrated along the blade, emphasizing the innate occult properties of the big, gnarled greatsword that allow it to cleave through souls as well as the flesh of mortal man. The dark, corrupt power of the weapon is focused in the tip of the abyssal blade, making thrusts especially lethal. While effective, they’re a bit unwieldy due to the warped weapon's shape."
756,,300,“Lifehunt Scythe”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Pulled from another world, a weapon born from the soul of the stark white crossbreed that resides in the painted world. Takes the form of a large, gnarled scythe. Priscilla’s dreaded power of Lifehunt resides in the scythe, rending enemy flesh horribly with each wound inflicted. In the hands of a normal mortal however, the backlash is almost as severe. Someone or something with greater constitution would be required to swing it safely."
757,,300,“Obsidian Greatsword”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Formed from the tail of Kalameet, an infamously powerful dragon and one of the last before his eventual death in ancient times. It resembles a jagged, obsidian curved sword. It boasts incredible power, is surprisingly heavy and far more durable than you would think by looking at it. Its edge is sharper than can be achieved with human hands and simple tools alone. When pulling on the power inside, the wielder can even unleash a wave of black fire in all directions. The abyssal heat has a way of temporarily rupturing a struck enemy’s sense of balance, causing them to stumble and fall, and is incredibly painful regardless."
758,,300,“Grant”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Legendary weapon of the Way of White, one of the treasures taken by the Undead Paladin Lloyd before his holy mission to the land of gods. This mass of iron can only be lifted by someone with inhuman strength, but it’s blessed with considerable magical might that grows stronger with the wielder’s faith. Its blessings also make it especially effective against undead, as any other Divine weapon. Those who lift Grant into the air above their heads can also release a powerful, dangerous divine shockwave that can blow away all around them. Such power inflicts brutal backlash on the relic though."
759,,300,“Moonlight Greatsword”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A paradoxical blade born from the unharmed, still living Seath’s severed tail. Perhaps transported from another world. The Moonlight Greatsword is a large, broad bladed sword of blue-green color. It’s covered in strange markings, possesses a golden guard and greatly wards against magic just by holding it. With a bizarre constitution, the blade appears to be entirely made of solid magic, becoming far more powerful the stronger your mind and soul are. It glides through things with no magical warding. Additionally, it can project waves of exploding magical shockwaves from focused slashes, though such things can degrade the weapon if relied upon."
760,,300,“Miracle of the Sunlight Spear”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"Scripture detailing Lord Gwyn’s conquest over the Eternal Dragons in great detail. This bestows revelations of his Sunlight Spear, enabling its Miracle in you. The Sunlight Spear is reminiscent of the lower powered Lightning Spear miracles, but is much more powerful and made up of crackling, golden energy of greater intensity. Not only may you learn it, you may share it with others. As faith is the source of its great power, those who wield it will see much greater results through belief in something greater than them."
761,,300,“Coiled Sword”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction,"A bizarre sword with a twisting blade that’s unwieldy when it comes to actually cutting, but possesses a fine, sharpened tip and abilities more akin to a fire poker than sword. The Coiled Sword ignites whatever it pierces whether that be enemy flesh and bone, or the ground at your feet, though obviously less than flammable things wouldn’t stay aflame for long. The Coiled Sword also intensifies present flames, allowing you to stoke bonfires or worsen an inflamed enemy’s condition. Even one good stab can spell an enemy’s death."
762,,300,Holy Moonlight Sword,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 

The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade. Whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort. It is in remarkable condition, with significant quality in the make of its blade, for a twice lost sword. 

When prayed upon, the arcane light within the blade surges forth to empower it. The wielder can fling arcane blades through the air off the blade’s edge, and crushing lances from the tip. The source of those mysterious lights that Ludwig looked too for guidance will remain a mystery to you, however.”\"
763,,300,Gatling Gun ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“This is a highly-customized, portable version of the stationary gatling gun operated by the old hunter Djura in Old Yharnam. It was also the weapon of choice of the youngest of Djura's three companions. 

The Gatling Gun boasts exceptional rapid-firing functionality, but is considered a cumbersome weapon, due to its excessive weight and insatiable consumption of Quicksilver Bullets. A hail of bullets from this firearm are nonetheless as dangerous as any other, making its salvos hellacious. 

While this weapon may seem wasteful, with such a finite supply of the local rounds and difficulty aiming it, what makes the Gatling Gun truly special is that it can fire four shots per bullet consumed. This means that even with a hand full of Blood Bullets, twenty shots can be fired off in moments.” "
764,,300,Whirligig Saw ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater. This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws. These discs, lined with serrated teeth, spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds. 

The initial form, a simple mace with a diamond shaped head, is nothing to write home about. When the weapon is transformed, by inserting the head inside the bladed mechanism carried on one’s back when out of us, that is when it becomes special. 

The mechanism grants the weapon a new head, with two dangerous buzz-saw blades that spin in opposite directions. The blades spin on command, though revving it up may tire you, indicating some form of will or stamina transference. Despite its apparent mundanity, it's brutally effective at its job.”"
765,,300,Bloodletter,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe. 

Looking like a spiked, bladed mace, this weapon is made for bleeding enemies dry. It transforms by absorbing ghastly amounts of your blood, the most direct method being impaling yourself on it. 

Once pulled free, the transformed Bloodletter is revealed, a massive bludgeon with a head covered in long, dangerous spikes, yet despite this size it's surprisingly easy to swing.”"
766,,300,Amygdalan Arm ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. Starts as a large, tough, blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive. 

The severed arm functions incredibly well in the hands of a hunter for something not intended as a weapon. By default it's a very strong club, but when ‘transformed’ through what seems to be will alone, the finger still attached readies itself.

It will still function fine as a club in this readied state, but each swing will be accompanied by the bladed tendril of a finger lashing out at nearby enemies as if it had a mind of its own. The way it bends and curls, perhaps that isn’t so unlikely.”"
767,,300,Rosmarinus ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A weapon very similar, yet incredibly different, to the Flame Sprayer. It looks the same, is about as durable too. Rosmarinus can also consume Quicksilver Bullets or Blood Bullets as special mediums, each one producing about as much propellant as they do for the Flamesprayer.

Instead of flames though, Rosmarinus projects a mystical, sacred mist. Arias are heard wherever sacred mist is seen, proving that the mist is a heavenly blessing. Despite its truly divine nature, it has great and terrible lethality that should not be overlooked. 

With the proper training, the wielder is capable of killing even giants after just a few seconds. Even enemies that can withstand the mist itself will probably soon succumb to a bizarre, almost toxic property of the mist. Like the Flamesprayer it can be ammo intensive, but is far more worth it.”"
768,,300,Burial Blade ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter. A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens, an incredibly durable yet lightweight material that can be magnetized. 

The Burial Blade consists of a large, double edged, curved sword that can be quickly and easily combined with a light, curved shaft to become a great scythe. Despite the weapon's size, it can be wielded with surprising speed, making it very dangerous at longer ranges than most melee weapons. 

Like the Ludwig's Holy Blade, the Burial Blade is receptive to arcane enhancements. When not in use, the shaft can be folded and carried on one’s back.” "
769,,300,Chikage,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“A favorite of the Vilebloods, this is a deadly Trick Weapon, for both the wielder and their enemies. When wielded with one hand, it just seems to be a normal, albeit well-made katana. It’s when its wielded with two hands that its deadly secret is revealed. 

When wielded with two hands, the Chikage siphons the wielder's blood and coats the blade with it. Upon doing so, it heavily empowers itself using the wielder's blood, based on its quality. 

Depending on that quality, that potency, the increase in power can be anywhere from moderate to incredible. Once a coating of blood is applied though, it also taints it with poison, allowing the wielder to spread it with their attacks. It becomes a double threat, one could say. 

This great power comes at a cost though, as the weapon will continue to siphon the wielder's blood while they hold it to sustain the wet coating, at a significant rate I might add. You may stop this without dropping the sword by simply flicking the blood off.”"
770,,300,Ludwig’s Holy Blade ,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“Ludwig's Holy Blade resembles the Kirkhammer in a way, as it consists of a sword that combines with its sheath. The silver sword itself heavily resembles the one employed by the Kirkhammer actually, but is a bit longer and seemingly higher quality.

Instead of a hammer, when the sword is locked into its stylized sheath it forms a large single bladed greatsword. The size and design of this Trick Weapon takes both strength and skill to properly wield. On the other hand, the methods used between forms aren’t so different.  

Hunters shouldn't shy away because of this though, as once mastered it becomes an incredibly potent weapon in the wielder's arsenal. Additionally, this Trick Weapon seems quite receptive to magical effects, such as Blood Gems which grant it elemental damage.”"
771,,300,Brutal Execution,Bloodborne,Destruction,"“What is it that separates man from beast? There are many things, but what allows man to overcome beast so consistently in the hunt? Forethought of course, and proper technique as well, but above all else is ruthless execution of brutal intent. 

You are a hunter, a killer, an executioner, slaughtering those who fall under the definition of your prey. Your reflexes are greater, dexterity heightened, accuracy fine, and timing just impeccable. These talents allow you to identify the most opportune moments to attack your enemy; when they least expect it. 

When in pitched battle, you could draw and fire off a round in the face of a lunging enemy in mid flight. If you catch an enemy’s back before they know you’re there, you know just where to plant a full power smash from behind to make it hurt most. 

Brutally attacking enemies in moments like these will temporarily induce a state of shock, leaving them vulnerable to otherwise difficult to employ offense, like a ‘Visceral Attack’ for instance. Punish the enemy’s lacking awareness, and then deliver upon them their fate.”"
772,,300,Knight’s Honor,Demon's Souls,Destruction,A lesser person might be encumbered by the heavy gear they have to wear but not you. Your strength is incredible making you capable of moving as if you were wearing simple clothes instead. Due to your training you are skilled in combat and may pick a type of weapon like you've trained with it all your life.
773,,300,Sacred Relic Sword,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Once, there was a god meant to live a life eternal. Perhaps the Greater Will sent another, less successful incarnation of its sacred order on an older, doomed mission in the distant past. The archaic, stone greatsword wrought from the body of its champion is now yours-it’s true meaning lost to time. With a single swing, you can unleash the golden power of that long-lost god to smite your foes with a wave of holy power only a god can bring to bear. Faith makes this weapon more effective, and a vestige of the Erdtree’s primal divine power yet lives on in it. Even if one lacks the power of an Empyrean such as Marika, it may be possible to commune with the Greater Will through it-entreating it’s blessings and calling on or amplifying its power, perhaps working miracles touched by its grace. Handle it carefully."
774,,300,Fingerslayer Blade ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Woe to the Greater Will. Woe to the world, indeed. For it seems the Eternal City of Nokron had more than one hidden treasure, and Godwyn’s corpse has birthed more than one curved blade. While it cannot be wielded by those without a fate in the hands of one so endowed it’s power to bring death is such that even the Greater Will and it’s vassals can be harmed by it. Such as, say, the ailing Two Fingers. A truly deplorable weapon, fit only for those with deicidal ambitions-and while such beings could surely fight back, it’s touch is annihilating to life lesser than true divinity."
775,,300,Might of Champions ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Brains overthink things. Faith gets you into trouble. And things that men aren’t meant to know have a tendency to turn them into monsters. You want to stand at the apex of the battlefield, you need brawn- and you’ve no lack of it. Those weapons considered big and heavy by your kind can be hefted with relative ease, and your blows strike with thunderous might. Let none doubt your prowess as a warrior though, for you have a wealth of experience with maces, axes and other weapons many may look down on as lout’s tools with the mastery of an expert fencer. And while every physical trait buffed from this section comes with some implicit proficiency at hand to hand combat, it is with this that you become a true martial artist among your kind- deadlier without a weapon than with one, some might say. And when you need MORE strength, like the warriors of the Badlands you can let out a mighty war cry that stuns those near you and empowers your body with unbound bloodlust- though it is a significant effort even for an experienced warrior."
776,,300,Absolutely Loathsome,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Pain. Blood. Rot. The horrific Seedbed Curse engraved on your flesh pales in comparison to the awfulness lurking in your soul. To start with, you are a superb killer by this world’s standards. It matters not if you fight with sword, bow or staff; you have the fitness and experience expected of someone that has slain thousands. Every wound you leave is a festering, ragged mess harder to heal and treat than it should be, jaggedly haemorrhaging and infested with filth that seems to taint all you lay hands on in malice. Something about you instinctively lets others know what an unnatural blight you are on the living and even the dead, making all but the bravest souls and those more than your match in raw power fear to even address you; even animals and many monsters greater than you find you less trouble to avoid than eat. But your true “gift” is this: There is nothing that, given time and effort, you cannot defile, cannot degrade, cannot make feel soiled and used and worse off. Drive a man crazy with terror of you, making him slaughter his fellows in a fit of paranoia. Mutilate a corpse so badly its soul cannot reincarnate. And get someone to defile you properly, soak up enough horror and bloody awfulness all around you, and you might just be able to produce a Mending Rune capable of defiling Order itself."
777,,300,Hidden Blade of Order,Elden Ring,Destruction,"Foul things have been done in the name of the Golden Order by the hidden killers employed by its highest authorities-and with this, somehow your history is twisted such that you have the skills needed to serve one such role. It matters not if you are one of the Omenkillers, a Confessor serving the Two Fingers, a particularly proficient hunter of the undead-or even one of the Black Knives, or at least one trained in their traditions. You are extremely well trained in tracking, silent movement and various forms of assassination ranging from thin blades at close range to uncanny accuracy with a bow. You can take out a dozen soldiers patrolling a bridge with less noise than the night wind-or inspire such fear in a lone Tarnished they’re half-mad with terror before you even stick the blade in their back. But against a specific demographic in this world-something like Omens (or beastial, grotesque beings similar to them in future world), Those Who Live In Death (the undead, essentially) or even demigods-your killing arts include a technique that give you an extreme advantage in lethality against them. It could be knowledge of the art of carving off Omen horns to make into talismans that let you channel their strength into your fighting arts (including a few you already own), a residual amount of Destined Death or incantations of the Golden Order that purge the unliving."
778,,300,Immortal Oak Stake ,MtG - Innistrad,Destruction,"A stake of oak, that curiously seems to be eternally alive. If you already have a stake you have gotten attached to for vampire killing, you may import it, the wood is now and from this point always will be alive. If the stake is damaged it will grow back into its shape."
779,,300,Magiphage,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"The ability to drain magic from a target and transfer magic into objects. The more experienced the mage, the longer the objects can remain fueled. Requires physical contact to use.

Boosted: THE Leech: Your ability to leech magic and transfer it has increased. Before, you had to touch to take and transfer. Now you can do so within a few metres of your position, siphoning the magic of others and transferring it to yourself to recharge your reserves or enhance an attack, to your allies, or to objects. Like with all disciplines, what you can do will increase with time and practise.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
780,,300,Energy-throwing ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"A fairly popular branch of magic, it converts energy into projectiles. These projectiles typically take the form of exploding balls that can be thrown like grenades or beams of energy. These beams may be projected from the user’s palms, eyes, or mouth. While firing from the eyes is generally more powerful, it will also temporarily blind the user. Firing from the mouth is even more powerful than the eyes, but terribly difficult to aim. A skilled energy-thrower may tune the frequency of their attacks, causing them to either scorch the enemy or simply strike with a blunt force. Overall, this power isn’t terribly versatile, but it is quite destructive. Yes, you can choose the colour.

Boosted: Energy-Blasting: Energy throwers are just children lobbing energy at their targets until they’re lucky enough to hit them. You are not like them. Unlike the rest, you can control the energy you create, molding it into more defined projections taking on whatever forms you desire. This only applies to the energy you project, not that of others. Your blasts have also been improved considerably. Where a normal energy-thrower could barely beat back Wretchlings, your blasts can easily tear them apart. Not even Cleavers with their magic-resistant uniforms could stand up to your attacks.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
781,,300,Kineticist ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"Allows the user to absorb kinetic energy and convert it into raw physical strength. This can be used to negate the damage of kinetic force against your body from things like projectiles or punches (or the backlash from your own punches) and use it to fuel your own physical attacks. This art is all extinct art at the present, with one of the few known users being Mr. Bliss.

Boosted:  World’s Strongest: Mr. Bliss is known as the physically strongest man in the world, and with good reason. His strength was so great that he was able to destroy every part of the Grotesquery that wasn’t a piece of a Faceless One, and in the end fell only in battle against a group of three Faceless Ones. With the Capstone Booster, your power has increased to rival his, where even the lightest of strikes could pulverize bones without the slightest damage to your own person. Your durability and reflexes have been similarly enhanced to the point that you could catch a sword with your bare hands, quite literally crush someone’s head between your fingers, and survive a building going down on you with just a few scars to show for it. With training the sky ISN’T the limit.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
782,,300,Truly Vile,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"Lord Vile was the most feared of Mevolent’s Three Generals. Not only for his cruelty and capacity to commit murder without a second thought, but for his capacity to step onto a battlefield, alone, and emerge utterly victorious. You too have this strength. When facing a large number of opponents alone, your powers and abilities are enhanced. Anything and everything that could help you win the battle becomes stronger. This is not a perk that makes fighting one hundred enemies at once the same as fighting one hundred one-on-one battles. Rather, your power literally increases when you are fighting more enemies. This boost will fade as the death you bring reduces your foes’ numbers, but it will do so at a pace that will still leave you stronger than normal until your last enemy has fallen or fled."
783,,300,Warring Warlock ,Young Justice,Destruction,"Your magical techniques are enhanced when used against another practitioner of magic, turning every fireball into an inferno and every force field or ward into a nigh impenetrable barrier. Not only does it look flashy, but your onslaught can actually disrupt their spell casting, making countering your magic harder. 
"
784,,300,A Talent for Slaughter ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"This goes beyond mere talent though. You’re a genius at dealing death, the Mozart of murder, the Einstein of evisceration. You’re now skilled beyond measure with any weapon you pick up, magical or not. Your body is similarly beyond peer, granting you the strength to cut through plate armor like butter, jump a man’s height with ease and endure attacks that would fell mortal men with minor harm. Whether against five men or fifty, you’ll be scything your way through normal people like a reaper with a grudge. 

But even a talent as great as yours can still be cultivated. The more you kill, the more powerful you’ll become. You’ll find new, more efficient ways to cut men in half, discover the proper way to behead someone at full speed without breaking a step and learn how to get the best out of a weapon the more you use it, perhaps even finding new abilities or tricks it may hide. All that exercise will help you get stronger physically as well. Your already prodigious strength will grow in time, until you’re pulling truly ridiculous anime shit. 

This takes time though. At the beginning, you might be more than a match for any man, but monsters are another matter. But if you manage to survive while ensuring that others do not, who knows how deadly you’ll get.
"
785,,300,Blood Soaked ,Drakengard and Nier,Destruction,"There’s magic in the blood of mortals, magic which you can now tap into. By literally soaking yourself in blood head to toe, you can access the power of the Flower and enter Intoner Mode. While in Intoner Mode, your speed, strength and endurance will all skyrocket and attacks made barehanded will produce giant slashes of magical energy. The boost only is active for a short time, around 20 seconds, but that’s enough to slaughter a couple dozen armed soldiers or more. 

Of course, finding enough blood to soak a person completely can be difficult. Blood doesn’t actually spray out of wounds like a fire hose in real life. Except now it does, at least when you kill someone. As a bonus to build up the bloody mess you need for this perk, when you deal a mortal wound to someone, blood will either spray or splash out in amounts that are, frankly speaking, ridiculous. This only counts for mortal wounds though, when they’re already going to die. No giving someone a paper cut and waiting for them to bleed out."
786,,300,Would You Like An Encore? ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Destruction,"Whenever your first attack (or song) finishes and successfully hits and damages its target(s), you can immediately jump into an encore – a second full attack of your choice. Your opponent will be unable to defend against the follow-up, even if the first attack was partially resisted. Also lets you perform encores to songs, dances, and other spectacles if your first number was a hit. Plus, by shouting “Love Shower Pitch!” at the end of the song, you launch a heart-shaped blast guaranteed to hit the target."
787,,300,Magical Artillery ,Dog Days,Destruction,"The magical equivalent to a cannon. Shots fired by this waist high device creates a large shockwave on impact, and is recharged with magic. Good for crowd control. You may import a gun in here to let it run on magic."
788,,300,Lance of the Scarlet Devil - Boosted,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Destruction,"Spending an extra 300 CP will allow for both polearms to be bought instead of having to choose between either. (CG note: Requires base Lance of the Scarlet Devil - Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise first.)
"
789,,300,Shadow Biter ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"Like every animal, even a domestic one, instinctively knows, you can literally bite or claw off a target’s shadow, making it fall off as a piece of cloth. And since you’re smarter than a regular animal, you also know how to cut off the shadow using non-natural means (swords, magical attacks, etc.). The shadows of exceptionally-willed individuals may have a mind of their own, but for the most part the shadow is now a simple item for you to claim. The effects of losing your shadow can range from harmless to dangerous depending on what world you are in, but a victim will never feel the same without his or her shadow, and victims will likely lose some degree of their full powers. Plus, you can gradually learn to make it so that cutting off a shadow will also take away at least some special powers the victim used to have. See Shadow Sewing or My Shadow companion for more benefits.
"
790,,300,Torch of Darkness ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"A jeweled, wooden scepter that burns a vile, purple smog. The smoke embodies the corruptive darkness of growing up, and magical beings such as fairies in range of the smoke will feel intense pain and weakness.
"
791,,300,Elite ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Destruction,"You are the best of the best, among your peoples finest troops. You fight harder, strike more quickly and with more skill and turning aside the clumsy swipes of others is almost insultingly simple.

You can also expect to be given the highest quality equipment and support, and as a mercenary while you should not expect to keep them you can expect to be loaned reasonably powerful magical items from time to time as well.

This carries over into other adventures you may have elsewhere, though if there is no magic in these places you will simply find easier access to the very cutting edge of killing technology.
"
792,,300,Tomb Blade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Destruction,"A cursed, fell weapon made magical by its centuries of steeping in the foul dark magics that swirl and coalesce in long forgotten tombs this blade hates now, the spirit of its once wielder trapped inside the rusted iron shard, hungry to tear away the warmth and life of the living, its bite leaving terrible unhealing wounds.
"
793,,300,Hand of Gods ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Destruction,"A golden, clawed gauntlet that can create immensely powerful balls of searing, magical light to burn your enemies easily piercing all but the strongest magical armour and wards and likely damaging the rest.
"
794,,300,Star Stone Mace ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Destruction,"A massive, double-handed mace crafted before the founding of the first temple city from stone not of this world. Extremely heavy but capable of rendering all magical enchantments inert upon striking.
"
795,,300,Plagued Censer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"Wielded by the devout, these massive flails are their holy prayer censers - the spiked, hollow heads containing the smouldering, mummified pelt of a former Plague Priest wrapped around coals. As they burn, the pelts emit a tainted smoke that carries the horrific pathogens that ravaged the Priest until their death - most often being the Red Plague or Black Death. The censer-bearers then go into battle with prayers on their tongues as they swing the censer-flails - some with two or more of the great, spiked heads chained to the rod.

Choose one of the malefic poxes that ravage the world, or one of the diseases within your own body. You now hold a well-constructed, ornate example of one of Pestilens’ plague-censers, with that disease trapped within the great smoke-emitting flail-head. This flail is enchanted to actively resist and defy all attempts to purify or cleanse the taint it carries and spreads. As you discover and contract new plagues and pathogens, you can choose whether they are added to the toxic miasma emanated from your spiked censer, or if another flail-head is chained on alongside, or if they aren’t added altogether.
"
796,,300,Seed Shooter ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Destruction,"This interesting device is used to weaponize Labrynna’s unusual plant life, and actually makes for a surprisingly good weapon. It’s technically an air powered gun, which is something of an oddity in these lands, but the way it’s shots bounce off of walls is something to behold. Coming with a satchel containing ten Ember, Scent, and Mystery Seeds, it’s honestly one of my favorite ranged weapons. As a bonus, it also comes with an Armor Ring, which increases your defense by a small amount and decreases your attack in the same way - thankfully, you personally aren’t attacking with this, so it doesn’t matter.
"
797,,300,Bomb Flower ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"Bombs are bombs, and can be quite temperamental. Bombs flowers... Well, they do the same thing as Bombs, but are so much worse. This plant serves as a nigh infinite source of Bombs, and when freshly picked are even stronger than the ‘stale’ kind you are most likely familiar with. As a small aside, Gorons seemingly find these to be a delicious snack, because Gorons are like that. Alongside the Bomb Flower itself, you also get a Peace Ring. When you hold a bomb and are wearing the Peace Ring... it doesn’t explode. Well, until you throw it, but that’s still surprisingly useful.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without 
"
798,,300,Magnetic Gloves ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"While these gloves are awkward and somewhat unwieldy, they can be extremely useful in the right scenarios. One of them is bright red, the other a deep blue. Channeling even the tiniest bit of magical energy into them will supercharge their magnetic nature, and will rip weapons and armor off your foes, will yank you across large gaps, and even help you find ores buried in the ground. Normally they wouldn’t be able to function as weapons in their own right, but thanks to this handy dandy Expert Ring, you can punch amazingly hard. You’d deal more damage than a good whack from your basic sword - twice as much, in fact.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
799,,300,Fools Ore ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"This is a hunk of rock. It’s unwieldy, it’s lumpy, it’s hard to get a grip on, and it’s quite frankly worthless to any merchant worth their salt. And yet, when it comes to bashing people upside the head with this thing, it seems to be able to deal just as much damage as the legendary Master Sword. By all laws and logic, it should do no such thing. And yet. ...Regardless, to help you compensate for its incredibly odd shape, it also comes with a Charge Ring, something that will let you get a spin attack ready in one fourth the time. I shudder to think what would happen if you forged an actual sword out of this.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
800,,300,Fire and Ice Arrows ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Destruction,"“The powers of fire and ice have been added to your arrows!”

I really hope you bought the Hero’s Bow if you’re going to buy this, as it would by default be an upgrade to that same weapon. If you didn’t buy it, perhaps you’d like to tack the potential upgrade of freezing or burning your foes onto whatever weapon you do actually have? Both effects require a small amount of magical energy to be used, but are quite worthwhile. As a small note, when attached to the Hero’s Bow, the arrows will gain the ability to alter the environment for a short period of time - a volcano might cool after being struck by a ice arrow, while a frozen wasteland might become somewhat tolerable for a short time after hitting it with a fire arrow.
"
801,,300,Blessing of Din ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Destruction,"Increases your physical and magical power, and allows you to use the spell Din's Fire, creating an expanding dome of flame around you."
802,,300,Elemental Rod ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Destruction,"Fire, Ice, Neutral, or other, you obtain a magical rod attuned to one element of magic, able to dish out pain in that particular flavor. They can also help traverse areas by altering or creating terrain.
"
803,,300,Evil's Bane ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Destruction,"Upgrade for one of your weapons or a shield, making them indestructible and enchanted to do greater damage to evil.
"
804,,300,Megaton Hammer ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Destruction,"A supremely heavy hammer made of solid steel, wieldable by only the mightiest of warriors. Its weight can destroy armor, shatter bones, and crush any obstacle in your path. In addition, the Gorons have enchanted it to wield the elemental power of fire and magma.
"
805,,300,Magic Weapons (Master) ,Terraria,Destruction ,"Can take the form of wands, books, or other items that the wielder channels mana into to cause an effect. It is possible, though not suggested, to take an item from a lower ‘rarity’ when purchasing at a higher price.

Get a Sorcerer Emblem or Avenger Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made of a late Hardmode, pre Lunatic Cultist ore [Chlorophyte, Shroomite, Spectre Bar] or which are listed here: Rainbow Rod, Venom Staff, Shadowbeam Staff, Inferno Fork, Spectre Staff, Staff of Earth, Bat Scepter, Billard Staff, Betsy’s Wrath, Rainbow Gun, Heat Ray, Charged Blaster Cannon, Laser Machinegun, Bubble Gun, Magnet Sphere, Razorblade Typhoon, Toxic Flash, Razorpine, Stellar Tune, Nightglow

See Magic Weapons for more information."
806,,400,Kasaneru Tsumi,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Destruction,"A blade designed to kill. This weapon was
designed to destroy mages and ki users, it’s blade strikes the very soul of its target. Damage it
deals cannot be healed magically, and heals very slowly, and cannot be blocked by mere armor,
requiring supernatural defenses. Those wounded by it lose ki and zeon in equal measure to
their wound, and if it strikes deeply enough, it immediately drains their energy. Finally, any slain
by it are slain down to their very soul, which is annihilated, though divine beings and those
equally loved by destiny are able to avoid such a fate."
807,,400,Dunkelschwert,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Destruction,"A black blade of demonic origin, borne by the
late infernal duke Balthazor, this artifact is half-demon, half weapon. A weapon of spectacular
quality, when someone touches the blade, it fuses with them, inserting itself in their arm, to
never be removed through any means short of cutting off the limb. From then on, the bearer
may manifest up to four blades from their arm at once, each costing him a payment in life force,
and each dancing forward in accordance with his will, a part of his body, rather than a mere
weapon. They can return to his arm, leaving no signs of injury, or of their presence, even to
those who can detect the supernatural. Though the original blade, as a demon, is willing to
corrupt its bearer into a quasi-demonic entity, and to turn their blows against their own allies
when they miss a strike, this one seems to be curiously bereft of such... blessings."
808,,400,Specially Trained Body,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"You’ve undergone a special type of training and
consumed specially healthy nutrients in order to not attain vast longevity but also
develop your body into one blessed with above peak human level of vitality, health,
durability and strength. First of all, you possess immense strength and quick reflexes
to the point you could briefly match someone who is using a strength-enhancing
Teigu with only your sheer physical prowess. As a complement to your strength, you
also have immense physical stamina and durability, as you can brush off that same
someone’s blows as nothing more than ""annoying"" as well as survive and remain
conscious even when extensively injured to the point that regular humans would
have died far before, taking something on par with butchering every piece of your
body to actually kill you if your brain isn’t damaged. As last bonuses, you’re also
capable of eating unusual substances, such as a spear for example, without any
detrimental side effects to your body and you’re able to live up to 130 years as a
human (or up to the very theoretical limit of the lifespan of whatever species you’re
currently a member of), remaining healthy even in your last years. With such a
special physiology, are you sure you’re still a human and not just a human-looking
monster?"
809,,400,Genius Sniper,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"When it comes to proficiency with long range, high
precision ranged weapons, you’re an elite sniper with the only known rival that can
match your skill being the Teigu Pumpkin’s current user, Mine. You possess an
above peak human level of precision and concentration while you’re targeting, being
able to snipe enemies from any range effortlessly as long as you have the right
weapon. Your skills also extend to any other type of similar ranged weapons with
less range, like handguns and even bows. Lastly, as every sniper’s major weakness
is that they leave their backs vulnerable to attacks while they’re preparing to attack
their targets, you also have a special sixth sense that allows you to detect people
that are nearby you when you’re focusing on preparing to shoot with any weapon,
even when your enemies don’t give off any killing intent, giving you the chance to
escape a stealth attack that would’ve finished a regular, non-genius sniper."
810,,400,Blessing of Ares,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Destruction,"Truly, you are a warrior without peer. You
are capable of fighting a dozen warriors at once, and walking away without a scratch while
leaving them lying in the dirt. The strength and speed of all of your actions in combat are
amplified, to the point where it can occasionally feel like everyone else is simply moving in slow
motion. Armor and shields crumple before your blows, and men are knocked flying through the
air from the force of your swings. You have a strong instinct for how to move and when to parry
or dodge blows and open your foe up for counter-attacks.

As an Isu Hybrid, your physique is pushed even further, leaving humanity behind. you are
capable of entering a temporary Wrath state, which turns all forms of damage into non-lethal
wounds. This state will only last for a minute or so, and you will have to wait for several minutes
afterwards before you can retake it, but while it lasts, you will not fall."
811,,400,Deathly Edge,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Destruction,"Over time countless legendary blades have emerged, this blade is one such weapon. It
is not a famous blade, but it is arguably one of the most dangerous due to its properties.
First, the blade is imbued with the End allowing you to kill anything. Even beings that
lack a concept of death will fall if slain by this blade. Second, it can absorb the power of
anything it touches or stabs. For example, if you killed a Hydra it would gain its venom
though you could go for something more impressive like a God of Poison. Lastly, the
blade is capable of cutting through anything. Though you can temporarily dull the edge
should you wish to use it in a safer manner. Lastly, should you already have a favored
weapon you may merge it with this blade."
812,,400,Gaé Bolg Alternative,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Destruction,"Gaé Bolg Alternative is the original set of spears wielded by Scáthach manifested as
her Noble Phantasm. These powerful barbed blood-red spears are capable of altering
causality to pierce the heart of the target. If the target lacks a heart, the spears will
instead strike their most vital areas; for example, when Scáthach fought Leviathan, her
spears instinctively sought out its core. Additionally, you can summon an endless
barrage of these spears, capable of devastating entire armies in a single, overwhelming
assault."
813,,400,World Ender,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Destruction,"World Ender is a skill that can only be acquired by causing the end of a world or its
‘World Order’. This skill enhances any actions that are taken against the world. You
must have been busy throughout your history as you have developed an A-rank version
of this skill. You have led to the downfall of multiple worlds becoming a veritable herald
of the end. Any action you take can directly harm a world or empire directly accelerating
its end. Additionally, your mere presence will weaken worlds, bring about a negative
turn of fate, and bolster those who would bring it down. You however, may optionally
suppress this effect should you not wish to harm a world."
814,,400,Raff-Rafflesia,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"Through your hands you can now channel the power or rot and sickness. You’re able to corrode and
dissolve anything that you touch or that comes near your hands. The rate of corrosion and area of
effect can also be controlled by you, enough to rot away whole buildings in a few seconds at its best. You’re also able to use the corrosion to rot dirt and earth, enabling you to grow and control plants to
a quite unexpectedly scary extent, including doing things like creating plant men soldiers to fight for
you. You have full control over this power."
815,,400,Trident of Poseidon,Greek Mythology,Destruction,"A trident that when struck against the earth can cause mighty
earthquakes or produce wells of seawater. The trident can also be used to bring forth tidal
waves, tsunamis, and sea storms."
816,,400,Zeus' Thunderbolt,Greek Mythology,Destruction,"This thunderbolt shaped scepter allows you to deal instantaneous
retributive destruction by releasing bolts of lightning from its tip."
817,,400,Sibling of the Gorgons,Greek Mythology,Destruction,"You have the skills and abilities of the three gorgon sisters.
Like the eldest sister, Stheno, you can spot weak points on your target and your ferocity will
grow in accordance to those around you. Similar to Euryale, you can release a Death Bellow that
will cause pain to those who hear (the level of pain is based on the distance they hear you,
screaming straight into someone's ears will most likely kill them). And finally, like the famous
Medusa, those who look upon your face will be turned to solid stone.

Requires Mortal Monsters to purchase."
818,,400,Bashōsen,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Destruction,"A large fan that is able to generate all five of the basic nature
transformations, requiring its user just to give a mental command to it, which
produces substantial amounts of the desired element when the fan is waved.
The fan can also be used as a shield to protect its user against elemental
techniques."
819,,400,Totsuka Blade,Naruto,Destruction,"An ethereal weapon with an enchanted blade that, in addition to cutting normally, seals those it pierces, trapping them in a genjutsu-like world of drunken dreams. You can release those sealed within the sword at will if you choose to do so.

Requires Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan to purchase."
820,,400,Null Aura,Worm: Endbringer,Destruction,"There are fewer opponents as terrifying to face off against as those who
take away every advantage that you possess. So it should be no surprise to know that
you are possibly every parahuman’s worst nightmare. You now emit a field that can
suppress or outright nullify powers, or any supernatural ability, really. You can, of
course, control how much of their power is suppressed as well as precisely who within
your range is affected. This is less effective against opponents who are more powerful
than you yourself are, so while you could suppress part of the Warrior’s capabilities, you
would be unable to nullify them without being an Entity of similar or greater power."
821,,400,Immortal Slaying Godbow Sun Feller,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"The Legendary Bow of the Immortal Hou Yi, renowned for its role in downing nine golden sun crows from the sky, leaving one to illuminate the heavens and earth, stands as a godly weapon capable of slaying immortals and gods alike.

Following this remarkable feat, the bow underwent further enhancement through the power of the nine fallen golden sun crows. Each crow infused it with the power of a mystical sun. When drawn, the bow requires no physical arrows; instead, it conjures an arrow of Sunfire. Moreover, the bow offers several firing modes for the wielder:

Multi-shot: Upon drawing, multiple arrows resembling flaming feathers materialize around the user, allowing them to rain down hundreds, if not thousands, of arrows simultaneously, dealing fiery destruction to adversaries.

Tracking shot: The arrow takes on the form of a three-legged golden sun crow mid-flight, relentlessly pursuing its target to ensure a precise strike.

Charge shot: The arrow's power intensifies as the bow is drawn and held. Upon release, its force can penetrate any defense, cleanly piercing the target or causing a devastating explosion that turns surrounding matter into molten slag.

As an immortal weapon, those lacking divine strength will struggle to unleash its full potential. A novice wielder might only manage to unleash enough power to demolish a city block with a single shot. However, with practice, one can unlock more of its true capabilities.

Individuals possessing powers related to the sun or solar energy will find it easier to harness the bow's full potential. Even after unlocking its full power, the bow remains an extraordinary conduit for channeling solar abilities, akin to Mjolnir's relationship with Thor."
822,,400,Bomber,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"Through physical contact, you possess the ability to discreetly attach an imperceptible explosive device onto individuals and objects, That only you can see. The destructive potential of the device can be precisely calibrated, spanning from the potency of a conventional military hand grenade to that of the formidable GBU-43, colloquially known as the Mother of All Bombs (~11 tons TNT). At your discretion, you retain the capability to adjust the explosive yield at any given moment subsequent to attachment, as well as determine the desired time of detonation.

There is no limit to how many bombs you can attach at a time."
823,,400,Ruler of the Primordial Flames,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"Your pyrokinesis has evolved, granting you power over fire and flame rather than just cinders and ash, and you can now regenerate using fire instead of just cinders and ashes. All of the things that you make out of cinders and ash are capable of withstanding ten times the force that they previously could.

In addition to this, your burning core has also evolved, becoming so dense and hot that it could be considered a miniature sun. It has also become durable enough to withstand a nuclear bomb.

Alongside this, you can temporarily or permanently gift someone pyrokinesis focused around either cinders, ash, or fire, though this will temporarily weaken you by one ninth for a lunar cycle per individual you give powers to.

Requires Lord of Cinder to purchase."
824,,400,When All You Have Is A Hammer,Bofuri,Destruction ,"Specialization is great, until you run into someone immune to your specialization damage.

This guarantees the presence of a “nail,” a method by which you can use your specialization damage to hurt someone or something normally immune to it. It might be something you’ve already done, or it might be something new, but it will be available. It might involve a bit of something besides the hammer, but it will be something you have (or can easily get) and it will leverage the massive power of your specialization."
825,,400,Morning! I Took Care Of It While You Were Sleeping! ,Bofuri,Destruction ,"The more speed, acceleration, evasion, teleportation, or other mobility you have available, the stronger your attacks hit. Those are “available” if you have a temporary boost ready to use, are using those attributes, or those attributes are ready to use at a moment’s notice."
826,,400,Ultimate Grudge ,Final Fantasy XIII,Destruction ,"At some point, you have to draw the line. All enemies who have insulted you or injured you receive all of the damage they dealt to you – back onto themselves. They are also paralyzed for a short while afterwards.

The effect is unavoidable – within a fifteen meter range. The ability “resets” after use, it does however, only work once per fight. Enemies hit by the ability before cannot be hit by it again in the same fight."
827,,400,Maw of Oblivion,Egyptian Mythology,Destruction ,"When someone dies, their ka and ba move on to the hall of judgement in Duat and hopefully then to Aaru as spiritual beings, but not all complete the journey, caught by predators in Duat or having their hearts consumed by ravenous beings for their sins in life.

You are one of these terrible devourers, able to eat practically anything, such as souls, shadows, light or air, gold or rivers. Magical beings and artifacts must be overwhelmed with your own heka or personal magical power in order to safely consume them – lest they merely jam in your throat or enter your belly and reside there until they might escape once more into the world.

All the things which you consume are completely destroyed without poisoning or discomforting you. Naturally, they must also fit in your mouth...you will require wide jaws indeed to swallow the sun."
828,,400,Soulsword,Marvel Zombies,Destruction ,"Like Magik, you’ve grasped the entirety of your being and created a weapon out of your soul. Traditionally, it’s a sword, but it doesn’t have to be. Just something that can be held in your hands, preferably a melee weapon. This weapon isn’t to be used against foes in the material world; swinging your sword at a physical thing or a person will see it pass through harmlessly. The most it’ll do to somebody is knock them out. it’s made for the immaterial. The soulsword is the bane of whatever midnight beasts may come your way, a reminder that humanity (or whatever you are) is not without its fangs. Spells, spellcasters, creatures of the night, and normally intangible creatures will fall before this sword like grain before the harvest. The blade, being part of you, can be dismissed and summoned whenever you like. Lastly, we’re going to make an exception about the point about the weapon not being able to harm physical matter, because we saw Franklin Richards use it to cut the zombified Silver Surfer’s board in twain in the last issue of Resurrection. The weapon, should you wish it, is fantastically sharp."
829,,400,The Voice,Marvel Zombies,Destruction ,"Tremendous sonic power is at your beck and call. Your control over sound waves can be used for a lot of things, not the least of which is a sonic scream capable of shattering glass, metal, bone, and much more. Besides that, you can fly by riding these waves, echolocate, and protect yourself by making some sort of force field. You yourself are immune to all sound-based attacks. Your vocal cords, lungs, and throat have been strengthened to take all this strain. Try not to lose your voice. "
830,,400,Optic Blast,Marvel Zombies,Destruction ,"Through a connection to an extradimensional plane of infinite energy, you have gained the ability to fire blasts of energy from your eyes. These aren’t lasers. Rather, they’re heatless beams of force that can blow straight through industrial steel. They could even blow through entire buildings if you’re pushing it to its utmost limit. This comes with an extremely good sense of spatial awareness and a natural knack for trigonometry, to the point where you might be able to bounce your beams off surfaces to hit targets. You can also bend your beam and adjust their width. Unlike Cyclops, you don’t need a visor to control your power."
831,,400,Demolition Man,Marvel Zombies,Destruction ,"By making skin contact with a physical, inorganic object, you can begin “charging” it with energy, essentially turning it into a bomb. It’s very destructive. This happens by turning the potential energy of the object’s molecules into kinetic energy. The larger the object, the longer it takes to charge. It’s usually quick. You instantly could turn something the size of a playing card into a grenade, but something the size of a skyscraper would take a few minutes. If you don’t like seeing things detonate, you can instead have them dissolve into their constituent molecules."
832,,400,One Bite,Marvel Zombies,Destruction ,"That’s all it takes. To be honest, it’s surprising how far the apocalypse got. How do you turn someone who’s made out of sand? Someone who’s literally a flaming skeleton? Someone who can turn intangible? Someone who’s just too tough for your teeth to puncture? Well, that’s not something you have to worry about. You can eat almost anything. Any defenses just don’t work if you’re attacking in a very specific way - by biting. Your teeth will shear through armor and extremely durable flesh, and they’ll find their mark no matter what fancy powers your next meal might throw your way. No resistances or immunities will save them. They can turn intangible or do whatever they want - it won’t stop you from making them your next meal. Of course, that doesn’t stop them from hurting you, or just getting away before you can really take a chunk out of them. But if you get close enough? It’s over."
833,,400,Soul Purge,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction ,"Warping the arcane flow, you can purge all of the magickal energy an enemy has. In an action akin to letting the sink drain, you must expend your own magical energy in order to drain a foe. While it is certainly most effective against mages, be wary that you do not drain yourself completely if your foe has far greater reserves than you."
834,,400,Gáe Bolg,Irish Mythology,Destruction ,"A great spear wielded by Scathach, and then Cu Chulainn, made from the rib of a great sea serpent, which needs to be drop-kicked at the enemy. It pierces any armor and then splits into thirty barbs, which themselves divide further. Anything mortal struck with Gae Bolg will definitely die, but you can only use it once per battle and then must wash the latest victim off to get the spear to fold back up."
835,,400,One Against Many,Irish Mythology,Destruction ,"There are countless tales in Eire, from Cu Chulainn holding back the armies of Medb to Diarmuid’s slaying three armies in one day, of a lone hero facing a huge horde. Fear not in these circumstances, warrior, for the number of your foe will provide them no advantages, not even to tire, distract or slow you. Unless an army contains fighters to match you, you shall breeze through them dispensing death at will."
836,,400,Baleful Gaze,Irish Mythology,Destruction ,"Balor of the Baleful Eye was king of the Fomor, a great cyclops with a special power. Whatever he lay eyes on died or was set ablaze, before Lugh’s spear closed his eye forever. You can also charge your eyes with the powers of death, to slay or set aflame all before you."
837,,400,Righting a Wrong,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Destruction ,"Cruelty is sometimes in human nature but so is fighting against it. You always know when a terrible wrong is being committed. When you work against such cruelties you are in your top form, even doing considerably more damage to the wicked and vile."
838,,400,Dragon Slayer        ,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction ,"Dragoons are especially well suited to fighting and killing dragons, their lancers reach along with their dragon partners and amazing jumping abilities allow them to slay foes that would often rain death upon any being below them. As a dragoon you also have learned how to spot the weak points in dragons, any time you fight a being or creature that is called a dragon or fits the description of a dragon you can immediately spot its weaknesses as well as finding it easier to exploit them. You will find your spear almost has a mind of its own as you drive it home into the heart of your scaled enemy (or eye, or wing as the case may be) to hit their weaknesses."
839,,400,Dark Power,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction ,"It is said that only the few who can tame the dark flames that burn within their soul, feeding on their sorrow and hatred are chosen to walk the path of the dark knight, you are one of these people. You can empower your strikes with the deepness of your emotions, empowering them to land heavier and do more damage to your enemies, making the pain you deal unto them match the pain you feel within. This is the most basic of skills a dark knight must master, you may find that bringing harm onto others never lessens the pain you feel within, that the void only seems to widen the more you draw upon it. This is a good thing however, for you draw power from the pain."
840,,400,Enhancing Elements,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction ,As a swordsman and a mage you have learned the art of adding magical damage to your attacks. Slightly increasing the damage you can do with a variety of effects ranging from simple elemental effects to blindness causing curses. This skill allows you to channel your spells through your blade to curse or damage your foes and while it is exceedingly useful you can only empower melee weapons in this way.
841,,400,Frenchman’s End,Dies Irae,Destruction ,"You were raised alongside an icon of death. Your parents manned the guillotines, you watched the blades drop every day of your life and when it came time for you to die, you knelt before that altar like so many thousands of others. Yet you didn’t die. That guillotine engraved its nature onto your soul and turned you into an extension of its own purpose, though you managed to control this nature. Whenever someone comes into physical contact with you, you are able to instantly decapitate them. It will be a clean separation of head from the neck, as if they had been executed by a guillotine. This isn’t necessarily able to kill someone, those who can regenerate from such things will do so and those with no need of a head will not need it. But there is no way to resist it, save from not touching you directly."
842,,400,Divine Retribution,Dies Irae,Destruction ,"Those who rise against God are struck back down with divine punishment. You might not be able to lay claim to a divine title but you are still able to borrow some of that biblical fervour to punish those who displease you. So long as you can physically grab hold of someone, you are able to force a special kind of curse on them. This curse is personal to every individual, something that will cause them endless unhappiness and constant dissatisfaction with life. It will make their life a living hell, one way or another. A man who loves battle beyond all other things would never find a satisfying battle. A man who wished only to repent for his sins would be forced to commit them over and over again. This curse is powerful but it will always have an escape clause linked to the curse itself. The battle maniac beating a foe he failed to in the past or the penance seeker managing to succeed where he once failed. The stronger these people are compared to you, the easier the condition will be to satisfy. "
843,,400,Götterdämmerung,Dies Irae,Destruction ,"The undead are walking the streets of Suwahara city these days and they’re much harder to put down than your average zombie. But in the end, even the Einherjar themselves can die or at least be locked away for good. When you kill a being, you kill it for good. You’ll have to beat through any defences or regenerative abilities they have, so the warriors of the LDO are still a tough battle, but once you have them killed, they’ll stay dead even if they might normally revive anyway."
844,,400,Living Relic,Dies Irae,Destruction ,"You are yourself a weapon. Quite literally, you are a living, sapient Ahnenerbe that was created by Mercurius in the past. Your being has the same basic, innate traits as an Ahnenerbe such as striking at the soul and body at once. Your nature as an Ahnenerbe also lets you wield any Ahnenerbe, or similar relic or magical item, that you can handle even if it would normally only be usable by certain beings or dangerous to hold. Those items seemingly recognise you as just another weapon, instead of an invalid user, and will work for you as if you were the fitting owner."
845,,400,Protective Rage,Hotel Transylvania,Destruction ,"There is something to be said about the rage one feels when one is trying to protect someone they love. It lets warriors fight to their last breath against enemies they could never otherwise face, pushes one to great heights as they work to be better for their sake, and it can make monsters out of even the gentlest of men. Now you too have this power as when someone you love is being threatened you may enter a berserk state and temporarily gain a great deal of power and possibly tap into abilities you didn’t think you had."
846,,400,Thor,The God of High School Jump,Destruction ,"The Norse God of Storms. Thor grants his partner greatly increased physical ability, though not nearly to the level of one Heracles, and the ability to fly at great speeds, both for the user and for them to make other inanimate objects or people fly as well. He also allows the user to fire huge, pink laser beams from their eyes at will, each of which are incredibly destructive rays."
847,,400,Bow of Hercules,The God of High School Jump,Destruction ,"The mighty bow of Heracles himself. A single shot from this bow, even from a normal human and with a normal arrow, has the power to split a truck in half and destroy the road behind the vehicle. As the user’s power increases, so too will the force they may fire the arrows with, as long as their physical strength is also matching. Any arrows fired are also coated in a weakened hydra’s blood, which will weaken any struck target’s body over time."
848,,400,Third Key,The God of High School Jump,Destruction ,"A Key is a being imbued with the power to break the Taboo, usually a Charyeok or human with a particularly intense hatred for the Gods who happened upon this power. Normally, there are only two Keys. One is the Nine Tails Guardian within Il-pyo Park, who was able to unseal, or potentially reseal, the Taboo on all of humanity in each of the Three Realms, and the other was Pandora within Lee Soo-Jin, which focused on a far more individual level, able to unseal the taboo on an individual as well as bring out their innate potential, while also being able to seal the supernatural powers of other beings that were close to the user’s level.

You are a Third Key, with powers similar to the above two but unique to yourself and one of your Charyeok. You constantly unseal any form of Taboo or like effect on yourself, even whilst unaware or unconscious, supernatural effects that would prevent you from harming a being. This does not negate magical shields or durability, rather any effect that would specifically prevent you from harming or hitting a target at all is nullified completely. You are also able to perform this same unsealing for any being within your range of sight. You may also, like your fellows, perform a sealing variant of your new ability, forcing the taboo or any like effect to be constantly sealed on those you can see though this will not maintain itself once they leave your vicinity."
849,,400,One Shot,Gods of Blood and Powder,Destruction ,"You are a born sharp shooter. Even with the pretty unreliable flintlock muskets and pistols it is almost impossible for you to miss. Your hand is steady even in the most brutal fighting. You can load a rifle with incredible speed and handle several pistols simultaneously with ease. The bullet is merely an extension of your mind to you and your mind always finds its target. Without being a powder mage this perk won’t give you any supernatural ability to make impossible shots, but should you be one then only Taniel Two-Shot would be considered your equal."
850,,400,Mad Jumper,Gods of Blood and Powder,Destruction ,"Like Mad Ben Styke you’re a walking giant. You are over 7 feet tall and weigh over twenty-two stones and are still deceptively quick for your size. You’re not only tough enough to survive two volleys of a shooting command, but also strong enough to fight and win against a Dragonman, an enchanted Dynize elite warrior, caving in their skull with sheer force. In your rage you’re more like a force of nature than you are a man. Whatever strength and power you have gained with this perk over normal humans, it will also apply as well in different alt forms and through different enhancements compared to the base of those forms, basically being a strength booster."
851,,400,Finest Fencer        ,Elantris,Destruction ,"In truth, the Selish people are generally non-violent. This only makes those with actual training and combat experience that much more exceptional. Whether you trained with Iandol’s soldiers, are one of the few surviving members of the Duledel nobility, or simply participated in the Teod national sports, you have received instruction on how to swing a blade. For 200cp, you are an even match for Sarene. This puts you above most of the fencers in Teod and makes you a proficient combatant, but still less skilled than 3 out of 4 Duledan citizens. Alternatively, you may favor unarmed combat and choose to receive training in the martial arts of the Teullu people.

For 400cp, you gain even more skill and talent, making you a peer of even the Duledan Republicans. More importantly, you’ve gained something exceptionally rare on Sel; actual combat experience. You’ve mastered your chosen fighting style both on the sparring grounds and the battlefield. Take care, however. Domi knows not every problem can be solved with a sword."
852,,400,Dust Implanting,RWBY,Destruction ,"No Huntsman would ever underestimate the raw power of Dust. In the right hands these crystals are a force to be reckoned with. Some go as far as directly implanting them into their body, to use the power inside directly, like one Hazel Reinhardt, which does come with some risks and a lot of pain. You now share a certain talent for Dust usage. Dust and similar kinds of power sources are almost laughably easy for you to use in combat, making it child’s play for you to utilize these powers to their fullest potential. Should you choose to do so, you can even make them directly part of your body, enhancing yourself with these forces with no risk to yourself."
853,,400,Mist: Suffering,Final Fantasy IX,Destruction ,"The Mist, aggravated by the inability of the dead to move into the cycle of reincarnation, has gripped Gaia in an inescapable bind. The aura of Mist, grown thick by death, is thick enough in some places that it can well become opaque. Thankfully, your companions and you remain unaffected.

The Mist, swarming with the souls of the dead, will assault the bodies of the living – harassing all those unaligned with you. This leaves the victims with their wounds re-opened, be they physical or mental, and the effects of healing in any form is reduced significantly.

Left with nothing to harass, or no opportunity, the dead will animate whatever they can in order to turn their wrath on the living."
854,,400,Cut you down,Cult of the Lamb,Destruction ,"Mastery of combat, a boon and a curse in equal measure. The dancing steps of war and violence have revealed themselves to you, granting you skill equal to the greatest paragons of this world in the ways of bloodshed. Be it by bow, blade, or something stranger, may you paint your legend across this land in the blood of your foes."
855,,400,Locust Fangs: Fists of Mass Destruction,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction ,"You have mastered the art of removing the energy dispersal from your attacks, much like the members of the Locust Swarm Ashema. Whether through the Power of Ego or another technique, this means that you have the unique ability to always unleash your full power on your designated target without causing any damage to the surrounding scenery or spectators.

And, like the Ashema, you're not doing this out of concern for the environment, but to satisfy a desire to inflict the most damage possible on your adversary. As a result, your attacks become much more deadly as your opponent is forced to confront you with all of your strength. Punches capable of shattering planets will atomize your victim rather than transforming the planet into a jumble of floating rocks. A useful skill for those who are primarily interested in one-on-one battles."
856,,400,Kingly Gaze,Fate/Grand Order,Destruction ,"Heavy is the gaze of one as high as you are. Just standing before your eyes will make others feel the truth of what they are and exactly how low they are in comparison to you. Just by looking at a person, you can harm them with the weight of the shame and guilt they’ll immediately feel for opposing you. The weaker they are in comparison to you, the worse this effect will be. Those on your level or above will feel strained in their movements and slightly weakened but the further below you someone is, the weaker they’ll be when in your sight and the more pain they’ll feel for every second they’re under your watchful eyes. If they’re as weak as to be no more than a normal human or less, their minds will simply break from a single glance from you, provided you don’t purposefully limit yourself to spare the mortals. "
857,,400,Genuine Man Eater,Fate/Grand Order,Destruction ,"Too many times has your heart been betrayed and knives thrust into your back. You’ve loved again and again and each time its gone wrong, all that’s left is hatred. At the very least, even if you don’t feel that hate, your blows are empowered against those like the ones who betrayed you. Men or Women, one entire side thrown under the same banner as targets. Whichever gender you choose here, you’ll find any attack against them from you to deal five times over the normal amount of damage. The hate in your blows empowers you, letting what might be just scratches instead become life threatening injuries and crippling blows kill outright."
858,,400,Distorted Blade,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Destruction ,"Some Fixers treat their weapons like they were a part of themselves, some literally via bionics and prosthetics though, in the end, all Fixers use their weapons for the same reason and to the same goal, physical harm to their enemies. Your equipment of choice is more though, it might be formed from your mind, taken from a distortion, or simply caught in a distorting area itself. Whatever the cause, the weapon you have(or imported) now wounds on not just a physical level but a mental one, so even non-blunt weapons make the target feel a concussive force or more fatigue in addition to whatever you hit them with. If enough pressure builds up in their mind, well normally they end up knocked out. But those with more fortitude will stay conscious but in a delirious state, potentially attacking their allies or otherwise causing more harm than if they were just unconscious."
859,,400,Disposal,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Destruction ,"R Corp has an entire branch dedicated to... correcting mistakes... whereas W Corp and the former L Corp had employees who were tasked with cleaning up byproducts that would be a nightmare if it was known by the public. You’ve learned from these agents and killing anything that is mass-produced or is supposed to be kept hidden is much easier. Both from a mental standpoint, they could just make more of them after all and it’s better if the public doesn’t see them anyway, and from a literal perspective since, they all act similarly or their reliance on your unfamiliarity is predictable. You can still hold affection to these types of entities since the one you know is clearly different from the junk that’s made by the dozen."
860,,400,Eye of Death,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Destruction ,"Fixers kill people, pretty often at that, but you’re not just flailing a weapon at someone until they stop moving, there’s a skill to your work and you’ve reached the pinnacle of it. When fighting you happen to hit lethal points far more often, cutting open arteries and slashing tendons. Additionally, you rarely leave yourself exposed to your enemy or lose focus, and the deaths of your allies don’t leave you shaken until you are out of danger, if anything you are more effective with them dead since failure would mean they died in vain. The perk also gives you toggleable fancy red glowing eyes, for intimidation purposes."
861,,400,Fukushuu no Taiken/Cursed Sword of Revenge,Kurohime,Destruction ,"This is a massive blade, easily longer than a tallest human, several hands in width, and thicker than a man’s fist. Yet, while wielding this sword, you can wield this massive and cumbersome blade with all the finesse of a rapier, for this sword draws upon your lifeforce to empower itself, allowing you to sever building-sized monsters with ease and unleash waves of power with the slashes of your sword. If you were to wield this weapon for years at a time, it would eat away your flesh and reduce you to a skeleton. Or at least, that’s what it would normally do. This one is provided a separate supply of life energy to feed it, so you can use it freely without needing to worry about it sucking away your life."
862,,400,Piercing Penetration,Kurohime,Destruction ,"A single punch is easily endured; thirty punches, maybe. But thirty punches in the same place? Never. Now, your attacks will compound upon each other the more accurately they target the same point. Why, if you were to fire off 24 bullets into a cliffside, you could snap off a chunk of stone a dozen feet thick... and if you had some good aiming perks, you might be able to do so with enough precision that the stone fell exactly where you intended it to."
863,,400,Sword Waves,Kurohime,Destruction ,"When you swing a weapon with strong enough intent and with enough willpower behind it, you will find that the reach of your weapon will extend beyond the length of the blade. An invisible force will allow your weapon’s edge to strike outside of your normal reach, allowing you to reach meters away from your position with your swings. This effect is most pronounced in melee weapons, giving a possible ranged attack use; however, it can be seen in ranged weapons too, as it projects the force of a projectile in front of the actual bullet.

The range of this effect can be increased with time and training."
864,,400,Life-Eater,Kurohime,Destruction ,"Many people must face the risk of death via old age, but you’ve left such worries behind. You are able to suck the life out of the helpless, unprepared, or the surprised, stealing away their unlived years to increase your own power and return your youth. This is an inefficient process, letting you live only a few years more for each young person you kill. You can also do this without killing to rapidly age a subject, but this is less effective. Doing it nonlethally would only store up a tenth of the time you would otherwise have stolen from them."
865,,400,Subspace Bomb,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction ,"A large, spherical bomb. Whilst these normally require two R.O.B.s to lock into the sides to activate it, this item comes with a remote control that works with the Subspace Bombs granted by this item purchase (and no others) that will allow you to activate it from a distance.

When activated, it will countdown from three minutes before exploding. This ‘explosion’ in fact connects the world to Subspace, externally appearing as a large purple sphere. The explosion is large enough to encompass a stadium, but also slow enough that a Fighter could outrun the escape if they started running from the bomb with at least 90 seconds to spare.

In future worlds, the Subspace Bomb will instead connect to an equivalent dark dimension or realm to the world you are currently in. If none is known to already exist, the Subspace Bomb will ensure the presence of one nonetheless. Should the Subspace Bomb be lost or destroyed, unless it was activated properly, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours. The remote will always be replaced after 24 hours if it was lost or destroyed.

If properly activated, you will not receive a Subspace Bomb until the following jump, so use it wisely. Post-chain, you will instead receive a new Subspace Bomb 10 years after the last one was properly activated."
866,,400,Dark Cannon,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Destruction ,"A heavy cannon, which vaguely resembles a black dragon’s head.

The weapon requires a long charging period, after which it fires black ‘directional arrow’-like beams of energy. Once the initial charge up is complete, the cannon is capable of firing off multiple shots before it has to recharge. Ammunition is not a concern. Should a Fighter be hit by one of these beams, they will automatically be forced into their Trophy Form. A single beam can only affect a single Fighter in this manner. Post-jump, any individual hit by one of these beams will be transformed into a trophy-like state.

Despite its power, this weapon has several flaws. The beams are easily dodged by an aware Fighter, the cannon itself is not very durable and can easily be destroyed by a Fighter. The charging period will allow an aware Fighter to take initiative. As such, this weapon is best employed in sneak attacks or ambushes.

Should your Dark Cannon be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
867,,400,Cataclysmic Orb,Miraculous Ladybug,Destruction ,"Be careful with this Jumper. You now have in your possession a dark orb with a portion of Plagg’s destructive energy contained within a fragile glass-like material. When you smash it against something (causing the glass casing to dissipate harmlessly), you can transfer that energy into that thing such as your hand, a sword, or an important object you need to protect (the orb can infer which “thing” is your target, such as inhabiting the bullet and not the gun). The next valid target to touch it, will be destroyed via Cataclysm, up to the size of a building (the orb can also infer which “thing” is your target in this case, such as destroying the cell bars and not the whole prison). These replenish once per Jump or every 10 years."
868,,400,Tiger(Roaar),Miraculous Ladybug,Destruction ,"Concept: Elation

Form: Panjas Bracelet (look this one up if you don’t know what it looks like, its awesome)

Tool: Bolas

Power: “Clout” - Fills the user with a sudden burst of energy, courage, or fighting spirit, and more importantly, charges their super fist of doom! Powerful enough to destroy a small building in a single blow and scales with the user’s strength."
869,,400,Mirakung Fu,Miraculous Ladybug,Destruction ,"You are now an expert in Mirakung Fu, an ancient technique practiced by Guardians in case Miraculous users go rogue. It is mostly Kung Fu (about at the level of Surprisingly Skilled Teenage Fighters), although it is several times as effective as it should be against superhuman targets. In this Jump this includes Miraculous users and akumatized targets."
870,,400,Earthshatter,High School DxD,Destruction ,"These are a pair of arm guards clad in bronze. Their application is simple and direct - the user’s physical attacks, whether with a weapon or with their fists and feet, will enjoy a boost of kinetic force that can pulverize rock and fight things many time their size and strength. There is no muscle power involved - the Sacred Gear turns mana into pure kinetic force, making the user stronger, faster, and tougher as the physical force of their blows and movements are increased while those of the enemy are mitigated. This has limits, however...it can only provide and prevent as much power as your mana can feed, and things that don’t rely on blunt or kinetic force can’t be defended against by this Gear alone. Try punching them before it happens."
871,,400,Festering Life Sword,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"The cursed tool of the cockroach cursed spirit Kurourushi, despite its name the Festering Life Sword appears less like a traditional blade, and more like a thick- bladed cleaver made of flesh. Despite its impractical shape, it’s a perfectly serviceable sword, capable of cutting just as well as any regular blade. That said, its main draw are the six barrels built into its blade, each of which holds a small egg.

At any time, you can cause these barrels to fire out their payload, the eggs rapidly flying forth towards whatever the blade’s swung at. Should these eggs make contact with flesh they’ll burrow beneath the skin, and in a matter of seconds they’ll hatch, fist-sized insect cursed spirits bursting out of the poor victim’s body. It only takes mere seconds for the sword to ‘reload’ too, the barrels rapidly refilling to be fired once again. The curses created through this weapon, though weak individually, are subservient to you."
872,,400,Supreme Martial Solution,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"Alongside Hiten, Supreme Martial Solution was one of the two cursed tools wielded by Sukuna. Shaped like a vajra, a weapon symbolising a thunderbolt, it unsurprisingly has properties to do with lightning. Just by holding it aloft and willing it, you can cause the weapon to fire off powerful blasts of electricity, leaving behind craters in the ground wherever its lightning strikes. Naturally, it probably won’t be much use against someone resistant to electricity, but against anyone else? It’ll make a devastating weapon indeed."
873,,400,Dragon-Bone,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"The masterpiece of the curse user Juzo Kumiya, Dragon-Bone is a cursed tool in the form of a single-edged sword. With a crude-looking leather handle, a mechanical hilt, and a thick blade with three vents near the hilt on the blunt end, it’s a rather odd- looking weapon, but deadly nonetheless. Through normal use, especially when used to strike something, it accumulates force and cursed energy within the blade. Then, at any time the user wishes, these can be ejected from the vents like jets, granting the blade an explosive boost in speed and cutting power. Such power is enough for it to slice clean through metal reinforced by cursed energy, to say nothing of the violence it could do to a person’s body. Even without its boosts, it’s still a sharp and durable weapon regardless, enough to wound almost any cursed spirit."
874,,400,Technique Nullification,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"You’re able to use your cursed energy to negate the abilities of others. Cursed techniques, barriers, even seals strong enough to trap a special grade sorcerer – all of these can be dispelled by you. Your cursed technique takes the form of beams of light you can fire from your body, or even call down from the sky in a great blast at the greatest extent, nullifying anything made of cursed energy caught within. Due to the unique nature of cursed spirits, this technique is incredibly dangerous against them. It’s worth noting, though, that this won’t be an instant skill, and those strong enough may be able to reinforce themselves to resist this.

As a side ability, your technique also gives you the ability to fly and hover at a decent pace, letting you move through the air roughly as fast as you can run."
875,,400,Swordmaster,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"During the Culling Games, many powerful individuals from centuries past were incarnated in the modern age, hijacking the bodies of those who’d unwittingly consumed their Cursed Objects. Yet, among all of the talented ancient sorcerers, there was one outlier: Hagane Daido, a non-sorcerer unable to even see curses. Despite lacking the capacity to use jujutsu, however, Daido more than made up for this with his by being a true master of the blade.

Choose any form of weapon you like: the sword is the most natural choice, but it could be spears, axes, bows, or even something stranger besides. Whatever your choice, you possess incredible prowess with it, enough to stand at the peak of what is possible. Even if you lacked the ability to manipulate cursed energy, you’d be able to fight on equal terms with a pretty powerful jujutsu sorcerer or a cursed spirit capable of moving at Mach speed, your sheer skill letting you overcome their superior physical abilities and esoteric techniques. It’s to the point that just holding your weapon of choice causes you to exude an aura of pure lethality, a testament to your mastery sure to strike terror into the hearts of your foes.

Alternatively, you may forsake specialising in a single weapon type to gain a more general talent. No matter what it is or what form it takes, so long as it’s a weapon of some sort, as soon as you pick it up you’ll not only know how to use it, but use it well. You won’t be close to the same level as the option above, but you make up for this with the sheer versatility this talent gives you, allowing you to wield anything at the level of a well-trained combatant. There’s nothing saying you can’t improve your skills further, either."
876,,400,DEATH,Final Fantasy VII,Destruction ,"Congratulations, someone has successfully managed to summon the willpower to resist your influence or otherwise shake off involuntary mutations you have attempted to give them! Their reward? Death. More specifically, an infectious disease similar to Geostigma that induces a deep depression, physical pain, fatigue, and occasionally horrifying visions of yourself and your goals. This will steadily sap them of their will to resist you both mentally and physically, until the disease develops strongly enough to kill them or they succumb to your influence. What's more, ordinary Materia magic or medicine won't heal or cure it...it would take an infusion of purified Lifestream energy or something truly beyond this world to cure it. You may, if you wish, remove this disease from a victim you have 'blessed' with it with a simple act of will. A merciful option, should you wish to use it. This disease only activates to those you have personally tried to mutate or experiment on, and only if you wish it to."
877,,400,"Guns, Guns, Guns",Final Fantasy VII,Destruction ,"So there's an unfortunate logistical fact to using firearms as your primary weapon: No matter how strong or skilled you are, the bullet fires at the same velocity and caliber as it would back when you had twigs for arms and half an idea of what you were doing. This is perfectly fine when you're fighting ordinary men or monsters with soft skin, but becomes a problem as your foes grow stronger while you're forced to either update your hardware or get a better weapon. But what if that weren't the case? Through some strange technique, the more physically strong you are and the more skilled you are as a gunslinger, the more powerful your gun becomes. The bullet strikes deeper, the insides of your enemies practically burst, and even a handgun can possibly fell a giant monster with a well-placed shot in your hand. Even better, you don't suffer from any recoil or backblast from any personal-sized firearms you use from now on. Lock and load!"
878,,400,Wargod’s Blessing ,Fairy Fencer F,Destruction ,Through the magic of this powerful bracer the holder becomes a force of destruction. The strength of all weapon and magic attacks increases by an incredible degree. A simple fire spell could turn into a searing blaze.
879,,400,Mana Burst,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Destruction ,"A classic for any Saber. By applying magical energy, you boost the functions of the target. A simple process made terrifying by the skill Sabers tend to have with it. A proper user can easily increase all physical attributes to a massively heightened level or apply similar boosts of power to the functions of Noble Phantasms or other abilities they possess. The normal use of Mana Burst focuses on increasing what already exists and is what you gain by default. 

As a master of the art, even a small amount of energy that an ordinary human magus might provide can let you fight against powerful Servants evenly for a time. Your skills lie in exceptionally efficient use of magical energy. A constant supply renders you almost unstoppable, uncatchable and practically invulnerable to even a strong Servant, statistics boosted to the stratosphere and even basic attacks equaling Noble Phantasm releases from lesser fighters. Though not exactly practical in energy costs, Mana Burst can even be used to form destructive constructs from energy, such as dragon heads or chains to pursue and attack foes from range. 

Alternatively, you can have your Mana Burst be of a specific element such as Fire or Poison. Though the reinforcement benefit will be significantly lower, you’ll be able to produce and control the chosen element from your body. A powerful Saber with Mana Burst [Fire] could produce flames that melt even Noble Phantasms down to slag! Though there’s no limit on what kind of elements can be chosen, those with more innate power will be proportionately more costly to make use of, and Mana Burst is exceptionally poor at attempting to replicate more complex magecraft-like effects."
880,,400,Save The Queen,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction ,"This fancifully designed rapier looks as though it was designed for fashion instead of for the battlefield. However, a number of enchantments have been inlaid into the metal that not only give it the durability necessary to slice through flesh and armor, but several invaluable enhancements to the wielder. Those who hold the rapier will find that it boosts their strength, both physically and magically. It can turn a simple firebolt into one that can slag metal or a glancing blow into one that drives straight through armor."
881,,400,Burning Fist,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction ,"A set of knuckle dusters imbued with the power of fire. While they are capable weapons in their own right, their ability to add an explosion of flames to a punch make them a pyromaniac’s dream. The magic takes a short while to recharge between each use, but you will be able to decide when you wish to unleash it with simple, shouted verbal command."
882,,400,A Warrior's Rage,God Of War (2018),Destruction ,"Within you is a seemingly bottomless well of rage that always threatens to consume you. But through abstinence and discipline you have managed to control it. Despite this threat against your sanity, it is also a source of great and terrible power. Throughout your life you have seen warriors lose themselves to their rage, letting it control them and lose themselves to it. You have decided that you will not follow their path. Instead you have tamed your wrath and use it to fuel your strength in combat rather than let it control you. By unleashing this rage, you gain a significant increase to your combat prowess and healing speed with the more damage you do to your enemies the more you heal yourself, finding that your controlled wrath is powerful but be wary. If you stay in this state too long you risk losing yourself to your wrath and begin seeking nothing but violence eventually becoming a monster equal to Kratos or the battle-hungry Aesir. While a controlled burst of wrath would fade quickly, overusing this ability will make you more aggressive and less caring of life. With a significant amount of time and great willpower you may one day gain full control over this rage?"
883,,400,God Slayer,God Of War (2018),Destruction ,"Divine and Immortal alike fear your wrath, for before you they are like any other mortal. It does not matter if they possess instant regeneration or can revive after death once you kill them they stay dead, unless you allow otherwise. Similarly those who possess divinity find themselves and have earned your ire find themselves weaker in your presence, and the longer they stay in your presence the weaker they find themselves. For example: Should you fight Thor he would go from being able to summon storms the size of countries like Norway to being able to only summon one the size of a large city. And should he actually try to fight you, his abilities would gradually weaken to the point he could barely summon an electric shock."
884,,400,Sei Dyam Prowess ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Destruction ,"An unfortunate fact of the world is that there will always be those with both magical acumen and the malice to curse people with it. Such curses can wreck a lot of havoc before a virtuous priest comes by to remove it. And now, you get to have knowledge and skill at this form of dark magic. Through spells and rituals, you can bring misery to any target you can see or have some form of connection to, such as a valued possession of theirs.

You can also curse locations and nations, in case you wish for a haunted mansion or to doom a kingdom. Pretty much any nasty way of causing misery is open to you, in forms both potent and lingering should you spend the effort to do so. Plagues of vermin, draining a target’s might or morale, regular nightmares, enthralling charms, perhaps even simple misfortune, you’ll be widely feared and possibly hunted if you leverage your abilities properly. Be careful of the virtuous, as no curse is unbeatable to good priests."
885,,400,A spear,The Song of the Nibelungs,Destruction ,"This is the spear Hagen used or will use to slay the hero Siegfried. It is long and especially sturdy. If wielded by you it will give you exceptional aim and nerves of steel. You could throw this spear farther and more accurate than most mortal men and in the most pressing of circumstances you will remain cool and calculating.

For an additional -200 cp this spear will become the fated weapon to slay anyone who breaks an oath or promise, which they made while holding the spear. You as the owner of the spear are exempt of course."
886,,400,Might of the Völsung,The Song of the Nibelungs,Destruction ,"You are, like Siegfried and his father Siegmund, a descendant of the great hero Völsung, who may have been a descendant of Odin himself (or him in disguise). His mighty blood runs through you and because of it you are strong enough to hammer an anvil into the ground with a single strike, rip out trees with your bare hands and toss them around and win a contest of strength against a valkyrie. You’re also faster than any man, capable of outrunning bears and tough enough to take serious punishment from incredibly strong foes such as giants, dragons, invisible dwarfs and valkyries, while also recovering incredibly quickly from dangerous blows that knock you off your feet and leave you coughing blood or even falling unconscious. Should you be mortally wounded, you still have enough might and rage in you that you can be guaranteed one last fatal blow of revenge, even though your heart is impaled on a spear. Your vitality is enhanced to a point that you can go for 4 days without neither food and drink nor sleep, while traveling and doing wonders and still fight a giant to the death at the end. You have little to fear from normal illness or disease and your tolerance for poisons and venoms is also highly increased."
887,,400,Lock On!,Asura’s Wrath,Destruction ,"You can harness personal or ambient mantra to create concussive blasts of energy from your hands or other appendages. These mantra blasts are self­-guiding.

Additionally, you gain an ability to aim and place your shots, which applies to any weapon or weapon system you wield. Mind you­ you are still limited by the nature of a weapon, so self-­guiding projectiles are naturally more potent than basic gunfire or the limited swinging rate of a sword.

Firing Mantra blasts Requires either a personal or ambient Mantral Level of 3."
888,,400,Magical Railgun,Witch on the Holy Night,Destruction ,"Rotational speed! Structural durability! Quality of output! Fuel efficiency! In the area of BIG BLUE BEAM SHOOTING based magecraft your magical shots are to most other mages what a railgun is to a handgun. In particular, somehow your magical system allows you to create rotating circles of mana that let you charge up and BLAST away the opposition with such tremendous potency and precision that in two years, you could surpass a seemingly perfect magus solely in the area of destruction. Your gift for SCREAMING BURNING HAVOK also applies to other magic or supernatural abilities you have, allowing you to dramatically amplify their firepower by rotating them with your mana and accelerating their firepower. Everything is a railgun. EVERYTHING IS A RAILGUN."
889,,400,Combat Applications,Library of Ruina,Destruction ,"Every Wing of the World must of course protect its interests. Even a simplecompany that has the ability to make a key to any lock may find itself using its I inventions to tear open arteries and make them unable to be closed ever again, while an energy company may find itself arming to the teeth to deal with the eldritch abominations that result from its singularity. The point is, no matter what the technology you may have the blueprints for, you can always find a way to make it into a weapon, at least as effective as it is at its intended purpose. Your device for hacking computers may find itself quickly remade to disrupt and destroy the nervous systems of your foes, or cause their devices to explode violently, even a simple lock may be reforged larger to crush your enemies within its mechanisms."
890,,400,Ascalon ,HighSchool DxD,Destruction ,"Dragons are mighty and titanic foes, and enemies that only the foolish or the desperate make. Still, it was only a matter of time before one sought to slay such a beast, whether in defense or wrath. In addition to its innate damage against Devils, it is an extremely effective weapon against Dragons or those who wield their power, slicing into their scales like a hot knife through butter. It can also release the aura around itself to attack foes from a distance, allowing one to close the gap or continue the fight."
891,,400,Poisonous Snake ,HighSchool DxD,Destruction ,"Ah, the Samael Curse, potent enough to kill any dragon or serpent. In the correct circumstances even the Dragon God Ophis could fall prey to it. Most of those hit by this would die immediately, and under lots of pain. I’ll grant you a few vials of the most concentrated, powerful, cursed poison of Samael. Use it right and no serpent, dragon, or being related to those will be capable of surviving. Fufufu, you would be surprised to know how many beings are linked to those, for example the Medusa, by her hair of serpents, would be weak to this, as it would be anyone that has her powers or similar."
892,,400,And Then There Were None,HighSchool DxD,Destruction ,"There are way too many powers in this world, many artifacts, effects, statuses, and more. Fuck them. Your stuff is better anyway. Whenever there’s a clash between two different powers or effects, this will ensure yours is the one that comes out on top. Of course, this is a lot more evident when it’s a clash between opposite effects, like the power to reflect attacks pitied against the power to bypass defenses. Although this is significant even in other cases. Of course, this bleeds out to the weapons and Sacred Gears you might possess."
893,,400,Gaze of the Gorgon,God of War,Destruction ,"Few can claim to have gazed into the eyes of a gorgon and lived to tell the tale, and for good reason. Like them, you can turn most who look into your eyes into unfeeling, immovable stone for a time. Those who are able to resist your petrifying gaze are instead paralyzed for a time, the effect wearing off quicker the more powerful your target is. You are in full control of this ability, and can choose what is affected and what isn’t."
894,,400,Wrath of Achilles,God of War,Destruction ,"Many heroes are subject to fatal flaws, character traits that either hinder them or actively lead to their downfall, and few have better examples than that of Achilles. Much like the fleet footed greek, you possess a potent rage, one that, when activated, greatly increases your physical capabilities for a time, allowing you to easily slay anyone unfortunate enough to be on your warpath."
895,,400,Demon Blood Sword,Adventure Time,Destruction ,"A magically sharp, hard and insanely durable sword made out of solidified demon blood."
896,,400,A Blade of Grass,Adventure Time,Destruction ,A technically cursed sword made out of a single magical blade of grass. Can switch between sword form and a grass bracelet around your forearm. Hard and demonically sharp. Regenerates.
897,,400,Party God’s Favour,Adventure Time,Destruction ,"You can, at will, awaken the power of a thousand partying demons within yourself. This will give you immense power to help in completing a specific objective, unfortunately you will become so overloaded with party energy that you will destroy everything in your path until it’s done."
898,,400,Round Killing Thing,Xena - Hercules,Destruction ,"You're an expert marksman/woman/misc and have an eye for angles. A brief look is all it takes to plot a course for a suitable projectile by ricocheting it off multiple surfaces accurately. If you wish, your shots will also lose far less kinetic energy as they travel or hit obstructions, allowing you to strike and penetrate multiple targets before succumbing to entropy."
899,,400,Dionysus’ Favor,Hades,Destruction ,"Dionysus will always show up to a party at the drop of a hat, but only the best of parties will earn his greatest blessing. Disappoint him too often and you may even earn his ire. Calling upon him will cause him to spread his drunken vapors in a wide area around you. These will be his most potent brew, inflicting drunkenness, an inability to defend themselves, and a debilitating drain on the life of anyone who inhales them.

Adding to the infirmities inflicted upon the foes you subject to Dionysus’ fumes is as simple as mixing in an additionalliquor.Now your foes caught imbibing willmove moderately slower while caught within the noxious cloud."
900,,400,Legendary Combatant ,Hades,Destruction ,"Hades has never been one to give credit where it isn’t due. If you found yourself in his employ, there is no doubt you are a warrior worthy of having their story told. However you stand above even those immortalized heroes. You would be the equal of Perseus, Jason, or even Hercules when it comes to your prowess on the battlefield. Enough that you could stand up against even the spawn of the Divinities themselves. At least, most of the time. You are dead after all."
901,,400,The Guardians of Humanity ,Fate/Strange Fake,Destruction ,"Heroic Spirits were never meant to be used as tools for magi in their petty pursuits of power. They are part of the planet and humanity’s defenses against great threats. As such, as an Heroic Spirit you find yourself gaining a great boost against those who prey on humanity, usually in the form of monsters and beasts. This may manifest in the ability to resist their powers, or get by some of their defenses more easily than what regular humans could, even if you still count as a human. It could even appear in just some great luck when facing these threats, almost if you were destined to be a great monster hunter.

Whatever it is, even when you face a great evil, there will always at least be a small chance for you to slay the monster, as it happens in most histories. It will be up to you to properly grab such a chance, and it may not be without sacrifices if the scale of the threat far surpasses your own."
902,,400,Comeback Champion,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Destruction ,"In battle, there are those that fear those that are stronger, and those that fear those that just keep coming. You, unfortunately for them, are both. Not only are you about twice as hard to kill as your peers, as you accumulate damage you find both your weapons and yourself getting more powerful. When you are on your last leg, those you face will soon be too."
903,,400,Magic to Burn,Final Fantasy I,Destruction ,"Black Magic is good at one, simple thing - inflicting damage. Whether it’s with fire, thunder, blizzards, or whatever other arcane power you can focus, you know how to leave a lasting impact on an unwary foe. Your magical damage isn’t any greater than it was before, but injuries you inflict with magic are slower to heal, and status ailments you push onto enemies are more difficult to resist. This might not mean too much against a hardy enough foe, but nothing quite says ‘you have made a grave mistake’ than permanent burns or an open wound that won’t close up before it’s too late for them, wouldn’t you say?"
904,,400,Impractical?,Final Fantasy I,Destruction ,"No such thing! So what if you’re wielding a weapon that is about five times the size of your entire body? You can swing it like a champ anyways, so it doesn’t matter! Your ability to carry and wield weapons of...questionable practicality lets you wield them as though you would a ‘normal’ weapon. Gigantic sword? Light as a feather! Dual- wielding rapid-fire crossbows? It won’t look so funny when the monsters have bolts sticking out of them, and you even reload in a timely fashion. Wielding an axe held in your teeth while holding two spears? It’s not as dumb as it looks. A live Moogle? Rude, but fine - it will be just as effective as a mace, and the little guy will even survive it! Swords chained together like nunchucks? Okay, now you’re just being silly. (Yes, it works too.)

The only downside is that you have to be able to at least -lift- the weapon normally to use it - if you can’t pick up a castle gate using your normal muscle power, even if you put your back into it in the first place, you’re not going to get to use it as a weapon."
905,,400,Glintstone Kris,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction ,"Ritual blade once presented to Leyndell by the Academy of Raya Lucaria to celebrate their newfound peace. Though the weapon is embedded with precious glintstones and features Erdtree ornamentation, the undulating blade is symbolic of an ancient ritual. Focusing a bit with the blade will allow you to cast Glintstone Dart at your enemies."
906,,400,Hoslow’s Petal Whip,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction ,"Metal whip formed of razor-sharp chain-link blades that have the appearance of flower petals. This work of art is handed down through the generations of the illustrious House Hoslow. High dexterity is required to wield this weapon, but it excels at inflicting devastating blood loss. ""The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."""
907,,400,Enchanted Knight,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction ,"The knights that serve the Carian royal family are infamous for their prowess with both martial and arcane might, allowing them to turn back the forces of the Golden Order before the union of Queen Rannala and Radagon. You have learned much from these prodigious warriors, and as such have become a master when it comes to utilizing might and magic on the field of battle, using both to make up for the inefficiencies that might arise should they be wielded by someone lesser than yourself."
908,,400,Jumper the Terrible,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Destruction ,"A Tyrant you are. Severity and brutality unmatched. Immortalized as the worst tyrant of the country even. Or at least you have the capacity to be. Your mere presence leaves lesser men shaking in their boots, like a heavy pressure is forced upon them. Determined individuals or particularly charismatic ones can resist this effect but those who don’t find themselves weakened in your presence, not as strong as they should be. And that is if they chose to fight at all and not merely surrender to you. Anyone that looks at you shall know fear."
909,,400,Sacred Blood and Steel ,Godbound,Destruction ,"The Godbound cut through men like chaff or subjugate them with a few words, and their mortal foes should count themselves lucky to even survive a murderous exchange against them. Yet hardened through vicious survival in these unforgiving times, you’ve learned to never go down without a fight. Whatever you are in this world, in battle you’re head and shoulders above others of your kind through some combination of skill, might and sheer fighting spirit. Mortal men could strike twice in the time it took another to strike once even while wearing full plate, and in the heat of battle rain blows upon others with awe-inspiring skill. Each of your strokes could send lesser men reeling without great skill of their own. If your attacks did not already they count as magical weapons, and are particularly effective against one form of adversaries like undead or Uncreated; if they already counted as such, they would strike even harder than before. Such prowess will only shine all the brighter for the likes of angels and Godbound."
910,,400,Home-Run Bat,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Destruction ,"You have found a black baseball bat. It has some yellow markings on it, drawing attention to its ‘sweet spot’.

This bat, when properly swung, will send anyone hit by it flying. This effect bypasses normal
durability entirely, though it will not cause physical damage to the victim if they wouldn’t be hurt by an ordinary baseball bat. It is also no more durable than an ordinary baseball bat, and could be destroyed except when it is connecting with a proper swing. So, whilst breaking it over your knee is easy enough, it is not going to break when you are using it for its intended purpose.

Should the bat be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse 24 hours later."
911,,400,Axe of Godrick,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction ,"Greataxe wielded by Godrick the Grafted. This golden battleaxe is emblazoned with the figure of a beast, representing the strength of Godfrey, First Elden Lord and patriarch of the golden lineage. Repeatedly smash the axe into the ground, unleashing earth-shaking shockwaves that can destabilize almost any foe. ""I command thee kneel! For I am the lord of all that is golden!"""
912,,400,Silura’s Tree,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction ,"This weapon is one of the two honored as foremost among the Crucible Knights. The primordial form of the Erdtree is close in nature to life itself, and this spear, modeled on its crucible, is imbued with ancient holy essence. By thrusting the weapon in a spiraling motion, it will be surrounded by a vortex of wind. Charged attacks have the power to blow away even the largest of enemies and can fire the tornado forwards."
913,,400,Dragonscale Blade ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction ,"A weapon made by sharpening a Gravel Stone scale, thought to be the source of ancient dragon immortality, into an unclouded blade. Alas, the Dragonkin Soldiers never attained immortality, and perished as decrepit, pale imitations of their skyborn kin. With a single swing, you can call down a bolt of ice lightning into the blade and bring it down upon a foe, inflicting them with short term paralysis."
914,,400,Doomsday Clock,Gummi Bears,Destruction ,"This gigantic clock is literally a doomsday device built by an ancient wizard, likely as a big eff you to the invading humans/aerials or to kill Gummi Bears. Thankfully it was never actually used and hundreds of years later it’s still fully functional.

Now you have this ancient weapon of mass destruction and blueprints to make more.

It’s never really explained how this thing destroys things, but it’s vaguely implied to be some sort of non-nuclear atomic bomb on the level of a fully powered Tsar Bomba made entirely out of clockwork. The good news is that it doesn’t have radioactive materials so it doesn’t poison the air/water/land.

The bad news is that because it is basically just clockwork it would be easy to make and proliferate."
915,,400,Dragon King Greataxe ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"This axe, one of the rare dragon weapons, is formed from the tail of a distant, deformed descendant of the Everlasting Dragons. Capable of cleaving through steel and stone with ease, when striking the ground with effort, it unleashes a wave of force, driving back all nearby enemies and staggering them, leaving them open to attack. This can optionally be fused to you, granting you the same ability in all of your limbs."
916,,400,Repeating Crossbow,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"This crossbow, customized for repeat-firing to face mobs alone, was used by a certain Slave Knight, warriors used as fodder for the bleakest of battles. Pulling on the trigger will see this weapon fire a number of dark-imbued bolts at the enemy, giving you a good option for constant, long-ranged damage. Curiously, the bolts it fires off never seems to run out, but that only means that you’ll spend less time vulnerable."
917,,400,Quelaag's Furysword,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"A curved sword born from the soul of Quelaag, daughter of the Witch of Izalith, who would be transformed into a chaos demon in a tragedy meant to stave off the Dark. Like her demonic form, the sword features shells, spikes, humanity and a coating of chaos fire. It deals a large amount of fire damage, as well as sending out a wave of demonic flames when swung."
918,,400,Dragonslayer Swordspear,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"A dragon hunting weapon that was owned by the firstborn son of Lord Gwyn, the god of war. It was the earliest form of cross spear, serving as both a sword and a spear, and imbued with divine lightning. It is the perfect weapon for penetrating the rocky hides of dragons, and can even summon golden lightning from the skies to attack an enemy."
919,,400,Darkmoon Bow,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"A golden shortbow used by the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity who would watch over the city of Anor Londo, which the gods would abandon after fire began to fade once more. With the replenishing quiver of Moonlight Arrows that comes with this weapon, it will hit much harder and shoot even farther than it has any right to, all thanks to the magic imbued within."
920,,400,Moonlight Greatsword ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"This sword, one of the rare dragon weapons, came from the tail of Seath the Scaleless, the pale white dragon who betrayed his own. It shines with an arcane light, dazzling many who gaze upon it. As it is imbued with Seath's own magic, it is capable of unleashing a devastating beam of arcane moonlight when swung, allowing you to hit far off enemies with ease."
921,,400,Moonlight Butterfly Horn,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"The horns of a moonlight butterfly, a being created by Seath, are imbued with a pure magic power, and are useful for a number of reasons. Not only can it act as a very effective spear, keeping your enemies at a distance while in melee, but it can fire off multiple magical projectiles that home in on a target of your choice."
922,,400,Life Hunt,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"A deadly ability, one taught to four kings and their subjects far into the future, meant to be used in order to assist them in bringing about an Age of Dark. The power of Life Hunt is one that the gods feared, as it was capable of rendering them weak and impotent. In your hands, you can use it to drain the vitality and stamina of a target with each strike you make, ensuring that you will always emerge the victor in a battle of attrition."
923,,400,Dragonslayer ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"It was the Lord of Sunlight that led the Lords and their subjects to overthrowing the Dragons, but it was his son who became so skilled at slaying them that he was named a god of war for his proficiency on those ancient battlefields. Like him, you are a dragon slayer with few to call you an equal, dealing more damage to draconic enemies than should otherwise be possible, all the while reducing their attacks against you to half effectiveness. No matter how many of your kin they may slay, they shall learn to fear the bite of your blades."
924,,400,Alhambra’s Ace,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Destruction ,"When you send an artificial vampire to fight the Darkness That Casts a Shadow on Darkness Itself, you better give them a fitting weapon. With this purchase, Tubalcain isn’t the only one with a deck of enchanted playing cards. Each individual card in this deck is razor-sharp, capable of piercing concrete and supernatural creatures alike. Once attuned to the deck, you may manipulate and control each card using telekinesis, attacking your foes with great force or interposing them between you and hostile blows. In addition, these cards have a few special abilities that can help a smallfry like Alhambra fight a heavyweight like Alucard. By throwing multiple cards at once, you can form mobile illusions (or “card clones for the cool kids) to serve as decoys or sacrificial lambs. Be warned that more complex illusions will require you to “spend” more cards, and you only have 52 to work with. Finally, these cards form a surprisingly effective counter to the regeneration possessed by most monsters. Wounds caused by these cards will not automatically heal, forcing your opponent to spend significantly more concentration, time, and energy to recover from your assault. Should your deck be completely expended or destroyed, you will receive a new one in a week’s time. Walk them into your ambush, then let them activate your trap card!"
925,,400,I’m A Vampire Hunter First,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Destruction ,"Oh, you’re an old hand at this. Like Walter and Ser Integra, you’re well acquainted with the eldritch horrors of the world and how to best dispatch them. You have a lifetime of experience fighting the strange and supernatural, as well as knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. You could turn your deadly arts against mortal foes; a human with this perk and the element of surprise could take down a room of soldiers by themselves. But your skills truly shine when facing down honest, inhuman monsters. Walter was just a man (albeit a very skilled one) and he still managed to hold his own against Alucard in single combat. This is no substitute for the supernatural abilities needed to take down the strongest of supernatural foes, but artificial vampires and even some lesser werekin will seem like unremarkable opponents to you."
926,,400,Sharpshooter,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Destruction ,"Some people don’t need magic to make their bullets connect. Some people are just damn-good shots. You are a bane to clay pigeons everywhere, with marksmanship to rival the best Hellsing has to offer. These skills scale with your inherent power level, so the average schmuck would find themselves on par with professional military snipers, while a trained professional could match shots with the catholic gunslinger Heinkel. Got the blood of a True Vampire? Well, you’ll be shooting a dozen V1 rockets out of the air from four kilometers away, so long as you have canons that can reach that far. You may not be doing anything unreal without other abilities, but even without vampire powers or giant guns, your sharpshooting borders on the supernatural. "
927,,400,Extra Long-Range Bombardment Firearm System for Localized Defensive Use ‘Harkonnen II’,Hellsing,Destruction ,"Coming in at three hundred and forty five kilograms gross, the Harkonnen II might just be one of the largest and deadliest personal weapons ever made. Not that anyone but a vampire could call it a personal weapon. Two 30mm auto-cannons, belt fed from massive ammunition boxes carried on ones back, the Harkonnen II can deliver utter devastation from up to four thousand meters. Combined with a vampire’s sight and it becomes effortless to shoot missiles from the sky, down aerial warships and rend vampire soldiers asunder with a single shot. If even that is not enough yet, the madwoman who choose to wield this can equip two ‘Vladimir’ incendiary grenades from atop the ammo boxes, delivering a pair of explosive shots to wipe clean vast swathes of a battlefield."
928,,400,Death’s Sickles ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Destruction ,"These are divine weapons of Death himself. They take the form of two sickles that can be combined into a single double-ended glaive. They allow him to harvest the souls of the damned, summon forth red flames, and slay anyone. As these blades contain the essence of death any being cut short by their edge will truly die. There will be no second chances, no resurrections, or tricks that allow them to escape. So make sure not to drop them or cut yourself on accident. In all seriousness though these are incredibly dangerous weapons and they will be returned to your warehouse if you are irresponsible enough to lose them."
929,,400,Strength to Victory,Disney’s Hercules,Destruction ,"It would be nice if you were always able to punch your way through monsters, wouldn’t it? Good thing you can now. Well, sort of. You have a strange ability, Jumper. Things that should be resistant or even immune to your abilities ... aren’t. You can cut the hide of the Nemean Lion, and you can kill a hydra through decapitation. This perk massively downgrades the immunities or resistances possessed by any beings you pit yourself against, to the extent that absolute immunities are broken down to very high resistances instead and resistances melt like butter to a hot knife. 

This doesn’t mean you can kill the aforementioned lion with a paper cut, though. It will still require a lot of work, but it can be done, and similarly while the Hydra does still regenerates, it does so far, far slower than it normally should."
930,,400,Wand of the Swamp Sage,Disney Villains Victorious,Destruction ,"An artifact of one of Doctor Facilier’s previous foes, this wand was a particular issue for his friends to deal with as it appears to be instilled with an inner light - and calling it a wand is being generous, since in practice it’s more useful as a club. Whacking creatures and people empowered by darkness with this is liable to lose their powers from it, and if they’re made from mostly evil and darkness? It’s going to hurt like nothing else, and weak ones are going to get banished to where they came from in one hit. Don’t mess with this wand."
931,,400,Grant ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"A legendary weapon of the Way of White, granted to an Undead paladin long ago. This mass of iron can usually only be lifted by those with inhuman strength, but it is blessed, and very effective against agents of the Dark. When it is struck upon the ground, it unleashes a corona of holy light that is especially deadly to the undead and those affiliated with the Dark."
932,,400,Dragonslayer Spear,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"The cross spear used by Ornstein, a Dragonslayer guarding Anor Londo cathedral. Two-handed thrusts rely on the cross and buries deep within a dragon's hide, and sends human foes flying. It is imbued with divine lightning, both coating the blade and capable of firing off at a distance, and is especially effective when used against dragons."
933,,400,Obsidian Greatsword,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"This greatsword, one of the rare dragon weapons, is formed by the tail of the one-eyed black dragon Kalameet, the last of the ancient dragons. The mystical power of its obsidian blade will be released when held with both hands, unleashing a corona of cursed energy that strikes at any nearby enemies."
934,,400,Gravelord Sword,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"This sword is wielded only by servants of Gravelord Nito, the First of the Dead, and was crafted from the bones of the fallen. It is imbued with a fraction of the Lord’s power, coating it in a toxic miasma of decay and death that lingers and harms all living things that are struck by it."
935,,400,Dark Hand ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"The Darkwraiths, incited by Kaathe, use the power of the dark soul to absorb humanity, an art shared by this weapon, which also acts as a special shield. The ancients, particularly, could sap the humanity of even a replete saint in the blink of an eye. Simply strike someone or hold onto them, and you will be able to steal both the humanity and the vitality of others, restoring your own."
936,,400,Quelaag's Furysword,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"A curved sword born from the soul of Quelaag, daughter of the Witch of Izalith, who was transformed into a chaos demon. Like Quelaag's body, the sword features shells, spikes, humanity and a coating of chaos fire. It deals a large amount of fire damage, as well as sending out a wave of demonic flames when swung."
937,,400,Sunlight Blade        ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"A miracle once wielded by the firstborn son of Lord Gwyn, the nameless god of war, none are as gifted in its use as you are. At will, you may coat your weapons in holy lightning, greatly extending its reach as well as increasing its attack power. Such golden lightning is especially effective against dragons and their ilk, stripping away their stone scales to strike the flesh underneath."
938,,400,Gravelord Greatsword Dance,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"Though they are rare, there are instances of miracles dedicated to the Gravelord. This is one such example, though bound to you in a manner that few could ever truly understand. With but a thought, you may cause massive red and black blades to erupt from the earth, impaling any who cannot move out of the way in time. Wounds left by these blades are extremely difficult to heal, even for the greatest of miracles. "
939,,400,Chaotic Storm,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"When the Witch of Izalith used her Lord Soul of Life to create the Flame of Chaos, it ruined her ancient home and covered it in burning lava. Within you is the same potential for devastation, conjuring up spouts of fire and lava from the earth below with but a thought. Remember, though, to always fear the flame, lest you be devoured by it, and lose yourself."
940,,400,Peter Wisdom,Marvel Britain,Destruction ,"Hot Knives, the ability to generate semi-solid energy projections as hot as the surface of the sun. You can shoot these projections out from your body like bullets, attach them to your hands to use as claws in close combat, and use them to form shields that can burn up incoming projectiles. While able to be projected anywhere around your body they are more easily projected around your hands. They can also be used to create thermals beneath you and slow your descent. With focus you can create Hot Knives that last longer, and you can also minimize the power in your projections to stun instead of kill. These projections are extraordinarily strong and sharp, cauterizing what they cut, they are capable of easily slicing through Skrull tech, Martian tech from parallel realities, and superhumanly durable opponents like Mindless Ones."
941,,400,Amygdalan Arm,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction ,"The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive. The wounds it leaves are imbued with arcane energies that eat at their lifeforce."
942,,400,Beast Claw,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction ,"Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy, it was crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
943,,400,Chikage ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction ,"Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. Unlike standard versions of the Chikage, you do not need to sacrifice your own essence to coat the blade in blood."
944,,400,Blood of the Great Ones,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction ,"Flowing through your veins is the most holy of mediums, the fresh blood of a Great One, pure and uncorrupted. This has changed you, all for the better. All of your physical capabilities are greatly enhanced, from speed to strength to even your senses. You are also capable of harming Great Ones like few others, capable of striking an enemy on multiple planes of existence or different dimensions, even while utilizing mundane weapons or your bare hands. This will also act as a Capstone Booster, making a number of your abilities even more powerful. You are a Hunter, and no prey is truly beyond you."
945,,400,Hitler’s Handgun,Marvel Magic,Destruction ,"Hitler was notorious for his obsession with the occult and apparently not all of what he managed to find was false magic. This Walther P-38 was one item that Hitler attempted to imbue with mystic properties -- and is also the weapon which he used to take his own life. It seems that some combination of the occult rituals and its role in a suicide has imbued the gun with actual magical properties. Bullets fired from this gun are totally mundane except for the fact that they bypass most magical defenses, ignoring wards and magical shields as though they weren’t there at all.

If you wish, you instead may import another handgun that you possess to gain these qualities."
946,,400,Dragonfang,Marvel Magic,Destruction ,"​Legends say that this straight sword sword forged by an ancient oriental wizard named Kahji-da when he carved it from the tusk of a powerful extra-dimensional dragon. Whether or not this is true is irrelevant, as the power of the blade is clear for all to see. The weapon is indestructible and supernaturally sharp, capable of cleaving most mundane matter in twain with easy. But the sword’s true strength lies not in its ability to cut the mundane, but in the damage it can inflict upon the supernatural. The blade’s edge can easily cut through all but the most powerful of enchantments and disrupt most spells with a glancing blow. This is a powerful and valuable weapon; make good use of it, won’t you? You may also import any swords you possess to gain these qualities."
947,,400,Fist of Iron,Marvel Magic,Destruction ,"Great power rests within the body of all living beings, if only they know how to draw on it, to focus it. Those who do are few and far between, but you count yourself upon their number. Be it through an encounter with some great being or force or simply through years of arduous training and meditation, you can focus the chi energy in your body for incredible feats. Being able to manipulate this life energy can allow for a large number of feats. The most basic of these abilities is simply heightening your physical and mental abilities, making you capable of feats of strength, speed, and durability beyond your natural peak. You can also focus your chi to heal yourself or others and to heighten your senses to supernatural levels or even to meld your consciousness with that of another being you are in contact with, peering into their mind. Your most formidable ability, however, is your ability to focus all of your chi into your fist, allowing from incredibly powerful strikes. Properly focuses, one punch can shatter building or destroy speeding trains while leaving you unharmed. However, this is heavily draining -- at first it may leave you completely exhausted to simply do so once, though this will improve with time and training."
948,,400,Indomitable Blade Master,Dial,Destruction ,"With the power of SCP-076-2, the formidable warrior known as ""Abel"", you embody the pinnacle of combat prowess and skill. Your mastery of the blade surpasses legendary warriors and even deities who have spent millennia honing their combat abilities. Whether it be swords, axes, spears, or any bladed weapon imaginable, you wield them with unparalleled proficiency and precision.
 
Through your connection to a special pocket dimension, you can summon any bladed weapon instantaneously, allowing you to adapt to any combat situation and wield the perfect weapon for the task at hand. Your arsenal is limitless, granting you an array of deadly tools to unleash upon your foes.

In addition to your unparalleled combat skill, you possess the ability to resurrect yourself upon death from within your coffin. This ability grants you a second chance at life, ensuring that defeat is never permanent. However, this power is limited to one revival per jump or once every ten years, whichever is shorter. This restriction ensures a balanced use of your resurrection ability while still granting you the advantage of immortality."
949,,400,The Ten Rings,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Destruction ,"Ancient beyond human recollection, these ten glowing bands possess power capable of destroying even the greater gods. The enhanced strength and immortality they bestow on a wearer that has bonded with them is the least of their gifts. The rings can fire energy blasts, hurtle through the air in precise formation at the user’s will or form platforms to propel them about. How much might they offer depends on how many rings a given user has wrested control of; even one can deflect bullets and slay a man, while all ten together can destroy a soul-eating, city-levelling dragon in a single blast. A truly experienced user can use them to match the strikes of even an Allfather in his prime-perhaps a sign that their full potential has yet to be shown."
950,,400,Touched by Darkness,X-23,Destruction ,"Laura Kinney was bestowed a Hell-Mark which marks her as a candidate for becoming a Hell-Lord. The bearers of said marks were granted numerous powers, but at the cost of being tied to hell itself. Instead of being tied to hell you have the innate ability to conjure and control magical Hellfire. This includes an immunity to heat and cold."
951,,400,Touched by Light,X-23,Destruction ,"When Laura Kinney played host to the Enigma Force she defeated the Whirldemon King with the power of light, which marked her as the Enigma Force’s future heir. The Enigma Force only works in its native universe, so instead you have the two abilities of the Enigma Force that were most beneficial to Laura Kinney. You can hurt any supernatural, demonic, divine, or mortal creature when you attack. Your body is also adapted to no longer need to breathe, you are immune to the vacuum of space, radiation, and the crushing pressure of celestial bodies."
952,,400,Stormbreaker,Marvel Cosmic,Destruction ,"Stormbreaker is an enchanted axe made from Uru. It was crafted by the Dwarves for Beta Ray Bill after his fight with Thor. You have an exact duplicate of the great weapon. It possesses many similar abilities to Mjolnir. It always returns to you when thrown, can only be lifted by you or those you deem worthy, can project energy blasts and even amplify your own energy capabilities."
953,,400,Voice of the King,Marvel Cosmic,Destruction ,"Whether or not you gained this ability through the Terrigen Mists you now share the mighty powers of King Blackagar Boltagon, supreme ruler of the Inhumans. Your voice naturally harnesses electrons and ambient particles through the speech center of your brain. Somehow this gives you the ability to fly and use your voice to manipulate energy and matter but none of that is what you are truly famous for. Your voice possesses immense destructive capabilities. A whisper from you could shatter a man’s bones, a normal speaking voice could raze cities, and a truly loud shout could break continents. Unlike the true Black Bolt, you can toggle this on and off if you would like to carry on a normal conversation without destroying everything around you."
954,,400,Dynamokinesis,Marvel Cosmic,Destruction ,"While the source of your ability is not required to be the X-Gene, you possess the same powers of one Gabriel Summers, or Emperor Vulcan as he prefers. You have the abilities to absorb and manipulate any form of energy at an Omega mutant level. Enough energy can overload you but the amount required to do that is utterly immense. You can use the absorbed energy to redirect into blasts, create solid energy constructs, and you can also convert it to any other type of energy you are familiar with. Since your power has its root in psionic abilities you can use your powers to temporarily suppress other people’s connections to their own so long as their powers are mental in nature. You can siphon energy not just from your surroundings or inanimate objects but also from other people and superhumans. Your current maximum of energy absorption easily makes you a planetary threat."
955,,400,Satan Claw,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Destruction ,"You have a copy of Baron Strucker’s Satan Claw, (though, in your case the claw is a glove rather than a cybernetic enhancement), a powerful weapon capable of draining a creature’s lifespan in a matter of seconds to restore the user’s youth."
956,,400,Iron Fist,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Destruction ,"By focusing your Chi, you can cause your fist to glow with energy capable of shearing through steel. The more powerful your Chi, the greater the effect; as you hone your skill and mind, your Chi will grow ever more powerful, though with diminishing returns. With time you can learn to substitute other types of energy (psionic, magic, electricity, etc.) to augment your strikes."
957,,400,Kinetic Charging,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Destruction ,"You can fill a small object (being able to be held in your hand is a good benchmark to use) with kinetic potential, causing it to glow with energy. The heavier the object, the longer it takes to charge, but the bigger the explosion. (A playing card explodes with the approximate force of a grenade.) Experience will allow you to charge objects faster, and will increase the size of objects you can affect slightly."
958,,400,Fire Specialization - Lightningbending ,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Destruction ,"You are one of a very few set of firebenders able to separate positive and negative energy within your body, using this imbalance to create lightning. A dangerous and difficult art, it requires an absence of emotion and peace of mind; any deviation can prove fatal. However, its power is unrivaled, making those able to utilize it extremely feared. You have also mastered the art of lightning redirection, guiding electricity through your body before expelling it harmlessly.

Requires Bending Arts(Firebending) to Purchase"
959,,400,Shard of Curtana Second,A Certain Magical Index,Destruction ,"This grants wielders from the British Royal Family the power to turn it into the best weapon to defend the wielder in a fight. Though you’re probably not one of them, you can now wield it just as well. It’s most commonly seen creating a lightsaber-like sword that can extend up to a mile away (only in the UK), but may have different applications depending on the user. Though it can only be used in the United Kingdom normally, you can now wield it outside (hey, you paid CP), though it will be weakened. Drastically. Don’t expect a blade any longer than 2 metres. Still, it’s more than enough to kill most enemies, and holds tremendous power even when weakened. Armour is paper to this."
960,,400,Savage Strength,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction ,"“Anger is power- unleash it!” The mercenaries gathered here have their tricks, powers, and steel to wield in battle; but few have command of their own raw brutality and as you do. The strength in your limbs in matched only by the ferocity in your heart as you charge into the enemy like a beast possessed, ripping and tearing through their lines. It would not be an exaggeration to say that you could cut a man in half with the right weapon. Such is the fire running through your veins that taking a moment to focus your rage would not only increase your precision, but also result in minor wounds, cuts, and even poisons disappearing; melting away in the depths of your wild rage. At this point, a scream from your throat could bring paralyzing terror even to the eldritch. The only downside is that entering such rages tends to tire the body, though this can be mitigated with time spent outside of battle. "
961,,400,Wind Prison,Ragna Crimson,Destruction ,"Mastery over the wind is the ability that you will gain through this magic. At its most basic level, the user can control the winds to make themselves or others fly, as well as communicate with the winds, whether they are wind spirits or wind elementals, to gain information of their surroundings, allowing them to be prepared for attacks that come even from several kilometers away. Not only that, the wind may also inform you of the emotions of others, and even their surface thoughts.

But that’s not the end of its use. For the wind is a mighty tool of destruction if your hand. Creating air blades that can cleave through armored men and even buildings is easy, as well as creating large tornadoes around oneself to both destroy large areas and shield oneself from most attacks. A powerful brethren would be able to create several of these at the same time if they were using their full power."
962,,400,Lord Dominik's Regards ,League of Legends ,Destruction ,"This crimson crossbow brings new meaning to the phrase ""The bigger you are, the harder you fall."" Bolts fired from this crossbow have a unique property of harming those physically larger than the wielder- If the difference is only a foot or so, the effect is negligible, but as the target gets larger and larger, this crossbow lives up to its other name of Giant Slayer, summoning forth huge gouts of blood and tearing through entire limbs with each shot."
963,,400,Infinity Edge,League of Legends ,Destruction ,"In the Shuriman desert, fables tell of a mystical pool of shimmering water. Any blade dipped in this pool will become sharper and strike truer than any other sword. The Infinity Edge was already a runic blade of the highest quality before its transformation, and now it is the deadliest sword in the world. Any who bear this massive blade will find that it can cut through all but the densest material, often cleaving men cleanly in two, and some swear that it has a mind of its own, steering its wielder to strike at vital organs."
964,,400,Guinsoo's Rageblade,League of Legends ,Destruction ,"This jagged blade is imbued with the fury of a legendary berserker. When you wield this sword, striking an opponent will imbue you with enhanced strength, speed, and magical might. Successive blows will further increase your speed and power until you unleash Guinsoo's Rage after eight strikes, giving you a spectral copy of yourself that imitates your attacks, applying your weapon's magical effects twice over."
965,,400,Duskblade of Draktharr ,League of Legends ,Destruction ,"One of the deadliest blades in the history of Noxus, this deadly weapon does not show its true colors until it is too late. While the Duskblade is a very sharp sword on its own, it possesses a lethal enchantment - when it cuts a foe, a six-pointed mark will appear on the skin of the victim around the cut. This mark will pulse painfully for three seconds and then explode in a shower of blood, blowing apart the flesh of the victim and dealing horrific damage. Once the blade leaves a mark, however, it cannot leave another one for another three hours."
966,,400,Auto Attacks,League of Legends ,Destruction ,"Projectile weaponry behaves a bit oddly when you use it. Whenever you're within a certain range of your enemy (usually around a maximum of ten meters, depending on the actual range of your weapon), projectiles will always hit their target when fired at an enemy. Always. So long as the target was in this range when you fired your projectile, it will curve midair or go impossible distances to follow them, even if they teleport past walls or lead your bullet through a maze."
967,,400,The Touch of Hellas,A Throne of Glass,Destruction ,"You have now gained the power of the greatest Demi-Fae male to have ever existed. You have power over the magic of Will and Death, empowered by the God of violent death Hellas. Your magic appears almost like wind, able to make breezes, tornadoes and great gusts, however beyond solely the wind Hellas’ touch has made your magic deadly. It instinctively makes you deadlier in combat, unconsciously guiding you towards opponents’ weak points, capitalising on their mistakes. This magic can also be condensed into hard constructs, shields, blades, whatever you would like, regardless of what you use it for it functions well. However, when used in combat, every attack you make with this magic does more damage than it should, blades cutting deeper, attacks breaking shields that should have just barely blocked them. This magic is lethal, not of shadow or darkness, but death itself and bears a tinge of that concept with it. With this you have enough magic to fight armies to a standstill, and while you do have less absolute skill with magic than the greatest Fae male in existence, the true lethality of your magic marks you two as equals."
968,,400,Shadowfire ,A Throne of Glass,Destruction ,"You have gained access to a twisted and dark sort of magic, caused by a powerful fire magic bloodline being corrupted by Valg shadow and darkness. What this means is you get access to a large well of magic that gives you the ability to destroy about a third of a large castle in a blast that would also require you to burn out completely. It would take all of your magic, and would reduce you to a pile of ash. The magic you have is called Shadowfire, darkness in the form of fire that causes immense pain on contact but does not spread like normal fire. Shadowfire does not create heat but is as destructive as potent fire, and is able to burn everything, from wood to rock to metal. This ability is one that while not of the greatest magnitude in this world, is extraordinarily deadly to those who might face it, even capable of consuming and destroying beings of darkness like the Valg."
969,,400,Earthstorm,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction ,"You can calling down power that was thought to be lost to this world. You can unleash the Earthstorm by expending a vast amount of mana, creating a series of elemental blasts that utilize the Exceeded versions of their terrain’s ruling element."
970,,400,Empty Mind Stance,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction ,"You are able to take on a stance during which any strike you make, especially ambushed strikes or critical attacks, has a decent chance of inflicting the Instant Death, Despair, and Knocked Out status effects. This stance drains your health while you are within it."
971,,400,Psychic Battalion,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction ,"Your mastery of psychic martial arts allows you to control your weapons with the power of your mind, and even allows you to summon forth additional weapons from the Rift made of pure Psychic energy."
972,,400,Two Graves,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction ,"It is not an exaggeration to say you would drag you opponents down to hell personally if you could. This is the next best thing. You are capable of splashing your blood onto a single opponent, attempting to inflict a vicious and specific Doom curse. If successful, any damage inflicted to you will be dealt back to them in full…and vice versa, though that is something you accept when it comes to your vengeance."
973,,400,Blow Me Away,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction ,"The devils of this world are powerful enemies, and you need every advantage you get against them. You wouldn’t be a professional if you didn’t know how to do so…so of course you’re first in class when it comes to fighting entirely magical beings. You know a number of rituals and enchantments that can be done to disrupt and damage magical beings. The more “made of magic” the enemy, the further damaging and debilitating these spells are - while a wizard may lose focus on their spells and feel further pain to their mind, a full elemental monster will start feeling its body fail on it, slowed and dazed."
974,,400,Here Comes the Arm,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction ,"The nature of the Old Gods make them vastly more powerful than any given hero, even with Mastery of a Job. However, the secrets of Serannia have given you and your allies a method of fighting them on even ground. You are capable of issuing a Challenge to a divine creature, binding them into a fight to the death in which both you and that creature are on even ground - as if that creature had all of its skills and abilities, but lost any of the divine power that amplifies it into being untouchable by mortal hands. However, many Gods are still warriors and mages with centuries of experience…"
975,,400,Photonic Weaponry,Super Dragon Sword,Destruction ,"You are capable of now manifesting weaponry out of Photonic Energy, a form of raw essence that deals Kinetic damage, a damage type that is especially potent against non-magical defenses. It takes seconds for you to do this, so switching weapons mid-combat is possible!"
976,,400,Beware the Alien ,Ben 10,Destruction ,"Do not taint your mind with such heretical knowledge, Jumper! You don’t need to understand an opponent to defeat them, simply close your mind and attack! When you battle against unnatural foes, like sorcerers or aliens from outer space, you find you are simply naturally at battling them using the purity of mundane human weaponry like guns or blades. Even better, the less you understand about your foe, the better you are at inflicting damage on them, your weapons cutting deeper and your bullets striking vitals just a bit more often. Ignore their demonic language and strike true!"
977,,400,Morning Hope/Evening Despair,King Arthur ,Destruction ,"From the brightest mornings to the darkest nights you shine to the people under your command. With a strong will, and the skill to inspire anyone who cares to listen to your words you are a leader to be feared by those who oppose you. Above all however is the unique ability you possess. You can, through force of will make any weapon you touch emit a blinding light or an obscure darkness capable of obliterating your enemies. Though exhausting at first with use the force of will required to use this ability will lessen. Eventually you might destroy castles with a single blow or even cut down a mountain."
978,,400,Arsenal,Dresden Files,Destruction ,"An entirely mundane one, before you get excited. But an arsenal all the same. A small army’s worth of the very best in guns, bombs, tactical gear and all the rest needed to either take down or protect a major city in the US, provided you can find the soldiers to use them. The weird fact however is that everything here is weirdly, excessively effective on Supernatural beings, even on things that it should have a lot of trouble with. How the flamethrowers in here are able to do serious damage to Winter Fae is unknown, but the damage is done anyway. Seriously, a direct hit from one of these rocket launchers could take down a giant."
979,,400,"""Chaos Seed""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction ,"The Chaos Flame, born of a terrible accident, was the progenitor of all demonic life. This flame, long thought extinguished and dead, still burns within your chest. Through purchasing this perk, you have an ember of the Chaos Flame inside of you. You have the ability to harness this power much like other demons with a bit of fire left in them, spewing red hot fire and lava from your mouth. If purchased with ""Pyromancy"", the Chaos Flame Ember fuses with your Pyromancy Flame, greatly empowering it and granting you the skill and knowledge to perform Chaos Pyromancies, as well as granting an affinity for them. Chaos Pyromancies are the strongest of all Pyromancies, usually accompanied by lava in addition to the already raging fire. Just like a normal Pyromancy Flame, you can eventually gift fragments of it to others once it has been cultivated enough."
980,,400,"""Sable Assassin""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction ,"It's readily apparently that the Sable Church has a unique relationship with blades. The fact can be seen whether you look at their deadly assassins reviled the world over, or the three lone founders, sisters highly skilled in fencing. Upon purchase, this perk makes you highly skilled with all manner of blades. The more abhorrent or fear inducing the blade, the better you tend to be with it. Additionally, you have the power to spread your curse to your weapons, turning them into Hollow variants. ""Hollow Weapons"" will appear somewhat corroded and worn compared to normal. They're empowered by an elusive, essential property of humans, luck. That is the say, the luckier you are, the more powerful a Hollow Weapon will be in your hands. Additionally, if you also purchased ""Twisted Reality"" then you may impart an odd ""vacuum"" property on your weapon, causing it to violently pull at the flesh and blood of your enemy as your blade digs in. You can also choose to temporarily transfer this property from your weapon to an enemy's wound as you make it, causing it to pull whatever is nearby (filth, poison, debris, etc) inside for a fleeting moment before the effect fades."
981,,400,Grudge,Dark Souls 2,Destruction ,"“Giants are comparable to elephants. Both are large, gray, and powerful. Both also have very long, detailed memories and a capacity to hold vicious grudges that can last nearly forever. Drangleic, which took something precious from the giants, learned this first hand. When you, like the other giants, are moved by your anger, you will feel it deep within your bones. Embrace it, the anger will move your limbs faster, force your unrelenting body to produce just that extra bit of power you didn’t have before. This all is to say that when enraged, you will become stronger and faster. You may also hold that anger, keep it, and maintain it for however long you want. If you wish to keep that grudge going forever, you may, but beware, lest you lead yourself to destruction.”"
982,,400,Toxic Spittle,Dark Souls 2,Destruction ,"“What pray tell is feared by man, giant and monster alike? What liquid death and misery flows through the vein to deliver agony and a long sleep? It’s venom, of course. Your body produces an oozing toxin at your command, created by the polluted burrow you were born and raised within, or otherwise made into your new home. Fangs, claws or any other natural weapon you may have may drip with the virulent poisons nativeto your body at a whim, taking to the bodies of those wounded and killing them from the inside out. Why, if you wished it so, you may even have it drip from a blade in hand.”"
983,,400,Yashariku’s Sugar ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Destruction ,"A crimson red candy that reminds you of blood from its color to its faint metallic taste. After taking this candy, you will be more prone to injury, but your strength will increase dramatically, up to five times. You receive a box of this candy in packs of six every day."
984,,400,Way of Wrath ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Destruction ,"Your combat style is ferocious. There’s no discipline or technique. The way you treat your weapon is no different from one who would treat a stick or a blunt weapon. This is for good reason, especially if you have no experience with true swordsmanship in the first place. Your instincts have been greatly supplemented through your experience. Most of what you do is unconscious and even if you make mistakes, you find that you unconsciously fixed it for the next time. Even during the heat of battle, your opponents who had the upper hand will slowly find that you’re getting better and better at overcoming them."
985,,400,Divine Lightning ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Destruction ,"You gain the ability to summon the storm’s wrath. Much like the dragon that inhabits the sakura tree, summoning this power fills the sky with clouds that bend to your whim with lightning ravaging the area like raindrops. In addition, your lightning is that of divine quality, much stronger than what would appear naturally. You can summon enough electric energy to power an entire city for a day with effort."
986,,400,Way of Tomoe ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Destruction ,"You have discovered the secret to the power of lightning itself. Should you find yourself in situations where lighting or electricity are involved, you’ll know exactly how to catch it through your blade and release it as an attack. So long as you are not touching the ground, the lightning will flow harmlessly through you. Not even a lightning strike from a god could deter you so long as you exercise this technique."
987,,400,Scarlet Blossom ,Elden Ring,Destruction ,"You have been cursed-no, blessed, though perhaps in ways you abhor. Though not necessarily to the extent of an Empyrean with this alone, a great deal of the Scarlet Rot has taken root in you, and whether by chance or dark design has left your body unravaged while imbuing you with it’s terrible power. You are well-versed and gifted in the various incantations of the Rot: Releasing poison mists, imbuing weapons with its foul taint and scattering sticky threads to slow your enemies among others. Your most devastating incantation is the Scarlet Aeonia: Blooming a gigantic flower around you suffused with the Rot. With it, you may spread its aberrant principle of death begetting life to other worlds and accelerate the development of its power where it has taken root in others. In time, you may be able to find other, more ritualised uses for the principles of rot. Perhaps with enough Rot and experimentation, you may even be able to taint or spawn others like it in the image of Malenia herself. But as you are now, you have inherited one of Malenia’s most potent advantages: The power to seamlessly and near-instantly mend your wounds by shedding the blood of your foes, letting an agile fighter prevail against terrible odds by inflicting death with a thousand cuts-and clawing back from the brink of death with every blow."
988,,400,Bane of Champions ,Elden Ring,Destruction ,"The Night’s Cavalry symbolise death to many would-be champions, and as one of their foremost champions you more than live up to that reputation. You have all the skills and powers associated with such warriors-a fearsome repertoire of Ashes of War and Incantations covering everything from recreating a beloved instructor’s attacks to infusing a blade with poison, or the dreaded Bloodhound’s Step that lets one evade and move faster than sight briefly. Above all though, fortune and presentation favours you when you battle heroes, usurpers and otherwise exceptional individuals of all sorts. Whether driven by their own ambitions or ideals opposing the status quo, they have a tendency to leave themselves wide open in battle with you-or to quell before your cold resolve to kill. It’s no guarantee of certain victory, but when the Tarnished witness you bearing down on them they’ll have to steel themselves lest they be crushed under your ornery wrath."
989,,400,Fiendfyre Master,Harry Potter,Destruction ,"You know the incantation for fiendfyre and you’re the only person alive who truly controls it. For you the giant flaming creatures seem to have a real intelligence, are unusually obedient and (strangest of all) the fire dies down at your command."
990,,400,Favor of Hazoret,MtG - Amonkhet,Destruction ,"Not everyone is meant for combat. Even among those who are, very few are like you. Not only can you endure danger and battle, you enjoy them on a deep, primal level, almost as though you have received a blessing from Hazoret the Fervent. In combat, particularly combat with meaningful stakes and significant danger, particularly against a worthy opponent( herein defined as an enemy who fights on a level you respect in a manner you approve of), you feel a thrill like fire in your heart, like your blood has begun to sing. In battle, you feel truly and completely alive. It will be particularly enjoyable if it is for a cause you truly believe in. This primal enjoyment will make you brave, keep you focused, and insulate you from battle-related trauma and resulting disorders, as well as help you psychologically handle killing, fighting, gore, and losing loved ones in battle without issue. Unlike others, your battlelust will never overwhelm nor distract you. Even in the thick of it, in the throes of this fervor, you remain yourself and you remain sane and cautious - if you were any of those to begin with."
991,,400,Ferocity Of The Wilds,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction ,"Power. Devastation. The ruination of all that loves peace and tranquility - the Wilds at its core tears down and builds anew...but first it must destroy. You have an odd strength - while you of course have superhuman strength as part of this, the true source of your might is simply that it is amplified against ‘orderly’, that is to say that your physical strength seems to become much grander when aimed at tearing down settlements, structures, and thwarting authority - the more entrenched, the harsher your blows sting."
992,,400,Reaper Of Night,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction ,"The darkness of the swamps and bogs of the Wilds holds one of the most feared forms of that which lurks beyond - the Specter. They’re thought to be one of the various creatures Witches form pacts with, and you have the nature of a Specter with you...capable of interacting with shades of the slain, spiritual entities born of a strong emotional tie to the world of the living. You are capable of also absorbing their spiritual energy as mana, or in turn even absorbing the same from the living with your shriek - though it’s a slower process and one that can be blocked by covering your ears."
993,,400,Giant Killer,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"They say that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. That’s quite a bit more literal for you - you’ve learned how to leverage the might of larger, stronger creatures against them...how to make them lose their footing, or even evade their wide strikes simply by being right under their nose...size against you is the farthest thing from an asset, becoming something you can use to further defeat them.

Boosted: Giant Killer - > Resolute Rider
It is no longer just the tall and mighty that fail to shake you - you are able to withstand the twisting, corrupting nature of the Wilds with the light of your soul, and in fact by summoning forth great righteousness you can create a wreath of power that actively causes further damage to mystical beings. In addition, you are capable of using the light of your soul to create a shield against the claws and spell of those very same beings.

994,,400,Knight of Garenbrig,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"Garenbrig. The Court of Strength. Knights of Garenbrig are those that have proven to Yorvo, king of giants, that they have trained their body with overwhelming might compared to their size and build - accomplishing feats such as ordinary humans performing acrobatic wrestling feats with a bear, or for a human to smash stone with their bare hands. You are one of the athletes capable of superhuman feats of strength, capable of getting into brawls with giants and trolls and coming out on top!"
995,,400,Knight of Embereth,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"Embereth. The Court of Courage. Knights of Embereth are those who have overcome the taunts, threats, and the heat of the Irencrag - a mystical stone embedded with the swords of all those who tried and failed to strike it with valor in their hearts. By striking the stone and having the courage to retrieve it from the treasure of the Burning Yard, a Knight of Embereth has the capability of calling upon their courage of sizzling flame, more destructive than the Silverflame and seemingly fueled by both the fear its wielder has as well as the fear of those it’s used against it."
996,,400,Knight of Ardenvale,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction,"Ardenvale. The Court of Loyalty. Ardenvale’s knights are those who have proven their selflessness and altruism, their loyalty to not only their kingdom but the people within it and their fellow knights. The Circle of Loyalty judges their heart, and if it finds them worthy, grants them the power of Silverflame. As a Knight of Ardenvale, you are capable of wreathing your weapons and your hands in holy fire - a flame that can bolster as well as heal the innocent, yet burns like the purest sunlight and vicious fire against wicked and evil beings. "
997,,400,Faith Is Its Own Reward,MtG - Zendikar,Destruction,"While the gods do not see fit to reward us, that doesn’t mean the faithful go unaided for their sacrifice. After all, with a little black mana you can easily siphon a little power from the sacrifices our gods demand, healing and fortifying the faithful as they offer tribute to the gods. And with the exertion of a mote of white mana per target and some small sacrifice of your own life force you may banish nonbelievers from your sight forcing people to flee and banishing summons back to the aether or wherever they came from. Stronger entities may resist banishment."
998,,400,"It’s Hard To Find Their Weak Points, But I Very Much Enjoy The Process",MtG - Zendikar,Destruction,"When the opposition is seemingly as undefeatable as the Eldrazi, many will often fall into despair - not so with you. The more powerful an opponent is, the more you will find yourself noticing little details that might indicate even the tiniest chink in their armour. An arrow a few inches deeper; a slight change in movements; these you would normally overlook, but now become clear as day while you zero in on that tiniest bit of weakness."
999,,400,SPECTACLE ,MtG - Ravnica,Destruction,"As a Rakdos mage, you need to be able to relish in the pain of others. When an opponent or a foe is in pain, your spells become significantly easier to cast. Not only that but they sometimes come with a few... extra little effects to make things much more enjoyable! Did that demon you’d summon always have those little spikes all over its body? Who cares, as long as it causes a bit more carnage as it goes"
1000,,400,HAUNT ,MtG - Ravnica,Destruction,"It’s annoying, isn’t it, when you get killed. One of the most annoying things about dying is knowing that the person who did it got away scot-free. This perks ensures that whenever you or a companion gets killed, the person who did you in will be cursed to suffer the same fate soon after. This triggers on reanimation as well as regular permanent deaths."
1001,,400,Perfection through Sacrifice,MtG - New Phyrexia,Destruction,"The flesh is weak. Your insight into the worlds of the living and machinery have revealed that much to you- the designs of whatever creator gods of the universe may exist are flawed, imperfect- and by damaging these designs in you- by sacrificing your own lifeforce, whether it be through drawing your own blood, tearing a chunk of your own flesh, or simply offering your own raw lifeforce, you may substitute the cost of supernatural abilities you have with it, empowering them with the ability to slowly Infect those hit by them- corrupting their mind so they may embrace perfection. This is a slow process, and might be downright impossible for the strongest-willed of enemies – But you’ll never let that get in the way of your Great Work, will you?"
1002,,400,Blades of Calamity,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Destruction,"The spells that Samurai use to enhance themselves in battle, that Ninja use to bind themselves ever further to the shadows, that Monks wrap around themselves as both a weapon of war and a means of meditation, these spells are as varied as those who wield them. And a way to weaponize them for yourself has been found. Given to you is a set of six blood red blades that ignite with fire whenever they are drawn. Due to the unique nature of their construction, these blades are able to absorb the faint traces and leftover mana from both your magics and that of others. In effect, whenever you begin to power one of your spells, the blades will begin to form an echo of that spell within them, one that can then be cast from the blades themselves. The spells of others are possible, though much more difficult. Each blade can only hold so much power or so complicated a spell, but they can be used in unison to copy more powerful techniques. Additionally, they may only be used once per day, lest the blades themselves become damaged beyond the point of usability. "
1003,,400,Purple Camellia Blooms ,MtG - Kamigawa,Destruction,"A spell weapon created and used by Kiku, a ruthless magical assassin. This comes in the form of either a tattoo or an actual Camellia flower which replicates itself when you use it. Whilst you are immune to it’s effects anything organic that the roots touch will find themselves the bed for those roots. This can only affect organic things but seemingly ignores all natural toughness and even some armor isn't enough to keep the roots from digging into a body and killing the person over time as it uses them as a seedbed to produce more lethal camellia blooms. With proper treatments, which are lain out in a series of scrolls you get with the original Purple Camellia Bloom, you can even grant the immunity to their roots to others."
1004,,400,Berserking Warrior ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Destruction,"Emotion is the lifeblood of a warrior, passion to pursue victory, rage to strengthen your blows, pride to match your skill. Emotion drives you as well, as the emotion you feel sharpens your abilities and is clear for all to see. A pyromancer in a fit of passion might find their hair encased in flames, and a warrior in the depths of rage will see their muscles bulge. One could find their abilities double when passionate about a cause or even tripled if one’s emotion is so great that they hate someone with the strength of a thousand suns. Just keep in mind that emotion must be met with action, if you find yourself in despair or terror with no idea of what you should do, then this will grant you no benefit, no matter how great the emotion."
1005,,400,Puppets and Tools ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Destruction,"However, there is something special about the personal touch. Perhaps instead of stealing the works of others you can gain power by stealing the lives of others. You are a master of death, but you are not a healer. No instead you are a master of using life and death for your own gain.

Whether it involves creating plagues, modifying individuals to be monstrous subservient slaves, raising undead minions, draining the life of another to fuel your own, or even torturing individuals to have them suffer ever more terrible nightmares to call into this world. You generate better results the more you make others suffer, making the effort to be evil worth it. Though others might disagree."
1006,,400,Master Swordsman,Warbreaker,Destruction,"You, like half the Five Scholars, are a much better swordsman than Vasher. And considering he’s an immortal with centuries of practical experience, this is saying quite a lot. It is laughably improbable that you will find an equal among mortals or people without some kind of supernatural advantage."
1007,,400,Magic-Sucker,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"This sword, as its name implies, can temporarily take away the magic of others. Originally created in a dimension where Mevolent won the war, this was used in his battle against Darquesse and later destroyed. However, you seem to have in your hands the exact same magical item, able to steal away even the magic of someone who has discovered their True Name. Obviously, it is useless against those who have no magic. If destroyed, you’ll have a new one arriving in your Warehouse after a week. Be careful, as breaking the weapon results in an explosion."
1008,,400,Red Right Hand ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"Do you want to make people suffer, Jumper? Your right hand is now red and skinless. By pointing it at someone, you can cause them to suffer overwhelmingly agonizing pain. Or, if you’re feeling merciful, you can just kill those you point it at, though this ability is much more taxing than merely causing pain. However, this ability only works on the living; undeads, robots, and other non-living beings won’t be affected in the slightest. Furthermore, it can only target one person at a time. Post-Jump, you may have your hand return to a normal appearance, or toggle it to its skinless form as you see fit. If taken with the Skulduggery Pleasant perk, the bones of your right hand turn red.

Boosted: Devil’s Touch: Your very nature has energized your red right hand, increasing the already agonizing pain that you could previously cause, but that is a parlor trick compared to what you are now capable of. Now, nothing is beyond your hand. Even if it is already dead or nonliving, you can now bring it death.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
1009,,400,Dark Metal Vessel ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"Normally, Metal Vessels are powered by white Rukh, which has the side effect of making them unusable by those who have had their souls dyed black by falling into depravity. Realising this problem, the ever-resourceful Magicians of Al-Thamen set about making their own versions of these powerful artefacts that run on black Rukh instead. While they weren’t entirely successful, their Dark Metal Vessels have some benefits over their regular counterparts. Though very few were ever made, it seems that you have managed to get your hands on one.

Like regular Metal Vessels, Dark Metal Vessels can, as their name implies, take on the form of any metal object, from swords to jewellery. Likewise, each has a unique power, though these tend to lean towards being more sinister in nature, such as producing a noxious fog that immobilises even those that are supernaturally strong who are caught in it, creating a number of doppelgangers from your shadow, or using magnetism to manipulate dust with enough finesse that you could create powerful puppets of dust indistinguishable from a person. Similarly, you can also perform a Dark Djinn Equip, though these usually take on a more monstrous appearance than regular Djinn Equips, and wield Extreme Magic.

However, being mere imitations, Dark Metal Vessels are much weaker than their originators, to the point that a skilled Household Vessel user could defeat you even with a Dark Djinn Equip. Likewise, the Extreme Magic of these vessels doesn’t come closer to the power needed to destroy a city and could even be deflected by sufficiently powerful Magicians. There is one way, though, in which this imitation exceeds the original.

See, since the Djinn are inherently beings of white Rukh, Dark Metal Vessels don’t actually contain one themselves, but instead allow their user to become an artificial Dark Djinn made of black Rukh. In this form, your physical and magical abilities are greatly enhanced to the point that even a talented Metal Vessel user would have difficulty fending you off. What’s more, you will continuously heal and be able to sustain this form so long as there’s a supply of black Rukh. There is, however, a catch – first, this form eats up much more Magoi than a Djinn Equip, and so it’s difficult to maintain for long if there’s no black Rukh around. Secondly, and perhaps more pressingly, becoming a Dark Djinn requires that you sacrifice your life. Though maybe that’s not so bad if you have some way to cheat death?

Since you’ve chosen to buy this option with CP, you will receive a unique Dark Metal Vessel which can also be powered by white Rukh, just in case you haven’t fallen into depravity."
1010,,400,Metal Vessel ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"Metal Vessels are artefacts of supreme power, each of which grants their user enough power to destroy a country overnight. The source of a Metal Vessel’s power is the Djinn that resides within, a being of incredible magical might that bestows the use of its abilities upon the wielder. Though the only way to attain one would usually be to conquer a Dungeon, this one-time offer will give you a chance to not only receive one without risking your life, but also design the Metal Vessel’s form, along with the Djinn inhabiting it and thus its powers, yourself. Alternatively, you may choose to take a canon Djinn instead of designing your own.

The form your Metal Vessel takes can be almost anything so long as, as its name implies, it is made primarily of metal. It can be anything from a weapon, such as a sword or spear, to an accessory or piece of jewellery like a ring, necklace, or hairpin. Hell, if you possessed a cybernetic limb you could even use that. The only similarity between the Metal Vessels’ appearances is the symbol of a Djinn, an eight-pointed star surrounded by a circle that glows when the item’s powers are used.

At its base level, a Metal Vessel allows its user to wield powerful magic based on its Djinn’s nature. These can range from elemental manipulation, such as controlling and producing fire and lightning, to more unusual effects, such as creating and controlling plant life, manipulating the mind and senses of living beings, or producing shield of force that reflect attacks back at their source.

This, however, is only the weakest use of a Metal Vessel. By focusing the Metal Vessel’s power unto themselves, the user can perform a Djinn Equip, becoming one with their Djinn. While your appearance does change when under the effects of a Djinn Equip, becoming a hybrid of the Djinn’s form and your own, that is the least of its effects. Not only do you become able to fly, but your strength, speed, durability, and magical power are all far enhanced, enough that you could single-handedly wipe out an army without breaking a sweat.

While using the Djinn Equip, you also gain access to the Djinn’s Extreme Magic – an attack which, while incredibly exhausting, possesses unmatched power, being capable of obliterating a city in a single shot. This Extreme Magic is based off the Metal Vessel’s base magical power. For example, a Vessel which wielded lightning would allow you to call down a bolt from the heavens capable of cleaving straight through several mountains, while a gravity-controlling Vessel could create a massive zone of intense gravity, instantly pulverising anything caught within.

The name, appearance, and personality of the Djinn inhabiting your Vessel can also be customised. Each Djinn shares a name with one of the seventy-two demons of the Ars Goetia, and have wildly differing forms – Some appear almost completely human in appearance, maybe possessing horns, scales, or feathered wings, while others are more unusual, ranging from enormous humanoid wolves to overweight, impish children. Naturally, your chosen Djinn’s form will affect your Djinn Equip’s appearance.

Oh, a few more points worth addressing. A Djinn, and thus the Metal Vessel it inhabits, is bound to a particular user, and so nobody else will be able to use your Metal Vessels. Additionally, unlike regular Metal Vessels, those bought using this option are completely indestructible. Finally, all of the powers the Metal Vessel grants you require your Magoi to power them, so if your energy reserves run dry, you’ll be unable to use it.

You may purchase this option multiple times. However, as you can only use one Djinn Equip at a time, additional Metal Vessels primarily provide increased versatility instead of heightened power, though you are capable of rapidly switching between Djinn Equips. Whether you obtain them through this purchase or conquer them in a Dungeon yourself, you can have a maximum of seven Metal Vessels.

1011,,400,Knightly Swordsman,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"Sure, an improvised fighting style might be all you need to take on your average bandit or thug, but the it’s undeniable that the greatest of fighters have all mastered some kind of martial art. Unfortunately, most have little chance to learn one, however, as many of these martial arts are exclusively taught to the nobility, but then again, you’re not most people. You have a choice of one of two different weapon-based martial arts: The royal Crawling Sword style of Heliohapt or the Spear Arts of Knights of Sasan. 

Heliohapt’s Crawling Sword style is, as its name suggests, a sword-based martial art that focuses on deftly dodging and parrying your foes blows while striking at even the slightest opening with lethal efficiency. The Spear Arts taught to the Knights of Sasan, on the other hand, uses lance-like spears for rapid barrages of quick, precise thrusts to overwhelm your foes. Whichever martial art you choose, you become well-trained in its use, equivalent in skill to one of the Eight Generals of Sindria, to the point that even a child could take down a small group of thugs.

If you really wish, you may alternatively choose to take a markedly less refined route and become a supremely talented unarmed martial artist. You’re good enough to take on a physically more powerful foe, such as an Imuchakk or younger Fanalis, and win through your skills alone. Though this won’t be quite as powerful as the weapon-based martial arts above, there’s something to be said about being able to fight effectively even when disarmed or caught without a weapon.

You may purchase this perk multiple times, taking a different martial art each time."
1012,,400,Fake Arm,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Destruction,"How interesting. This black cube seems to have a limited shapeshifting capacity. It's covered your arm in this black goop. Actually, if you happen to be missing an arm, it's flat out replaced it. On top of that, it seems to have an unusual power. Let’s call it... Soul Eater. And it does just what it sounds like - with it, you can eat souls. Actually, it's a bit more. Absorb blood like a vampire to heal, eat souls to repair and strengthen your own, even memories can be consumed in a mockery of a mind wipe. Just keep in mind, this can only be used while it's equipped. That and it's intensely exhausting to use."
1013,,400,Paladin,Campione,Destruction,"The exact rank of paladin hasn’t been reached by anyone in a good while, people like Ena Seishuuin or Erica Blandelli are close, but not quite there. Saint Raffaello being perhaps the last one. It not only requires the leadership, tactical mind, magical prowess and excellent swordsmanship required for Great Knights, but also needs to go a step beyond that. Paladins are those with the power to go toe to toe with a Heretic God or Campione, even if a win isn’t really sure. That was until you came along, you now hold the title of Paladin within the magical community, as well as everything that entails. If this is enough for you to actually win against a Heretic God or Campione is up to the air, but this ensures you will be a good fight at the very least."
1014,,400,Demolition Man,Campione,Destruction,"You’ll have to forgive others for the title, given you could very well be mistaken for an avatar of destruction with how much ruin lies in your wake. The bright smile you have on your face the more damage you dish out doesn’t help either. Seemingly predestined to destroy all you touch; your actions and powers have a talent for causing more damage than reasonably possible with every step. While this doesn’t help in direct combat, the surroundings come apart with frightening ease such that even a simple exchange between equals could leave a noticeable scar on a city or an all-out brawl demoting it to village status. Of course, you can reign over the amount of collateral damage in any fight you partake on, from none to destroying the roman colosseum in a friendly spar."
1015,,400,Trial By Combat,Fate/Extra CCC,Destruction,"The Moon Cell has a surprisingly gamified environment, what with having countless minor beasts that provide ‘exp’ when killed, which can be used to grow in power. With this, you’re able to retain this benefit anywhere. Conclusively defeating opponents, whether killing them or beating them up to the point they can’t fight any longer, will provide you with ‘exp’, which will slowly strengthen you along the same lines of the Servant parameters; Strength, Endurance, Agility, Mana (magical power essentially), and Luck. They’ll be increased proportionally to how much you use them, so a Servant who fights in melee without using any magic will find that their strength and endurance are the most strengthened while those who fight primarily with magic will find greater growth in agility and mana. Luck is a bit of an odd duck but it will sit at a sort of middle ground compared to the rest of the stats, in terms of growth.

Of course, it should be worth noting that this growth is slower the more npowerful you are, and that it slows down to a crawl when you reach the power of high ranking Servants, and stops completely when you are several times stronger than such Servants. ‘Level 99’, in a manner of speaking. Unfortunately this only applies to you, those who fight alongside you won’t benefit from this ‘exp’ system the Moon Cell devised. It would take a few months of constant combat with roughly equal opponents for a bottom tier Servant to reach the level of a high rank Servant, so at least it’s not too time consuming, relatively speaking, but if you’re trying to reach ‘Level 99’, then it’s going to take you a long time, not to mention that’s assuming you always have access to enemies as strong as you are to maintain the challenge. Still, such growth is quite an incredible advantage either way. How will you utilize your future strength?

1016,,400,Revolving Victory,Fate/Extra CCC,Destruction ,"Excalibur is one of the most famous legendary swords in the modern age, if not the most famous one. However, there is another sword related to Excalibur, which ended up being overshadowed quite thoroughly. Utilizing a strange artificial sun within its hilt, the Sword of Revolving Victory could be said to represent the rays of heat from the sun that hit the Earth. Aside from being a very sharp blade, able to cut through steel as easily as flesh, it can utilize its pseudo-sun to produce vast swathes of potent flame, serving as a very powerful anti-army weapon, and certainly a powerful trump card in battles between high rank Servants. Its flames also count as true sunlight for whatever mystical purposesyou might wish to perform, although there’s no Servant in the Moon Cell with a particular weakness to the sun, so it’ll likely be of little utility. Expect quite the surprise from a certain knight should you brandish this sword openly."
1017,,400,Sadistic Constitution,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"Few can deny that you are a skilled and powerful warrior, everyone saw how you’ve wrestled giant
beasts to death and ably compete with some of the best warriors in Rome with your favoured
weapon, be it swords or spears or bows. But that’s not why people feel fear in their hearts when
they think of you on the battlefield. You have the ability to enter a monstrous rage that massively
increases your physical strength and speed, which will only continues to increases as you remain in
the rage, but causes your physical durability and reason to significantly degrade at the start, though
you retain all your fighting skill. When in this rage, you’ll continue to hunt down any enemies you
consider near and are near immune to mental interference from others, though not entirely so to
very powerful magicians. The rage can be ended with great effort, but given that you can refrain
from hurting allies and will only hunt enemies, one questions why you’d want to. It’d be so much
easier to give yourself to the endless red fury and allow all your enemies to be slaughtered, from
invading barbarians to those annoying politicians that bother you back at home. "
1018,,400,Bow of the Hydra,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"Favoured weapon of the greatest hero of Greece, the Bow of the Hydra is the same weapon that
Heracles would use to slay some of his greatest foes. The bow itself is not particularly special, as
beyond being usable as a nearly indestructible club if need be and somewhat enhancing the power
of shots fired by it, it lacks magical traits. The quiver the bow comes with is very different, holding an
endless supply of both exceptionally tough and sharp arrows as well as arrows coated in the Hydra’s
poison, a substance capable of quickly and painfully killing almost any being. Only an immortal being
could avoid death, should the poison enter their blood, but it will still deliver unending agony unless
they could use powerful magic to remove the poison. "
1019,,400,Tauropolos,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"A very large and sturdy bow, taller than some men, but with powerful enchantments placed on it by
Artemis herself. This jet black bow has a replenishing quiver of similarly dark arrows, each one
capable of piercing all but the most powerful magical defences, and the bow itself grants immense destructive power to any shot fired through it. It requires no more strength than a normal bow to
pull back but even an ordinary man could blast a fortress into many pieces with a fully drawn shot. The bow is also able to call down a rain of light attacks, by expending some magical energy and firing
two shots at once towards the sky. This results in a rain of arrows of light, each able to easily pierce
thick enchanted metal armour, over a controlled range of attack. Many thousands of light arrows are
released and entire battlefields can be lightly sprayed or the arrows can all be focused on a single
point to deal incredible damage."
1020,,400,Fifth Heavenly Hunter,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"The greatest of all demon hunters are the ones with demon blood in their own veins. Even the
famous Minamoto no Yorimitsu and her four heavenly kings bear that taint. Through a personal
journey or being part of such a legendary group, you’ve become worthy of standing at the peak of all
hunters in this land. Your physical abilities may not match the most terrible of demons outright, though splitting a castle with an axe is well within your reach, but your combat abilities extend much
further. You are broadly skilled with many weapons and martial arts, enough to reach an expert level
in most, and are particularly talented at fighting those more powerful than yourself. Whereas a
master swordsman may outmatch you with their wits, you are able to fight in a way to negate the
advantages of demons tens of times your strength or speed. Knowledge of holy rituals and a lifetime
of slaughtering mysterious beasts has made you highly resistant to magic and able to deal much
more damage to beings of great mystery than normal.

Your demon blood heritage is fully turned to your benefit, making it much easier for you to deceive
and trick demons and Oni. Fooling them into treating you as an honoured guest, even when you are
a famous hunter of their kind, isn’t an impossible task. Lastly, as with the many demon hunter clans
to arise in later times, you are able to pass down your techniques and unique abilities to the rest of
your family. Your descendants are able to much more easily learn what you have learned, as well as
being able to unlock special powers that would normally have a very low rate of inheritance. Unlike
some clans, they also share any self control you have over your Oni nature, preventing them from
falling to madness."
1021,,400,Human Meal Preparation,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"A cruel power, capable of instant death with the right aim, inherited from one of the greatest of all
Japanese monsters. The deboning art lets the user remove bones from within the body of another
creature, without spilling any blood. Your hands pass through their skin, meat and organs as if they
did not exist, tearing out bones like removing the pieces of a puzzle. The smallest piece removed can
cause the whole body to collapse in agony or death. While bones are the most elegant choice in the
mind of the original creator of this technique, it can be used to remove the internals of any living
thing with enough focus on the desired kind of target, perhaps even remade to work on non-living
objects as well. It is a special ability, rather than pure magic, and thus lets your grasping hands
bypass magical resistances and armor that might normally block it, though wards to stop contact
might help your poor targets."
1022,,400,Golden Axe,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"A great golden axe, large and heavy enough that one requires superhuman strength to lift the tool at
all. At the top of the axe handle is a reverse pistol grip, a trigger linked to what makes the axe special. A powerful magical weapon already, the axe has fifteen cartridges built into it that store powerful
blasts of lightning. Even one cartridge being triggered unleashes a powerful blast of lightning that
can leave a small city block in ruins. All fifteen at once might split a small mountain into two with the
valley carved by the thunderbolt. These cartridges slowly replenish over time, drawing on the
electricity in the air, but can automatically absorb any lightning attack when empty to protect you
and charge faster. It’ll take some practice to get used to the trigger, though you can optionally
change it’s place on the axe if desired. 

Golden Axe is also able to take on a second form, that of a modern Japanese motorcycle, albeit a
massive one done up in the style of a young gangster. According to one golden man, the bike has
two million horsepower and can travel at over Mach 2. True or not, the wheels are able to rapidly
build up a thunder charge like the cartridges, becoming stronger and more charged with each
revolution. Racing towards a foe turns your bike into a mighty spear of lightning that can tear
through even powerful youkai, if they fail to dodge the extremely visible attack. At least the thunder
from the Axe doesn’t harm you. "
1023,,400,Caladbolg,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Destruction ,"An exceptional sword is rare in the land of spears but hardly unheard of. Particularly when it comes
to the blade now resting in your hands. Caladbolg, legendary sword of Fergus MacRoich and the
prototype weapon for many of the most famous blades in history, such as both Caliburn and
Excalibur. This drill shaped sword meets little resistance even against powerful magical armour or
spells and when it’s true power is released by it’s wielder, it can unleash enormous blasts of light
that can wipe out entire armies. Caladbolg however, excels at the destruction of the landscape and
when used to destroy the environment, it can even render a mountain to slag or shatter whole
islands, much more than it normally can do."
1024,,400,Bridal Chest,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Destruction ,"An enormous war hammer, the head in the shape of a strange bronze ball. While a near unbreakable
weapon and light in your hands despite the stone crushing weight it swings with, these are all minor
physical traits. The true value is the core held within the hammer head, which has the ability to use
the Galvanism trait, in a very similar way to the Living Lightning perk. The hammer can absorb any
wasted magical energy or electric energy from you as well as anything within a short range around
the hammer in your surroundings, acting as a potent defence against magic. The hammer can
unleash massive blasts of lightning, taking the form of tree branch extensions, both in close range
and at a longer distance when targeted. Just picking up ordinary mana and electricty from the air, the hammer is able to unleash bolts that tear humans, cars or houses apart. A large amount of
energy could wipe out a small force of magical golems in an instant.

If used in tandem with the Living Lightning perk, or similar abilities, the two sides work together to
create a much more powerful Galvanism expression. The limits on absorption are largely removed, excess energy in the body immediately discharged through the hammer with great force, allowing
the user to easily defend against even vast amounts of magic. Bridal Chest also grants easier
regulation of energy, greatly improving how much can be used to heal or reinforce your body before
you endanger it.

Bridal Chest is also able to transform into a secondary mode, taking the form of a equally large
sword. In this state, not only can the electricity be used to hone the swords’ edge or cause it to
vibrate at high speeds, the sword can be reversed so that the energy is channeled into a massive
projection of electricity. This energy blade takes a vast amount of fuel but is easily the most
destructive attack the weapon possesses."
1025,,400,Murderous Brawler,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Destruction ,"Surrounded by a dozen ships of the line, hundreds of pirates pouring onto your flagship, your crew dying in droves around you? You’ve never felt the blood pump harder in your ears nor moved with such lethal speed. They think they’re going to easily win but they don’t yet realise that the worse off you are, the deadlier you become. Already, you’ve been made one of the most dangerous men or women on the seven seas with a blade or gun or both. Firing through a captain’s eye from half a mile away in the middle of a ship battle as a hurricane rages above? You barely had to aim. Ten expert duelists surrounding you from all angles, as you wield naught but a short sword? They’ll be mewling on the ground, clutching fatal wounds in less than a minute!

The chaos of battle only benefits you, hardly hindering your awareness of your surroundings and revealing to you all the ways to take advantage. Makeshift weapons leap out to your sight, the crush of crowded bodies limiting only your opponents agility and errant fire from surrounding battles is easy to misdirect into your enemy. Most potent of all, you find yourself moving with greater power, speed and skill the worse the battle is going for your side. The greater you are disavantaged, the more damaging your own returning fire. Both you and the ship you command find this benefit, allowing you to tear your way through overwhelming odds and escape, or even manage to win battles that by all rights you should have died miserably in. A cornered pirate is no different than a cornered rat, they’re just at their nastiest and most violent point. "
1026,,400,Maria the Rippers,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Destruction ,"A set of four curved red knives, each the embodiment of the murders that the legend of Jack the
Ripper carried out on the London streets. The knives on their own are deadly weapons, cutting flesh
and steel with equal ease, but when the user fulfills certain conditions, the weapons become more
potent. These conditions are that it must be night-time, that it must be misty or foggy and that the
target must be female. The preferences of the Ripper. Each condition filled significantly increases the
cutting power of the knives and if all three are met, a curse can be activated on any valid target you see. This curse causes the four knives to manifest inside the target’s body, vivisecting them as
desired from within regardless of their physical durability, the grudge filled knives slicing through
any defence. Resistance against curses can prevent this however but you can continually use the
technique as long as the conditions are met, requiring only small amounts of energy to perform. "
1027,,400,Stella,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Destruction ,"Few men are born to wield the bow and arrow as you, to the point of favour from the Gods and
Goddesses of war. Just seeing your skill is a sublime show to please even their jaded minds. Even in
the company of heroes and monsters of these ancient ages, rare is that which can dodge an arrow
loosed by you. The art of bowmanship is more than just the physical act as well, as you are capable
of several magical feats in this regard. With any loose physical matter, you can instantly transmute
that matter into the shape of an effective and usable bow and/or arrows. Magical energy can also be
used in place of arrows, stunningly effective at this even, as small amounts of energy form into boulder shattering attacks. There is no upper limit on how many arrows you can fire at once from a
single bow, so long as you can either hold them all or supply enough magical energy. The Great
Arash could fire ten thousand arrows of magic at once, blotting out both the sky and the lives of
entire armies in a single attack.

Magical arrows are the path towards the final technique offered by this perk. By burning into the
very core of your being, you can unleash a final technique with a loud cry. An arrow capable of vastly
more than your ordinary ability might allow for, this is the same shot that Arash used to carve a
twenty five hundred kilometer long trail between would-be kingdoms. A vaporising laser-like shot
that would annihilate whole fortresses, terrible beasts and burn through even a Dragon’s hide for
the length of it’s shot. While Arash was scattered to the winds by this feat, you are able to just barely
survive performing this attack once every ten years, though the act will still leave you unconscious."
1028,,400,The Ark of the Covenant,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Destruction ,"A beautifully decorated wooden box, atop which sit a pair of winged figures. This is the Ark in which
Moses laid the stones on which he carved the Ten Commandments he received from God. Somehow, regardless of your affiliations, you have come to be considered the rightful caretaker of this Ark. The
box is heavy and unwieldy, far from something useful in combat. But touching the box without your
permission or being considered worthy of the being that first exalted the Ark remains a way to end
almost any fight. Any who trespass and touch the box will instantly be drained of all supernatural
forms of energy within them, destroying spirits in a moment and leaving most others drained and
powerless for their blasphemy. The energy is stored within the Ark, building up without limit, and
should the Ark be opened, the stored energy will be unleashed on all those surrounding that are
unworthy, even you should you not measure up to the standards of the divine being that created
this effect."
1029,,400,Battlefield Terror,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Destruction ,"Enough about love and beauty. A paladin may be a stunning star of the court but he is also a great
warrior in the king’s service. No longer are you merely an expert or proficient on the battlefield, now
you are a master seen once a century. Your sword strokes are often compared to an artform by
those lucky enough to survive seeing them and many men whisper that you must have magical
powers to command the horse to move in the supernatural ways you can, spurring them to move
faster than the eye can see with a nudge. Your body is through natural means able to contend with a
Saint that relies on holy power and should you find yourself in a formal duel against one opponent, your skills and abilities greatly heighten in threat level. But no hero can win forever and thus your
final defence is one of spite towards any that try and take from you. Any enemy of yours that is able
to steal a personal ability or item from you directly will find that not only do they gain little to no use
out of it, it will often backfire on them catastrophically. Whether it be your legendary sword
breaking in their hands or even turning against them, your stolen magic tearing them apart from
within or just your horse preferring death to ever obeying your foes."
1030,,400,Guns of a Patriot,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Destruction ,"In a land filled with magical blades, spells and horrific beasts from hell, can a gun really be of use?
The gun just needs to get bigger. And there needs to be lots of them. Really, there’s not much you
can’t do with enough cannon. Just look at Napoleon. You’ve got a hefty arsenal of hundreds of
cannons and firearms from the earlier ages of the technology stored at a safe location. It’s best kept
there, since you can summon and mentally command any firearm or gun kept with the rest of this
arsenal you have at will and empower the gun to greater effect by channeling magical energy into it, regardless of how the weapon normally works. Just summon a new pistol to your hand every time
you run out of ammunition or bring a massive golden cannon to the battlefield and charge it up with
mana to knock a hole through an entire castle at once!"
1031,,400,Long Sought Execution,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Destruction ,"Humanity’s thoughts and feelings are what shape the course of history. Is it so strange that feelings
as strong as your own could warp the world? Not when they’re such dark emotions. When pursuing
goals motivated by hate, vengeance, rage and other negative feelings, you can find that these goals
become unnaturally easy to achieve the stronger those feelings get. The fabric of reality twists in
ways to make normally difficult things easy and near impossible things achievable, at least if you are
deep enough in your fury. The impossible cannot be made possible but enemies that would normally
dodge your attacks may find you moving faster than should be possible for your body or that your
strikes tear deeply into their normally too-tough flesh."
1032,,400,Wisconsin Death Trip,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Destruction ,"It’s loud, it’s noisy, it’s positively furious. It’s the most offensive chainsaw ever made and there are
so many ways to apply that. Bright pink and screaming, the Death Trip is a chainsaw with some
impressive qualities, beyond the fact that it can chew through magically enhanced steel or diamond
like it was a thin twig. The chainsaw is especially effective against magical targets and while it can’t
cut through everything, it’d take a very powerful magus or spirit to resist it fully. What it does cut
won’t heal for a long time either, the brutally jagged wounds left by the saw blades take much
longer to heal even with supernatural aid. The chainsaw’s always useful as well, since it’ll grow in
size to match you regardless of how BIG you become, is summoned to your hand with a thought and
never runs empty on fuel. It’ll barely weight anything to you as well. As you get angrier, the saws will
spin faster too, so with enough rage in you, you might even find the wind around the blade is
dangerous just by itself!"
1033,,400,Knight’s Armoury,Angel Notes,Destruction ,"The legendary Knight Arms, weapons of the Ether Liners, are made by externalising the Grain within
the bodies of each Ether Liner and forming it into a solid weapon in the outside world. While you no
doubt have your own Knight Arm, given you are a knight, now you’ve become able to use a similar
process on other internal energies. Any supernatural energy or material that is produced from within
you can now be externalised into a unique Knight Arm based on that energy. The stronger the base
you choose to work with, the stronger the resulting Knight Arm will be. You can make a single such
Knight Arm for each distinct supernatural energy or material produced from within your being."
1034,,400,Knight of Owner,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction,"As a manifestation of incredible fighting feats and achievements, a true warrior’s power has
appeared in your hands. The representation of a knight and fighter without compare, this special
ability immediately affects anything you come into contact with and perceive primarily as a weapon
of some kind. It spreads an aura through and around the weapon, in two colours of your choice, and
even as a base effect it will let you achieve an instant and natural mastery of the use of that weapon,
like it was a favoured weapon that you’d wielded for many years on the battlefield. Beyond that skill,
it also enchants anything affected to be a fairly powerful magical tool. While they’re far from an
Excalibur, the enchantments are still quite useful, allowing the weapons to possess unnatural
durability or fire magical blasts of significant power. Even a gun might find each bullet now
possessing enough power to meaningfully harm some supernatural foes. Knight of Owner has no size limitation on what it can affect, so long as you see it and everything
within that might be affected as a weapon first. Even a jet fighter or battleship can be affected, with
your weaponising aura allowing you to control affected vehicles by thought alone. Lastly, the power
will also override control over things that would normally have special requirements for you to use, such as a Noble Phantasm that only the wielder can use via magical rules, a gun that is DNA-locked
to specific people or just a car that you need a key for."
1035,,400,Sword Wizard,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"Magic is a beautiful thing, capable of such incredible things and filled with endless amounts of
mystery. Yet…one hates to say it out loud but perhaps the meathead knights have a point. It really is
so much quicker to just smack things with holy swords. Even the great Merlin is himself an
exceptional warrior, so you saw about taking after this path yourself. As your magical skill rises, you
also find your skill in combat rises alongside it too. While you may not learn specific techniques out
of nowhere, you do have an easier and easier time fighting others in battle, unarmed or with a
weapon, the better you become at magic. Almost as if the two have become linked in some manner. Unfortunately, you do not necessarily gain the physical attributes to make the best use of your skill
in combat but perhaps that wondrous magic could be turned to shoring up that fault."
1036,,400,The Sword of Promised Victory,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"No light shines greater in the hearts of men than that of glory and no blade embodies that glory
moreso than Excalibur. The blade of light that brings out the fondest feelings of all warriors that see
it, even as it obliterates them, and can force madmen back to sanity with a glimpse of this glory. Excalibur is the embodiment of victory and a mighty weapon in it's own right. A holy blade of truly
peerless strength, endurance and cutting power in this world, it is also able to instantly convert any
amount of magical energy residing in the wielder's body into destructive beams of holy light. Fired as
an energy beam or blast from the tip of the blade in less than a second from activation, the blast of
Excalibur can cleanse almost any foe from the face of the world. While costly to activate even for
King Arthur, it is more than capable of vaporising fortresses, mountains or even Divine Beasts. The
ranks of those that can survive a full power beam, as it can be adjusted for less cost and power, are
limited to powerful Divine Spirits, the mightiest Dragons and beings above them. The weapon is constantly covered in a powerful enchantment of wind, placed by Merlin himself. This
conceals the sword to all eyes but your own, rendering it invisible, and cloaks it in an aura of wind. This wind can be controlled, made to cut and grind away or even unleashed in a powerful blast that
on it's own, would be a match for many powerful magical tools. While this Invisible Air is active, it
significantly reduces the attack power of the blade and prevents you from activating the holy light. The sword must be revealed to the foe to show it's true self, in the manner of a chivalrous knight. Much like the Lance of the End- Rhongomyniad, Excalibur has potentially not normally seen. There
are Thirteen Seals on the blade, one made by each member of the Round Table. Each seal that has
it's condition met, raises the power of the sword even beyond what you might do by charging it with
more energy. Unlocking all Thirteen Seals would return Excalibur to it's original form, a shining light
made to protect the very planet. A weapon that can decisively drive away even the Umbral Star itself
from this world in a single, glorious ray of light."
1037,,400,Fairy Weapon,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"All of the Knights of the Round have their own special weapon. A magical sword, a enchanted bow, a
special shield. These weapons are often crafted by the hands of the fairies themselves, creating
immensely powerful weapons for the greatest protectors of Britain. Now you too have a legendary
weapon in your hands, on the same level as things like Excalibur Galatine, Arondight or Lord Camelot. You might choose an enchanted sword that can unleash gigantic blasts of energy at will or a bow
that fires a dozen shots for every single one you loose or even a flail that can command the wind as
it slams into your foes. You could even have a magical prosthetic arm that unleashes blades and
blasts of light on command."
1038,,400,Holy Staff,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"For a magus who looks to do work in the crush of battle yet still requires a proper mystic code, there’s no need to look further than this. A fairy made weapon, similar to Excalibur if much weaker, has been mounted on a staff made from a very old and magical tree. Together, they form the perfect
weapon for one such as you. The blade, beyond being a holy blade of excellent power, can unleash
good sized blasts of holy light on command. The staff will significantly increase the power of magic
used while holding it, as well as making magical energy much easier to shape and direct, even energy
from outside the wielder’s form."
1039,,400,Clarent,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"The corrupted sword that Mordred stole to use against her father, now finds a copy of itself in your
hands. It appears that it acknowledges you as a rightful owner however, a touch different to poor
Mordred the thief. Clarent is a powerful magical blade, one that makes the wielder stronger, faster
and tougher when holding it as well as significantly increasing their charisma and presence. The
most notable ability of the sword, at least now that it is here, is that you are able to channel your
emotions into the blade alongside mana to unleash potent attacks. The deeper the emotions and
more mana you put in, the more powerful and large the outgoing blast will become."
1040,,400,Add - Grim Reaper ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Destruction,"A replica of the Atlas superweapon known as Logos React
created by Morgan le Fey, this Mystic Code takes the form of a talking box in a bird cage,
with a personality designed by you. At your command, it can transform into a massive
scythe known as Grim Reaper that’s deadly in combat and can consume both magical
energy and spiritual bodies, boosting the user’s physical abilities in the process. It grows
as it consumes more energy, somehow without reducing your combat effectiveness. It
can also be turned into a hammer, a shield, and probably a few other forms as well."
1041,,400,Rhongomyniad,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Destruction ,"By spending an additional 400 CP after purchasing Add -
Grim Reaper, you gain access to the Mystic Code’s true form: the Lance That
Shines to the Ends of the World: Rhongomyniad, the holy spear of the King of
Knights. Besides being an incredibly powerful spear, it is capable of launching
beams of magical energy at one's enemies. It is also a pillar of the World, which
means if it breaks, the Age of Gods shall return and consume the Modern World or
whatever world you unleash it upon. Best not to allow that to happen, but if you
do, Rhongomyniad will reform post-jump, optionally restoring the barrier between
reality and illusion in the process, though by then who knows what damage will
already be done. Oh, and don’t worry about that whole “turning into a sociopathic
goddess” thing. Add will protect you from that.    

Requires Add - Grim Reaper "
1042,,400,Mystic Eyes of Flame ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"Your eyes have command over heat. At first, all you will be able to do is increase the heat of people and objects you look at, burning them and possibly even settingthem aflame, but further training will allow you to manipulate heat more freely and with greater potency. Setting things on fire instantly or freezing them solid at a glance is something within a true master's ability"
1043,,400,Seventh Holy Scripture ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"This powerful Conceptual Weapon is made from a unicorn’s horn and the freely given life of a young woman who became the elemental dwelling inside of it. It is a weapon made to kill souls, doing massively increased damage to spirits. 'Immortal' beings that rely on the soul surviving, such as beings making use of reincarnation, can be slain with this weapon. It was reforged into a type of weapon of your choice, or else incorporated into another weapon from a previous jump. The spirit within may be a copy of Nanako or a similar spirit of your choosing.
"
1044,,400,Mystic Eyes of Distortion ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"The telekinetic eyes of the Asakami clan. Together, they exert great force on the world in their sights through the vector of spirals of force. The left eye forces rotation to the left, while the right eye does the same to the right. Any location that can be seen can be forcefully twisted in this way, immense force being emitted that’s enough to tear a person in half or crumple up a car. Your eyes are stronger than most, equal to Asagami Fujino, and could potentially warp and distort an entire suspension bridge in a single use, though it may proving tiring to start out trying that."
1045,,400,Awakened Predator ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"Ah, more direct than most, are you? All this talk of predators and prey awoke an ancient lineage in you, a calling back to the days when we all had to crush and kill with our bare hands. When humans and beasts were no different. It might have been a miraculous success of the bloodchip drug or the result of an awakened origin, but you’ve become rather like Lio Shirazumi. Your body is powerful now, able to leap several storeys and tear through stone walls or crush human skulls with ease. Your senses have quickly come to match some of the best in the animal kingdom and the sharp fangs and claws that appear when you grow hostile slice flesh like it was just water. These traits slowly increase as time goes on and you hunt more, perhaps even new abilities sourced from predator animals appearing on you. 

Unlike Lio, you can halt and start the progress of this when you desire. Useful given it has an effect on your mind. Much more limited than the Shirazumi beast suffers but you still find that the more monstrous you become, the more your mindset begins to reflect that of a predator. Sheer force of will can restrain your urges to devour and kill, with magecraft perhaps holding keys to treat this mental affliction. Should you give into the power, you’ll soon be more than a match for many of the denizens of this city.
"
1046,,400,Heirloom Weapon ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"An ancient weapon of a Demon Hunting clan, perhaps even a replica of the Kanesada Kuji that the Ryougi treasure. A five hundred year old weapon, already a heavy weight of mystery, but with a particular bend towards damaging and destroying magecraft it comes into contact with, at least when younger and weaker than the weapon itself. A sword from this option might disband lesser bounded fields just from being withdrawn from the scabbard and swinging such a blade could cut through even powerful magical barriers that otherwise lock space itself tight.
"
1047,,400,Mystic Hunter ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"For a human fighting in a world filled with eldritch nightmares you are truly tenacious, and judging by the looks of it you seem to be able to hold just fine against threats larger than your own. With this perk, you’ll receive a natural advantage against the supernatural. Against you, supernatural attacks feel more sluggish, accelerated movements look predictable, impregnable defenses are riddled with holes, and overwhelming strength is only slightly overbearing.

You'll still be forced to play on the defensive, especially against larger threats, but at least you’ll have a solid chance of succeeding regardless of whether you choose to fight or flight. This ability only works for the supernatural, so don’t let yourself get mauled by a fierce beast, or squashed by a large rock.
"
1048,,400,Alakapurine Shears ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"The scissors that an Hour used to butcher another. These scissors sever all strings, cut all attachments, and end all contracts without repercussions, allowing one to get rid of needless things.
"
1049,,400,Carcass Spark ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"An ember of a most radiant light. This spark never fades or burns without reason, and can consume materials and souls alike to grow like a bonfire. Its fire remembers the exact moment where all stones become water."
1050,,400,Furious Sliver ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"The remnants of a blade that had to be shattered for a general to become an Hour. Even broken, these 3 fragments yearn to strike again, and should they be reforged, they will surround and follow their master like loyal dogs of war.
"
1051,,400,Division Bell ,Cultist Simulator,Destruction,"A handheld bell that rings with dissonant tones. Pointing this bell at something and ringing it can divide that which has been put together. Through this, and with enough haste, even the Worms can be separated from the still unwilling host."
1052,,400,Celestial Horrors ,Sonny,Destruction,"With this comes two blades; the Moon Struck Horrors and the Sun Struck Horrors. The Moon Struck horrors is a buster sword engraved with glowing blue symbols, and whenever you pick it up you can hear tormented screams coming from it. Moon Struck Horrors is somewhat sharp, yes, but the main draw is twofold. The first is that while holding it you become a decent bit physically stronger, enough to maybe dent a car door, and the second is that the blade releases a chilling aura that leaves chunks of ice behind. Not the strongest, but definitely powerful. 

The Sun Struck Horrors is a mirror of the Moon Struck Horrors, only with warm orange symbols. Whenever you pick it up, you can hear twisted laughter coming from it. The Sun Struck Horrors provides a similar benefit to its brother, but instead of a chilling aura, it releases flames.
"
1053,,400,Sonic​ ​Emissions​ ,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"Your hair accessories are blessed with a power you can replicate, with some effort--when distress grips you, no matter what, any scream or cry you emit will send out sonic shockwaves through the air. Your loud voice is amplified to earsplitting levels--but you’ll be immune to it. Your enemy, however, will suffer painfully.
"
1054,,400,Brute Force ,DC Occult,Destruction,"​The inhuman source of your abilities grants you not only magical power, but also physical power as well. Your durability is enough to completely ignore conventional firearms and laugh in the face of a grenade exploding in your face. Your strength, likewise, allows you to casually throw large vehicles and tear through steel as if it was paper."
1055,,400,Sword of Beowulf ,Young Justice,Destruction,"This sword normally only works for the pure of heart; however, it seems to work differently for you. Instead, it only works for you and those you allow to use it. In the hands of another, it refuses to swing and will quickly leave their hand, seeking to return to you or it’s sheathe, whichever is closer. The sword itself is indestructible, supernaturally sharp, and capable of firing beams of magical energy with every swing."
1056,,400,The Curse of the Mummy ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"A blight upon all who steal from the most sacred treasures of the Tomb Kings of Nehekhara. Those tombs, and the bodies laid within, were given countless wards and protective enchantments to protect them from thieves and desecraters and to curse all those who manage to get away. This curse will affect anyone who steals from you, even a single bronze coin lifted from your pouch is enough to count. Once afflicted, they will be stricken with disgusting plagues and illnesses, cursed with horrid bad luck and aged far beyond their years. Only by returning what they stole can they stop it from progressing any further, though what they have already suffered will remain with them as a reminder. If someone were to go so far as to manage to actually kill you, the curse would apply at an even greater level, slaying all but the strongest beings of this world in a slow, agonising death.
"
1057,,400,Energy Weapon ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to protect others? Y​our Weapon is now directly charged with magical energy from your Soul Gem, letting you inflict even more magical damage by ‘overcharging’ them. This is proportional to how much energy you put into the weapon itself - letting the next attack or shot from it become anything from a little extra punch to a devastating finishing move. Just try not to use all of it at once, alright?"
1058,,400,Slashing Strings ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Destruction,"What is a singer without instruments? You might not have any skill in playing string instruments, but you are very good at actually fighting with string. Your Hero outfit now has a large bracelet around your wrist. From this bracelet projects incredibly tough and sharp metal strings. To the point where making a net with them to wrap around your target and then swinging your net around while they’re still trapped inside is a viable method for killing your target. You can manipulate these strings with but a single thought, and meld them into any shape. In Mankai form, you can pierce the most powerful being’s bodies and fill them with your power, possibly destroying them.
"
1059,,400,Scourge ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Destruction,"A wicked weapon, this whip that has stolen lives. Covered in a multitude of barbs ripped from Tuskgor and Razorgor hides, wrapped in the bitter curses woven by Bray-Shaman. When confronted with enemies, the whip will jump into action on being swung - lashing out with a mind of its own to strike every opponent in front of you, with a maximum range of eight feet. The spines and barbs will tear through hide and flesh - striking your foes with Scourge’s myriad of engrained curses. Curses of bloodletting, fear, and other nerve-wracking spells will course through their bodies.
"
1060,,400,Potential Unleashed ,Dragon Ball Super,Destruction,"A mystic power attained only through a strange ritual administered by the former Supreme Kai of Universe 7, the potential unleashed state is a powerful form that forces out all your latent potential and then brings out even more power you didn’t know you had. Manifesting as a white aura around your body, it can even be easily utilised with other transformations without putting any further stress on your body. The power the form grants normally would be somewhere between the Super Saiyan 2 and 3 states but with mastery, as you have, the Potential Unleashed state has grown to enhance you with equivalent power to a Super Saiyan God transformation."
1061,,400,Magic Iron Sword ,Neverland: The RPG,Destruction,"A mighty sword forged by Michael the Mountain Smith. After three successful hits on a target, the sword damages either the opponent’s weapon (reducing its attack power) or their armor (reducing their defense).
"
1062,,400,Corn Dolly ,Neverland: The RPG,Destruction,"An animated corn doll made from grains grown around Hangman’s Tree. If you add some part of a person (hair, fingernails, etc.) into the doll, any damage or effects inflicted on the dolly will be redirected at that individual. You can only tie the doll to a single individual, but once you modify your doll, you’ll get an unbound copy in a week’s time.
"
1063,,400,Executioner’s Axe ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"A double-bladed axe with a perpetually sharp edge, engraved with royal card suit designs from the House of Clubs. All attacks made with it automatically home in on the head of a targett one thing is certain - the flames that cover both of their blades will not be extinguished, even should an Ice Witch of Kislev use her coldest spells upon them. Resonating with your bestial fury, the axe will cook flesh as it cleaves, and melt through the armor of mankind’s champions with little effort.(the weapon becomes ineffectual if there is no head to hit), and the attack does not suffer from any penalties that would normally occur from such a called shot. Fortunately, this version of the axe does not run the risk of hitting an innocent bystander or its own user; be careful if you find such an axe elsewhere during your time in Wonderland. You can also choose to have a current axe in your possession converted into this purchase; it will keep most of its old attributes but will be modified accordingly
"
1064,,400,Life Thief ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"It looks like you’re burning someone alive. Like you’re setting them aflame, from the inside out. But it’s a bit more complicated than that. Using The strands of your hair and a spiritual extension of it, you are able to ‘plunder’ the life force of a living person, stealing it for yourself and making them endure the pain of being burned alive in the process, though no actual burning takes place - you merely drain them dry of their lifeforce, leaving them lifeless and empty should it be allowed to complete itself. This process is invisible and virtually unstoppable by someone with no spiritual awareness, such as an ordinary human being, leaving them to only be caught and die helplessly by this. Your hair is also now a living weapon, able to move accordingly to your will and absorb the life from whatever it touches. However, against the spiritually aware, such as magi or a Dead Apostle, this is merely agrapple or a mild nuisance, and these beings will take more time and effort to capture and kill with this method.As a side effect, you are also capable of ‘giving’ stolen life force or your own to others,extending their lifespans rather than draining it. Optionally, your hair is now longer. With time and effort, this could be improved to drain life more quickly and effectively, even against the spiritually aware, but this will take a good amount of practice.
"
1065,,400,The End of A Thousand Years ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"All True Ancestors suffer from an instinctive but purely psychological bloodlust that they must suppress using their own powers in order to act rationally and control themselves. Your unusual condition doesn’t make this much of a problem as a True Ancestor yourself...but you’ve either found a way to safely tapinto it or just have anger issues powerful enough to make you into a rampaging monster. You may choose to tap into this bloodlust and stop holding yourself back, complete with glowing yellow pupils and red irises, which greatly enhances your phys .
"
1066,,400,Ghost Sword ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"The copy of a sword belonging to the ghost of an unfortunate Chessman general who lost his life to a pair of hungry Tweedle. The sword weighs absolutely nothing, so it has no encumbrance or strength requirement to wield. The sword is nearly invisible, and while you can easily find it, it is hard for others to find it if it’s set down. Also, when carrying the sword, your spirit is boosted slightly, and you get a slight boost to fighting skills when fighting Tweedle (or twins, copies, clones, fused beings, or similar things). You can also choose to have a current sword you own converted into this purchase; it will keep most of its old attributes but gain the new aspects such as zero weight and boost to fighting Tweedle and the like.
"
1067,,400,Sword-n-Board ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Destruction,"This feels familiar, but it’s probably just me seeing things. Anyways, most halfling leaders and generals are equipped with a set of weapons similar to this - an enchanted sword to serve as a badge of office, and a shield with their personal crest emblazoned upon it. You’ll find like that one Nicholas Warfoot however, yours are a bit above average.

Your sword is a notch-for-notch copy of Glammyding, the ancestral weapon of the Warfoots and the one by which all halfling generals model theirs after. The magical sword’s edge is enhanced that any cut, stab, or slash it doles out goes twice as deep as it ordinarily would, and enhances the wielder’s own physical strength by a smidgeon. As well, any orcoid or goblinoid foe who lays eyes on it will be struck with fear by the blade’s light.

Your shield is equally enchanted, enough to protect you on the field of battle against even the dread Necromancers and Vampires of Sylvania. Its thick steel plating is as durable as steam tank armor, with a shimmering light emanating about half-an-inch off its surface that aids in defending the shieldbearer from magical assaults. As well, projectiles aimed at you - arrows, throwing knives, goblins flung from a Doom Diver Catapult as examples - are redirected mid-flight to strike the shield instead.
"
1068,,400,SHARD BLADE ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"The great polearm of Boris Ursus himself, made from the ice of a Norscan glacier and bound by wards of witches of Kislev. The blade is supernaturally sharp and simply holding it is enough to grant the strength required to cut a troll clean in half. What’s more any cuts made by it cause a spreading chill to go through your enemies as their blood and flesh begins to freeze.
"
1069,,400,THE SILVER SHARD ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"This magical bow is crafted of white oak and wrapped with silver and white fox leather. Silver arrows appear in the hands of the wielder and when fired from it, splinter in the air, resolve themselves into a score of bolts that can fell entire ranks of enemy soldiers. Not only are the arrows fired from it capable of hitting daemons but they seem devastatingly effective against such diabolical threats as wounds caused refuse to heal and seem to greatly distress these foul abominations.
"
1070,,400,FEARFROST ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Destruction,"The sword of the Tzarina, or one much like it. An artefact of great power, the immense cold that emanates from it is enough to cause most armour to crack on contact and it’s said that a mere scratch to the skin is enough to kill a man. Were the blade to be lifted by anyone other than you they would find themselves frozen to death within a heartbeat.
"
1071,,400,Walking Battery ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"The Lore of Fire is a straightforward and destructive Lore of Magic, and it shows especially well in those Bright Wizards sent to aid the Empire’s armies in sieges. You have fought in such battles, less as a soldier and more as a man-sized artillery piece. Your spells of flaming destruction now deal additional damage to walls, gates, palisades, and other defensive fortifications, a simple fireball being half again as effective as a cannonball of equal size.
"
1072,,400,Death From Above ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"As much as they are astrologers, the Celestial Wizards are still called to battle in the name of the Empire. In such battles, they call down death from the very sky. Bolts of lightning arc between enemies, blasts of wind mow down cadres, and comets flatten entire units at a time. You are especially adept at this, as your spells of wind, weather, and heavenly bodies strike half again the area they normally should."
1073,,400,Iron Wheel ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"When the Chaos Lord Tamurkhan launched his assault on Nuln, three Bright Wizards took to the sky on a wheel like this to oppose his aerial force of Manticores and Harpies. This ever-burning wheel of coal-black iron, enchanted with the ability to fly at the behest of its rider, will allow you to do the same. The ride is surprisingly comfortable and even more surprisingly stable due to the enchantments. What is more, the constant flame and smoke it emits will scorch, blind, and choke enemy creatures which approach you in the air."
1074,,400,Celestial Hurricanum ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"This battle altar is the pride of the Celestial College’s armaments. A planetarium surrounding an Orb of Sorcery channels the arcane Storm of Shemtek, which slowly but surely bends the sky until the enemies of the Celestial Wizard riding it are pelted with bolts of lightning and hailstones the size of their heads. If the Acolytes manning the machine perform a certain ritual correctly, the device will even call down a blazing meteor upon the enemy force, and allied soldiers within a few yards are given visions of the near future by the leaking energy, allowing them to dodge incoming enemy blows. Is this not the sort of weapon you have dreamed of?
"
1075,,400,Luminark of Hysh ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"Let the unclean fear the approach of this Battle Altar, for its power is great. Powered by one of Teclis’ Orbs of Sorcery and crewed by several Acolytes, this mobile purification platform uses an array of carefully-crafted lenses to focus the light from the Orb of Sorcery into Solheim’s Bolt of Illumination. Hysh leaks from it as it fires, protecting nearby allies from blade and arrow as they march with the arcane wagon. This artillery piece is immensely useful against the Empire’s most devious enemies - the Von Carsteins of Sylvania and their minions, and the Daemons that stream forth alongside the Norscan hordes. That one of these rare machines is in your personal keeping implies a great deal of trust in you, for each Orb of Sorcery used to power a Luminark is one less Orb powering the prisons beneath the Light College."
1076,,400,Thing-Gouger ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"There exists, crafted by skaven hands, a warpick named ‘Dwarf-Gouger.’ The maul was forged during the days of skavendom’s earliest history, when dwarf and rat were beginning their endless feud in the underground. Twisted epithets and curses towards dawikind are carved into the pick’s surface, and it is perpetually stained with the dried blood of the stout folk. While it currently exists in Queek Head-Taker’s paws, these are skaven we speak of - there is no way in the Warp others like this do not exist.

And in fact, in your paws is a weapon made for much the same purpose as Dwarf-Gouger. It doesn’t have to be a war-pick either - for your purposes it could be a jagged sword, halberd, or other weapon of your preference. Regardless, the weapon is built to pierce and brutalize armor - carving steel like butter and even managing to pierce dwarven gromgril or puresteel. And to make matters worse for your foes, into the tool of war is engraved curses and oaths of violence against a foe of your choice - causing the weapon to hunger and seek the flesh of said enemy, and tear through them with disturbing ease.

Note: These have to be enemies that could conceivably attack or be attacked by Skaven. No, “Elder Gods of the Infinite Cosmos” doesn’t count. If you want to say Ork tho, it’d work on all Ork- and Orc-like monsters.
"
1077,,400,Screaming Bell ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"Unholy battle-altars of the Horned Rat, the Screaming Bells strike awe and fervor into the hearts of skaven, and the tolling carves fear into the hearts of Skavenblight’s enemies. They are made from a thirteen-day long ritual in which bronze alloy is melted down with warpstone in the grand warp-forges of Skavenblight, the blood of sacrifices spilled across the metal both as it is set into the cast, and as it cools. The chittering incantations of Skryre and Seer alike wreath the metal in skittering, malevolent runes as it cools; Once it is finished, a great carriage built with a piece of the Tower of Kavzar’s masonry is constructed to hold the infernal relic - and a Rat-Ogre specially constructed to be the bell-ringer.

And atop the bell’s archway is a paw-hold, for you as its Seer to stand atop the ringing bell as you observe the battlefield and squeak-preach the word of the Horned Rat. Yes, you heard me right - you have earned the honors of commanding the holy war-machine of the Screaming Bell, as you command the cart to move in the direction of skavendom’s sworn enemies. The bell’s ringing is magically augmented - even more so with you aboard the battle-altar, as your own magical power enhances the metal device. Every thundering toll empowers and hardens those under your command with a zealotry unseen by any other false God of this world. And to make matters worse for your enemies, every toll rings doom: For as the rat-ogre bellringer hoists on the rope, the din will grow louder and louder still, until stone and metal are cracked, pounded, and broken by the explosions of sound that emanate from the device. Should the Bell suffer destruction at enemy hands, or cause itself to detonate in a beautiful display of cataclysm, it will reappear good as new in a week’s time.
"
1078,,400,Plague Furnace ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"When the Pestilent Brotherhood goes to battle, there always remains the need and the time to preach the ways of The Horned Rat, The Harbinger. Thus does this great war machine serve as both burning siege engine, and noisome altar of worship. Crewed by a regiment of skaven clerics, the machine is built like the Screaming Bell of the Grey Seer Priesthood - except instead of a great bell hanging from the archway, there is a great metal censer the size of a dwarven wrecking ball, with a great many mummified priests skins wrapped inside about a chunk of burning warpstone. The brazier emanates a hot, sickly green mist as the priests heave on its chains, with even simple beasts knowing immediately that to inhale that mist is to die a most horrific death. Just beneath the swinging brazier is the Priest’s podium - from which they squeak and shriek the word of the Verminous One.

You may decide upon the crew that mans your own great Furnace - either a regiment of plagued clerics, some to hoist the great brazier’s chain and some to push the war machine, or two rat-ogres specifically trained for this purpose only. Indeed, I said “your own,” for you lay claim to one of the holy siege engines of Pestilens. Taking your rightful place on the war-machine-altar will magnify your voice, enough to be heard across an entire raging battlefield. As well, the spells you wield atop the Plague Furnace are multiplied in effectiveness, from the great-many plagued runes and enchantments woven into the machine. The mist that billows from the brazier will inflict whatever debilitating pox will most wreak havoc upon the field of battle, but renders a different effect on your brothers and allies: Those by your side and under your command are, on inhaling the sickly fog, immediately taken by a religious fervour as their pain is dulled and their mind sharpened for the violence at hand.
"
1079,,400,Dead Man’s Volley ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Destruction,"“We shall be TRULY superior!”

Just like Ganon, you have been granted the power to fire magic from your body in the form of purple energy balls. The damage which these orbs cause is proportional to your own magical power, scaling with no upper limit. When the orb is hit with a perfect counterattack, it will be deflected back at the one who fired it. If you hit it back yourself, it will be reflected once more, growing in speed and power with each hit until a botched shot causes it to finally makes contact with you or your target.
"
1080,,400,Master Sword ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Destruction,"“You got the Master Sword - a blade for a true hero!”

This legendary blade from Hyrule’s history has long been sealed in the Lost Woods, and is far more powerful than any mundane sword. It is capable of banishing evil and dispelling dark magic, and can also be upgraded with Master Ore to further increase its formidable power. If you would prefer, you may import an existing melee weapon to adopt the properties of the Master Sword.
"
1081,,400,The Great Wizard ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Destruction,"Darkness aside, Agahnim was still a wizard of no small might. Fireballs and bolts of lightning seem to be his favorite tricks, and the both of them are now something you can command. But more important than those is what seems to be his speciality, barriers. Or more accurately, the breaking of barriers. Beyond those simple yet deadly magical attacks now in your possession, all of your magics now carry a secondary effect. When confronted with a barrier, a small part of your magic will slip through. A fireball might be reduced to a mild burn instead of instant obliteration, but no barrier will actually stop your attack.
"
1082,,400,Din’s Fire ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Destruction,"A spell handed down by the goddess, this power allows you to manifest a dome of massive fire around you and creates an ‘explosion’ of flame - it requires a bit of your energy, but it can be an amazing way to create breathing room if you’re surrounded by foes.
"
1083,,400,Light Arrows ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Destruction,"“You got the Light Arrow! The sacred light of these arrows can pierce pure evil itself!”

Light nuke might be another name for these, if only Hyrule knew what those were. Regardless, the light arrows are the complete antithesis of the dark and its inhabitants. So much so that most monster will simply disintegrate with a single arrow to the face. Of course, that assumes the monster is ‘dark’, or has some sort of affiliation with the dark. Without that, these arrows ‘merely’ hit like someone throwing a big old pirate ship at you. Now, they do cost quite a bit of magic to fully activate, but I assure you, it’s more than worth the price. Also, if you didn’t buy the Hero’s Bow (because who buys arrows without a bow?), you can apply this to a weapon of your choice as a more permanent upgrade. Not quite as powerful, but constant.
"
1084,,400,Royal Blade ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Destruction,"An ornate weapon passed down the family tree for generations, and now ending up in your care. Although it is a high-quality weapon, and nearly unbreakable, it’s not quite on par with the blades of yore. It’s main use is as a catalyst for magic, allowing one to channel their abilities through its structure and strengthening them. It does have one similarity, however; because of its use in magic, the Royal Blade is capable of deflecting magical attacks as well.
"
1085,,400,Magical Boomerang ,The Legend of Zelda,Destruction,"This enchanted Boomerang will always return to you wherever you throw it, and what’s more it can retrieve items when you do so. It’s strong enough to kill weak enemies such as Octoroks and stun larger ones, when they are hit by it.
"
1086,,400,General of the Hordes of Evil ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Destruction,"You have ascended to the top of the ranks for Ganon’s army - earning yourself the title of “Boss” among those who have pledged their life to Darkness. This grants you an associated form - In shape it is similar to the the Might of Monsters, but for 8 Hylians OR a single “Spell” (such as those granted by The Wise Man’s Teachings) but only choosing from Life, Fairy, Jump and Shield. There is one caveat however - this form has “patterns” when you use it in combat that allow the sharp eyed to counter your attacks, and in each pattern no matter what there is a “Critical point” in which your defenses are lowered such that you can easily be attacked and damaged. Ensure that your enemies are crushed before the chance to take advantage of their wits even occurs.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Might of Monsters - Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link first.)

If you have The Might of Monsters, you instead have both the might and endurance of 10 Hylians as well as a choice of a natural Spell from among Fire, Jump, Fairy, Life, and Shield.
"
1087,,400,Dragonslayer,TES: Dovah,Destruction,"Much like with mortals, the greatest killer of the Dov are other
Dovah themselves, and it seems as though you are no different. All of your attacks
towards another dragon are three times more effective, while their attempts at harming
you are reduced by half. Though this may seem like a simple ability, it will undoubtedly
make you a nightmare for any dragon who thinks of going against you."
1088,,400,Feeble Aura,TES: Magic,Destruction,"A skilled user of Destruction does not only strike at their foes using
elemental forces, but by damaging an enemy's very self. At will, you may emit an aura
that will slowly drain away your enemies' attributes, such as their strength and agility, as
well as draining away their stamina and magicka in order to bolster your own. Even
though they will not be defeated through this aura alone, this will ensure that you will be
able to fight much longer than they will."
1089,,400,Necromage,TES: Magic,Destruction,"Everybody always thinks that Restoration is only good for healing,
something that any competent priest should know. What they fail to remember, is that
Restoration magic is an absolute nightmare for any undead entity. It would only make
sense, after all, for the School of Magic focused on life energy. You’ve got a gift, able to
imbue a little bit of Restoration into all of your spells, allowing all of your magic to be
twice as effective against the undead."
1090,,400,Spellsword ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"It is an unfortunate truth that sometimes pure might is not enough. You are quite skilled in supplementing your combat capabilities with the use of magic. Enhancing your physical capabilities, momentarily coat your weapon in mystical fire, or just using a blade in one hand and blasting lightning from the other."
1091,,400,Giant Sword ,Undertale,Destruction,"Historically, humans wielded swords up to 10x their size. Well, with this blade, you've harnessed this ancient human fighting style! This 10-meter broadsword is a perfect fusion of Human and Monster engineering! Not only is it surprisingly well-made, not buckling under its own weight like it ought to, but it's very light for its size and can actually be used as, you know, a sword. Instead of an oversized slab of metal. More importantly, it's perfectly capable of conducting magic for use in combat!"
1092,,400,Gaster Blaster ,Undertale,Destruction,"This device, run on the user's own magical power, is a semi-autonomous magical weapon. Resembling a floating goat's skull with glowing eyes, the Gaster Blaster is an extremely powerful magic device capable of shooting very powerful magical lasers of variable width. While it's very draining to use and are only effective at close range, being unable to operate beyond 10 meters of the user, the versatility and maneuverability of this weapon is unmatched in the Underground."
1093,,400,Favored Weapon ,Genshin Impact,Destruction,"A good weapon is a strong force multiplier. If you could cleave through trees with a normal steel sword, then imagine the havoc you could wreak with one that was capable of cleaving through stone when wielded by normal mortals, let alone one imbued with its own power. These kinds of weapons are the type that appears once every few decades or even lifetimes, but those lifetimes add up. You have acquired your very own legendary weapon, the kind used by heroes of eras past. Incomparably sharp, incredibly sturdy, and filled with elemental power, this weapon puts you in good stead for the journey ahead."
1094,,500,Gate of Skye,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Destruction,"The Gate of Skye is a powerful ability functioning as both Scathach’s Noble Phantasm
and her Semblance. By purchasing this you may acquire both versions of the Gate. The
first is her standard Noble Phantasm. This variant allows her to call forth the gate which
will suck up everything in the area. Anyone consumed by the gate will be instantly slain.
Should someone survive they will suffer from immense damage. The second version of
the gate is made from her Semblance. This version sacrifices its offensive and sealing
power to focus on defense. This gate is nearly indestructible, being particularly effective
when defending against Mystery-based attacks."
1095,,500,Sayafushi,Bleach,Destruction,"Greatest failure of Oetsu Nimaiya, inventor of the Zanpaktou and member of the Royal Guard. Sayafushi resembles a sword, a normal katana in fact, but fails to meet the basic definition of a
sword. Sayashi is too sharp, and its edge is too smooth. It will never chip, nor will it scratch, from
even the most burdensome use. Blood slides off of it immediately, and no sheath can contain its
impossibly perfect edge. This is a failed sword that is simple able to cut through anything it meets. Sayafushi comes with a large tank filled with a special jelly in which it is able to float when not in use;
the only way to leave the weapon unattended for any length of time. "
1096,,500,Angrboða,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Destruction,"You are now big, like actually as big as most people think the Jötnar are. As a Guðkunnigr, you could be a snake whose body encircles the world, or a wolf whose mouth reaches from bedrock to heaven and could devour the sun.  You no longer obey the square cube law; in fact, you murdered it and all its relatives, like the cube 4d law, to wear their pelts like a fancy stitched hat. You can grow endlessly, though not necessarily quickly and can go toe-to-toe in physical might with beings an order of magnitude greater than yourself. You have gained the ability to kill anything, even that which can not die, that lacks the concept entirely, or was never alive to begin with; even the dead can die. Murdering an avatar would kill the source itself and what you kill stays dead. You can murder concepts like love or hope, though through more esoteric means; you could kill a concept in its entirety or just an instance of it, forcing ideas wherever they are to physically manifest so they can be destroyed.  Any aspect of you or your power that is focused on death, destruction, consumption, chaos, war, poison, decay, entropy, madness, lies, hate, evil or the like is massively enhanced. Your touch can turn things to embers and dust instantly, your bite corrosive, your venom toxic to everything, and nothing - not even gods or greater cosmic entities or fate itself - can heal the wounds you inflict upon the world without your blessing. You are become death, the destroyer of worlds."
1097,,500,Spatial Rupture,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"Your attacks, be it from weapons, your fists, and so on leave undetectable remains only you can see and feel. You can choose to instantly teleport to one of these invisible remains whenever you choose or cause them to explode in an All or Nothing spatial rupture that destroys anything within a 3-meter range of it. You are immune to the effects of your own Spatial Slashes and they last up to a week, after which they will fizzle and fade."
1098,,500,Cleaving The Multitude,Slay the Princess,Destruction,"There is something to be said about the limitlessness of absolute reality, how it expands and branches out infinitely to all possible points at once. But despite this, it is never ours to keep - always kept away from us because of higher powers that, by their very nature, do not notice as they crush and destroy our meager finite existences. No more. Together, with this power, we shall tear and cut away that which makes these concepts so mighty, so infinite and we shall reduce them to something that can fit into narrow confines - into possibilities tight enough to strangle them with.

This merely lessens them for a time, and them breaking free is all too real a concern - as can be expected when you try to bind Gods, but it is enough. Enough to divide them for but a moment, to create a point of weakness in the points between their definitions and lay their beating hearts bare for the world to witness. It is here that they may be slain."
1099,,500,“Sword” of the Barbarians,80s Sword and Sorcery,Destruction,"Not a sword, but a mighty crossbow as long as a man is tall, and with a pull strength that would require Mighty Thews to pull back and even then it would not be quick or easy. The crossbow fires 3 bolts at once and it and its projectiles are immune to direct application of magic, reality warping, and supernatural alteration. Bolts launched from it will pierce through force fields and energy barriers as if they were not there, ignore magical protections (other than sheer supernatural durability), and hit with greater force than even their bow’s size and the strength needed to pull it back, able to easily punch through steel plate, dragons’ scales, or tanks. It is able to kill even normally immortal or unkillable beings with its bolts, and even if it does not kill them the wounds it inflicts ignore supernatural regeneration, and magical means of recovery requiring them to be healed by natural methods, and until they are healed will render the wounded entity mortal; this will not prevent supernatural means being used to heal other wounds, and will not necessarily render and entity easy to kill, merely able to be.

The crossbow is theoretically destructible through sheer force, but even a Significant Sword would be hard pressed to damage it. If it does manage to be destroyed you will get a new one within a year.

If imported into another ranged weapon this giant crossbow form will become an alt-form, but while all forms may benefit from its resistance to damage and being transformed or destroyed by magic, it must be in a suitably large and awkward form to gain its immortal slaying property and immense force."
1100,,500,Cutting off the Head        ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Destruction,"There’s something simple in fantasy stories. You kill the usurping king and his treasonous minister, his second in command, or his nephew don’t take up his standard and take control, but instead his army just seems to lose cohesion and surrender, his forces and his regime crumbling almost in instants. Now this is something that you carry with yourself as well. If you kill the leader of an organization that organization seems to instantly fall apart the moment this is made common knowledge. If you kill the commander of an army it will lose all fighting spirit and surrender the moment you make this fact known to it. If you kill the head of a company the value of its stock will plummet as it spirals into bankruptcy. If you kill a king the country will immediately begin to fold and capitulate. This won’t necessarily stop someone from trying to rebuild it from the ruins, the prince can rally the people of the country once more, or maybe in a few years the tribes that formed the enemy army will coalesce again around another charismatic leader, but it will end its immediate threat and give you at least some breathing time until someone can even begin to put it back together again, if they even can."
1101,,500,Silver Eyes,RWBY,Destruction,"You... have silver eyes. Well isn’t that an interesting development. You are now one of the Silver Eyed Warriors. These figures are Warriors of Legends and are incredibly rare, a certain girl by the name of Ruby Rose being the only truly ‘active’ Warrior in these times. Not much is known about them except their origin seemingly being from the God of Light. They are the desire to preserve life and as such are in opposition to Destruction which is embodied by the Grimm.

With them you are able to emit great blasts of silver light, capable of pulverizing and/or turning Grimm to stone. They react to the desire to preserve and protect life, as such positive emotions will probably help you in Mastering them. To begin your eyes will be difficult to use and draining but with enough practice all Grimm shall fear you.

This Power only works on Grimm and those who are bound to them like Cinder. After this Jump you will be able to use them on any being similar to Grimm in nature as beings of malevolence and Destruction. For the duration of the Jump your Silver Eyes can not be changed, however post Jump you may opt to replace them with a different colour while still keeping the ability to use the Silver light they provide. Any biological descendants of yours will also inherit the power of this Perk.

Be warned... just by having them you are a threat to Salem and she will not take that so lightly."
1102,,500,Durandal,HighSchool DxD,Destruction,"A blade surpasses many of the other Holy Swords in pure, destructive power, this gigantic blade is almost more like a wild horse than a mindless weapon in the hands of the user. The sword cuts with the touch of the blade alone, and at its full power it could obliterate other Holy Swords and powerful foes with ease. It also has an aura that is responsive to the user - the wielder desiring destruction would receive an aura that lays waste to the land around them, while a desire for precision would soften this to the capabilities of a normal, if powerful, sword. However, Durandal is extremely difficult to control, its blade needing to be sheathed in a small dimensional space (included) when not in use. It will take a lot of training to use it to its full potential, and even those pose a risk to you. I hope you like playing with fire."
1103,,500,Great Nirvana Sword – Zero ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Destruction,My... what a beautiful weapon. Its sheer presence makes me want to cry with joy. This is a Weapon born from a Volund between Zerofuku and Buddha. The ultimate divine weapon which none but those who have attained the great Nirvana in the Pure Lands can create. This weapon takes the form of a seven-branched sword with bladed protrusions which are each associated with one of the seven lucky gods. Usually... a Volund is powered by Misery. This one though? It is powered by Compassion... and powerful enough a God who gave the Buddha a good fight can be laid low with one slash.
1104,,500,Make Them Bleed,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Destruction,"Volunds allow for man to strike against Gods. To leave injuries on even the Divine. However just because one is harmed doesn’t guarantee their death. Wielding you as a weapon though? That is just a little bit different. Your Volund form strikes as a weakness against any Divine Entity, harming them more than they should. And for those of not Divine Origin, who still possess a natural weakness of some kind, this Weapon you are may fit that weakness."
1105,,500,Godkiller,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Destruction,"One day... this is what the Einherjar will be remembered as, that is Brunhilde sure of. The man who stared Divinity in the eye and made them blink. For now... this isn’t set in stone... but for you? You who are the exception in all worlds? Well lets just say this Perk every human could really need. When your fighting someone of ‘divine’ origin, be it a God, Demon or Angel, you find yourself strengthened. Your attacks are stronger you can endure more... combine this with what you already possess and killing a God may not be totally impossible."
1106,,500,Combustion,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Destruction,"The ability to channel chi through the forehead, often marked by an intricate third-eye tattoo, superheat the surrounding air, and produce a massive beam of explosive energy capable of causing immense damage at both short and long range. Unlike conventional firebending, which produces a flame from the body, combustion creates a powerful beam that explodes upon contact with a solid surface.

Requires Bender(Fire) to Purchase"
1107,,500,Lavabending,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Destruction,"The very rare ability to manipulate molten earth, it is believed this power can only be learned by skilled earthbenders who also have an affinity for firebending. Lavabending allows the user to melt rock into lava, solidify lava into stone, create temporary constructs like lava discs, and manipulate existing sources of lava with great dexterity.

Requires Bender(Earth) to Purchase"
1108,,500,Runic Blade,League of Legends ,Destruction,"One of the best weapons one could own, This massive sword is made of black Noxian steel and inscribed with magical runes. As tall and wide as a man, this mighty blade should be so heavy no normal human could lift it like a sword, no less swing it like one- But nonetheless, when you lift it, it feels like the weight of a normal sword. Not only does the blade's enchantment make it lighter for you, the blade is sharper and swifter than any other, and possesses an enchantment to keep it from ever dulling or breaking. It stores kinetic energy from your blows, unleashing blasts of magic from every impact. Even if the sword is somehow shattered, its magic will keep it together, the peices independently reassembling into the sword's form."
1109,,500,"""Swords of the Twin Princes""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"""Sword forged from the reunion of the inseparable swords born from the souls of Lothric and Lorian, the twin princes. Their union is rooted in a curse, and perpetuated by grief."" A union of the two swords associated with the twin princes Lothric and Lorian, and capable of wielding the powers of both. Its shape is derived from Lothric’s platinum holy sword, which the frail prince never wielded, while the size and charred appearance comes from Lorian’s greatsword, used to slay the Demon Prince. Normally this sword would never be able to exist, being transposed from both swords, but somehow it has ended up in your possession. The sword is capable of separating temporarily allowing one sword or the other to be wielded without its counterpart, though the nature of the souls used to craft it means this parting is hard to maintain. Lorian’s greatsword, eternally scorched with flame and stained black, constantly smolders with the embers of Chaos. When stimulated with the wielder’s soul the embers are ignited, becoming flame once more, and the sword gains the ability to launch flames across the ground. Lothric’s holy sword was blessed by Emma, the High Priestess, with potent magic. The sword can be imbued with sacred light, after which a thrusting attack can be used to release it in the form of an arrow."
1110,,500,"""Vessel of Fire""",Dark Souls 3,Destruction,"Large vessel of fire, reminiscent of the Lordvessel spoken of in the ancient myths. Intricately carved out of stone, it contains embers, flames, and even molten lava, which when spilled from its depths feels as harmless as rain to the owner’s skin. Its bowl-like shape makes for a somewhat unwieldy weapon, though the owner can always hoist it above their head despite the immense weight that others would feel from attempting it. This is because it’s true purpose is to reflect the state of the world- and, if the corruption of that world becomes too great, to burn it away so that a new world can be born from the fires; like a forest erupting with new life after a wildfire. It is possible to pour the contents of the bowl out prematurely to do this in a more localized fashion; burning away rot and other unnatural foulness like a lantern burns oil. The fires will burn wildly, but not uncontrollably, and will die away so long as they aren’t fed further from the bowl. Of course, there is another option. If the festering corruption of the world is great enough that the fire will burn all, then one can feed blood to the bowl to help prevent the state of the world from worsening further. The painted world is one that was painted with blood, and perhaps all worlds are the same way, for feeding blood to the fires will quench their thirst. But not any blood will do; only the owner of the vessel’s. This may buy time for others to improve the state of the world... or maybe such sacrifice is in vain, and one should know when a world’s time has come."
1111,,500,Black Blade ,Elden Ring,Destruction,"What a terrifying twist to the conspiracies of the divine you are. Long ago, Marika locked away Destined Death, that which slays the seemingly divine and immortal, in Maliketh-but with this, it seems for one reason or another, you too were chosen as a failsafe. Or perhaps, you or your predecessor was more involved in the night of Godwyn’s assassination than many know? Whatever the reason you now have an equal measure of Destined Death’s power as Maliketh retains in the present, perhaps strengthened by the consumption of Deathroot.

Somewhere on your body is a flat, round seal hosting the dreadful power your form contains. Smash it to release the writhing shadows and blazing crimson flames of Destined Death, and the great rusty blade that seethes focuses it’s terrible power into a force that can slay even the divine. Wreathed in an empowering aura of blood-red, writhing black and even the Erdtree’s golden sparks this blade can manifest slashing beams of crimson light, erupt in bonfire- like flames or simply slash at all nearby in a storm of illusory blades-and it is likely you can discover new techniques to wield the seething energy now unbound. Even unrefined, it grants you comparable physical prowess to a demigod. The result is the same: The innate vitality, endurance and resilience of all nearby, even that of divine beings, is drastically reduced and continuously lessened. Defences like the Erdtree’s impenetrable barrier of thorns crumble at its touch, the seeming immortal demigods die even to a fragment of the power you hold and even an incarnation of Order itself would bleed, wither and wilt like a mortal before you. No blessing from this world can withstand the inevitability nor the deprivation of death that follows with it. Only another fragment of the Great Rune of Death could even offer resistance."
1112,,500,Nullification,Harry Potter,Destruction,You can make someone’s spell fail while they are casting or temporarily remove enchantments from objects or places. You must actively and purposefully decide to do so and must be able to see the magical object or attempt at magic for it to work.
1113,,500,"You Were Hardly Using It, Anyway",The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Destruction,"Thanks to a customized parasitic spell, you are able to steal the powers of other magic users with just a touch- but there are a few caveats to this. First of all, you must take their focus – this would be their ring, staff, orb and so on – and you must either kill them or place them in a coma, magically induced or not. If you do not kill them, your theft of their powers will be incomplete, and they will instantly return to said user as soon as they care to pick up another focus or exert their strength again. If someone does not use a focus, then there is only one option: you must kill them."
1114,,500,I Brought A Little Science With Me! ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Destruction,"A sorcerer's power comes from their nervous system – no matter how little sense that really makes considering it can be stolen – which is a double-edged blade, since nerves are vulnerable to damage from electrocution and chemical damage. When you're involved, lightning is always a viable anti-magic weapon, doing massive damage to magical entities without specialized resistance and cutting through a chunk of the resistance of those that do. Sorcerer's and other magic users who receive nerve damage from your lightning also find that they permanently lose part of their power without treatment."
1115,,500,Flute of the Ancients ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Destruction,"An ornate flute with mystical powers. You can imbed words within the music you play to put victims into a trance. The flute can also change into (multiple) whips or a bow with arrows. The flute (and its other weapon forms) is enchanted with the holy magic of the Ancient Ones, further strengthening their power.
"
1116,,500,Golden Arrow of Shu-Tata ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"A fabled arrow created when the ancient brave Little Panther brought peace between the sun and the moon. The moon discarded its old hatred in the form of an arrow, and the sun blessed it with golden light. Enchanted with the power of both the sun and the moon, and representing their pact that led to the regular sequence of night and day, this arrow is very potent magically, and could work as either as a weapon or a foci in a ritual. Your ability to use the arrow’s powers is enhanced with Tribal Magic.
"
1117,,500,Vorpal Sword ,Wonderland No More,Destruction,"A mighty greatsword that requires two hands to use, it has a foot-long hilt and 4-foot blade. The shining grooves of the blade channel whatever it’s cutting away, so it does not drag or get caught. When wielded, it magically enhances your fighting skills slightly. It ignores armor, and it deals mighty blows against Jabberwocks, Jabberkin, and other dragon-like enemies. If you want, you can make a sword you already have into the Vorpal Sword, giving it the extra attributes received in this purchase.
"
1118,,500,Stellar Staff ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Destruction,"An ornate staff with a mystical orrery on top with which you can alter the trajectory of passing comets. Particularly large comets may only come by occasionally but there always seem to be a few small ones to call down to smash the enemies of Lustria and shatter their settlements.
"
1119,,500,Daemon Weapon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"Now, I know what you’re thinking. There has never been a single Verminlord that has been turned into a Daemon Weapon. And you would be right - because from the path of ascendance, Verminlords are those Skaven who have succeeded at their way of life so well that they were rewarded with Daemonhood. It would be counter-intuitive to suddenly trap one of these successful rats with being sealed inside a weapon. Unless that Verminlord were to fail at one of these schemes so catastrophically that the Great Horned Rat deigned to punish them.

And that’s where this comes in. By purchasing this, you guarantee a few things: One, that a Verminlord of your choice fails in their plans, and fails so disastrously that the Horned Rat is all but guaranteed to punish them. Two, that the Horned Rat punishes the daemonic vermin in question by trapping him within a weapon, to be used by a lowly rodent from the material world. And three - that this weapon comes into your claws, one way or another. As a Verminlord-borne Daemon Weapon, it comes with many of the capabilities of those tied to the four Gods of Chaos: Any with witchsight or the ability to see magic will witness the twisted, verminous monstrosity writhing within the armament; Born of the Warp, the weapon will tear and bite at a victim regardless of their state in either material or spectral forms; And finally, any of the skills, knowledge, and magical power the Verminlord bore in life will be yours to wield as the bearer of this terrible icon.

1120,,500,Daemon Weapon: Lord of Change ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Destruction,"“For seventeen, long centuries have I remained in this blade, confined within these metal walls. During all of my time of imprisonment you are the first I have seen who is worthy to bear me into battle. Come, take my hilt, and I will serve you in the manner of my kind, drawing blood of your enemies, protecting you in the midst of the fight, bringing you safely home again. Now, draw me from the scabbard and test the fineness of my balance. See how easily I swing, how my keen edge cleaves the air. A good choice, am I not? Willingly you picked me up. Your first mistake. Willingly you drew me. Your second mistake. I do not allow my servants to make three mistakes, foolish mortal...”

The Daemon Weapons of Chaos are perhaps the most terrible weapons in all of the world, mighty not because of the sharpness of their blades or the weight behind their strikes, but for the horrible evils that lie within it. Forged at the very heart of the Chaos Wastes by truly mad servants of the Ruinous Powers, these weapons contain within them a being feared by many - a Daemon. These weapons are no longer truly weapons, but unholy vessels, and servants of Chaos in their own right for they are always sentient in some fashion. Daemon Weapons are created with a specific warrior in mind and each one is perfectly suited to their wielder.

Each and every Daemon Weapon possesses the following traits.
● They are a beacon of unnatural energies, and most magic users not aligned with Chaos may become utterly horrified with the truly unnatural thing that they can not just see, but really feel. Mages in other universes may not react so dramatically, for they have no true connection to the weapon, but they will still have a good idea of what they are looking at and aren’t likely to overlook it.
● Daemon Weapons care not for whether their victims are even of the material realm. These weapons can do harm to virtually anything they strike, including spirits such as ghosts. The magical protections of this world are unlikely to be sufficient to stop this weapon.
● You may make use of the abilities and weapons skill of the Daemon trapped inside the weapon when you are using it. 

You may import any weapon you possess (Barring Chaos Weapons) to be the host for the Daemon, including ranged weapons if it pleases you. ​These Daemons are normally troublesome at the best of times, but as a special consideration, you will find that your God(s) have totally broken the will of the Daemon you receive, so while they may show their usual problematic traits to others if you do not step in to reign the demon in, you are safe from their treachery.

The Lord of Change is Tzeentch’s greatest Daemon servant, known for being wholly
unpredictable and truly manipulative. Many short-sighted fools have attempted to outwit
these beings, only to be crushed utterly by the incomprehensible amount of trickery
these beings are capable of. These Daemons are true masters of magic, and having
this Daemon within your weapon will result in an absolutely monstrous amount of
magical power available to you from this world, secret spells and long forgotten
techniques and rituals revealing themselves to you by the Daemon’s will. The Daemon
will also give you counsel when desired, and it’s intelligence will quickly prove to be
valuable to you.

The Daemon is often sarcastic in its dealings with you, but press it enough and it will
eventually tell you the truth about what you wish to know.

The greatest Daemon of Khorne, the colossal beasts exist only to kill in Khorne’s name. The Bloodthirster is a true master of war, able to use it’s raw strength to destroy all who oppose it in battle and can outmaneuver even the most genius of human generals. Bloodthirsters on this earth are known to be totally unstoppable, and while trapped in your weapon it will grant much of it’s martial mastery to you. Even the most inept and incompetent fool will find himself able to butcher entire elite regiments on their lonesome, and by bearing this weapon you will also be tutored by the Daemon on tactical acumen, making you a virtually unstoppable force as a commander as well as a killer.

The Lord of Change is Tzeentch’s greatest Daemon servant, known for being wholly
unpredictable and truly manipulative. Many short-sighted fools have attempted to outwit
these beings, only to be crushed utterly by the incomprehensible amount of trickery
these beings are capable of. These Daemons are true masters of magic, and having
this Daemon within your weapon will result in an absolutely monstrous amount of
magical power available to you from this world, secret spells and long forgotten
techniques and rituals revealing themselves to you by the Daemon’s will. The Daemon
will also give you counsel when desired, and it’s intelligence will quickly prove to be
valuable to you.

Nurgle’s most powerful Daemon is the Great Unclean One, who are capable of bringing everything that crosses their path into despair and rot, their presence absolutely impossible to mistake. It’s innumerable diseases permeate in the air, and anything that comes into contact with the blade is all but guaranteed to rot and decay away, perhaps before the weapon makes contact with its intended target. You will also become nearly impossible to kill through any mundane means, save for being blasted apart so strongly that there is absolutely nothing of you left.

A manifestation of both temptation and torment, the Keeper of Secrets are Daemons of Slaanesh who wholly represent Slaanesh’s two-faced nature. When they arrive, they entice the minds of all mortals who lay eyes on them with their impossible charisma, and despite their hellish appearance most cannot bear to tear their eyes away. In battle, the Daemon flows through the enemy like water, and carves them to pieces with unnatural precision. You will receive a gargantuan boost to any skill of your choice, the skill now likely unmatched by any mortal alive which is the result of the Daemon being practiced in almost any hobby and pleasurable activity. Your agility is now utterly otherworldly, a trait characterizes Slaanesh’s kind.

How incredibly unusual. A Daemon that has ties to all four of the Chaos Gods is virtually unheard of, but it seems that the Ruinous Powers are willing to give you a Daemon that has remained entirely silent...until now. This Daemon was born from the very first murder that occurred long before Sigmar had even been conceived. The Daemon has a truly immense amount of knowledge and lore it can grant you and no shortage of power, but it has been in a sort of sleep for thousands of years and as a result is not necessarily a great expert in any one area. The Daemon grants you some of the benefits of all of the Daemons above, but their effects will not be of full strength. You’ve gained the immense power of a Greater Daemon, make no mistake, but the term jack of all trades is only appropriate.

The Daemon is for the most part silent, but the process of forging it into a weapon has served to simply awaken it rather than break it. It is very curious about your otherworldly nature and desires to understand its wielder. You will find it surprisingly civil, so perhaps it did not necessarily even need breaking.
"
1122,,600,Bhaalspawn,Baldur's Gate 3,Destruction,"‘The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his doom, he shall spawn a score of mortal
progeny. Chaos will be sewn from their passage. So sayeth the wise Alaundo.’ the prophecy
goes. You are one of those progeny jumper (or you gained that divine spark some other way).
Either way, you carry the divine blood and essence of God of Murder within your body.
First of all, your abilities, skills and powers are boosted. You become better at, generally
speaking, everything. You learn skills faster, grasp intricate concepts and techniques easier and
so on. At all times you are at your best, executing each action with peerless acumen. On the
statistical side, this basically grants you bodily and mental prowess equivalent to person who
purchased All 20s all attribute boosting options, only at a half as much efficiency (making all
of your attributes around 14-15, if they aren’t greater than that).
Secondly, you have broken the limits placed on your mortal body by having a little bit
of god blood within your veins. Your growth cap is removed, meaning that all of your skills,
physical qualities, mental prowess and any abilities you possess can be trained endlessly with
no upper limit. The only limiting factor for your growth is time constraints, which are increased
as this perk also grants you an extra century of two to your lifespan, which all of that will be
spend in your prime. If you find a way to extend your unholy lifespan even further, maybe in
time you’ll be a match for gods themselves.
Finally, you gain an inborn talent and creativeness for all things related to killing and
violence. If you just a put some effort into it, you could drop the jaws of the Murder Tribunal
to floor with your pure displays of savagery. Killing is a second nature to you, being more of
an art form rather than a tool. You can use all tools and equipment for murdering purposes.
Maybe stabbing a pen through the eye? Or strangling someone with their innards perhaps?
Possibilities are endless. Oh, and you take the meaning of ‘If it bleeds, you can kill it’ saying to
its limits. If it’s possible to kill a being, you are sure to find a way to do so. And if the being
were to be truly unkillable, you may find a way to make them vulnerable just to you can kill
them again. This even extends to beings which are conceptually unkillable. This does require
quite an effort for though, and for some beings it can be damn near impossible.
Whatever you decide to with all these powers is up to your jumper. Go and slaughter
your way forth in the name of your dread father... or defy your nature and use your awesome
power in the name of greater good.
On a final note, while you are still a child of Bhaal, he has no power over you or your
blood, no more than any other god. To put you at ease, this means that he cannot just literally
explode you in a shower of gore, if you were to defy him... he could send someone with a slayer
form though, if you were to anger him too much. The only real power he has over you is
parenting rights, and even that is a big maybe."
1123,,600,"Carnwennan, the Silver Dagger",Anima Beyond Fantasy,Destruction,"A dagger born
from darkness but turned to light, this holy weapon resonates with those who desire justice, and
who possess a strong desire to destroy evil. A weapon of inhuman quality, this dagger can
strike even beings of energy, and strikes like lightning, losing only the slightest amount of
accuracy in return for increased speed, and further increasing the agility and dexterity of its
bearer. When used to surprise a foe, it’s strength is nearly doubled, and lethal wounds grow
more so. In order to facilitate such a surprise, it strengthens the bearer’s stealth when they are
inside, away from the light of the sun.
Finally, the blade is designed to deliver judgement, and will not permit any defense to
stand in it’s way: When it strikes, every defense of the target is negated for the next few
moments, and if it was thrown, it will remain within the target’s body until the next new moon,
and cannot be removed by any but it’s owner until then. So long as it remains within them, their
wounds will not heal and fate itself will grow to detest them, cursing them with ill luck."
1124,,600,Contained Artificial Disaster,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"The Supreme Teigu was a weapon capable
of laying waste to the entire Imperial Capital, however, Esdeath wielding the very
peak of the Demon’s Extract’s power became an existence capable of attacking the
very world and its lands to the point of basically being compared to a natural disaster
with a consciousness when she engulfed the whole continent in a cataclysmic ice
storm by absorbing the energy stored on her Ice Cavalry and using her third trump
card, Ice Commander in Chief. However, she wasn’t the first one attempting to use
such a power, as a former user of the same Teigu, consumed by its violent urges,
attempted to use all of their spiritual and physical energy to do the same feat but
were stopped by other Teigu users before they succeeded. Although, their power
ended up being stored within a fist-sized, crystallized orb that you managed to
acquire a long time later. This crystal, when broken, will release all of its stored
power into the atmosphere, effectively creating an artificial Russian Winter capable
of engulfing a land mass as large as a whole continent for several years, having
essentially the same effect as the Ice Commander in Chief technique but without
being restricted to the user needing to stay alive to keep it working. If used or lost,
you’ll receive a new crystal at the beginning of the next jump or a decade later,
whichever comes sooner."
1125,,600,Super Class Threat,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"Standing at the top of
the Danger Beasts, there are the most powerful and most dangerous of them, the
legendary Super Class (or Ultra Risk) Danger Beasts, each one of them possessing
notable magical abilities and holding enough power to lay waste to cities and armies
with ease. While there are hordes of countless beasts of the lower classes all around
the continent, many of the Super Class Danger Beasts were killed because of the
threat they pose, mainly in the time of the First Emperor when they were hunted to
serve as materials for the Teigu, resulting in them becoming very rare today.
However, despite their rarity, instead of being a Class 1 or 2 beasts, you’re actually
one of these legendary Super Class Danger Beasts, possessing the same
destructive power and strength each one of them have as well as having all of your
abilities as a beast being boosted to a similar degree. Additionally, like how
mentioned in the Freak Physiology perk, if you want to, you can choose a canon
species of Super Class beast to be part of, such as Death Tagool and the unnamed
Danger Beast whose fur was used to make Cross Tail's threads, however, the Tyrant
is a special case, as, even if you choose this species, you’ll gain all of the Incursio’s
Tyrant’s abilities but not his adaptability and evolutionary potential unless you also
take the perk below.

Requires Freak Physiology."
1126,,600,The Great General,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"While still not an actual Great General, you’re no
more just a mere captain of the military, but have already achieved the rank of a
general through your efforts, having a physical condition on par with the Empire’s
average general. As a talented general, you’ve also acquired an enormous
proficiency in combat, with your strength already being perfected, that is, you’ve
already developed the most efficient combat style for your body, weapons and
abilities (while being capable of quickly evolving this style as you grow stronger and
for each new ability or weapon you acquire) which allow you to use your current
power at its maximum possible effectiveness.
Additionally, instead of only focusing on enhancing yourself, you’re also aware of the
strength of your subordinates and thus you built up a considerable amount of skill in
regards to strategies and war tactics, combined with a substantial amount of
experience with warfare in the most varied scenarios, making you an actual master
strategist, one on par with the generals Najenda and Esdeath themselves. You also
possess an uncanny skill when it comes to psychological warfare as an extension of
your skill for war tactics, typically involving brutal methods, such as using torture,
public executions or mutilations in order to psychologically manipulate your enemies,
toy with their minds and break their mentalities. Furthermore, you’re also skilled in
leading your troops effectively even in the middle of the battles, in motivating them to
fight with a calm but still burning heart and in training them to help them perfect their
own strength in the same way as you did."
1127,,600,The Elite Eight,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"As rebellions began to rise due to the Empire’s increasing
corruption and the need to quell these rebellions became vital to its survival, the
country began to form elite assassination squads. The Empire acquired an estimated
100 children to take part in a cruel exam in which the participants were dropped into
a forest full of Danger Beasts and challenged to survive. The first and strongest
seven survivors were then recruited into a special group known as the Elite Seven to
be led and personally trained by Gozuki, a former member of the Rakshasa Demons,
for nearly a decade while the remaining survivors joined another squad, the Group of
Terror. Normally, Gozuki would have limited his elite team to only seven members,
however, he changed his mind and decided to accept an eighth apprentice, you.
As a result of your rigorous training regiment under Gozuki, possibly combined with
the training under other powerful warriors to complement your development, you’ve
become one of the Empire's most deadliest assassins, one on par with Akame
herself, having been raised to be a human weapon. You possess several
superhuman level physical attributes such as superhuman strength, speed, reflexes,
senses and durability, with your agility and reflex being enough to allow you to run at
Mach 1, with your other physical traits being around the same degree. In addition to
being already an expert when it comes to hand-to-hand combat, you also have been
trained to be a fearsome warrior when it comes to the utilization of a single kind of
weapon to the point that, if you choose the sword as your speciality, you would
match the skill of master swordsmans for example. As a last bonus, like the other
members of the now disbanded Elite Seven (or Elite Eight), you’ve also built up
resistance or even immunity in some cases to most mundane poisons."
1128,,600,Apex Predator,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"You truly are a born slaughterer, a true monster of human
origin (or even a monster among monsters if you’re actually a Danger Beast instead
of being human) whose physical attributes are greatly superior to that of a regular
human even without some special training to attain such condition. Regardless if this
monstrous power is a result of the life you had changing you or due to you naturally
having an unique freak physiology, you possess several superhuman level physical
attributes, all of them on par with Akame and the other members of the Elite Seven.
Furthermore, your monstrous nature also grants you a secondary benefit unrelated
to your enhanced physical condition, you possess a domineering primal/animalistic
charisma, one comparable to the charisma of the ice commander herself.
Your great charisma, combined with treating others well or with satisfying their goals
and/or desires, is capable of inspiring many, mainly those that would already have
similarly monstrous nature, to fight for you with a degree of loyalty and determination
that could even be considered almost unnatural, with the most loyal among your
servants and allies even considering you a divine figure.
Now, as if the world itself recognized you as a threat of the highest caliber, you’ll be
treated by fate itself as the “Final Boss” and it’ll treat you accordingly. What does this
mean? As the “Final Boss”, you possess a “contractual boss immunity”, a peculiar
type of narrative plot armor/advantage that makes it considerably harder to kill you
through cheap means and similar fancy tricks, such as instant-death attacks, making
them fail completely at all or only slowing down their effects to give you a chance to
overcome them.
For example, instant death spells, like the Grasp Heart spell from Overlord, would
always fail due to some coincidence or would be unable to target at all. Another
example is, if you were to be hit by Murasame, instead of dying in a few instants, the
curse would be slowed in order to give you enough time to deal with it by finding a
way to remove it, like by cutting off the affected area, to avoid getting killed by it.
In other words, a more decisive blow will be required to put you down, like facing you
in an actual combat instead of relying on some cheap trick that normally would
ensure an easy victory for them."
1129,,600,Autonomous Teigu,Akame ga Kill!,Destruction,"You may look like a human or a Danger Beast,
however, you aren’t a common being and were never one to begin with, as, in truth,
you’re an Organism Type Teigu, an Imperial Arm that was created a millenia ago
during the reign of the First Emperor, but, unlike any other of your kind, you
eventually managed to acquire free will and become fully autonomous.
For all intents and purposes, you’ll still count as a living being despite your status as
a sapient Teigu, to the point of even requiring sustenance and having your own
reserve of spiritual energy - that, by extension, also removes the Organism types’
need of having a master to be able to move. However, your nature as a legendary
living weapon also brings you three main benefits over most natural living beings.
First of all, as an artificial being, you’re completely immune to the effects of mundane
poisons, toxins and biological pathogens that could easily kill ordinary warriors.
Second, as a Biological Teigu, you’ll have a core located somewhere in your body
that, as long as it remains intact, you’ll be able to keep regenerating from almost
every damage you suffer, capable of even regenerating entire limbs in mere
seconds.
Last but not least, you’re still a completely new 49th Teigu and, as such, you’ll be
able to use the Teigu Builder Supplement to customize your new form and abilities
instead of using it to create and customize a separate Imperial Arm. As you’ll be the
Teigu in this case, you must take the Organism type and you’ll receive the Sapient
special feature for free. Post-jump, your Teigu form may become an alt-form if you
prefer."
1130,,600,Damage Focused,Overlord,Destruction,"Your skills are virtually unmatched when it comes to the slaying of others. You could casually defeat entire armies of men and beasts without even batting an eyelash with nothing but your strength of arm and talent with a blade. Your special abilities are even more powerful, and additionally you may now deal wounds that prevent both natural and magical methods of healing, as well as forcing weaknesses in creatures and enemies that do not normally have them. You’ll also possess the ability to strike at range, well outside of melee, through either air pressure or the simple force of your martial prowess (your choice). Finally you will have unlocked the most devastating of all direct damage abilities. The Super-Move, Dimensional Slash (or pierce/smash). With this technique you will be able to, several times per day, deliver strikes so devastating that they travel across dimensions, bypassing virtually every single defensive measure known. Armor fails, toughness fails, magic fails. Only pure skill and dodging will save your foes from this technique and with this ability before you virtually anything can be killed. Pointedly it does not prevent foes from being resurrected. A damage focused warrior benefits tremendously from also training in defense focus, as their increased knowledge and skill in defensive ability serves only to heighten their knowledge at exploiting the defenses of others."
1131,,600,Legend,Worm CYOA v17,Destruction,"Your very being is entwined with energy on fundamental levels. You can fire blasts of light whose properties and effects are within your control. Forking or homing lasers, freeze beams, disintegrating spheres that orbit around you in a pattern. All of these and more are within your capabilities. At their strongest, a single one of these can destroy a skyscraper easily. You can fire a dozen blasts at once and coordinating such barrages is trivial for you.

You are also able to fly, reaching the speed of light in an instant. Your mind will automatically compensate for relativistic time dilation by slowing down or speeding up.

You are able to switch back and forth between a breaker state that removes all physical needs, and quickly restores you to perfect physical condition. In this state, most attacks are simply absorbed, with only the strongest able to put you down before the damage is gone. Your vision is perfect, encompasses the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and no longer degrades with distance."
1132,,600,Avatar of Rot,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Destruction,"The Scarlet Rot, a devastating infection created by an Outer God, spread through the
Lands Between with the power to fell even gods. Indeed, you exceed even Malenia with your talent. Infected with the Scarlet Rot, you have gained the
ability to control and weaponize it. You can unleash the rot to infect and weaken your
enemies, dramatically enhance your physical capabilities, and lay waste to entire
regions. Your mastery of the Scarlet Rot makes you a terrifying foe even for superior
opponents. Though you can also restrain or remove the infection if you wish to contain
it. This perk enhances your capability with Rot in every way and to such a degree that even Caelid is but a tame microcosm of the devestation you could wreak.

Requires Scarlet Blossom to purchase."
1133,,600,Testament User,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"When you’re just that salty, you might as well doom the entire planet after failing. Testament is a
simple Style, perhaps inspired after a bit too much cartoon watching. When activated, it drops any
orbiting moons around the current planet you are on towards the planet itself. You’ll be mostly
assured of this cruel world’s destruction, unless someone literally destroys everything you’ve
dropped towards the world. You can also set for this to activate automatically on your death. Just to
be sure, you know?"
1134,,600,Scar Dead,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"Scars never disappear forever. You’re living proof. You’re able to instantly re-open any wound
someone you can see has ever suffered, whether physical or even mental, and force it open as many
times as you want even if that person heals once more. This power is quite indiscriminate when you
want it to be, even able to open wounds and injuries suffered by objects, even if those ‘wounds’ were things like a sword being beaten into shape by a hammer while being forged. It also bypasses
any defences against anything less than supernatural powers in general, not counting as an attack
against defences against such things. "
1135,,600,Spinning Angler,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"All that rotates now does so at your command. Well, as long as it’s not bigger than the Earth. You’re
able to manipulate the rotation of the planet and anything smaller than that or yourself that you are
currently in contact with, even when that rotation would not be physically possible normally. You
can rotate someone’s waist to tear their body in half or speed up the rotation of the Earth until
everyone on Earth is killed or flung into the air. "
1136,,600,All-Killing Ash Bones,Naruto,Destruction,"One of Kaguya’s signature abilities, the All-Killing Ash Bones are a fearsome weapon truly deserving of their status as a certain-kill technique. The user is capable of extruding ultra-hard bones from their body and using them as melee weapons or firing them as projectiles. When these bones pierce a living organism, the bone and the target both start to deteriorate, quickly disintegrating them and leaving their bodies as nothing more than ash. You'll find these bones are preternaturally sharp, able to penetrate beings who'd normally need nothing short of a planet-buster to harm them."
1137,,600,Dust Release,Naruto,Destruction,"Almost every combined nature
transformation is classified as a kekkei genkai, but Dust Release is an exception to
this rule, being classified as a kekkei tōta instead. You’re one of the users of this very
rare natural transformation, being a combination of three different nature
transformations (Earth, Fire and Wind Release) and, unlike other combined nature
transformations, it isn’t exactly genetic in nature but instead requires a very powerful
innate affinity with these three elements. Dust Release allows the user to create
three-dimensional objects made of their chakra and, once released by them, the
construct expands and moves astonishingly fast at its target.
Anything that passes through it (or that is passed through by it) is turned into dust,
being literally disintegrated on a molecular level. This isn’t limited to affecting just
physical matter, as it’s also able to affect chakra constructs. Despite the sheer
destructiveness of Dust Release, it still has three main weaknesses. Dust Release
techniques require a certain time to prepare, making it possible to prematurely halt
the technique before it is completed, and the hands also play a crucial role in the
preparation, so interfering with the user's arms can hinder the technique. Its
techniques also consume a lot of chakra, with bigger and/or more complex
constructs requiring yet more chakra to be used."
1138,,600,Harpe,Greek Mythology,Destruction,"A sword with a sickle protrusion along one edge near the tip of the blade, made
of a divine material that resembles diamond. A dangerous and feared weapon that was used to
castrate and depose Uranus, a primordial god, as well as kill and behead the gorgon Medusa.
This blade has the power to slay an immortal without risking the destruction that would come
from their death instead everything will continue as it naturally would."
1139,,600,Typhon,Greek Mythology,Destruction,"Born from Gaia and Tartarus, Typhon was a monster and titan who was born
with the sole purpose to destroy and defeat the gods of Olympus. You can produce a fire hot
enough to burn an immortal, with the ambient heat being enough to scorch the earth and boil the
oceans. You also possess strength enough to lift and throw mountains. The strongest ability you
hold is being a bane of immortals for in your presence; they are just as vulnerable to death as
anyone else.

Requires Mortal Monsters to purchase."
1140,,600,Sviga Lævi,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Destruction,"Scathe of branches, bringer of fire. The bright sword. Within  your hands is a world breaker, a sword more terrifying than any single other weapon within this jump. For you hold the very sun of the gods and the dead. An unbreakable and immutable blade of fire, light, metal, and hatred brought forth to burn down and cleanse worlds. No being can touch this blade, and most can not even approach it, without your discretion. You and those you designate can be granted a reprieve from this blinding blade, but others will face the full fury of the sun itself.  This blade can strengthen and empower any gifts of fire, light, the sun, metal, burning hells, infernal power , wrath  and other such abilities by an order of magnitude. It acts as a lodestone and eternal furnace for such forces while other powers of a similar nature or in opposition, such as cold and darkness, equally shrink against the torrent and fury of this sword. This may be a blade of any style or make you so desire, and while it may be unbearably heavy, it will always be comfortable within your hands. "
1141,,600,Soukyoku,Bleach,Destruction,"A replica of the halberd of execution, the tool used by the Shinigami to absolutely annihilate the
souls of their worst criminals. At least, the ones that have no further use to Soul Society. The Halberd
is vast, many times taller than a man, and normally bound by powerful Kido seals. Released from
these bindings at your command, the halberd transforms into a vast and fiery phoenix. Intent only
on a single victim with each summoning, it’s flames possess the power of a million Zanpakuto
already and it’s beak ten times that when piercing the intended criminal. Even accounting for
ordinary Zanpakuto in this multiplication, the firebird has more than enough power to vaporise even
a veteran Captain with ease. However, this immense power is only effective against the target it was
released against, even single Captain could block the phoenix’s beak with their sealed sword, albeit
with some difficulty. After completing it’s task, and it will chase down it’s target over great distances, the halberd will bind itself again for a time to rest."
1142,,600,Hollow Scythe,Bleach,Destruction,"Formerly a parasitic hollow that was broken, dominated, and transformed, this scythe acts as a
conduit for its wielder’s power and possesses the constitution of a powerful Hollow with its own, unique abilities. It appears twisted and white, with a doubled sided, red blade. Its first ability is
simply the manifestation energy charged rifts made by slashing the air, which expel massive waves
of destructive power. The scythe’s true worth however stems from its ability of ‘memory erasure.’ The scythe is able to seamlessly slide through anyone and anything (with the exception of spirit
energy infused objects like Zanpaktou) and in the process, erase memories possessed by the target. The wielder can selectively erase some or all of the a target’s memories, with anyone that memory is
connected too also suffering its effects. Erase one’s memory of their identity, and all who knew them, and all records of them, will also be erased. "
1143,,600,Stagger,Final Fantasy XIII,Destruction,"By continuously attacking a single enemy, you can build a chain. When the chain reaches a certain value, the enemy is staggered. Staggered enemies are twice as susceptible to attack – and you may launch them into the air regardless of size.

Once you take this, it applies to you and all allies."
1144,,600,“Die.”,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Destruction,"You are an Angel of Death. With just a small expenditure of Faith, when you kill something it stays dead. If you destroy a soul, it cannot return. If you snuff a spirit, it does not reform. If you slay a God, they remain fallen. People die when they are killed. With this, you can break lines of reincarnation, and no amount of magic or divine might can resurrect those you have deemed unworthy of life."
1145,,600,Fragarach,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Destruction,"A magic given by the gods, passed down from generation to generation. If mastered and used properly, it allows one to take their opponent’s attack and fire an equally powerful attack back at them. However, it’s real power comes from the fact that its counter attack reverses the order of attacks, namely its counter attack strikes first in “time” while the OG attack comes second."
1146,,600,Yorokobe Shounen!,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Destruction,"Rejoice! As a dedicated servant of the Lord, you have been blessed with a unique soul. Any martial arts you use can now harm and/or affect incorporeal beings (souls, ghosts, even Servants). This doesn’t grant you any extra strength towards them, rather it just means your attacks will connect just like they otherwise would with corporeal beings.

Boosted: Incorporeal beings are your playthings. Your very touch can harm them (much like sunlight affects a vampire). You can imbue anything you are using (items, powers, etc.) with holy energy capable of killing any minor “evils” or demonic entities and severely wounding greater ones. In fact, all of your “stats” are boosted against incorporeal beings, so much so that you could throw down with someone like Beowulf, Saint Martha, or Cu and potentially come out on top. It of course requires some fighting skills or other powers; this perk only gives you the potential to fight on their level.

1147,,600,Magicite Boom,Final Fantasy XII,Destruction,"With a snap of your finger, magicite within twenty meters detonates, spreading sharp shards everywhere. The magicite infects those who are wounded in the explosion. The infected are afflicted with a severe poison that calcifies their joints. We’ve had trouble curing this – and amputation has been the most common solution thus far. It also has a nasty tendency to interfere with mages and their spellcasting."
1148,,600,Bonds Beyond Even The Stars ,Black★Rock Shooter,Destruction,"“The tiny bird flies in the blue sky. The sea reflects the blue of the sky. The blue reflection is the
sea of the sky. The sea of the sky cries blue tears. Among those blue tears, the tiny bird flies.”

The friendships you forge are simply unbreakable, and made of gold, never losing its luster and shine. Nothing can tear you apart when the bonds are made, not insanity, not deception, not curses, not amnesia, not accidents, not even time itself can stop these bonds from shattering.

You know, deep in your heart who your friends are and they too know you, the greater the connection with your friends the more you’ll both be able to respond to each other’s desires and make each other happy. When fighting for your friends or your friends fighting for you or hell, anyone else that could be considered close to you, your power rises considerably, rising to meet the threats that seek to end you or your loved one’s lives.

But sometimes that is not enough when all of the chips are down, an opponent or force is just too strong, too unbelievably unfair in its strength that there is nothing you can do but just die
with your pitiful friends… 

Look them in the face and say ‘fuck that!’

Once per year you can pull upon the connections between you and your friends to empower one of blows to impossible heights. This attack cannot be dodged, it cannot be blocked, or maneuvered against and it will destroy them in one hit, nor it can be stopped when you decide to begin this attack, you taking all of their hits like it's nothing in the process. If you wish, this attack can have a wide area of effect if you’re looking to destroy more than just one opponent and is pretty freeform in its variety of secondary effects you can place on them, amplifying the attack you were going to use as something more. This attack will also usually have a rainbow aesthetic to it.

This attack however, can only be pulled off if this threat is also seeking to destroy or otherwise harm your friends alongside you, though said friends don’t need to be right next to you to pull this attack off either.

If you wish for your friendships to be able to fade or just not feel the emotions of your friends, you can toggle those portions of the perk off."
1149,,600,Spear of Lugh,Irish Mythology,Destruction,"One of the Four Treasures the Tuatha de Danann brought over from their four shining cities. Named for Lugh, the sun god who would be its most famous user. The burning spear of yew must be kept in a barrel of alcohol when not in use, to restrain its awesome bloodlust. When cast with a cry of “Ibar!” the spear strikes like lightning and never misses, bowling over entire ranks with the force of its flight. The spear then fights and seeks targets on its own, and returns only reluctantly to its master's hand when he cries “Athibar!”"
1150,,600,Claíomh Solais,Irish Mythology,Destruction,"One of the Four Treasures the Tuatha de Danann brought over from their four shining cities. This sword blazes with light, allowing one to see in the dark, and carves stone and metal with ease. More than a mythic lightsaber though, the sword is enchanted so once drawn, no enemy may flee from you before it is returned to its sheath. Very handy, that."
1151,,600,The Fury's Despair,Slay the Princess,Destruction,"A thing stripped bare of all flesh to expose the raw muscle and bone, an engine of wrath and ruin - that is what you have become now. A thing that is only made of pain and sinew and who only seeks to do the same to everything else. There is power here, but it is power made of pain and hate and spite. Spite for the world, spite for everything that lives and who has denied you your deepest desires. And that spite has become a power all its own - seeping into the world itself, turning the land into twisted paths of wet and dripping nerves, festering mounds of still-living meat sprouting out of the ground and dotting the landscape, still warm blood bubbling out of cracks in the ground and sticking to your feet. Your despair and pain has become something that reaches out to mold reality like clay to reflect your defilement.

But that is not all, for your power can manifest itself in a more direct manner as well. With but a thought and a modicum of will, you can ‘unwind’ a person - quite literally stripping them away until all that's left is nothing but raw exposed nerves, bones, and muscles. You can put them back together as well. And then do it again. And again. And again. And again. And again. Forever."
1152,,600,Store Damage,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"The Samurai are masters of burst damage generating massive amounts of harm to their foes with powerful strikes and skills, you however can take this to an entirely new level. You can set aside a portion of the damage you do to a creature or being, storing it in your blade for later use, then when the time is right you may release the built up energy all at once in one awe inspiring strike. Doing so tends to generate quite a bit of light and more than a small amount of flames. If you wish you can actually ""throw"" this burst of energy at a target, though it won't be quite as powerful as if it were used from your blade. This can be used with all melee weapons."
1153,,600,More Fists ,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"The use of chakra by monks has many more uses other than just defense, often times a monk will use his chakra in concert with his punches to unleash devastating blows. By infusing your fists with chakra you can actually multiply the amount of blows you land on your enemy as if you had extra fists, the more chakra you infuse into your fists the more this damage multiplies up to 5 hits for every punch you land. Whoever said one hundred fists are enough obviously had no idea what they were talking about."
1154,,600,Furious Storm,Final Fantasy XI,Destruction,"Sometimes defeating your enemy is not enough, sometimes you are out numbered and your skill alone are inadequate. In those times you know how to really cut loose. Once a day for up to an hour you can activate a sort of rage mode where for every enemy you kill your strength and speed increases making you like unto an unstoppable flurry of death. This added power disappears after it ends however but with any luck your foes wont be around to see it."
1155,,600,Scales of Death,Dies Irae,Destruction,"There is an undeniable connection between you and all that you have wrought. This connection binds their lives to that of your own, ensuring that so long as you wished for them to do so, they would die or be destroyed when you are. Everything you have made, everything you rule over without dispute and everything you are in full control will be affected by this, coming to an end if you wish them to once you yourself have died. This ability has also made you become aware of how to prevent such things from happenings due to the deaths of others, be it because of a supernatural link or something entirely more mundane, such as mere biology."
1156,,600,The Holy Collection,Dies Irae,Destruction,"Very few are capable of touching the Lance of Longinus and surviving. Only two men at this time are great enough to truly wield it. The reason for this is that the Lance seeks to protect itself from outsiders, burning away at the body, mind and soul of any who touch it without permission. Only those of earth shattering power can bypass this without being the true owner of the Lance. Now they’ll need the same permission to touch anything that you own. So long as it is a possession of yours, you are able to extend this same three target ward to any object you possess. Any who touch your weapons, armour, accessories, clothes or even idle trinkets or money without permission will find their bodies rotting, their minds shattering and their souls burning away, quickly enough to kill in just seconds for most or even less for those truly weak compared to you. Those near or equal to your power will still be harmed but it would take a few minutes of contact for them to be severely harmed. Those far above you will be unfortunately largely unaffected, at least until you become stronger. You can choose to disable this effect for specific objects, specific people or overall as you please."
1157,,600,Bow of Kronos ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Destruction,"This appears to be a plain, but finely made pure white longbow. And in the hands of an ordinary individual that is all it is. But in the hands of one who has conquered fear, or since you’re paying CP you even if you have not, it becomes a potent weapon of magical power. No longer does it need arrows to fire, but when you pull back the string, energy forms across the bow, materializing arrows of light.

These arrows of light seem to not only penetrate the targets but discharge energy through them on a hit, and are able to split apart into half a dozen bolts to fire at many different enemies, to swerve and move to correct their aim if an enemy moves from you or you simply didn’t have proper angle to fire straight on, to pass through solid objects to strike your foes, and fly far further than an ordinary arrow should as gravity and air resistance affects them less. Now this is not to say they can shoot an infinite distance, they will eventually lose coherence but they can travel several times further than an arrow first, nor that you do not need to be able to aim because they will swerve and correct, their ability to accurately correct their course seems to be dependent upon your own accuracy with the bow and their force and power upon how much of a pull weight you can handle. Also these magical bolts of light seem to be highly effective against supernatural creatures and entities of darkness.

Finally as its master, by raising your hand you are able to call this bow to you. Its approach is relatively slow, and it won’t teleport or pass through objects, but it will float back to your hand at a rate of maybe 6 miles per hour."
1158,,600,Sorcerer Slayer,80s Sword and Sorcery,Destruction,"The more you play into the archetype of a traditional warrior and martial champion, the more potent you seem to become against magic and other supernatural, paranormal, or even super science forces. You are able to penetrate supernatural and ‘hax’ protections far easier than should be possible, and you will find yourself highly resistant to magic the more in keeping with the warrior archetype you are; spells that would kill a normal man might see you merely inflicted with pain, or those that might bind one paralyzed you could overcome with effort. You can even apply raw physical strength and skill at arms to combat sorcery and other paranormal forces directly which would normally warp or outright rewrite the laws of physics: bending bars of arcane force with the strength of your arms, or pushing through a barrier that prevents all entry through sheer, physical power.

The more esoteric your own powers and further from the archetype of warrior the less potent this anti-magical property will become; wielding a magic sword that cuts through steel or Herculean strength would do little if anything to weaken this, and likely would even be necessary to overcome stronger magical forces, but firing giant laser blasts from your sword would see a drastic reduction in benefit at least for how well they penetrate such defenses, and you will see little or no benefit when attempting to weaponize concepts through metaphysical manipulation. Though be warned even as a purely mundane warrior who lives and breathes the tropes of the archetype this will never quite reach total immunity, but as long as you play into the role magic, absolute effects, and so-called hax will always be less than perfect against you. This also applies less against things such as magical swords or energy blasts, than against more ‘hax’ magical effects such as transformation magic or instant death spells."
1159,,600,Jumper-Jin,The God of High School Jump,Destruction,"No longer are you a relative beginner in the martial arts. With the purchase of this, you have become one of the strongest beings on Earth. Your skill with any Martial Arts or National Treasures that you have bought is on the level of a member of The Six, humans second only to Taejin Jin in power and skill. Your physical form as undertaken a similar boost in might, with all your physical attributes raised to absurdly superhuman levels. You could survive being punched from Seoul to Beijing, run back in a few minutes and then punch your attacker two hundred kilometres away, embedding them halfway into a mountain. You are not yet on the level of the High Gods but you’re closer than all but a dozen or two people in all the universe.

Boosted: So long has Humanity suffered under the yoke of the Gods. It is only recently that men and women capable of making a push for freedom have appeared. Men and women as mighty as yourself. That insatiable drive for freedom, or just revenge, against the Gods has granted you special powers against Divine beings. Your blows strike far harder against them, piercing through all but the greatest defenses that Divine beings can muster. And their counter attacks against you are dulled, reduced to a tenth of their full force. The Taboo still applies to you but the Gods will find it of little use.

1160,,600,Denying Ascension,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Destruction,"The Ever After has its own rules on life and death... and the Jabberwalker is the most dreaded being in the land because of that. Being devoured by it can deny someone ascension, killing them for real. This is a quality you too share now, though not exactly. Anything you kill you can deny the ability to resurrect."
1161,,600,Terror of Zanarkand,Final Fantasy X,Destruction,"A Guardian with no Summoner is no different from a soldier with no Lord. There is no Pilgrimage without the Summoner, and should the Summoner fall while the Guardian remains, that is nothing if not a sign of the Guardian’s failings. If the individual that you’ve designated as your Summoner passes away for any reason, for as long as your energy remains, you’ll enter into a berserk state – your only purpose being to destroy any enemy that remains.

The power and range your attacks are doubled and a substantial portion of your attacks will ignore the presence of barriers entirely. In this state concepts such as pain and recoil are unknown to you – but this enraged state will not dissipate, not even as your energy is depleted and your life force is steadily drained in place. Should all your enemies fall, you’ll seek others nearby – nothing will be spared of your wrath until you come within inches away from death, hanging on with nothing but willpower. Then, and only then, will you be liberated from the madness that overtakes you.

The longer your rampage continues for, the less effective spells are upon you regardless of whether they are beneficial or not – your common sense and awareness of the world will steadily drain as well. The only sense that will remain by the end is a distinct awareness of where the closest enemy lays."
1162,,600,Jecht Shot EX,Final Fantasy X,Destruction,"Most people play Blitzball within the dome – but there’s no reason why kicking a ball around can’t be taken outside of the dome. Granted, with the sheer force that some Blitzball players possess, their kicks might as well count as a lethal weapon. With but a bit of magic, even if you don’t have a Blitzball available, you can conjure one to kick at an enemy.

It turns out that air is a lot less resistant than water, so don’t be too surprised when the enemy is sent flying meters away from the sheer force of the shot. It’ll easily shatter barriers and armour from the force of the impact alone and drive them back, regardless of the target’s size.

If you can catch the rebound in time...you can fire another volley as well, though each successive rebound will be harder and harder to return, until it becomes outright impossible."
1163,,600,Mad Dog,Chainsaw Man,Destruction,"You’re at retiring age despite your occupation, a sign of your resolve and strength. You are strong enough to casually wrestle mid-tier devils and shatter their necks with ease, fast and quick-thinking enough to counter an ambush from several of those devils before they know what happened, and durable enough to be thrown off a high building onto a car and continue fighting right afterwards. You have an additional free purchase of Extra Contracts which doesn’t count towards its max limit (meaning you can have four total). You are a master of practical, lethal knifemanship (or similar killing art if you wish) and hand-to-hand combat. You seemingly have 360 degree vision and fantastic situational and spacial awareness. Your body and abilities seemingly adapt to any situation they’re in so even if you were missing a leg, an arm, and half your organs you’d still be at only 80% of your overall effectiveness. Your pain tolerance is enough to shrug off being in this state, too."
1164,,600,Holy Sacraments,Fate/Stay Night,Destruction,"The Sacraments are gifts from God to his most favoured servants. At first. The Church has long since deciphered the method to apply these incredibly blessings to its most elite agents and you were one such being. Or you just stole the process. Your body has been greatly enhanced by the process, giving you the strength to smash thick trees in half with a single punch, enough speed to outpace any modern race car and durability such that small calibre firearms would be lucky to bruise your skin. Your body also carries an innate holy enchantment, making every unarmed blow you deal like one dealt by a weapon blessed with holy power, exceptionally deadly against the creatures of the night. Finally, your resistance to the corrupting nature and powers of evil beings, artefacts and lands has been greatly increased. It would take a notably strong demon or evil spirit to break through this initial defence. 

Boosted: Holy Sacraments now improves the holy enchantments so that it is no longer limited to just your body. Instead you exude a constant aura of holy energy around you. This allows you to bless water or weapons with nothing more than a touch and to harm demons or other unholy beings with just your presence, though only the weakest will die solely from this. With focus, you can concentrate this aura into a single point to deal much greater damage to an unholy opponent but this act will temporarily rob you of the passive aura till it replenishes.

1165,,600,Snake,Fate/Stay Night,Destruction,"The Snake was the personal martial art of one Souichirou Kuzuki, an art that was impossible to predict the first few attacks from, even from those with supernatural instincts and decades of combat experience, though it dropped severely in effect after those first attacks against experienced fighters. Perhaps you are another student of this martial form or maybe you have your own pseudo- supernatural martial art. One that becomes deadlier the more tired you are? Perhaps you can use wires to slice through stone or steel with a flick of your wrist? Whichever you choose, the rigorous training has brought both your body and your mind to the peak of human ability. Your physical strength, agility, endurance and so on are all enough to compete with Olympic athletes that specialise in any of those alone whilst your mental capabilities let you multitask over a half dozen actions at once, along with placing you on the level of men like Hawking or Einstein in terms of intelligence. Additional Martial Arts as described above may be purchased for a further 200cp each, though this has no other effect and cannot be stacked on one Art. 

Boosted: Snake's natural physical and mental boosts have gone to superhuman levels. You are strong enough to punch through brick walls, fast enough to keep up with even the faster production cars for short periods, tough enough that most small calibre bullets will be like paintballs and blades find you to be like thick leather to cut through. Your mind processes information faster than any human and though it'd take all your focus, you could potentially catch bullets by combining this mental speed and your physical speed. The martial art you chose has also progressed to actual supernatural levels. The martial art that became more deadly as you got tired now actually increases your strength and speed as you tire whilst the original Snake martial art would now make any move far harder to predict, rather than simply the first encounter. Consider it the equivalent of a Servant with E rank in all physical stats. Additional Martial Arts beyond the first one that have been bought with the base perk may be upgraded to capstone boosted level for 100cp extra per Art.

Your skill is legendary and aspiring Hunters all over the World want to be just like you. Your experience in combat is vast, several decades so. This boost to experience translates to all your combat related skills post Jump, even upon acquiring a new Perk."
1167,,600,Angel Wings,Final Fantasy VIII,Destruction,"While you receive no extra ability to use magic, you can now enter a berserk state at will that amplifies your magic power by several times its usual strength and prevents any drain of your spell stocks or greatly reduces any cost in mana at the price of your sanity and logic. While you won't target your friends, you'll wildly attack any enemy almost at random, paying no heed for obstacles or collateral damage. Choosing from the spells you know at random, you'll still tend towards the offensive and the devastating over all else. This state will last until you're incapacitated or the foes have been killed, and nothing that impedes your thought process, mind, or ability to cast magic will have an effect on you for you're already mad and the magic coursing through your body refuses to stay silent."
1168,,600,Denying the Heavens: A Bullet for God,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction,"The Avesta, the war between Good and Evil and the Commandments. Why would you have to follow all of these rules? Well, you have something to set your own rules when it comes to fighting, at least. In exchange for sealing the usage of any special powers in battle, you become able to negate them for your enemies as well. Immortal monsters suddenly feel that they have trouble closing their wounds when you produce them, supposedly undodgeable attacks that twist space become something that you can move around, and even abilities designed to track you have a hard time pinpointing your location.

The major downside from this ability, besides not being able to use any powers while it is active, it’s that it is only at its maximum strength when you are dueling someone. In group battles, the effectiveness of this will be severely reduced, to the point that your foes will notice that their powers aren’t working correctly, but they won’t be completely gone. Hope you have something to compensate for that. And don’t try to take on things that are too far beyond your scale with just this, a mortal man wouldn’t do well against a black hole."
1169,,600,Beast of the End,Fate/Grand Order,Destruction,"Vindictive little thing, aren’t you? Not enough to just verbally curse your opponent, you need them to really suffer for daring to rise against you. When you suffer a defeat of some kind at the hand of another being, you inflict an equal amount of misfortune back at them some time later on. A man who defeats you in battle would be faced against a more powerful opponent then you in hopes of suffering a defeat, while a girl who steals something important from you would have a master thief try to take something important from them. It is not impossible to defeat these curses but they will become harder and harder to avoid as you become stronger.

Boosted: The Beasts do not fight alone. Not in the end. The defeat of the first Beast is just the signal for the next to put their own plans in motion. Humanity must face their Beasts 7 times over to finally be free and the same will apply to any who dare to defeat you. Instead of suffering a single equal curse, they will now suffer back 7 of increasing potency. The first will be equal to the normal curse but each one after will increase the misfortune by a little, ending with a curse at least thrice as bad as the original. As with the original curse, these are not unbeatable or unavoidable but the chance of either will lessen as your power grows.

1170,,600,A Potential Color,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Destruction,"The City from the outside might seem like people have their fate decided by birth, Nest-born end up as corporate workers or are thrown into the Backstreets, the desperate in the Backstreets end up as Fixers or in Syndicates, and everyone is just trying to make sure they have a future ahead of them. The Colors often prove this wrong, a crying child surrounded by violence in District 23 became a legend, a smoke war veteran with good connections got thrown down to the bottom, and the man sent to kill the Pianist could later cause an event magnitudes worse.

You might just have what it takes to be among their ranks, with combat skills and instincts far outclassing nearly anyone in the City, and an aptitude with a weapon(or weapons) that would be unusable to anyone else. What truly makes a Color is their motivation, and your’s is something that can never be clouded, regardless of what is affecting your mind, your primary motive is always going to shine through and guide you forward."
1171,,600,Rot Acceptance,Bibliomania,Destruction,"You're an odd one aren’t you. You have by chance or planning managed to not only figure out a way to fully accept any negatively affecting maladies, cures, poison or other negative conditions you may encounter, you have managed to make it a part of you and weaponise it. What this does is that when you encounter something trying to negatively affect you you will be fully aware of it and its effects and buy choice you can accept it which will take a bit of time, normally hours(which is shortened to within seconds if you have Rot Acceptance and Rot Resistance) in which you will endure whatever is affecting you and integrate it into yourself giving you total resistance to the integrated effect. Once it's fully integrated it's added to a mental archive of effects you have accepted and from then on you can now freely express any and all effects of them and even weaponise them to add their effects to any attract or actions you may perform at no extra cost and without harming yourself. Initially you will have just this world's Rot already fully accepted and as such can freely affect yourself and others with it. It should be noted that the potency of an effect is dependent on the effects natural potency, your personal strength and how you apply it."
1172,,600,Split Soul Katana,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"One of the strongest cursed tools, the Split Soul Katana is a rather unassuming single-edged blade, with the white fur upon its guard being its only real distinguishing quality. The blade’s unique property is that it ignores the physical toughness of any substance it strikes in order to directly cut the soul. While its said to be strongest in the hands of those who can see the souls of inorganic matter, such as those with zero cursed energy, its power is incredible regardless. The bodies of even the toughest cursed spirits would be like paper before it, and the damage to the soul will make it much more difficult to recover from their injuries than normal."
1173,,600,Shrine,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction,"Shrine is the Cursed Technique of Ryōmen Sukuna: the ability to sever and slice nearly anything, as long as you have the necessary CE output for it. With this ability, Sukuna was capable of shredding entire city blocks to dust, while a single activation could slice skyscrapers in half, its scythes capable of cutting at the world itself, bypassing all but the most esoteric defenses. With this ability, you gain three avenues of attack: Dismantle, capable of being launched at any range, as well as Cleave, a stronger attack that adjusts based on the durability, but requires physical contact unless your target is within your Domain Expansion. Finally, Fūga, an extraordinarily potent attack, but with limited range and slow speed, though Sukuna's Binding Vow turned it into his trump card."
1174,,600,Inverted Spear of Heaven ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"Despite what its name like imply, this special grade cursed tool takes the form of a dagger with an unusual, two-pronged blade. Imbued with an unusually potent cursed technique, it has the ability to nullify any cursed technique its blade comes into contact with. No matter how powerful it is, the technique will be forcibly ended and suppressed the moment the blade comes into contact with its cursed energy. It doesn’t hurt that the actual dagger portion of the blade is perfectly functional despite its odd shape, cutting through flesh and cursed energy with equal ease."
1175,,600,Cursed Energy Discharge ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"Perhaps the simplest of all cursed techniques, you’re able to fire off beams of raw, concentrated cursed energy. What this lacks in versatility though, it more than makes up for in power, possessing the greatest output of all cursed techniques. At its most powerful, you can unleash a wide beam of energy by charging up for a bit, strong enough to destroy several city blocks in a single shot and leave nothing but rubble in its wake. Though they may not be as powerful, your regular beams are nothing to scoff at, either. Not only do they have the power to pulverise concrete and tear apart buildings with little effort, you can also fire off several at the same time, independently controlling each of their flight paths to make them follow your target with unerring accuracy. Likewise, your range with this is also incredible, able to precisely target your beams even hundreds of metres away from you.

With a rapid volley of these normal beams bombarding them from the sky, your strength with this is such that you could even give a special grade sorcerer trouble, to say nothing of what you could do to lesser sorcerers. Truly, only sorcerers on the level of Gojo or Sukuna could hope to rival you in raw power alone with this, and that’s only if they have a technique suited for such a thing."
1176,,600,God of War,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction ,"Humans, be they sorcerer or not, are all born with a certain level of cursed energy innate to their being – sorcerers just have a higher amount of the stuff, along with the ability to control it. There are rare cases, though, when would-be sorcerers are born with abnormally low levels of cursed energy, less even than an ordinary human, and in exchange are gifted with superhuman natural physical capabilities. Rarer yet is one born with no cursed energy at all, of which only two cases are known to have ever existed. The result of this is a monster capable of contending with even the strongest of sorcerers.

Now, you are the third such case – a being born without any cursed energy, with all of the benefits this comes with. The first, and most notably, are your physical abilities, which have far transcended the limits of any normal human. You’re strong enough to smash down buildings, shatter thick concrete walls, and casually throw cars around. The ground forms sizeable craters when you strike it, and all but the toughest of curses could be killed with a single blow should you land a clean hit on them with a cursed tool.

Your toughness is similarly impressive, able to take such hits without being injured too badly, and any injuries you do take short of missing limbs or organs can be healed relatively quickly. You could be crushed between two enormous hands of stone, large enough to fully envelop your body, and not only would you be able to overpower them, but break through them without much being harmed much at all. Even if you were slammed into the ground at speeds far faster than the speed of sound, rupturing your organs and leaving you unable to move, you’d be able to get up again after barely five minutes of recovery and keep fighting as if nothing happened.

You can move so fast that others have difficulty even perceiving your movements, able to cut down multiple highly-skilled sorcerers before they even have a chance to react to your presence. Combined with your equally impressive agility and reactions, you could catch bullets fired at point blank range, run across water, and bound off of walls and trees with effortless ease.

Your senses are likewise a lot sharper than they were before. You’re capable of spotting even the slightest of oddities in your foes’ movements, and can even perceive the air itself.Through this, you could determine the presence and actions of invisible creatures by how the air moves around them, and even pre-empt their movements to a degree. More than this, you can even see the scattered surfaces in the air created by subtle differences in temperature and density, and somehow use them to manoeuvre in mid-air, swinging and leaping through the skies in ways no other could predict. This, combined with your speed and agility, affords you such mobility that even a cursed spirit moving at Mach 3 would be completely unable to keep up with you.

In addition to the above, having no cursed energy has benefits of its own – specifically, that any ability that targets cursed energy has no effect on you. Barriers, for instance, can only recognise and prevent the entrance or exit of beings with cursed energy – while any other sorcerer might be completely blocked by one, you could walk straight through it as if it wasn’t there. Similarly, effects that detect others based on their cursed energy wouldn’t even register you, and even the guaranteed-hit effects of Domains would be unable to target you. This also applies to any other supernatural energies you might possess.

The main downside of having no cursed energy, of course, is just that: you don’t have any cursed energy. As such, not only are you completely unable to use any sort of cursed technique, but you’re also unable to harm cursed spirits – you’ll need a cursed tool or other object imbued with cursed energy to do that. However, given that those with this ability are capable of fighting an entire clan of sorcerers at once and emerging as the sole survivor, or taking on special grade cursed spirits and defeating them single-handedly so long as they’re armed with a decent cursed tool, the benefits are well worth such small drawbacks."
1177,,600,Black Materia,Final Fantasy VII,Destruction ,"On the other hand, maybe you just want everything to die? This is the legendary Black Materia, which contains the ultimate destructive magic Meteor. Upon being cast, a gigantic moon-sized Meteor will appear in the cosmos and then head hurtling towards the planet you cast this on. Upon impact, Meteor will destroy all life on its surface and deeply wound the planet, likely to death if nothing stopped or blunt its impact. The Meteor itself is also durable enough to shrug off powerful explosives and remain perfectly intact and on-course, as if in mockery at human technology trying to stop what's coming. That said, it takes several days before impact and is plainly visible in the sky...more than enough time for the natives to make a desperate plan of attack or escape, or just dissolve into panic. You may only cast this spell once per jump or once every ten years, whichever comes first.

Oh, and try not to be on said planet when impact happens. Casting this without an escape plan or a way to survive would be, well, stupid."
1178,,600,White Materia,Final Fantasy VII,Destruction ,"One of the only known Ultimate Magics in the world, this White Materia contains the ultimate defense magic: Holy. When the Planet is meeting a crisis that threatens it and life on its surface, you may cast the spell from this Materia. Upon doing so, the spell will roar to life and immediately destroy whatever is causing the Planet agony. While malevolent forces may be able to hold back or overcome the spell, Holy is powerful enough that only another Ultimate Magic could hope to match it in this world. That said, as indicated, this spell can only be activated in a moment of great need, often an impending apocalypse. Also note that 'threats' may well include all of humanity depending on its relationship with the planet in question. Don't call on Holy lightly, Jumper."
1179,,600,Ultimate Weapon,Final Fantasy VII,Destruction ,"If your Signature Weapon can be considered a 10, this can be considered a 100. This is a weapon that matches your chosen fighting style in Still More Fighting, being tailored to an aesthetic you enjoy. In addition to starting off ten times stronger than a normal Signature Weapon, the Ultimate Weapon's strength will scale with one specific trait about yourself you choose. It could be how many enemies you've killed in your chain, your maximum health, how close you are to Limit Break, the strength of a Materia or item you have equipped, your magical energy, and so on. As this specific trait grows stronger, so does the Weapon, with its power growing alongside with it. Thus, as you grow more powerful, the Weapon will grow along with you whether in short bursts or as you continue to become stronger in your chain."

As their size grows, you gain more strength, speed and toughness, your weapons pierce their skin more easily, and your armor becomes more and more impenetrable. Good hunt."
1181,,600,Hero Killer,Inheritance Cycle,Destruction ,"You know those Heroes? Main Protagonists? Those people who prance around with all sorts of plot armor and come out the other side of the worst the universe has to throw at them smelling like roses? Well, you sir, are a Hero Killer! Your blade and magic are able to pierce plot armor like it doesn't exist. It doesn't matter what 'destiny' or the 'plot' dictates. Everyone is equal under your weapon."
1182,,600,Potential Colour,Library of Ruina V1.0,Destruction ,"Top of the line fixers rise through the ranks until they are given a title of a colour, like the Red Mist or the Purple Tear. As the elite of the elite, colours are recognised as the most capable of the fixers. The training and expertise of each colour can be so vast that it's difficult to compare any two colours. This perk ensures you have the baseline of what a colour tends to have:

● Better fighting ability all-around with better reflexes, stronger force and a sharper mind.
● Your fighting skills never deteriorate, and you can be ready for battle at any time.
● You can safely use any weapon, no matter how exotic, volatile or self-harming it may be.
● Although most are capable of deflecting bullets with melee weapons, you can do so reliably and consistently.
● You can, at a glance, accurately assess someone's combat capabilities and can tell if they're holding back or hiding it.
● Finally, when you are hired for a job, you can see the optimal path of success and the optimal means of pleasing the client, even if the two are mutually exclusive. 

With this you could clash with some of the strongest fighters this city has to offer. But if you want to stand out from the other fixers and colours, you will have to develop your own unique style."
1183,,600,Final Trump,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction ,"This deck of cards has no equal and likely never will in this world. Each card is a work of art with intricately painted designs depicting figures both lovely and frightening. One would never expect such lovely creations of having a far more sinister and deadly use. Created by a Magi with a flair for the dramatic, these cards can be imbued with touches of mana to turn them into terrifying thrown weapons. The edges each become as sharp as obsidian and the wielder can even control their flight through that touch of magic. Do not worry about losing one of these priceless cards. They will always return to their box a day after they leave it."
1184,,600,Zanmato,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction ,"A holy katana said to have been forged by the very earth itself. The very oldest stories suggest that a great confluence of magic welled up in the magma beneath the world, casting the Zanmato out of the toughest metals ever seen. The legends also speak of those who hold the blade sidestepping strikes and cleaving armored men in twain. Those stories have only moderately exaggerated the true power of this blade. It is utterly unbreakable and now loyal only to you. If lost or stolen, the katana will find its way back to you in short order."
1185,,600,Bushido,Final Fantasy VI,Destruction ,"Any who study the art of the blade will tell you there is always something left to learn. There is no perfect attack, no flawless defense, and certainly no single strategy that will annihilate those who stand before your bared steel. Still, there are those who learn to draw out the “soul” of a blade using their own to perform truly supernatural feats. Concentration and waiting for the perfect moment to strike are key to the Bushido techniques.

You will begin with the most basic techniques of the Bushido already mastered. The first is Fang, a concentrated strike that phases through armor to strike at the core of a person. The second is the Sky technique, a patient parry that waits for the opponent to strike and then punishes them severely. Few, if any, opponents can dodge the Sky counterstrike. These are only the beginning though. Given time, training, and meditation on the “soul” of the blade one will be able to draw out even more impressive feats. Striking four opponents with a single swing, drawing strength and energy from the wounds you inflict, even striking down undead in a single strike could all be in your future if your soul is strong enough."
1186,,600,Void Control,Final Fantasy V,Destruction ,"As a practitioner of the Void, you are able to manifest and use its power. Able to reduce entire countries into Nothingness, its power is nearly unmatched. However, its use comes with a price. It is the absence of magical energy, and as such, its use will reduce all magic in the lands in which it’s used, including your own. It is a powerful weapon, but it can and will wreak havoc on any world or being suffused with magical power."
1187,,600,Red cross,The Song of the Nibelungs,Destruction ,"The cross Kriemhild wove into Siegfrieds clothes, telling Hagen exactly which his weak point was, so that Hagen may protect her husband from harm. This red cross will appear on any particular weak spot or the weakest spot that can be found of a specific enemy, telling you exactly where to strike. You will be the only one who can see this cross."
1188,,600,Kriemhild's revenge,The Song of the Nibelungs,Destruction ,"You’ve been deeply wronged. Whether all your lifes work has been destroyed, your love has been murdered or wether you were insulted and shamed in front of witnesses, you have been wronged. The hatred you’ve felt from that day burns with fury hotter than all the dwarfs' forges and all the dragon's heart. The more severe you have been wronged, the more hatred and rage and willpower you will gain, with no limit. In pursuit of your revenge you will spare no effort. As long as you do anything with your revenge as its ultimate goal all your long and short term planning, mental faculties, determination and charisma become enhanced so that your ultimate goal comes ever closer and will be all the more sweet and brutal and cathartic. Fate or the Norns themselves seem to smile upon you in your quest and will offer ample opportunity for alliances, moments to strike and other tools to help you. With this perk you could go from a lonely and poor widow to a merciless angel of vengeance who will sacrifice thousands of lives, kill off your own clan and ruin a kingdom and a half. Let them all burn."
1189,,600,Rusted God’s Sword,Witch on the Holy Night,Destruction ,"What a wicked, awful thing this melee weapon is, dripping with thousand years-old magical energy and malice. If it truly is the sword that once slew Yamato-no-Orochi it has rusted far from its original glory- yet soaked in it’s victim still holds the power to mark the wielder as “kin” and grant them an otherworldly form associated with the divine serpent while rotting enemies with its curses. If it was once an ordinary tree branch, it’s Mystery has risen to the point it could cleave a streak through small buildings with a single swing-and raise new foliage from where it struck. Whatever it’s true nature, this semi-sentient artifact is a Conceptual Weapon as soaked in the Age of the Gods’ Mystery as Lugh Beowulf himself-and his equal in sheer danger, requiring only a wielder to bond with. Interestingly, it always feels like a natural extension of your body even if you have no hands to wield it."
1190,,600,Mountain Snake,Witch on the Holy Night,Destruction ,"There is far more to your form than meets the eye. Your childhood was a harsh and rigorous thing, spent far away in the mountains beyond civilisation’s comforts where you fought beasts bigger than you. As a result, your physicality and ability to kill with bare hands is frankly inhuman. You can run ten miles in under ten minutes, pick up a young woman, and carry her back much of the way while only being out of breath from the sprint. You can access what is called hysterical strength, reading the fighting capabilities of even otherworldly foes with a glance and exceeding the safe limits of your body with machine-like precision to strike them with the full force of your body on one single point. While ruinous to your own arms and even the rest of your body, two such blows could drop even a mighty steel-furred Elemental to the ground. Doubtless any lesser confrontation for you would be like tearing apart papier mache. As long as it doesn’t involve magecraft, at least. For all that your flesh is well-forged and your tendons are like steel cables, you’re no more resistant to magecraft than the next man on the street."
1191,,600,You Think Our Rage... a Weakness? ,Final Fantasy IV,Destruction ,"There is a fire that burns deep in your heart, one that is either part of your lineage, or unique to you, but it is certain that it cannot be quenched. When your life, or the lives of your friends are on the line, a power that transcends your physical limitations takes hold. When it takes hold, logic seems to fall to the wayside for you. Resilience in the face of an attack that should have killed you. Strength far beyond your normal limitations. Use of magic above your abilities. All of this and more are possible when it is your very life that hangs in the balance."
1192,,600,Gram ,HighSchool DxD,Destruction ,"The strongest Demon Sword created, Gram was previously wielded by the original Siegfried who used it to slay the Dragon King Fafnir, though Fafnir was later revived by the Norse Gods. It’s considered to be the combination of Durandal and Ascalon; as such, it can release destructive power, but it doesn't require the same charging time as Durandal, furthermore its edge cuts through almost anything, and quite capable of cutting even the likes of Grendel. The destructive power it brings its unmatched."
1193,,600,Ballad of the Myth Hunter,HighSchool DxD,Destruction ,"Gods, Dragons, Mythical creatures of unimaginable power. The unreachable heights of strength that mere mortals could never hope to match in force. What are they, truly? Nothing but stepping stones, fuel for your growth. Nothing more. This will give you the power to ignore those ‘absolute’ defenses beings on that level like to take pride in, making them as vulnerable to your might as any mundane animal would be; as well as granting a great increase in luck when fighting those who are on the level of a god or superior. In practice this means that you will always have a decent chance, maybe the only one, to defeat divine beings and above. And really, what’s the true goal of humanity if not to be atop of everything else?"
1194,,600,Trident of Poseidon,God of War,Destruction ,"The personal weapon of the king of the seas, and the ultimate symbol of his rulership. Created by the Cyclopes and given to Poseidon as a gift after his brother, Zeus, freed them from Tartarus, it can allow the wielder it the ability to survive underwater and ignore deep sea pressure, greatly increase their speed while underwater, and grant them complete control over all sealife as well as horses. Additionally, it will greatly improve all lightning and air abilities you may possess, allowing you to show them why they should beware the seas."
1195,,600,Child of Typhon ,God of War,Destruction ,"Typhon was once the greatest threat to the Olympian’s reign, a monstrous son of Gaia and Tartarus that dwarfed all others. Much like him, you were born to be the bane of the gods, capable of dealing extreme damage to any divine being, while possessing a great resistance to their abilities. This effect scales with their level of divinity, meaning that the more divine they are, the worse they will fare against you. Bring down those hated gods, and bring about the new world order you were destined to."
1196,,600,Strength of Ares,God of War,Destruction ,"Whereas Athena is praised for her battle tactics and sharp wits, Ares represents the basest parts of war, in strength of arms. And strength is something that you have in spades. You possess a well of strength so vast that, when tapped into, allows you to perform above and beyond your proverbial weight class. Lifting structures far beyond what any thought possible of you, extreme bursts of speed, even amplifying your natural regeneration are but a few uses. This strength is more difficult to access while in active combat, but not impossible with training and effort."
1197,,600,Lich,Adventure Time,Destruction ,"Well maybe not the Lich but certainly a lich - A herald of death, doom and possibly the undying physical manifestation of a mushroom bomb. You have the power to bring despair to those around you, throw eerie green flames, cause objects you come into contact with directly to decay and possess the bodies of living things."
1198,,600,Masamune,Final Fantasy III,Destruction ,"You have touched upon the absolute heights of a warrior, at least from this world. You are like a whirlwind in combat, able to tear through dozens of men. Your speed, strength and agility allow you to run across a battlefield in full armour and cut down any ordinary man you pass on the way at a startling pace. You have also learned the arts of stealth and infiltration, able to sneak into an enemy palace and cut down generals and kings in their sleep without being noticed."
1199,,600,Thunderbolts,Xena - Hercules,Destruction ,"Now you've done it. You've acquired a gold-and-leather brace of three jagged spears that transform mid-throw into blasts of electricity. They hit every bit as fast and hard as their natural counterparts, and being semi-divine, they ignore spells and enchantments that protect against electricity. Technological defenses are less effective as well, the energy of each bolt ignoring physics and refusing to be re-directed or grounded out until all their energy is expended upon the target.

Creatures that are incredibly tough or naturally resistant to electricity are most likely to survive a hit, but nothing less than a being of lightning incarnate can completely shrug off a hit from one of these. The brace forms new spears whenever struck by natural lightning."
1200,,600,Pierce the Veil,Final Fantasy II,Destruction ,"In dealing with supernatural threats, you’ve come to learn that killing something doesn’t necessarily mean that it will stay dead. Too often something will return from beyond, stronger and more powerful than before. This particular perk will provide you with the option that, when killing something, you also destroy its soul, preventing it from returning. Avatars or clones, when destroyed, do not return their power back to the original. Additionally, you can send short messages to the souls of the deceased, before they are fully at rest, allowing you to communicate with them (as allowed by the afterlife of the setting)."
1201,,600,Combat Magic,Hellblazer,Destruction ,"The Flashy Stuff. Throw fireballs, telekinesis, lightning, that sort of thing. Requires mana."
1202,,600,Full Confession ,Katana Zero,Destruction ,"And even among the NULLs, there are those who stand above everyone else; the Gammas. Trained and treated with Chronos since childhood, the Gammas have few equals, and they push what is humanly possible to such a degree that it can only be truly described as supernatural. Your combat skills have been improved by an order of magnitude, at minimum allowing you to deflect bullets, and your physicality has had a tremendous boost, in particular your agility.

The two NULLs who haven’t sustained a near-fatal head injury and amnesia have shown that they can move so quickly they effectively teleport. The Dragon dashes a good 10-20ft, even through lasers, with anything in that path being absolutely sliced apart, while a NULL in the employ of Al-Qasim known as the Headhunter just...teleports with absolutely no regard for ‘cooldowns’ or what not, while also managing to do similar feats as the Dragon with her knife despite being practically in Chronos withdrawal. SNOW might be able to go anywhere, but in combat a NULL with this is nigh-unbeatable to anyone who isn’t a fellow Gamma.

Oh, and as an added bonus, any and all psychic abilities you may have get a 3 times power boost."
1203,,600,Judgment Staff,Final Fantasy I,Destruction ,"Noticing a trend yet? No? Don’t worry about it. This is an incredibly powerful staff that...okay, look. It’s the Sage’s Staff, except it works with Black Magic instead and the spell imbued into it is the mighty and explosive Flare spell, which is good at making ash out of squad-sized groups within seconds. Boom. All there is to it."
1204,,600,Masamune,Final Fantasy I,Destruction ,"A weapon straight out of myth, this long katana is said to sometimes grow several inches over the course of each heroic saga it takes part in. Thankfully, that doesn’t seem true for this one...though the length of the blade can be extended at the will of the user, up to the height of the user. This blade’s cutting power is something to behold, separating men from their limbs with lazy swipes, opening painful wounds on great beasts, and even small grazes opening into deadly cuts with its power. It lacks the magical penetration of Excalibur or the arcane power of Thor’s Hammer, but it makes up for being able to clear large groups of unwary foes in but a few swings."
1205,,600,Excalibur,Final Fantasy I,Destruction ,"A legendary sword wielded by legendary heroes in a legendary land in legendary legends. This shining blade forged of powerful magic is the bane of both evil and creatures of myth, slicing through mundane armor like a hot knife through butter, and cutting through monsters easily. This sword strikes enemies with elemental weaknesses as though the blade itself were said weakness, maximizing the damage the steel can wreck upon their physical forms. Things lacking such weakness or being beyond such things are unaffected by this, but the sword alone can still easily tear through men and lesser monsters. By your hand, they will fall."
1206,,600,Tail of the Phoenix,Final Fantasy I,Destruction ,"Never underestimate the power of a practiced White Mage! You may not be able to shake the earth with arcane power like your darker cousins or swing a weapon like a skilled Fighter, but your spells and abilities have a bite of their own. Just as healing magic damages the undead, your defensive spells and support spells are much stronger when used against the cause of evil or demons. Being that are openly malevolent or made of such take damage just from striking or being near your own barriers, your ability to heal afflictions they unleash is much easier and less costly, and even healing your own allies will damage your foes in proportion to the power of the spell should they be near...even moreso if they’re undead, of course. Let none stand before your light, and may evil be banished from this world."
1207,,600,Hey That Could Work,The Little Mermaid,Destruction ,"Sometimes there just doesn’t seem to be a way to win. The bad guy is invulnerable and all-powerful. No matter what you do, your attacks just seem to bounce off. Do they even have a weakness? Of course they do. Everyone does, at least when you’re involved. Once every jump (or every ten years), when you’re facing insurmountable odds and an overpowered enemy, you can trigger a stroke of brilliance. It will seem and feel like an impulsive decision. A mad plan that couldn’t possibly work, could it? It might be as simple as ‘drive a boat at her and stab her with it’ or ‘throw this weird plant I found into their drink’. But you only get the one chance. If you mess it up, refuse to act, or hesitate in the heat of the moment the weakness will go away for good. The more powerful the enemy, the more convoluted or hard to implement the plan is."
1208,,600,Dark Moon Greatsword ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Destruction ,"A Moon Greatsword bestowed by a Carian queen upon her spouse to honor long-standing tradition, and is one of the legendary armaments in the Lands Between. Ranni's sigil is a full moon, cold and leaden, and this sword is but a beam of its light. By raising the sword aloft, bathing it in the light of the dark moon, the magic attack power will be enhanced and imbues blade with frost, while charged attacks can release blasts of moonlight."
1209,,600,God of Death and Conquest,The Road to El Dorado,Destruction ,"Rather than a captain and his men, instead what your enemies see is different. A wandering catastrophe, a scourge of men, a horde that destroys nations. The air around you reeks of death for those that draw your ire; the depth of malice and cruelty you can willingly project would chill the bones of battle hardened veterans. In comparison to such veterans, battles led by yourself are decidedly one sided should you possess a moderate amount of advantages, such as superior technology or education, allowing you to overcome greater numbers. Such battles rarely turn against your favor as ambushes fail and get reversed by the fear you can bestow upon the hearts of these forsaken men. While there might be greater military generals, in lands still ripe and new to the horrors of modern warfare you are truly a god. Some might even beseech your mercy and aid you in killing their brothers, for hopes they might be spared, especially those who seek the god of death you can portray yourself to be."
1210,,600,Thrice Cursed Grail,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Destruction ,"This is an Artefact so cursed I can’t imagine the church condoning you possess it. In a different world, where the spirit of Rasputin inhabited the corpse of a certain different priest, the resulting being knew of the evil dragon Azi Dahaka and the ridiculing Bahloo. This Grail is cursed with a similar memory, alongside the present idea of burning the world with a Holy Grail. What you can summon from this Grail is nothing else but the pollution spilled out of the heart of a god representing evil in its purest form. The Black Mud emerges from the Grail rapidly but instead of corrupting it incinerates the wicked. Upon contact with this flood of curses having gained physical form, those that have repeatedly committed evil thoughts or deeds will be lit on fire, the flame all the more punishing the eviler the sinner is. But even those of good heart aren’t entirely immune, an ever so minor chance that contact with the Mud kills them instantly. A terrifying and potent Grail, even if it lacks the wish granting nigh infinite magical reserves of proper Holy Grails. It also has one more weakness. To use this Grail means using the evil hearts of men as nourishment, akin to firewood. Should there be no evil in its presence, not even a single drop of Mud will be produced by the Grail."
1211,,600,Yielding To None,Godbound,Destruction ,"Yet it is not by platitudes and kind deeds that the despoilers of the world will be defeated. You are yourself a terror on the battlefield, boasting exceptional natural talent for all the arts of war. Unerringly your divine eyes spot the fault lines and weaknesses in battlefields, economies and arguments as if looking upon the underlying meanings that run through creation rather than their surface impressions. With good aim, a thrown dagger in your hand could do the work of a ballista bolt. When you actually bring war to others, even your normal attacks surge with divine power as if you were smiting others with universal miracles of the Sword, Bow, Might or whatever form of attack you use-felling what would be great foes to other Godbound without even using true effort. And when you inflict truly grievous wounds, be they on enemies, objects or even abstract constructs like Celestial Engines, you may smite them from afar with your divine powers with a fraction of the might that punishes impious devotees-which is still among the deadliest yet most precise shows of divine force. Best of all you have a terrific resistance to all manner of effects which would normally slay or transfigure you on the spot, or require you to make a show of divine resilience to withstand. Let your enemies fear you as the Scourge of the One, for their sins must have been great indeed to deserve your coming."
1212,,600,Sword of Milos,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction ,"A sinister greatsword fashioned from a giant's backbone, the spines along each side of the blade have been tapered to a fine point and mete out wounds like a lopsided saw-blade. Milos was undersized for a giant, and was viewed as sullied and terribly grotesque. It can let out a horrific cursed scream that vastly reduces all damage negation and status resistances for nearby foes. "
1213,,600,Magma Wyrm’s Scalesword ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction ,"Curved greatsword wielded by Magma Wyrms. The shape resembles a dragon's jaw and is covered in hard scales. It's said these land-bound dragons were once human heroes who partook in dragon communion, a grave transgression for which they were cursed to crawl the earth upon their bellies, shadows of their former selves. Smashing this weapon into the ground will trigger a blast of burning magma, which will cost the environment around you."
1214,,600,Axe of Godfrey,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction ,"Weapon of Godfrey, Elden Lord. It was broken in a battle fought as leader of the Tarnished during the Long March. This weapon is symbolic of Godfrey's vow to conduct himself as a lord, later becoming an emblem of the golden lineage. In the days of the past, a crown was warranted with strength. Those who wield it can not only tear through enemies like they were grass, but can send a shockwave through the earth that causes all nearby enemies to fall and stumble while spikes of stone impale them."
1215,,600,Crucible Knight,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Destruction ,"You were counted amongst the personal knights of the Elden Lord Godfrey, and are still amongst the most formidable warriors in all of the Lands Between. After participating in some of the deadliest battles, your strength is such that you could stomp the ground hard enough to create deadly spikes on the earth, and your flesh just as effective, if not more so, than many forms of armor. Yet without your lord, what is the point of it all?

Boosted: You are no mere knight, instead someone comparable to the Lord of the Battlefield himself. Your strength is legendary, capable of shaking an entire arena with a single stomp and fighting a Rune Bear barehanded and easily coming out on top. Even your flesh is more akin to stone than any flesh, as unyielding as a mountain. With such ferocity and power in your hands, what could hope to surpass you?

1216,,600,The Strongest,Blue Archive,Destruction ,"Violence and gunfights are common in Kivotos, and as such most students possess some skill with guns and other methods of fighting. You are one of the rare students who isn’t just skilled at violence, but an expert. Much like Head Prefect Hina, JTF President Tsurugi, or C&C’s ‘Double O’ Neru, you possess an overwhelming capacity for violence. Your durability is massively increased, allowing you to walk away from a direct cruise missile hit with only minor injuries, while your strength would allow you to go toe-to-toe with a high-tech power suit and come out on top. As most schools only have one student on this level, expect to gain a fair amount of attention if you show off."
1217,,600,Heart of the Sands,Wizard 101,Destruction ,"The sands speak in whispers and riddles, and few are those who can hear, but you have learned to listen and, perhaps more importantly, speak back. You have learned how to listen to the sands of your heart, learning all that they have to teach you about the weaknesses and strengths of all that have set foot upon them, and granting you the sagely wisdom to swiftly pick out the weaknesses of any foe you happen to run across, and how best to exploit these weaknesses for your own ends as the sands whisper ancient secrets and hidden truths, granting you the greatest of advantages against any foe, that of knowledge and secrets. Instead of listening to the wisdom of the sands, you may instead [SPEAK], and command the eternal sands to obey, raising vast pyramids and swirling storms of the sand born from a thousand thousand dead worlds to crush your foes and strengthen your allies alike."
1218,,600,Sword of Truth,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Destruction ,"With this blade, or at least one like it, Prince Philip will achieve the impossible and slay Maleficent, the Mistress of All Evil at the height of her power. An enchanted sword forged by the power of righteousness, it is a mighty weapon against evil, as even a strike at the armoured hide of Maleficent’s dragon form would cause her pain, and if it were to strike at a more vulnerable spot, itt could even kill her! Indeed, this sword is a bane to evil everywhere. But that is not the only gift it has. It is not just an incredible sword, it is not only enchanted to be a weapon against evil, but it is also blessed so that, once per jump, you may throw it, and like the sword wielded by Phillip when it was blessed by Flora, it will strike swift and sure, striking your foe’s most vulnerable spot. You would have to be able to hit it by throwing the sword normally, of course, but against certain enemies, this might be enough to strike the death blow...just like with Maleficent."
1219,,600,Obsidian Greatsword,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"This greatsword, one of the rare dragon weapons, is formed by the tail of the one-eyed black dragon Kalameet, the last of the ancient dragons. The mystical power of its obsidian blade will be released when held with both hands, unleashing a corona of cursed energy that strikes at any nearby enemies, paralyzing them, making them vulnerable and open to any attacks for a time. This can optionally be fused with you, becoming a tail."
1220,,600,Arm of the Grave,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"The bladed arm of the Lord of Death, crafted from the bones of an Everlasting Dragon. It is imbued with a large portion of the Gravelord’s power, not only enhancing any necromantic or entropy-based abilities channeled through it, but each wound it delivers unto an enemy will resist all attempts to heal it. Not even the most potent of miracles can restore the wounds caused by this, forcing it to heal at a natural, glacial pace. This can optionally be directly attached to your arm."
1221,,600,Storm of Fire,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"Life is just as capable with destruction as it is with creation, for just as easily can fire bake bread as it can burn it. You embody that destructive capability well, surrounding yourself in a deadly aura of flame and pure heat, reaching temperatures capable of melting stone and steel with contemptuous ease. You can toggle this aura on and off at will, should you so desire.

Boosted: Your mere presence is not a bonfire, but a hurricane of flame capable of burning down all in your path. Fire raining from the sky capable of melting even the scales of the Everlasting Dragons, turning their greatest defense into a cage, leaving them unable to move as they cook within their own stone bodies. When you walk, all shall know that a Lord of flame has arrived, capable of burning away cities and kingdoms until naught but ash is left.

1222,,600,Master of the Entropy,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Destruction ,"When the Lord of Sunlight peeled back the stone scales of the Everlasting Dragons, the Gravelord unleashed a miasma of death and disease, causing their vulnerable flesh to wither and decay. You are now surrounded by such a miasma, a dark and coiling thing that will steal away the life of any caught within, and cause their weapons and armor to rust away into nothingness. Only the truly timeless are unaffected by your power over entropy. You can of course toggle this aura on and off, should you wish to enjoy their company a little while longer.

Boosted: Your mere presence is no longer a gentle breeze that steals away the breath of the living, but a deadly hurricane devastating all in your wake. The winds themselves eb and flow under your guiding hand, tearing away at the very landscape at your leisure, as is only right for a Lord such as yourself. For just as improbable as it is for someone to fight off a storm, how could they hope to fend off the inevitable endpoint of all life.

But if they shall not go gently into that good night, then you shall make them, kicking and screaming into its quiet embrace. If it can be killed, then you will rapidly find out how to do so. No matter what it may attempt in order to hide its weaknesses or vulnerabilities, you shall deliver unto them their destined death.

Boosted: As Lord of the Dead, you do not merely know how to kill an enemy, but also how to ensure that they stay dead. What you kill will remain dead, unable to be saved by resurrections, reincarnations, nothing. Death favors no one over another, a fact many seem to have forgotten, but you are ready to remind them of. You could be merciful and allow them another chance at life, but such opportunities are often wasted on those undeserving.

With practice and combat experience, you’ll eventually grow to match him in his prime. Cut through steel rebar and concrete while tossing your enemies around like toys.

1226,,600,Hellsing ARMS 13mm Auto Anti Freak Combat Pistol: Jackal,Hellsing,Destruction ,"From black gunmetal, this sixteen inch monster takes form. A heady weight of sixteen kilograms lets the user know, if they can even lift it as a handgun, that a weapon of mass destruction rests in their hand. A semi-automatic pistol with the same strange reloading quirk as the Casull, the Jackal has the power to make both .50 calibre rifles and even the Casull itself blush. Even a single shot can turn a vampire to red mist, then destroy at least one stone wall behind that vampire too. Each round is a marvel in it’s own right. A 13mm explosive, hollow-point bullet. Made to pierce even the most powerful monsters, the rounds are cased in blessed Macedonian silver and have a charge of blessed mercury in them. Beyond their immense raw power and holy attributes, they also have powerful anti-regeneration effects. A regenerator like the Paladin Anderson found himself largely unable to heal from the wounds the Jackal leaves. Though a mythical artefact like Helena’s Nail may be able to regenerate despite the bullet, each shot will still grievously harm almost anything it touches. "
1227,,600,All Must Divide,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales,Destruction ,"Enchanting sirens who lure men to the depths, cursed crags which trap vengeful spirits, immortal sailors who ferry the souls of the deceased, tridents that command the power of the sea... You’ve spent your life studying the myths and curses of the oceans, and you know all too well that all of these are not mere stories, but glimpses into a more wondrous and terrifying reality. You’re at least passingly familiar with nearly every supernatural working and phenomenon that has ever been spoken of in this world, how they fit together, and -- more importantly -- their flaws. Most sailors would lie down as curses and monsters descend upon them, recognizing the inevitability of their fate. Unlike them, your seeming foolishness prevents you from accepting the hand you’ve been dealt, no doubt bolstered by your seeming tendency to stumble upon solutions that work. Fate will guide you towards the most effective means to break any mystical phenomenon or being, though this will only help in terms preparing the journey. Actually claiming the materials and performing any necessary actions are on you, but gifting final deliverance upon beasts and cursed men is now something you can achieve in a reasonable timeframe."
1228,,600,Wrath of the Gods,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"If there is one lesson to be held above all others from the sacrifice of the Great Lord Gwyn, then it is to rage against the dying of the light. With but a thought, you can unleash a powerful wave of pure white force, damaging any who are too close to you. This wave l, you will find, is especially effective against the undead and those in accord with the Dark. Do not go gentle into that good night, and do not send your foes there gently, either.

Boosted: The Dark is surely the enemy of man and the gods, it's corruptive nature no match for the purity of your faith. You may now turn those waves of force, now more potent than before, into a constant aura that pushes back against all you deem as enemies and hazards. Few have the strength necessary to get close to you, and fewer still could sustain it.

1229,,600,Sunlight Spear,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"Spears of electrified sunlight, wielded by Lord Gwyn himself during the war that marked the dawn of the Age of Fire. Such a legacy cannot be understated, nor can the power that comes with it. You may hurl these bolts of divine sunlight towards your foes, each one capable of greatly wounding the mightiest in this world with just a single hit. It is especially deadly to dragons of all kinds.

Boosted: When you hurl these bolts of sunlight, you do so with the same potency as Lord Gwyn did in those ancient times. One strike is enough to slay an Everlasting Dragon, something that is only easier due to how quickly you can produce them, as well as the fact that you can alter their trajectory while they are in midair.

1230,,600,Last Rites,Dark Souls: Covenants,Destruction ,"Death comes for all eventually, no matter who you are nor what measures you take to avoid it. But if they shall not go gently into that good night, then you shall make them. If it can be killed, then you will rapidly find out how to do so. No matter what it may attempt in order to hide its weaknesses or vulnerabilities, you will piece it together.

Boosted: You do not merely know how to kill them, but also how to ensure that they stay dead. What you kill will remain dead, unable to be saved by resurrections, reincarnations, nothing. Death favors no one person over another, a fact many seem to have forgotten.

1231,,600,I’m Death Straight Up ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Destruction ,"Perhaps the most intimidating moment for this story is when Death reveals himself. The embodiment of Death now walks the world hunting down Puss for his disrespect. By taking this Death will no longer be alone as you share his domain. You may optionally choose to replace Death or to split your duties with him. For example, you might be in charge of peaceful death while he deals with violent deaths. Either way you are now a god and one of if not the most dangerous beings here.

Post jump you may step into this role gaining all of the qualities associated with your new universe’s concept of death. This will give you all of the powers associated with the title as well. Before you think about that however, you should examine the abilities this power grants you. First, you are now capable of killing anything due to your conceptual power. Second, you gain the ability to manipulate fire. While it was unclear it appears to be some sort of soul burning properties making it an incredibly dangerous form of magic with great potential. Third, you gain the ability to freely travel anywhere and to teleport to others regardless of location. For example, Death was capable of appearing wherever Puss was and could bypass the Star Wall which killed anyone else that went through it. Lastly, there are a number of miscellaneous abilities you will receive, but the ones mentioned above are some of the more important ones."
1232,,600,Kos Parasite,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction ,"When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in humans. This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung, but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting a lumenwood."
1233,,600,Burial Blade,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction ,"The iconic trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter. A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare."
1234,,600,Scythe of the Martyr ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction ,"The chosen weapon of Martyr Logarius, which he used to cut down any who tried to learn the secret of the Forsaken Castle Cainhurst. He used it to slay so many of the Vileblood nobility that their blood echoes still cling to the weapon, allowing the user to summon them to strike at foes from a distance. The corrupted blood of those who dwelt in the castle has also granted the weapon some arcane properties, perhaps a remnant of what originated the bloodline originally?"
1235,,600,Reiterpallasch,Bloodborne: Covenants,Destruction ,"A fully upgraded variant of the weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst, it combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar firearm wielded by them. The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague, and the disposal of beasts was a discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were called for the sake of appearances."
1236,,600,Durandal,Symphogear,Destruction ,"This giant gold sword is an “indestructible and everlasting” weapon that can produce overwhelming amounts of energy at an inexhaustible rate. It was eventually destroyed when it was used against the endlessly regenerating Nehushtan Armor, so do be careful."
1237,,600,Blade That Removes,Loki,Destruction ,"You should be very careful using this sword, and not just because it’s very sharp. Perhaps it’s been affected by exposure to Alioth, travelling through innumerable timelines, or something far more maddening and multiversal, but whatever the reason it is an extremely dangerous weapon thanks to the capability it has; Should you kill someone or something with it, it will kill every Variant of that being. Every reality within your current setting that has a Variant of the one you killed will be affected from the point you land the killing blow, from alternate timelines to mirror dimensions. Every possible version will die at the same time, and any new Variants that are created won’t escape this effect either, instantly dying the moment they reach the same relative point in their own timeline even if their own respective timeline branched off at an earlier point. While this is horrendous overkill in many situations, it is arguably the only way to ensure that a being that cannot be allowed to exist anywhere, no matter how different their alternate selves might be, is slain. It could end a Multiversal war between infinite Variants of a single person with a single stab... or avert one before it starts."
1238,,600,Penance Stare ,Marvel Primal,Destruction ,"The ultimate power of the Rider. By making eye contact with someone, you can inflict on them all the pain they’ve ever caused in their existence. Only a true innocent, such as an infant, or a truly soulless being is immune. Whether or not the target is afflicted, you know what sins they’ve inflicted and what pain they have wrought after using this power on them."
1239,,600,Drinker of Godblood,Thor: Love and Thunder,Destruction ,"In another universe, All-Black the Necrosword was the first symbiote, forged by the lord of the abyss, eons ago in the severed head of a fallen celestial. The blade in all its variations is a blade meant to do the impossible and slay the divine. A lesser known fact is that with each victory, the sword imbibes itself with the blood and ichor of every god it kills. You take this to another level. With every kill, you absorb part of your victim’s essence, usurping their power. What was once theirs will be yours. Such is the legacy of the God Butcher, wielder of the Annihiliblade, Slicer of Worlds. Of course, the amount of power depends on the nature of the being, and it isn’t exactly perfect power copying. If you work your way up from the bottom, and one day you’ll fell the mightiest of the mighty."
1240,,600,The Mighty ,Thor: Love and Thunder,Destruction ,"Forget training to equal Thor, because with this perk alone, you can fight on par with beings such as him with a somewhat solid chance of coming out on top. You are a born warrior. You stand at the very pinnacle of your species, the apex. A human would be beyond even the super-soldiers of WWII and the Black Panthers of Wakanda. A shadow monster would be a gargantuan abomination the size of a mountain. An Asgardian would have surpassed the royals and the titans. You’re the very best your race has to offer. Your body ripples with raw power, and your natural talent in battle surpasses the greatest warriors of the realms, to the point where you could tear through elite armies with no prior experience whatsoever. With effort, you could very well be hailed as the strongest there is. You could stand against Hela, Goddess of Death herself or duel a being with the strength of the Hulk or Thanos given a day of training."
1241,,600,Ammits Staff,Moon Knight,Destruction ,"The gift Arthur Harrow received from his Patron. This Staff can fire of a purple energy to attack foes, powerful enough to hold back Moon Knight and extract someone’s life force as well as Shapeshift into an Axe. Furthermore just by letting it wave in someones hand it can peer into that person past and future, determining if they are evil or good. Lastly you can summon Jackals, invisible to normal humans and stronger than one, from a different dimension and let them hunt your enemies."
1242,,600,Soul Eater,Moon Knight,Destruction ,"Much like the dreaded Ammit, you can devour the very lifeforce and soul of those who oppose you. All it takes is physical contact for you to, in a blast of purple light, tear their soul and essence out, for you to devour so it is obliterated into nothingness, bypassing resurrection.

Boosted: Now for every Soul you consume you can feel your powers strengthen. Swallow a whole City of Sinners and you can grow as large as a Pyramid for example.

1243,,600,Hammer ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Destruction ,"Made of mystical uru metal and enchanted, while it won’t give you Thor’s strength or powers, it does possess Mjolnir’s other capabilities. This hammer is amplifies the force of your blows, can be used to fly, returns to you when called (capable of smashing through planets if they get in the way), can open portals between locations and dimensions, can project the Anti-Force capable of vaporizing mountains (and perhaps destroying planets), as well as possessing great capability to absorb and manipulate energy. By focusing them through this hammer you can also massively amplify any energy blasts, or energy manipulation powers you possess, or utilize your own life force in a powerful destructive blast; as Thor has shown, you can further empower the former by performing the latter.

As it was not made for Thor, this hammer does lack a worthiness enchantment. But it will resist use by individuals other than you.

If you’d prefer another melee weapon, it can be another non-powered melee weapon of your choice, or you may import a melee weapon of your choice into this one (even if powered)."
1244,,600,Blade of the Phoenix       ,Marvel Cosmic,Destruction ,The Blade of the Phoenix is imbued with a portion of the power of the Phoenix Force. It has immense power projection abilities and strength and when fully channelled can shatter planets. The blade’s usual form is a large metal looking sword that glows blue. The blade can normally only be wielded by the Rook’shir bloodline of the Shi’ar but this identical copy of the blade recognizes you and anyone you choose as a rightful wielder. Those unauthorized to wield it would find it easier to lift a star than to move this powerful blade.
1245,,600,The Master of Antimatter,Marvel Cosmic,Destruction ,"You have become an antimatter reactor and generator. One gram of anti-matter contains the same energy as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, one droplet could power New York City for an entire day, and now your entire body is dedicated to the production and use of anti-matter. At its very base this gives you strength to compare to the likes of the Hulk and Sentry but the power only starts there. You are nigh invulnerable as long as you can continue to channel your antimatter energies. You can fly. You also have complete control over anti-matter and can use it for energy blasts or even incredible levels of energy and matter manipulation."
1246,,600,Roguelike,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Destruction ,"Your touch enervates others; draining their powers and temporarily making them yours. This also drains their energy, and can kill if you aren’t careful. While it may be possible to make absorbed powers permanent, this is a rare occurrence and would almost certainly cripple the person who’s power you’re ‘borrowing’. The more powerful the person you’re draining, the less damage you deal and the less power you absorb; this may not work on the most powerful of beings. The longer you absorb power, the longer it lasts for you. You also absorb knowledge, skills, and memories while in contact with others; unlike their powers, you can make this permanent if your memory is good enough, though you will lack their muscle memory. You’re also immune to other touch based absorption powers; but you’re also unable to absorb them as the conflicting absorption effects cancel each other out."
1247,,600,Stone Touch,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Destruction ,"You’ve got the touch of the Grey Gargoyle, transmuting living flesh to stone. The more powerful the creature you try this on, the longer the transformation will take; on particularly powerful beings, it may not work at all. This wears off after a few hours unless you refresh your touch."
1248,,600,Self-Detonation,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Destruction ,"You can explode! Well, there’s more to it than that; you can detonate all of your body or parts of your body in a large, highly damaging explosion, which scatters the detonated parts of your body as a colorless gas. You can control this gas like it was part of your body, but the only thing you can do with it other than move it is reform it into the body (part) that was detonated. It takes only a few seconds for arms, or around a half a minute for your entire body when human sized. If you’re much bigger than that, the strength of the explosion increases- but so does the time it takes to reform."
1249,,600,Spiritual Combat ,Avatar: Beginnings,Destruction ,"You can’t kill spirits, but you can hurt them. It turns out, you’re very good at that. Able to sever the cords binding the Great Spirits, when you strike with intention, the smug immortals will know they’ve been hit. You can even punch a possessing spirit out of their stolen body, and grapple with the otherwise immaterial. Just be wary of wounding what you can’t kill."
1250,,600,Killer of Magic ,Fate/Zero,Destruction ,"All that experience hunting down mages has left you with a lot of skill in figuring out magic and how to get past it. It only takes you seeing a particular instance of magic, whether spell or item or ability, once and a few minutes to figure out the capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of it and once you have that down, you’re a genius with finding ways to take advantage of the knowledge. In fact, even beyond this skill, when you use mundane methods against magic, they’re more effective than ever. Magical shields are weaker, invisibility is clearer to see, magical fire doesn’t burn nearly as hot and so on. Make sure to take advantage of the surprise when those witches find their magic far less effective against your trusty sidearm.

Boosted: Your very presence now weakens the magic of those you oppose, whether you use hostile methods or not. You don’t even need to be actively working against the enemy to weaken them when they are near you and even when you yourself use magic against the, the effects of this perk will still weaken their magic whilst leaving yours untouched.

1251,,600,All-Purpose Slayer,Toaruverse,Destruction ,"Many magicians feel despair when fighting someone far stronger than them. That's why they create spells or magic that would let them overcome the difference in power of their foes. This is one of those spells while normally you would need to set up formations that would need many companions and comrades to do it along with wielding a spear for a reference to the spear that stabbed the Son of God. But alas you are different you can cast this spell without the need of formations, incantations or a spear allowing you to substitute any weapon of your choice even using your bare hands would do it. Another is the spell is modified to an all-purpose that makes it capable of harming any being from a normal human to magic gods up to angels of this world and many more as if the weapons and spell is composed and made out of their weakness along with this spell capable of bypassing or breaking any type of defense or immunity even natural durability with sufficient amount of energy poured in the spell."
1252,,600,Fool’s Performance,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction ,"“Death and demise- cause for celebration!” Ah, the humble fool. So often under-appreciated, for all that they bring laughter and music to the masses. So often scorned and mocked, and abused. Perhaps being unhinged is merely a part of the job; you’d have to be mad to dance and laugh through combat, alternatively strumming on your lute and cutting veins, and so here you are. Your tunes inspire both calmness and bloodlust, lullabies to soothe fears and battle ballads to make the blood pump. With every note and cut you make you build up power for a final blow, to be used at your discretion. When the time comes, begin your solo, drawing all eyes to you. And then… the finale, a phantom spear that strikes from the heavens and, if you’ve played well enough, maims or even obliterates a target of choice. This can be done only once per battle, leaving you drained afterwards, so it is best used to save it for the final opponent- or a particularly troublesome one."
1253,,600,Serpent Sway,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction ,"“They arrive with the East wind- a torrent of whirling doom.” A strange and exotic fighting-style, born from desperation and the venom which courses through your veins. Originally used with a spear and shield, your use of it can be adapted to any melee weapon of choice should you wish; either way, in your hands the weapon will become envenomed like a viper’s fang, leaving the taste of poison with each blow. The style excels at breaking defenses and at defending; sundering armor, breaking guards, and exposing weaknesses and cowards in the shadows while dodging or blocking such strikes yourself. You can even summon spectral snakes to bite at your foes from afar, and by quietly meditating you can take on aspects of a snake’s hardened skin, blighting fangs, or weakness-sensing gaze for a time. "
1254,,600,Mark for Death ,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction ,"“True desperation is known only when escape is impossible.” All that lives must one day expire, and with strange aeons even beings of cosmic malevolence can die. And you are the one who arranges meetings with the reaper, and it is by your command that others meet him. By simply pointing out at an enemy, you open them up for extreme damage; making them stumble when they try to dodge, and weakening armor and flesh. Although you can only “mark” one being in this way at a time, others are more than capable of taking advantage of this weakness- and the more precise their attack, the more damage they are capable of dealing. With this and luck some of the strongest abominations can be felled with but a few blows."
1255,,600,Martyr,Darkest Dungeon,Destruction ,"“Those who covet injury find it in no short supply.” There is purity in flagellation, or so some followers of the Light say. The rending of one’s flesh can cleanse the mind as easily as prayer and meditation. And if done religiously, you may find yourself gaining unique insight into the holiness of scarification- something which you can share with your foe-men, as well as your allies. Lash your back and the drops of blood will lance your enemies likes knives, lacerating their flesh and making them bleed as you do. Take the burdens from others, gaining their cuts and poisons and even their stress so you can suffer in their place. And, when you’re on death’s door, unleash your accumulated trauma- regenerating your own wounds to keep the punishment coming, and either restoring the health of an ally or bleeding an enemy severely as well. The burden of suffering must be shared, but you will carry more than your fair amount- and if you truly believe, you’ll love every second as you fulfill your holy mission."
1256,,600,Umbran Climax,Bayonetta,Destruction ,"Sometimes you just want to hit an enemy a bit too hard. Sometimes you just want to deliver insult to injury. Fortunately for you, now there's the means to do both. You'll get a sense of when an enemy is staggered or weakened enough... and that's when you can summon the pain. A manifestation of your magic surrounds the enemy, where one of many potential torture devices entrap the enemy. The more you strike them during this period, the more the damage will accumulate for the few seconds it's up... which only further increases depending on the level of sadism and shadows involved. After those few seconds, they strike the enemy with interest, dealing a tremendous amount of hurt. Their pain is your pleasure."
1257,,600,Holy Audience,Bayonetta,Destruction ,"The enemy has sinned. They know this as you fight them, as you show them the power of the skies and the justice within your heart. This divine light is what scares people, and you'll show them why the wicked SHOULD fear it. You'll get a sense of when an enemy is staggered or weakened enough, and by then your divine backers will enter the fray. The more you strike them during this period, the more damage will accumulate for the few seconds they are around... and the more creatures are summoned, the more your attacks will be augmented to further increase the damage. After those few seconds, the light will envelop them as the damage is struck with interest... delivering a tremendous amount of damage. Be Judged."
1258,,600,"Lightning, Come Forth",Ragna Crimson,Destruction ,"You have gained the power to control and command lightning. The lightning that the user commands with this magic can also be used to fast travel from one place to the other by entering a lightning bolt and exit from another several hundreds of kilometers after a second.

The destructive power of this magic is also no laughing matter, as the user can call forth large lightning bolts that can pulverize entire buildings and conjure lightning storms capable of destroying cities in seconds, and it would do even more if the user were to be something more powerful like a Seija.

But this is not the end of this magic. With enough experience, the user may also learn to move their bodies with the properties of lightning, allowing them to showcase an speed that is that of lightning with their every movement, moving so fast that people may have their heads cut and their bodies not even notice that if the head were to be reattached. Finally, it also grants some form of control over magnetism."
1259,,600,Pillar of the Sun,Ragna Crimson,Destruction ,"Even if they present themselves as a highly hierarchical group, the Sun Cult is only held together by the presence of their leader, Dula Polo Nello, the Sun Saint. It is his sole presence that prevents infighting and forces the vast personality differences of the powerful Saints to be united into a singular goal. And he does that while being a half-cremated corpse.

And that it is because of his power: the ability to project a powerful Solar Aura. Beyond the Silver Aura that freezes the magic of the dragons, the Solar Aura burns their magic and their bodies with extreme ease. In your case, this aura is basically a blazing inferno. You could cremate High Class dragons in presence with extreme ease, and project a blazing image of yourself from your body. 

And if you were to combine your own Human Aura, the Solar Aura and the Silver Aura, you could create surprisingly powerful results, amplifying each other’s powers to create a devastating attack that could wipe out even Second Seats."
1260,,600,Scroll of Final Twilight,Trinity Wonder ,Destruction ,"When Ashhart was threatened at the end, he pulled out one last desperate measure. The Eternal Twilight. A mythical spell the likes of which all would fear. At the expense of a truly immense amount of mana, the caster can use Eternal Twilight to create a sphere of annihilation that will continue to grow until it destroys entire countries. This isn’t that spell. Rather, this is an offshoot one derived from it, in order to make it more usable by reducing the collateral. Rather than entire countries, this is merely on the level of city blocks. Consequently, it requires far less mana to use. After being cast the only way to stop the spell is to kill the caster, who happens to be at the epicenter of the sphere of annihilation, unharmed by the spell."
1261,,600,Steel Tempest,League of Legends,Destruction ,"Your blade moves with the wind itself... Or maybe it's the other way around? You've learned an extremely rare and powerful brand of swordsmanship, one that doesn't even have its own name- Using nothing but a blade, you can create cutting shockwaves of wind, create tornadoes that throw your enemies into the air, dash around your foes as if you were the wind itself, deflect projectiles with air, and strike with such speed that your blows are barely even visible to the untrained eye."
1262,,600,Mala & Brannon’s Heritage – The Firebringer,A Throne of Glass,Destruction ,"You are somehow related to the bloodline descended from the union of Mala, enfleshed Sun Goddess, and Brannon, arguably the greatest user of Fire magic the world has ever known. Maybe a bastard born bloodline, or potentially an unknown sibling of Aelin herself, the fact of the matter is that you have an unlimited well of Fire magic to draw from. Not just bottomless, this Fire magic has been touched by the Goddess of the Sun itself, making this Fire more potent against and able to destroy and eradicate demons and beings of shadow, to the point of permanent and true death. Your flame does not just burn but it purifies. This bottomless well allows you to have an unlimited amount of throughput as well without burning up, the only limitation is the time you spend delving to dredge up as much magic as possible. Without effort or preparation, you could bring down castles, with a few days of delving you could eradicate a force of 500 Ilken, nightmarish monsters that were thought to be so resistant to magic as to act as if truly immune. You could blast them to ash after a day of fighting an army of other magic users and only then feel tired. However, with delving for three months you would be able to instantaneously evaporate a massive lake worth of water in a single enormous blast of Flame. An icy lake that has filled a mountain valley after being dammed for literal centuries, the heat and steam would take the better part of a day to dissipate. Only after such a feat would you feel truly tired, and even then, you would be able to fight the next day as if fresh."
1263,,600,Anathema Bag,Dracula Untold,Destruction ,"On the surface this is a simple silk bag. But of course, there’s more to it than that! This bag is always the best place for you to find something to use against any supernatural enemies you face, no matter how powerful. The contents of this bag change to whatever the weakness of the enemy you designate to it is, and while it will almost never be enough to straightaway kill them, if you manage to hit them with the contents they will be significantly weakened, requiring drastically lesser effort to finish off than otherwise. 

They will also suffer horrible pain and get angry, so take care."
1264,,600,Eye of Balor,Dresden Files,Destruction ,"Pretty much what it says on the tin. A massively, outrageously powerful magical superweapon that can wither the world. The eye emanates a destructive effect that’s almost impossible to stop except with the Eye’s own coverings. Coverings you can remove partially or fully to refine and direct the destructive effect. This can be a copy of the real Eye, or the actual item if you want Ethniu to panic so many years in advance."
1265,,600,Jumperacchius,Dresden Files,Destruction ,"The Fourth Sword of faith. Maybe its hilt is made from the Wood of the Cross? Anyway, it has a powerful angel inside it, and all the powers of the three swords of the cross. That is, bearing this sword marks you as a Knight of the Cross, and grants unto you certain powers that Knights normally only hold whenever it’s convenient for the plot. You have Mysterious Ways working for you, ensuring you happen to be at the right place at the right time, every time. Whenever you stand against Evil, and one does mean real evil here, you find that you can move faster, hit harder, resist more damage. It’s as if your abilities are… equalized to your opposition, somehow. And oh, this sword can kill anything. That’s anything, so long as it’s engaged in behavior that would go against good as defined by the White God. As it’s really defined, not what comes out after two thousand years of religious politics. And weirdly, it kills them without any metaphysical effects occurring due to it, even in the case of entities holding up serious weight. In future jumps the sword switches to your moral compass… at the start of the jump, not changing every moment."
1266,,600,Sword of the Cross,The Dresden Files,Destruction ,"Um, wow. There are supposed to be only three of these, but it looks like someone just handed you a fourth one. The Swords, capital S, are extremely potent artifacts said to be set with one of the nails Christ was crucified with, and were made to level the playing field between Mortals and everything else. They're impossible to break, immune to any supernatural power, and cut through anyone, no matter how supernaturally tough they might be, like they were made of plain old flesh and bone. Faerie, dragon, twenty foot tall gorilla monster? They're all equal under the Eyes of God.

Sounds like a sure buy, yeah? Well, there's a catch, and it's a big one. The Swords were made for a specific purpose, and it's absolutely not just killing monsters. Any wielder who takes up the sword must have a selfless, worthy purpose, and without that kind of purpose in mind, their power will falter. You're not the one who judges, either – if the biggest son of a bitch in the world is surrendering, even if you know he'll stab you in the back five minutes later, then you'd better sheathe that sword. Even try to use it in violation of its purpose, and the bond between wielder and Sword will be broken, and the Sword will just be a chunk of metal until you go through some major penance or pass them off to a better candidate. Actually succeed, forcing it to commit an act which perverts its purpose like taking an innocent life? Then it's GONE, forever. Like, forever-forever, not just ten years. No refunds.

Also, just to forestall the inevitable questions about Holy Lightsabers, rather than contriving circumstances to break and reforge it you can just offer up any sword you've got in your Warehouse, and it'll be reforged into your brand new Sword. Keep in mind, though, that immune means immune. Magic, psionic, whatever you want to call it, reforge an abnormal sword, and it'll be a perfectly ordinary Sword when you're done. Technological weapons are fine as long as they've got physical blades to make use of. As for the lightsaber trick? Don't try to reproduce it. It's not a selfless purpose, you just want to look cool, and all you'll get is a holy hilt."
1267,,600,Soul Sucking Banshee,Dark Souls 2,Destruction ,"“Honeyed words promising a heavy downfall aren’t all you can do when by the side of those with power. You, who have the same maddened, furious origins as the other fragments, also have the same ability as the Squalid Queen. You have the power to suck away at the souls of other beings near you. Your thirst is nigh imperceptible to any but the most perceptive and spiritually aware, and it can prove highly lethal. Average humans can be left sick, and eventually dead, over the course of just a few days. A mighty dragon however could last an entire year before its health eventually degrades. Consumption of bits and pieces of the souls of others will both empower you over time depending on what you’re leeching off of, and provides sustenance. Multiple targets may be affected at a time.”"
1268,,600,Giant Soul ,Dark Souls 2,Destruction ,"“Vendrick took something most valuable to the Giants in his campaigns within their lands. That valuable something was the catalyst of Drangleic’s ruin, as well as a component in Aldia’s experiments. You appear to have been one of Aldia’s most important experiments, as whether or not your form is a natural one, you were put together with the soul of a giant in your breast. Somewhat larger, greater physical abilities with an emphasis on strength but also something more. Natural abilities of your bestial form are emphasized, and you’ve gained a curious property. Enemies before you almost seem to “erode.” That doesn’t mean they fall apart, however those setting themselves against you become more frail and easily damaged by your hand.”"
1269,,600,Just That Great,Dark Souls 2,Destruction ,"“Ten thousand swings of a sword followed by ten thousand more. Through the mundane, become exceptional. By being practical, become fantastical. Through the methods of man, become superhuman. One day you may become peerless. You are but a simple knight, but even you can elevate yourself to the status of legends. By fighting and using only the mundane skills and equipment that have carried you through your quests, you will find your once simplistic abilities becoming something more like ages past. Your sword hand through simple practice and combat will eventually swing harder and faster than any ordinary man could, no magical intervention involved. Your weapons despite being of ordinary make and iron will inevitably cleave through the hides of the toughest monsters. Your skill with combat will even grow to keep up with the greatest kings and souls left in this world. But, these things will only come with time. Months? Years? Your activity and dedication will settle that. Continue your travels, live simply, and maybe you will be praised as a god amongst men.”"
1270,,600,“Cornered Beast”,Dark Souls 1,Destruction ,"Long ago, Artorias fell to the abyss. When the nameless hero was forced to confront them, they soon learned that despite his broken and battered body that he was no less dangerous than he ever was. On purchase, your constitution becomes strange. You can never truly be broken or whittled down by an enemy, since you can only become more dangerous from such action. Whenever you’re left injured or broken, the rest of your body compensates to make up for those injuries. Like some kind of twisted berserker, you become stronger, faster, more agile, more dexterous and you become capable of yet more ridiculous feats. With both of your arms broken arms and your left foot mangled you could still hop around on one leg while twisting your great hammer around your body with your neck and stumps like the most dangerous paraplegic in Lordran. With Man’s Best Friends, your connection with beasts causes your primal instincts to swell and sharpen with damage as well, truly making you no more dangerous than when cornered and near defeat."
1271,,600,Old Hunter,Bloodborne,Destruction ,"“Hunters today are a dime a dozen, if blood and prayers weren’t the only form of currency left in Yharnam. Back, back, years ago, when the Workshop still operated, and Gehrman was still around though; those were truly the days. The Old Hunters, what formidable incarnations of skill. 

Like stepping out of the mists of time, Good Hunter, you are every bit the match of those who once stalked Yharnam’s shadows, who only exist now within scattered corners. You’re simply more more stealthy, more deadly, more refined; simply superior in every context compared to the average hunter. 

Beasts, Kin, Blood Drunk Hunters, even scattered clues and accounts of such threats allow you to quickly develop a plan of attack that can be executed with lethal efficiency. Equipment is always in pristine condition even in the midst of enemy territory, unless filth prove advantageous. 

Your ability to run circles around prey, bringing what’s necessary to kill them, leveraging it masterfully, and adapting to any unexpected interruptions; few could boast similar prowess in the field.”"
1272,,600,Squalid Beggar,Bloodborne,Destruction ,"“The birth of a beast is the death of a man. Some beasts even function like animate corpses, surviving with neither blood or flesh. Beware however, for those beasts that look to argue otherwise. Good Hunter, there’s something quite wrong with you. 

You have the qualities of a dark beast in your unturned form. Notably, your ability to cling to life is powerful, able to survive with most of your blood sucked away, and flesh picked from your bones, long as you mostly remain in one piece. It could even be said your content is redundant to your form.

It is as if your will alone is able to perpetuate movement, letting you move in disturbing ways, stretching and contorting limbs in a way no man ever could. Additionally, your body is able to produce man killing levels of electricity at will, though at the expense of your mental stamina.”"
1273,,600,"O, Flame! ",Elden Ring,Destruction ,"In times past, every single person who attempted to control the flame of frenzy succumbed to madness after a desperate internal struggle. And whether this is a meagre victory or a prelude to yet another tragedy, it seems you have a great affinity for magic governing fire of all kinds. Fireballs roar into short-lived rains of fire while dragon’s breath roars like a comet; while all fire magic benefits, the yearning for destruction within you is drawn most to unrestricted, wild, passionate destruction. The magic of the Frenzied Flame in particular is most empowered by your blazing gift. With certain unwholesome practices it would not be out of the question to pervert and warp other powers with the Flame’s destructive ways, whether by reducing a promising Finger Maiden into a self-immolating vessel for communion with the Frenzied Flame or perhaps becoming a spiritual entity capable of possessing others preserved by the Flame’s own endurance. Perhaps you have been embraced by the Three Fingers at some point before entering this world, for were you to cut loose and channel a truly potent source of flame (like that of the Giants’ forge) you could well burn down the Erdtree and any barrier it throws up in your path. And as you descend further into madness, as the conviction that enough is enough and this twisted world has to be reset, your power to burn it all away will only grow stronger."
1274,,600,Wings of the Undefeated,Elden Ring,Destruction ,"Your strength...extraordinary. In sheer skill with the blade, you are a prodigy of exceptional talent far and above others of your kind. Your dodges carry you nimbly across an arena. In your hand, a long blade flickers slashes so much faster than the eye can track that for many merely approaching you is certain death. From parries that others would deem impossible to vaulting attacks that hit from unseen angles, the sheer speed, dexterity and precision you boast could exploit the tiniest chinks in armour or cut down many a lesser foe unaware. Your strength and endurance is no less exceptional, such that a slim woman could lift a heavily armoured man to be cleanly impaled on her blade-and flick him away on it. You learn from every battle you fight, gaining the measure of your foes such that their every misstep and opening becomes plain as day to you with but a few exchanges-and while your greatest genius is reserved for duels and creating or honing martial techniques worthy of the Ashes of War, this can also be applied in large scale warfare to predict the movements of enemy troops and glean the weak links in their battle lines. It’s doubtful you could have ever known defeat in your lifetime, unless you crossed blades with the greatest of demigods."
1275,,600,WARRIOR! ,Elden Ring,Destruction ,"Before he was King Godfrey, the first Elden Lord was a mighty barbarian champion of the Badlands called Hoarah Loux. He led the War against the Giants. Fought the Storm Lord, alone. No foe could stand before his coming, and he ruled the battlefield. So great in size, that Morgott is like a small child in his arms. And now, it seems that you too have somehow obtained a similar physicality to the heroic build he boasts. Though you may not necessarily share all his experiences as the first Elden Lord, you fight like one who had done so all their life; some weapons may be more familiar to you than others, but none are strangers to you-and your masterful grace with all will brutally punish who assume you are but a dumb brute. But it is your uncanny strength focused into hand to hand that makes you truly fearsome, being to other men what dragons are to lizards.

With a single stomp you could raise jagged spikes from the earth, and leap flying over your foes in a single bound. With a weapon in hand, you could raise even greater shockwaves from the ground beneath you. And when you cut loose, your strength is even greater. Your battle cries can kill lesser men, even as they bolster your own might. With your bare hands, you could punch craters into the ground that soon after explode, toss men like ragdolls-and leap fast enough to catch and fling them at the earth anew. And your resilience is more akin to a great monster than the Tarnished you are at heart. Oh yes. Though you have the strength to rend men limb from limb and the swiftness to catch them in a single bound, in truth there is no great secret to your mighty prowess, no pact with foreign powers and no dark secret behind what you are. You have simply fought and accumulated Runes to the point where you are built. Different."
1276,,600,Duelist Champion,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Destruction ,Your skill and speed in combat make you among the most dangerous magical combatants the wizarding world has ever seen. Even highly trained aurors can be swatted aside as little more than nuisances. Not only is your skill prodigious but you seem to simply have more magical power behind your spells than other wizards and witches whenever you are in combat.
1277,,600,Malefic Scythe,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction ,"Created by sealing a Specter into a harvester’s scythe, this blade has a very straightforward power - it is infused with the power of “Reaper of Night”, absorbing souls from those it cuts down, and becoming more sharp, more keen, more willing and able to do violence. At the height of its power after absorbing at least a hundred souls, it is equivalent to the “Jabberwock” in its capacity for violence - slicing without being swung"
1278,,600,Steelbane,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Destruction ,"Blades, bows and shield. The people of the Realm lean upon their artifice, their magical treasures, and their weapons to protect them. All are just scrap under your hand. You are capable of chewing through steel and gems with your teeth if you already couldn’t, and what’s more, you can ‘absorb’ the power of magic artifacts and iron to enhance yourself, with the raw materials giving you stronger skin, muscle, and bones while the enchantments upon them become raw mana. With enough honing of this technique, you could even ‘drink’ the existing blessings and curses off of others to transform into mana."
1279,,600,Apocalypse Chime ,MtG - Homelands,Destruction,"This is the device that ruined the world, the device that ended the Great War by destroying the very mana systems it was fought over. The effects of ringing it are monstrous, causing a magical backlash that engulfs the world. Permanently disrupting all mana channels and fueling a cataclysm of colorless fire with an entire world’s worth of energy. Even those that manage to avoid the initial wave die soon after, the very soil draining their lifeforce.

The chime promises a cleansing, but no sane being could know the truth of it and still ring it. Creatures melt. Artifacts shatter. Planeswalkers wither to ash. The land dies. Green turns to
stone, stone crumbles to dust. Across the entire plane, the sound of Apocalypse rings loud. Nothing that needs mana can survive the colorless fire that chars the globe.

Luckily, the cloth-wrapped chime also comes with a large stone sarcophagus, which seals shut and protects its occupant from the magical backlash of the chime. This version of the magical coffin also has a simple quick-release, so you can easily get out afterwards."
1280,,600,Eldritch Madness ,MtG - Shandalar,Destruction,"Black magic offers knowledge unheard of by any other mage, but just as it grants such insights, so too can it take them away. Black mages are the undisputed masters of memory erasure, inducing madness and hallucinations in a target, and other such forms of psychic attacks to rend apart a victim’s very identity. You know such spells well, but more than that, you have mastered madness to a level unheard of. By channeling your power into your summoned creatures, your allies, or even your very own touch, you are capable of rendering those augmented in such a way into embodiments of mind-rending insanity. Much like the terrifying Hypnotic Specter, each blow delivered while under this effect will lash out against a target’s mind, memories, and identity, until nothing remains but a broken shell. Though maintaining such effects takes substantial amounts of  mana even for relatively small numbers of servants, the results are truly terrifying, and enough to make any mage who knows of your abilities quiver in fear... until even that knowledge is lost."
1281,,600,RIOT ,MtG - Ravnica,Destruction,"It’s easy enough to become angry. Any Gruul member fresh out of their grave can grasp hold of a flicker of rage, enough to lose track of things, destroy a few walls. You, however, understand that the most potent rage is not without some forethought. Naturally, you still should be as rage filled as possible, but having the ability to regulate your own rage, along with your strength and speed, is one of the most potent weapons a Gruul member can have. The difference between hitting quick and fast and waiting until you have the power to completely overwhelm your opponents is vital in order to smash as destructively as possible."
1282,,600,UNLEASH,MtG - Ravnica,Destruction,"Defense? Isn’t that just a messy thing that sometimes gets in the way of attacking? Why bother blocking when you could be dealing more damage? You can now channel any defensive energy or abilities into pure offensive power! Sure, their attacks will hurt like hell, but when you’re in the Cult of Rakdos, that’s hardly a downside! And if you hit them first, then you don’t need to worry about that anyway."
1283,,600,Wurmcoil Engine ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Destruction,"This massive mechanical worm-weapon is capable of tunneling through the ground with perplexing speed thanks to the glowing yellow-green acid it secretes from its mouth and its sharp maw, taking sustained artillery fire and leeching the life from those it consumes to repair its metallic caparace. While it will be vaguely loyal to you, it will not be capable of following complex orders on its own. Should you also have “A living weapon”, however, you may have the black germ pilot the Wurmcoil Engine, maintaining all of its abilities and benefiting from the living weapon’s obedience."
1284,,600,Perfection through Action,MtG - New Phyrexia,Destruction,"You've attained perfection as a means to an end- to change what you dislike about the world- the system itself. Whether working against a corrupt regime or totalitarian force, or anything which would suppress your freedom, you find yourself gifted when it comes to rallying rebels to your cause- even if your ideals are radically different, so long as your goal of thwarting your foe remains the same, you’ll find it easier to work with them, at least until it is over. You are likewise able to enter violent rages in combat, granting you increased speed, and causing even hardened warriors to cower in fear. Your focus on the “now” rather than long term plans has likewise granted you greatly enhanced skills in improvisation, and the effect of “And from scraps, perfection” has been boosted, letting you improve even already good materials further- where before you could make functional devices out of scrap, that same scrap can now be used to create masterpieces of machinery."
1285,,600,At The Storms Edge Lies A Blade,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Destruction,"Something that very few people are willing to admit is that the vast majority of people who step onto the battlefield simply don’t matter. They’re filler, a holding action, meant more to buy time for the REAL fighters to arrive, or for the wizard to cast the spell that will guarantee victory. Or, more accurately, for you to arrive. You are, quite simply, a warrior without peer, someone that outright changes the nature of battle simply for being a part of it. Beyond simply being strong, beyond simply being skillful - your mere presence on the battlefield exalts your allies and their cause in a manner that very few are prepared to deal with. Strength floods into their limbs, those who were exhausted gain a surge of energy to go one or two more rounds - and as long as you stay on the battlefield, these boons don’t fade away. With proper management and tactics, you could probably get away with launching two offenses at the same time, or possibly one right after the other, without a single drop in efficiency or iota of damage to your supply lines."
1286,,600,The Momentum Of Battle,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Destruction,"Battle is like water. It has an ebb, a flow, it can grind down the strongest of walls, or dash you against the rocks just as easily. Battle is also nothing like water, and poetic shitheads who think it is can honestly just suck it. With that said, reading the battlefield to determine that things are going well for you or that you need to retreat NOW is something that you can do with barely a glance at half a dozen soldiers, let alone the entire army. And more importantly, when things are going in your favor you simply seem to get stronger. There’s no real rhyme or reason to it - you can shrug off heavier blows, fight harder and for longer, so long as you are advancing. I suppose it might be better to say that when you lead them to victory, it becomes that much easier to claim that victory for your cause. Of course, if you falter and begin to lose? Well, morale will likely be the least of your issues."
1287,,600,A Clay Tablet Named Vengeance,MtG - Kamigawa,Destruction,"A clay tablet containing a curse of vengeance. This is one of the most potent acts of magic a group of casters can manage without being empowered by the mana of an entire land. This potent curse allows one to control shadows to form fully physical constructs able to fight even the likes of a Kami, an empowered ogre, or even an Oni in shear strength and on top of that the shadows fill in damages at an astounding rate to regenerate from injury. The damages that one can mete out with this curse are indeed astounding and one only has to break the tablet with a grudge in mind and the power will embolden every action towards that grudge’s completion. However the tablet is first and foremost a seal that holds the curse back, as the full force of such magics is terrifying to those with a lesser will, and even those who have nerves of steel will find the mental pollution of this curse trying.

Once broken a new tablet can be found in your Warehouse, or among your belongings, in around a week. The curse runs it course one grudge at a time and can’t stack for one grudge."
1288,,600,God Slaying Arts,MtG - Kamigawa,Destruction,"These are the so-called ‘dark art’ of the Kami Slayers. On most occasions these magics would be hunted down for destabilizing the natural order, but with the current state of affairs these arts are quite good to know. You have a great talent for the arts passed down in particular tribes of mountain dwelling ogres and humans. These arts encompass a series of rituals and skills that culminate in the elimination of the natural order, once such rites are completed the user shares the same abilities. Rites for these arts are varied and can be anything from quenching weapons in dragon's blood to branding heretical symbols upon the flesh of the victim before unleashing the final blow, however the method will always take a bit of prep work to do properly.

A user of these arts could fight like an Oni to slay a Kami, and the Kami's divine defenses would falter as if against those dark spirits. In more broad strokes this power can be used to reduce absolute supernatural defenses and immunities into resistances. Other things such as innate resistances would become feeble in the wake of these powerful skills and abilities. This doesn’t stack to make any absolute effect feeble.

Boosted: When taken with Jumper of Spirit and Flesh this allows you to teach these arts, though you will always be better at them than those you teach. In addition this grants a training regimen that could take a normal human and enhance their body, spirit, and mind in a number of ways to the point where one taught these arts would be as tough and strong as an ogre. After buying this perk you are treated as if you’ve already undergone such training.

Boost Requires Jumper of Spirit and Flesh(MtG-Kamigawa)"
1289,,600,Hero of the Clachan,MtG - Lorwyn,Destruction,"While all kithkin feel the thoughtweave in the back of their mind when they are amongst their fellows, a select few benefitted more greatly from the connection. The heroes of their villages are empowered by thoughtweft more directly than others. They may spend much of their lives relying on it, using the urging of the kithkin who love, respect, and admire them to guide their decisions and give them strength. Empowered by this hero worship, these kithkin are more like heroic avatars of their communities.

As the new Hero of your home clachan, you share in this bolstering. The faith of the village's kithkin raising you to heights few others could reach. But not just anyone could win a place as a clachan's hero, it does require actual skill too. Accordingly, you're a ranger without comparison. You know the fields, the hills, and the forests around your clachan like the back of your hand, could fly a glider better than anyone, and your skill as an archer is celebrated throughout the community. If you had a few minutes preparation, you'd be able to take down a full pack of a dozen elvish hunters without breaking a sweat (as long as you stay out of range from their swords).

And to keep up the living legend created around you, you will need more than mere deeds and skills. Luckily, you're also more than talented enough to translate your escapades into verse to form ever-popular, evolving ballads rhyming couplets about your exploit, ones that would joyfully compel kithkin festival-goers into spontaneous sing-alongs. You'll only have to teach them the words."
1290,,600,Parasite Blade,MtG - Innistrad,Destruction,"A replica of Sorin's chosen weapon, the Parasite Blade. Able to suck the life of those it cuts directly, and feed vampires in place of traditional means. The blade is capable of killing giants and even small cuts will exhaust most, as it saps their life. It is of such malevolence and so concentrated in its infusion of black mana that it reflects no light."
1291,,600,Unmaking,MtG - Innistrad,Destruction,"It is cruel beyond all other things to ask a creator to destroy their creation, or a parent their child. Yet sometimes that is exactly what is needed. Anything you create you may unmake, unravelling it at its base. Beings formed of magic unravelling, as the spell that created them does. Technology will fall to its base components. All things you make you can unmake. Though that doesn’t mean you do not do so with a heavy heart."
1292,,600,A Life Well Lived ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Destruction,"The triumph of those Planeswalker’s who embrace Red, is not that of attaining their ideal life, for such a thing truly does not exist and limits one's freedom. But instead realising that a perfect life can’t get better, where as a life well lived can always foster new adventures, wants, and desires in the future. Your life has granted you a very rare skill among those who embrace Red due to its logical paradox. You have control, specifically control over your own life.

This manifests itself in your abilities, where as your most powerful abilities are no less powerful or destructive you can wield them immense precision. A raging inferno in all directions can have all that destructive power channeled into a beam scything through much more dangerous targets with much better results, a meteor you summon falling from the sky can break formations on a mountain without shattering it and leaving your allies completely without a scratch. This is not merely reducing collateral damage, this is focusing the power lost on unintended targets, like the ground or the surroundings, and instead directing all that power at the intended target. Just keep in mind you still need to hit your target which isn’t necessarily assured."
1293,,600,Self Fulfillment ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Destruction,"The triumph of those Planeswalker’s who embrace Black, is not selfish survival above all else, instead they strive for much greater ambition, the power to do what they want. When things are at their bleakest, you can turn the tide since you are best when everything depends on you. Your decisions are powerful and the more participants in a conflict, the larger your power will grow in that moment.

If you are facing a great hero or villain one on one, then you will only be able to operate on whatever power you possess. But if you are in a conflict with great armies, you will find yourself empowered such that having you on a side would be a war winning advantage. Likewise great armies you face alone will also empower you as the weight of the conflict benefits you in some manner. Now the main question that enters the minds of leaders when you become involved in a battle is simply. Which side are you on?"
1294,,600,Nightblood,Warbreaker,Destruction,"“Would you like to destroy some evil today?” A black sword constantly emitting a dark smoke that falls instead of rising. The to-date only known Class Four Entity, a sword imbued with a thousand Breath and the base command to ‘destroy evil.’ Pity Nightblood was never given the ability to distinguish good from evil. Nightblood is sapient, if oddly childlike, and can cut easily through anything but aluminum and the shardblades/plate he was made in imitation of. Those who are evil or self-serving will on sight be overwhelmed with greed for the sword, killing their companions over it before dying as he drains the Investiture and life from the wielder. Good people are disgusted and repulsed. Someone who has used Nightblood a few times, or paid cp for him, will be immune to both aura effects."
1295,,600,The Desolation Engine,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"A magical Weapon of Mass Destruction. Simply put, this is a bomb. It has an appearance like a stone hourglass, containing a green liquid that turns red when the device is armed. When it goes off, the Desolation Engine annihilates everything within a one mile radius; every living thing, building, tree, and stone is obliterated. You may remotely arm and detonate this device, set it to explode on a timer, or even invoke specific arming and detonation conditions. For example, one Desolation Engine was modified to arm itself when held by a specific individual, and then detonate once it left his hands. Your Desolation Engine will respawn in your Warehouse a month after it is used."
1296,,600,The Scepter of the Ancients,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"A golden rod the length of a thigh bone, ending in a large black crystal, this weapon is a legendary artifact crafted by the Faceless Ones. It is capable of firing bolts of black lightning which reduce anything they strike to dust. This lightning can even harm targets with high levels of magic resistance, and can kill gods. Additionally, the weapon sings to its user, warning them when enemies approach them. However, those who carry the blood of the Ancients are undetectable to this defense. Finally, only one person may use the Scepter at any given time; as long as you live, no one else will be able to wield its power. And unlike some people, being an undead won’t count as no longer being alive. If you so choose, you may import this into an existing weapon, granting it the same properties."
1297,,600,Born of the Stars,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Destruction,"One of Eris’ greatest minions, you are a beast beyond reckoning. A creature born from one of the countless constellations in the starry sky. Your strength is truly something of legend, able to sink ships with great ease. Your hide would turn any blow short of concentrated cannon fire. I’m sure your mistress will be please with such a powerful servant."
1298,,600,Armour of the Immortal,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"In his youth, Zayzafon was a great general who loved nothing more than fighting alongside his troops on the front line. However, as his years caught up on him, his body became more and more frail and decrepit, until eventually he was rendered bedridden. Not wanting such a brilliant warrior to go to waste, though, Lord Barbarossa approached the elderly general and, through a complex magical ritual, transferred his consciousness into a suit of armour, allowing him to fight without end forever more. Though you are still flesh and blood, you now possess a suit of heavy plate armour, simple in its design except for the two large horns protruding from its bucket helm, with many of the same abilities.

This armour extraordinarily durable, somehow being able to stand up to the strikes of Fanalis and Metal Vessel users without breaking. Even if it does get damaged, though, you are able to reshape any part of this armour with your will, nigh-instantly repairing damaged segments, sprouting dozens of metal lances to impale your foes,  creating makeshift tools, or any other creative uses you can come up with of. In addition, you are also bestowed with Zayzafon’s stamina while wearing this armour, allowing you to fight endlessly without tiring so long as you’re still clad in it.

But that isn’t all. If you happen to die or your body is damaged beyond all repair, you may choose to instead transfer you soul and consciousness into this suit of armour, using it as your new, hollow body. You can only use this feature once per Jump, though, so it’s really only a last resort, and if this armour then ends up being destroyed, you will die for good."
1299,,600,Assimilated,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"When in dire need of more strength to protect those they care most about, a Household Vessel user can sometimes undergo a process known as Assimilation – they fuse with the Household spirit of the Djinn inside their vessel, sacrificing their human form for vastly increased power. It seems that you, too, have undergone this process. Your form in now distinctly inhuman, appearing more akin to a humanoid beast that towers over other men. You’re stronger and faster than any normal man, able to tear into dozens of trained assassins and somehow come out on top.

Taking this perk grants you one free purchase of the ‘Household Vessel’ item, which fuses with your very being to grant you its powers as an inherent part of yourself. For example, a Household Vessel that can shoot fireballs may grant you a potent flame breath, while one that produces a poison that saps the strength of its victims could allow you to produce said poison from your teeth and claws.

Oh, one more thing that’s worth noting. A Fanalis who takes this perk doesn’t just take on any appearance, but that of a Red Lion: A hulking beast from another world with skin like steel and power that exceeds even that of a Fanalis. In addition, these Red Lions are known to possess an incredible resistance to magic, rendering them immune to all but the greatest of spells."
1300,,600,Rukh Absorption ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Destruction,"Once someone dies, their soul is carried away by their Rukh and returned to the Great Flow, where it is stripped of its memories before being reincarnated into another body. Strangely, however, you have developed a unique way of disrupting this cycle of rebirth. When in the vicinity of someone on the verge of death or recently deceased, you can intercept their soul’s departure and absorb it into your own. As their soul melds with your own, the deceased individual’s personality and consciousness quickly fade away, but a small fragment of them remains in the form of their most significant memories and knowledge. With time and practice, you may be able to improve this skill further to retain more of their memories, and perhaps some of their skills too.

However, this process does not come without risk. If you carry out this process on someone against their will, you must overpower their will with your own, for failure in this task will allow them to instead claim your body for their own and cause your consciousness to dissolve instead, effectively killing you. I’d be wary about using this on too many people at once, too, lest their combined wills be enough to triumph over yours."
1301,,600,Arbarian,Magi: Alma Torran,Destruction,"In a world where magic reigns supreme, many look down on the martial arts as unsophisticated and redundant. After all, what good is a sword when you can burn a man to ash from miles away? Those arrogant Magicians quickly stop laughing when caught in an isolation barrier and their beloved magical powers are stripped from them, leaving them helpless before even a peasant with a pitchfork.

You needn’t worry about such petty issues, though, as you’re just as proficient with a sword as with a spell, perhaps even better. You’re one of the greatest swordsmen in the world, with such skill at arms that your enemies will fall before you by the horde, cut down as easily as a farmer harvests wheat, and even other masters of the blade are almost novices when compared to you. Even if all your supernatural powers were stripped away, you could take on half a dozen expert swordsmen with nothing but skill alone and likely come out on top.

What’s more, you’re pretty talented at mixing your magical and martial might, perhaps wreathing your blades with flame or manipulating gravity to enhance the power behind your blows to reach even greater heights of power. The only one who could claim to be your equal would be Arba, Solomon’s right-hand and the future founder of Al-Thamen.

If you wish, you may choose to gain this proficiency with a weapon other than the sword."
1302,,600,Old Memory,Fate/Extra CCC,Destruction ,"The Earth was created, and all things were formed, and the Earth developed into the world you’re familiar with. But there is one thing that still remembers what was before. A thing formed before the concept of weapons of tools was even devised, its physical form is almost irrelevant to its function, but quite striking nonetheless. Having the general size and shape of a longsword, it deviates in its blade, possessing what looks to be some kind of three-part drill instead of any normal weapon. It is black with red cuneiform letterings, with some gold inscribed with blue letters in its handguard and hilt. Despite the odd shape, it is very functional as a weapon, dealing disproportionate amounts of damage despite its lack of an edge.

And yet that’s merely the surface aspect of it. Its true power is an imitation of the miracle of genesis, returning all to what was the beginning, and then forging it anew. Its red winds annihilate anything it comes into contact with, leaving only the true form of reality before it was even created, and then tearing apart even that. No matter the power or status of a target, being hit by this thing’s true power spells their end. Of course, utilizing the full power of this thing will be beyond you even as a high rank Servant, but with sufficient upgrading of your Matrix, perhaps you could show off the star of creation that split Heaven and Earth. Maybe, should you somehow be able to practice with this thing, you’d be able to utilize it to terraform lifeless worlds and realities into something more to your tastes. Such a process would certainly be counterintuitive, however, given that the thing’s power destroys everything, but such was its original purpose, and perhaps you might allow it to fulfill such purpose once more. Just make sure to avoid a certain blond king. Nothing good would come from such a meeting."
1303,,600,I Am Spartacus,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"Men can be monsters. Not just of the heart, the way everyone has heard a hundred times before. But of the flesh. Taking their bodies to such heights that they shatter any possible notion that their
muscles still obey they laws that restrict all men. You’ve rebelled against those limits on your body, even as a mere human, and become too huge to ignore. Your body is a marvel of muscle, with the
physical power to wrestle and struggle with powerful demigods like Heracles, though you couldn’t
truly do more than prove an able but futile contest for him, but also endure such a beings blows to
your body. Your endurance is your greatest strength, you even possess a moderate healing factor
that replenishes most cuts and bone breaks in several minutes. But you can take that endurance
much further. When people inflict damage to you, you can convert that damage into magical energy
within you, still suffering the wound, but able to either use that new source of energy as normal or
enhance your body’s physical abilities and rate of healing with it directly. This energy can even be
used to enhance physical objects you touch, from weapons to the debris caused by your attacks, and
enough build up will cause you to grow in size and mutate into a terrifying monster. There is no limit
to the build up and with enough energy, you can unleash powerful magical blasts that can erase
entire mountains instantly, but the energy will slowly fade out if you cease to take damage from an
opponent."
1304,,600,Brahmastra,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction ,"The greatest of gifts, mightiest of the gods’ weapons. The Brahmastra in it’s many forms comes to
rest in your hands, the ultimate divine weapon against demons. A weapon that can take on any form
of weapon needed by the wielder, it is a tool for punishing those that go against Heavens’ will. Even
the mightiest of Divine Spirits will find their bodies cleaving before the stroke of this blade and the
most terrible demon kings quail when targeted by the Bramastra in arrow form. More so then, as
the weapon is both enormously potent against demons and far more powerful when used in ranged
form. Individually, it would allow opposing a threat well beyond your normal level but a ranged blow
against a demon could bring low even the greatest evils in a few strikes. 

Becoming connected to you, the Brahmastra will return to your being when called, stored away
within your soul when not needed for combat. This connection also allows you to channel magical
energy and powers through the weapon, acting as a magnifier for such things against your enemies. Even a modest fireball could turn into raging torrents from the sword of the gods."
1305,,600,Trishula Shakti,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Destruction ,"The three pronged trident of the King of the Gods. Avatar of creation, existence and destruction, it is
a weapon without peer. The spear itself releases it’s true power when held in your hands, having the
destructive force to shatter planets and destroy whole worlds with a thrust or throw. Each of it’s
points confers a unique power relating to the trinity of existence, used as you desire.

The first point represents Destruction and releases divine lightning on command. This lightning
unmakes whatever it comes into contact with, short of a fully enlightened Buddha or God of solar
scale. What is destroyed by this lightning is done so completely, impossible to bring back short of a
reality changing miracle, such as a wish from a Holy Grail or the act of a Bodhisattva of great power. Physical material, magical spells, even the fabric of the world that creates a texture can all be
undone. The lightning moves to your will, like gentle waves or a raging storm, guided to every target
by thought. 

The second point is lesser, not so deeply represented by Shiva’s aspects, but still potent. Maintenance of reality that allows the spear to reinforce reality as it is, greatly hindering attempts to
change it. From magic to authority to mundane methods, the trident can be planted on the ground
and extreme resistance to change in the world you are currently in, preventing reality from being
altered or commanded by others without immense power. 

Finally, creation as the third point. When holding the spear, you may cast your own magic through
the trident and out of this final point. The process immensely improves the power of such things,
increasing them to hundreds of times their normal strength. It becomes a tool to aid the shaping of
the world around you, creating and manipulating using your own knowledge with the trident as a
tool."
1306,,600,Demon King,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"Japan is more than just some island filled with ghosts and spirits of old. These witches and youkai
and outdated swordsman just don’t comprehend what the rising sun means for this country but it
won’t be forever. More and more will appear those that cut down the mystery that holds the nation
back from it’s destiny. You’re one of these chosen ones, given the power to fight back against the
gods in ways they cannot understand. You are naturally much more capable at starting and
supporting revolutions against established powers or governments, seeing yourself and your fellow
rebels much more fortunate when fighting together against such order. 

Your entire being is infused with the power to harm mystery and the beings filled with it. The greater
the mystery of your opponent, the more fantastical or magical or legendary they are meant to be, the more powerful you become when challenging them. This also applies twice over to those who
have a divine nature, boosting you a second time. Your body, your weapons and even spells or other
abilities become more powerful from this, albeit only against the right targets. With an exertion of
energy, you are even able to drag all those around you into a Reality Marble created from this anti- mystery power. Manifesting as a blazing battlefield hell, it subjects those other than you within it to
heat and fire. The greater their mystery and divinity, the hotter and wilder these flames become. Those without such things feel only a bit of heat but great gods and mythical heroes can find all their
power scorched away in these hell fires. Should it not be enough, you can also summon large and
powerful skeletons with burnt-black bones to attack those trapped in this dimension or partially
summon the same entities outside of it for aid in combat."
1307,,600,Three Thousand Worlds,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"The three thousand arquebuses that may one day change Japan. Called to your hand and presence
by will, you are able to summon these matchlock rifles and control them with your mind, aiming and
firing each one as if personally holding them. They do not run dry on shot, taking only a few seconds
to reload, but are no more powerful than ordinary matchlocks right now. Against those riding a
creature or otherwise known for cavalry combat, the matchlocks display several times their normal
power and easily tear through samurai and horse in a single shot. But even without any boost, three
thousand focused shots can destroy many foes, particularly rained down every six seconds. If you
have any magical energy of your own, you can charge it into one or more of the guns to directly
amplify their power.

Possessing these guns, stored in some form of pocket dimension normally, also teaches you a
bizarrely effective ‘gun-kata’ that allows you to fight effectively with muskets even in close combat, utilising them as swords, for parries and rapidly swapping your guns to fire quickly. If you have other
firearms, you can also add them in place of one of your three thousand muskets. Replenishing the
ammunition of more powerful weapons will take comparatively longer for the magic here."
1308,,600,True Steel,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"The pride and joy of one of the greatest swordsmiths in history. While without decoration, the sword
in your hands is among the most potent and valuable in all of Japan. A perfect katana, whose quality
and specifications appear to have been molded to fit your body and style specifically. Even a novice
with this in hand would feel like they could move as a master does. The blade itself cuts without
hesitation or restriction when swung with the intent to do so, allowing it to cut through not just any
physical matter but even non-physical presences and concepts. Spirits die as easily as mortal men to
the sword and the barriers between worlds or dimensions can be sliced open with a flick of the wrist. Combined with the skill to strike at conceptual ideas without this sword, it can even allow for
outright destruction of what you attack, instead of merely severing it.
 
The legendary sword will not break no matter the pressures you put it through, always adapting to
your body and fighting style to remain a true partner in battle. In the thick of it, the sheer power that
radiates off the sword can even create an aura around you, shining red and gold."
1309,,600,Godslayer,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Destruction ,"The gods of this world seem to be mighty but only to those who do not realise the potential within
their own forms. The gods are far from the invincible overlords they once came close to being and
these days, are indeed just another mountain for a hero to conquer. You’ve been training yourself
for this feat and have already slain many minor divine spirits, which has embedded a curious aspect
of power in your spirit. Your actions have a far greater effect against any divine being, even just
things that call themselves divine to a lesser extent, such that your blows that might normally only
bruise or scratch will deliver actual wounds instead. You can easily sense the presence of any divine
being or their servants within a vast area around yourself, enabling for the easy hunting of such
arrogant creatures, and you possess an immense degree of resistance to their powers of Authority, allowing any divine being to use a tenth of their domain-based powers at most. Of course, you have prepared yourself as even with this, a god is no easy prey. While you do not have the skill or abilities
that other perks earlier may give, you find yourself a incredibly accomplished combatant with a
enormous variety of weapons. You won’t fight any Gods of the Spear to a stand still but anything
much less is easy hunting. Your raw physical and magical abilities are quite astonishing, only being a
few steps below that of a proper demigod, though as yet you seem to lack any magical training."
1310,,600,Curruid Coinchenn,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Destruction ,"The dreaded body of the beast from which Gae Bolg, the thorny spear of death, was made has now
been harvested and reformed into a strange but very powerful suit of armour. Covering most of your
body but leaving the chest and face bare, though it does include a hood, Curruid Coinchenn is a
partially living armour that wards away even the blows of magical spears like Gae Bolg, while also
massively magnifying the strength and endurance of the one who wields it, such that they would be
at least ten times as strong as they originally were. It even heals the wearer at a significant pace of
any injuries they take on. The armour is covered in cursed spikes, similar to Gae Bolg itself, which
deliver wounds that will not heal naturally or through weaker magical means. Finally, when activated
in full, the armour will fully cover your body and turn you into a rampaging beast, amplifying your
physical abilities even further and letting you extend and fire off the spear-like implements in your
body, though they do not have the strange powers Gae Bolg has."
1311,,600,Promised Victory,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Destruction ,"There’s no shame in adoring the legend of King Arthur. A famous tale known across the globe and
for good reason. That shining knight symbolised victory to all who fought on the battlefield, particularly so to their English descendants, and nowhere is that more purely expressed than the
golden sword Excalibur. Your own obsession with the Once and Future King was such that it called
on part of this legend, the myth of the sword, and made it part of your very being. 

Any tool you hold can become Excalibur. Or at least, a version of it. The golden sword manifests at
your command from your weapon, be it a stick or a sword of great magical power in it’s own right. It
works almost identically to the holy sword, able to convert magical energy into greatly magnified
heat and light, resulting in an annihilating laser blast or slash. The quality of Excalibur will depend on
the base tool you used to manifest it and many tools will crumble from the strain. A stick’s maximum
power could still split thick trees in two before turning to ash but a sturdy sword might leave a large
theatre ruined from a half hearted slash of light. The limitation is that, as mighty as your power can
be, it can never truly match the original Excalibur’s scale, even with the greatest of base tools. "
1312,,600,The Mist,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Destruction ,"An old shuttered lantern, hiding a deadly magic inside. Opening the shutters and touching the candle
inside will rapidly produce a deadly mist, to any but yourself. Made from a mix of magical curses and
sulfuric acid, it rapidly burns away at anything it touches. Eyes fester, throats and lungs blister and
burn, even skin or muscle rapidly begins to boil off of bones. While those of supernatural durability
may resist the burns, the mist has other deleterious effects. Magecraft is significantly harder to use
while within the fog, the mist interferes with such energies, and movements are rendered sluggish
even in those unharmed by the mist. 

The mist expands quickly, to a limit of around a hundred meters in any direction from the lantern, hitting a Bounded Field that limits it’s progress any further. However, the user of the lantern can
control the mist finely, limiting it to only the insides of a building or creating a constant free space
around certain people they wish unharmed. Others trapped within the bounded field lose all sense
of direction and even memory of their location, causing those familiar with their current locale to
become lost, and preventing anyone without magical spells or senses from being able to leave the
mist. Needless to say, it makes it far more difficult to notice your presence or movements if they’re
thus affected. 

The lantern can be taken within your body, removing the weakness of temporarily damaging or
destroying the item before it reappears in a few hours, but this forces the mist to be constantly
active and automatically target all beings with magical energy within it’s potential radius. While you
can prevent it from attacking non-magical beings, the mist is uncontrollable in those other regards."
1313,,600,Old Man,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Destruction ,"Assassination is an art. It’s one you realised needed to be cultivated and honed. But it is also
something you realised would be better grown by others that could truly master those arts. Perhaps
you felt you never could become a true assassin because you already had such a talent for death
that you could no longer hide from any prey you sought. When your presence brings visions of death
to your targets, it becomes impossible to hide. But that is the fate for the assassin of assassins. Your
nature is that of a simple and straightforward dealer of death. Through this option, you do not have
a dozen tricks or the skill to craft the perfect trap or the ability to talk your way into the heart of any
man. You do not need it. Your sheer, natural power leaves even dragons and demons of the highest
orders realising that they face at least an equal, if not a superior, in physical might. Your speed is
such that only the greatest warriors of mankind could even recognise you had moved before their heads slip from their necks. Even should they be able to see you move, your skill in combat without a
weapon or with one of almost any kind is almost on the level of the gods of war themselves.
 
Your affinity for death is so powerful that you are not even limited to the killing of physical matter, as you can strike at and kill things even on a immaterial or conceptual level. Splitting a soul in half, cutting a demon out of a man, erasing a magical contract between two beings with a strike or
destroying the lack of a concept of death by a mighty slash. Even immortal beings cease to be in your
presence. It has also given you a connection to strange flames of the underworld, manifesting as
powerful blue fire that you can freely summon, allowing you to attack or even teleport through the
flames, as well as the ability to control sand and the desert on a enormous scale, burying entire cities
in sandstorms. The one downside is that those you seek to kill can now sense the evening bell tolling
for them as you approach, warning them that their death is nigh and showing them a horrifying
vision of you as you prepare to strike, even if you can perfectly conceal yourself from any being. It is
a good thing though, that your prey would always see your face just as they die and carry it to the
next world with them. "
1314,,600,Nameless ‘Sword’,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Destruction ,"It is called a sword for the convenience of those who cannot comprehend what it truly is. Something
that predates ‘Sword’, that predates almost all creations of man, and exists solely to bring
destruction to the World and reveal the Truth. In ancient times, a golden king would lay on this
blade the name ‘Ea’ but that is nothing more than a personal styling.

The nameless weapon in your hands has the hilt and guard of a sword but the blade far more closely
resembles a drill. Despite the drill-tip and the rounded edges, the blade remains dangerous as a
weapon. Perhaps too much so, as almost anything that comes in contact with the blade is destroyed
even when swung by a novice. Even great artefacts of the ancient times are torn through like they
were made of paper to the swing of the nameless weapon. When wished, the weapon will unleash a
burst of force and energy around itself, hitting only what the wielder wishes, and acting as if the
wielder had hit those targets many times over.

The true power of ‘Ea’ is revealed when the user pushes their own energy into the weapon and
activates it, causing the weapon to rapidly spin and gather power. This is Enuma Elish, the
overloaded activation of the weapons’ attack functions, massively magnifying the energy placed into
the weapon to create an attack that surpasses all others. The spinning of the blade creates a current
of wind and magic that when unleashed, races forward towards the target. Even with a minor
activation of this power, it will rend time, space and the reality of the World apart to leave a void
that shows the Truth beneath it. A true activation of this at full force would make for certain
annihilation of anything caught in this rent in reality, such that the only method of survival would be
to not be hit in the first place. The weapon can easily destroy smaller Worlds, pocket realities and
small dimensions, returning those within to the larger reality outside. But should enough energy be
put into the weapon, there is no true upper limit to what the weapon may destroy and it can
potentially cause a wound significant enough in a reality as to shatter the rest of it as that wound
spreads further. You may import an existing blade into this weapon option."
1315,,600,Azrael,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Destruction ,"A huge black blade, a broadsword that looks like it was made to be wielded by a man seven feet tall. Yet, when you hold it, it does not feel any heavier than a feather. Indeed, you swing the blade as if
you were a master of the sword, regardless of your actual expertise in such matters. Almost as if the
sword wishes to be used in battle and will show you the way to do so. The first time you use this black blade, Azrael, in battle, you’ll discover it’s power. A single cut, no matter how miniscule, brings
death. The mere presence of the blade will weaken and rot your foes but regardless of how strong,
important or resistant the enemy may be, a cut from Azrael has a chance of killing them. The greater
the cut, the higher the chance of instant death becomes. Even a mortal has a good chance to survive
should you barely nick the tip of their finger but even a true and fleshly god might be utterly
destroyed in an instant should your dark weapon pierce their heart. The blade kills truly, leaving no
chance to return for it’s victims, and will strike without regard to the presence of the physical or not. You may import an existing weapon into this role."
1316,,600,America Striker,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Destruction ,"With the cry of an Eagle, the might of America crashes down on the foe! You have a American Flag
that when held high, summons the Spirit of America itself, taking the form of one of the many folk
heroes or legends of the country’s past. Imbued with the conceptual power of the history of America
in the current world, it strikes down at the foe with annihilating force. Even a mountain could not
stand up to this fantastic summon but the spirit can only maintain itself for a few minutes before it
fades. The spirit will actually grow in power with the America in the current world, becoming
stronger the more developed, expanded and powerful the United States has become and lasting onger as well! It won’t get weaker then here but the spirit does seem sadder when summoned in
worlds with a weak or missing US of A. The spirit may or may not actually just be Paul Bunyan
dressing up in different crummy outfits that look like other American heroes and legends. Up to the
user. Fuck yeah!
You may import a country you possess into this item instead to make it the spirit of said country, rather than of America. Traitor."
1317,,600,Truth of the World,Angel Notes,Destruction ,"They come to your world, bringing death and terror. They say they have no concept of death, that
they cannot even comprehend what failure is. That’s alright. You’ve always been a good teacher. With your fists and blades and weapons, you can force these concepts and many others onto an
enemy, making them part of their very being. The undying can die. The eternally victorious can lose. Those fated for a single path in life are given freedom. Each of your blows can imprint one such
concept onto something it successfully strikes. What limits you is that you can only teach what you
yourself comprehend. If you cannot die, you cannot introduce death to a being that does not have it.
If you don’t weaken to old age, you can’t make something weak from age either."
1318,,600,Saint of the Sun,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"If there was ever a morning person, you’d be the guy. And also an evening person, funnily enough. Why? Because it seems like the sun just can’t get enough of you. During the hours of 9AM to 12PM
and 3PM to 6PM, you’ll find that the sun charges your overall power and individual abilities until
they are three times their normal power, at no further cost to you than normal. Additionally, any
damage you receive in this state is greatly reduced, enough that attacks that might harm you
normally are now barely even scratches. If you could find some way to maintain the presence of the
sun in a condition similar to the hours of power you have, you might even gain this boost for longer
than normal. Lastly, even when outside of your normal hours, you can briefly activate the sun power
for a few seconds, though this is terribly tiring."
1319,,600,End of Eras,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"For every truly great hero, there is a truly terrible foe that lays him low at the end of his story. The
dragon that kills the king after his pride leads him to ruin, the traitorous knight that ruins the
kingdom out of jealous rage, the former friend that stabs an emperor in the back because he has
gone too far. These heroes that are destined for great things are defeated by beings like you, the
villains of the story. You have the ability to break through things like fate and destiny in order to kill
those who should not die yet and stop stories that should yet go on. Luck and the protection of a
story are nothing before you and indeed, the greater the fate and more protected by destiny your
opponent is, the more powerful you seem to become when faced against them. The Once and
Future King, despite their lofty purpose, is truly never weaker than when before you."
1320,,600,Rhongomyniad,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"The lance that shines to the end of the world, one of the two great artefacts held by King Arthur. This lance is now in your possession, as a copy of the one that the King will come to hold. This
weapon is just a reflection of a much greater construct, a pillar that holds apart the two sides of the
world. That of reality and the side where mystery, gods and phantasmal beasts makes their home. As a lance, it can pierce any armour and strike through any defence. By calling out it’s name, one can
even release a blast of light sourced from the pillar it represents, an incredibly powerful attack. However, the lance is restricted by the same 13 Rules that bind Excalibur, limiting it’s power unless
used in the right conditions. If the lance were to be broken, the two sides of the world would
combine into one, filling the world back up with all kinds of fantasy. In fact, Rhon retains this quality
even in future worlds, allowing you to break the lance to fill the world with magic, myths and
mystery appropriate to it. The lance will be restored at the beginning of your next jump and if
repaired while in the same jump as it was broken in, it will separate the worlds once more."
1321,,600,Holy Sacrament ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"You do not simply wield holy weapons -you ARE a holy weapon. Whether as a side effect of a past curse or a quirk of your lineage, you are a bit beyond the average human being - your body alone qualifies as a holy weapon, able to strike spirits and monsters as though you were the living blade of a saint, greatly damaging the demonic and the malevolent by touch alone, should you so will it. You can sense the presence of supernatural monsters or great evil within a city block-sized area, and track them with all the skill of an expert hunter. Your physical abilities are likewise enhanced - your strength is enough to bend steel, your speed is enough to keep up with a car moving at full speed, and your durability allows you to survive bullets and piercing wounds with a fair amount of ease, though removal of limbs or vital organs still can’t be shrugged off with this alone. Finally, in your hands,any already-enchanted items or weapons designed as ‘holy’ are twice as effective, letting you tear through Dead Apostles with ‘common’ instruments like Black Keys and cutting a bloody swath through dozens of them with something like the Seventh Scripture. You are the one who hunts heretics and monsters in the night - and now, you embody that purpose.
"
1322,,600,Living Antibody ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"The Counter Force. The planet’s collective will to survive made manifest, a passive force designed to act to protect it from any extinction event or existential threat. As you were created by the planet to enforce its will (or are some odd exception to Gaia’s old desire to exterminate humans), you may tap into the Counter Force to do battle with and exterminate such threats. When facing anything that threatens either yourself or the existence of the planet you reside on, you may call on the planet’s own will to survive to empower you, greatly increasing your own abilities and powers to match the threat -against something you could easily dispose of, the boost is minor and almost intangible. But Against a rampaging beast ready to tear the entire world apart and with the ability to do so,your blows become strong enough to send them doubling back, but only ‘just’ enough to overcome them. Note that the planet itself must be alive for you to draw strength from - a dead or dying world yields little or nothing to empower you, and if you yourself are an active threat that world’s survival, it will actively refuse to aid you. Woe if you encounter a foe that is stronger than the collective will of an entire planet, for this alone won’t be able to help you.
"
1323,,600,False Eyes of Death Perception ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"Technically, the true name for these is ‘Mystic Eyes of Life Perception’ or would be along those lines if it was properly identified. You are able to perceive the ‘life force’ that sustains a living being, appearing as lines and points around said living being. By cutting along or damaging these lines and points, you can greatly damage the being in question as their life force is burned away, likely killing them if enough damage is inflicted. However, you cannot truly see ‘death’, and as such cannot actualize it upon a living being or even an unliving or inanimate object - thus rather than instantly killing the target, it merely critically damages them until their bodies cannot take much more. In short, all these Eyes can do is inflict damage upon that which lives, the same as any weapon or method of murder.
"
1324,,600,Barrel Replica ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"A copy of the greatest weapon in the armory of the Alchemists of Atlas. Its Progenitor is a conceptual weapon, composed of the mysterious Fifth True Theoretical Element,that will one day be wielded by a normal human to slay the Ultimate One of Venus in a single shot. While this is not that terrible weapon, the Barrel Replica is still a thing to be feared. It Enforces the idea of mortality on your foes by putting out a 'toxin' which has attack power in proportion to that being’s natural lifespan. Truly immortal beings will not be slain by this,though most will find it painful enough that their abilities and form may be stunted considerably with enough damage. As a rule, if it doesn't need a body to survive this weapon can't kill them. The wounds it inflicts will heal at the pace of a normal human being regardless of how fast it would normally heal. At its highest output you will need to anchor the weapon,else it will simply blow its way out of your hands and through whatever is behind it. You may use it in its current form as a pistol, have it reforged into a weapon of your choice, incorporate it into a weapon from a previous jump.
"
1325,,600,Mystic Eyes of Death Perception ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"The eyes that see the path to the end. Among the highest grade of Mystic Eye possible, Death Perception becomes quite literal, They see the lines and dots that mark all ‘living’ things, anything that has any sort of direct interaction with the living world. An object, a person, a ghost, telekinetic force exerted by a psychic or even a timeline, if it were made certain and absolute enough to become solid in your eyes. Tracing these lines with something that cuts, even a blunt butter knife, will separate them without doubt. Cutting the target into pieces. Piercing one of the dots you can see, a single one on any being, is enough to destroy almost all things. While your eyes do not strain you, not all things can be cut so easily. Things that are resistant to death or associated with it will have faded lines, difficult to see or even requiring several minutes of focus to see at all. Dead Apostles, those who have achieved a deathless state of enlightenment, ones who practice death magic and, especially, beings who lack the concept of death at all on whom lines cannot even be seen. Your eyes do not strain you with their use, though you should always be careful with the cutting tools you hold.
"
1326,,600,Blade of Light ,Sonny,Destruction,"This titanic sword that gives off a golden glow near the tip is an exquisite weapon. To begin with, it’s exceedingly sharp, enough to carve steel, and buzzes with electric power. The blade’s main feature is the insane holy properties, carving through dark-aligned enemies like paper. It also increases your speed, strength, durability, and magical power to a level nearly matching the Capstone perks when wielding it. Lastly, you may choose to have the scars it leaves linger; scars left by this blade will periodically release a deep, sharp pain into their victims, though it does no damage itself. They will dissipate once healed, but are harder to heal than normal.

1327,,600,Sailor​ ​Castle​ ​Cannon​ ,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"While the Silver Millennium was an era of peace and prosperity, its architects were not complacent. They knew some day, that peace would be threatened. While their plans to prevent the fall of the Silver Millennium ultimately failed, their efforts were great. Within the Sailor Castles that orbit the celestial bodies, a great superweapon slept. You have the keys to that superweapon, literally. You may summon up a key with the symbol of your planet, hold it high in the air, and shout “Mighty​ ​Discordia​ ​Beam!”​ to summon a great beam down from the heavens. This beam incinerates all within it’s path, except for you and your allies. Note that any non-magical innocents caught in the blast will also die, and this will cause much collateral damage. You may replace “Discordia” in the summon phrase with your Sailor Castle’s name. Drop-Ins have a satellite in the planet’s orbit that shoots a beam with the same power, Mysterious Protectors also have a castle, Villains possess a powerful spell with a similar effect.
"
1328,,600,Space​ ​Sword​ ​,Sailor Moon,Destruction,"The planets spin in orbit around the sun are pulled by a great force that moves entire worlds. This sword has the might of that same driving force, manifesting in an overwhelmingly mighty slash that can split the ground itself. If one were to strike the earth with it, it could create earthquakes that shatter entire cities. One may send a powerful beam with this same force from the sword at will. This same force may also summon up a cutting whirlwind that slices into people as if it were steel. It is a simple boon compared to the others, but unmatched in its strength.
"
1329,,600,Insane Dedication,DC Comics,Destruction,"You know hatred. You know it very well. It’s what gives you your strength, your meaning to
live, your purpose. Someone has wronged you, and that person will pay. Everything they have,
everything they are, you will take it from them. Best-laid plans to stop you find you difficult to
snare. Hidden ones have an uncanny tendency to be revealed to you. Whatever is precious to
your enemy, whatever is sacred and treasured-you will take it and burn it, and only once they’ve
been reduced to nothing more than a shattered husk of a person, only then will you finally end
them. Your inhuman amounts of raw, seething hatred carry you forwards like an unstoppable
machine of death, an inevitable fate awaiting your enemy. Not quite will, but persistence
against all odds and no small measure of luck-extra reserves of strength and resilience eked out
with every step you draw closer to, even powers going to the extra mile to work their magic-
almost literally fuelled by hate. No words can sway you, no prison can hold you, and no heroes
can stop you, not until it’s finished. And once you’ve clawed your way out of hell itself, burned
the world to the ground, stripped away and defiled everything of meaning in their pathetic little
existence? Then, you can finally rest. Until it’s time to burn once again."
1330,,600,Trident of Lucifer ,DC Occult,Destruction,"​Something of a misnomer, this fiendish golden weapon is actually closer to the bastard offspring of a bident and a spear. An artifact of immense power forged long ago in the deepest fires of Hell, this Trident is greatly feared and lusted after by demons and mages alike. Able to summon forth enormous torrents of the flames of Hell in which it was born, this Hellfire not only burns the physical but also the magical and spiritual. These flames are powerful enough to burn most beings to ash within an instant and banish or destroy all but the absolute most powerful of demons and spirits.
"
1331,,600,Great Magic ,Valkyrie Profile,Destruction,"Normally requiring a host of mitigating factors, your research showed you a way to allow you to cast Great Magic at will using your own energy, without the need of an enchanted item and the assistance of a Valkyrie or an Einherjar. While much more draining this way, and still requiring the verbal component and the need of a circle traced in magic, there's no understatement in saying that Great Magics are the most impressive magical feats a sorcerer can accomplish. Great Magics are defined by the magic you use to power the ritual circle, such as the Stone Touch spell creating Carnage Anthem, a lake of molten poison that engulfs the enemy before fading away. Other known spells and their effects are too many to list, and even more undiscovered ones may have Great Magic counterparts, but examples of the scale of great magic include a skeleton the size of a tower, a spear of similar size, a rain of celestial lasers, or a powerful gravity well that encases and crushes your opponents.
"
1332,,600,Mithril Rapier​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Destruction,"It’s a rapier made of Mithril, and thus immune to magic. In this age of wands, this might seem underwhelming, but it is precisely because we are in an age of magic that such a tool is so worthy. Demons will find their otherwise invulnerable skin failing to protect them, and magical shields will be easily pierced. If you wish, you may instead import a weapon you already own and turn it mithril. I’ll even intervene to make sure that the enchantments stay on!"
1333,,600,Absolute Configuration ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"I take back any comments I made about you lacking experience - that’s clearly not the case here. Magical Girls have a limited, singular arsenal that’s determined by the nature of their wish and their soul. No ‘power ups’ are really to be found here. You’ve found a way to compensate - do one thing and do it well. You are now an undeniable master of using a single weapon of your choosing (likely your magical weapon) - muskets? You’re a sharpshooter that would put even experts to shame and never suffer from jamming. A sword? You may as well be a painter who only uses red when you’re wielding that steel. This even applies to using said weapon unconventionally, like using a gun as a blunt weapon or throwing swords en masse.

But wait, there’s more. You’re an incredibly quick thinker and tactician, enough so that you could fight someone with time stop powers on even ground if you got the drop on them - figuring out the abilities and limitations of your opponent is something you can do in mere minutes, and you can plan ahead far enough in a combat situation to know how your opponent plans to take advantage of a weakness of yours without skipping a beat. Can they keep up with you?
"
1334,,600,Purification Shot ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to stand for the best in others?​ Your magical attacks from your Weapon and otherwise can now have a ‘purification’ effect that can damage or even remove corruptive effects, as well as greatly damage things made of despair, angst, or other negative emotions.
"
1335,,600,Finale ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to end a fight with a bang?​ Similar to Energy Weapon, you may ‘overcharge’ your weapon to unleash a single, devastating Finishing Move that can deal a deathblow to a Wraith if placed at the right time. The difference being is that while the energy cost is much lower than if you simply charged it, you can only use it once every thirty minutes. Constantly using a finishing move just isn’t a class act, you know.
"
1336,,600,Shard of a Burdensome Wish ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"This wish was made for the sake of someone else, but the consequences were dear, and the wish itself is forgotten in the flames. Still, the memory makes you stronger...so long as you hold this shard, fire or high temperatures do no damage to you, and you become physically stronger and more resilient, enough so that you could wrestle a tank without fear of it hurting you outside of your Magical Girl form. You may ‘burn’ the shard to gain the ability to bathe an entire building in flame, and control fire with your mind for up to an hour before the energy exhausts itself. You will receive a new shard the following week after using it this way."
1337,,600,The Sealing Ritual ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Destruction,"Every magical girl can seal a Vertex in the battlefield, exposing its soul. With at least two other people and chanting a prayer (What you say doesn’t matter, as long as you have the spirit), they immobilize the Vertex. The soul of the Vertex then slides out and becomes material. Taking out the Vertex’s soul is generally a bad idea if you’re not prepared to attack it then and there, as a countdown timer will appear on the runes around it. The surroundings of the barrier you are in will wilt, the rot growing towards Shinju-Sama’s direction and when the countdown timer ends, Shinju-Sama dies. The countdown timer varies in length from Vertex to Vertex, but it is not a good idea to dawdle when the soul appears regardless. The soul is a physical entity in this case, and it is entirely possible to shatter it without resorting to magic.

However, it’s the only way to kill the Vertex, as it’s healing factor is too much for any ordinary group of magical girls to handle, and even to destroy the soul is a challenge. It could have different layers, or be unusually tough to destroy. It could move and attempt to fly away. It could have self defense systems. Worse, is that it is difficult to tell what challenges the soul will bring when the Vertex is sealed. Every vertex soul has a tough, solid outer shell. A standard attack won’t cut it down.

Now you can do the Sealing Ritual on beings other than the Vertex. They cannot resist the ritual being done on them, and you may do it as easily as in the heat of the battlefield. The ritual for other beings works the exact same way as stated in the Sealing Ritual perk, except that when the countdown timer ends, the soul returns to the body of the being. And you can no longer use the ritual on them. You will have to find some other way to destroy it. You could potentially kill unkillable beings this way--but do not expect their souls to be easy to destroy. The challenge to destroy the soul scales with the mental strength of the being. There will be many defense mechanisms the soul has if it’s terribly strong. Obviously, one could merely shatter a regular human soul with a strong enough punch without much resistance on the soul’s part, but the soul of a monster will carry many challenges to defeat. The ritual merely gives you a weak point to attack.

Also note that a being will have to have a soul in the first place for this ritual to work.
"
1338,,600,HERO PUNCH! ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Destruction,"You’ve tons of power inside those tiny fists of yours! But your strength isn’t the best part of it. No, you could destroy most energy blasts with a clenched fist after sufficient training. You’ll suffer no pain when you punch away an energy blast. Fireballs being flung in your direction? Just punch it. Thick steel walls in your way? Just punch a hole them. With enough time and guts, you could probably punch a hole in anything. You could be able to punch apart blasts the size of buildings like nothing at the higher levels of power from training without Mankai. 

This power is extra amplified when your friends join in on blocking or dispelling a blast. Punch the living hell out of anyone and anything in your path, with friendship and love. You could even, somehow, get through to someone you’re fighting with a big huge punch to snap them out of their freakout, as long as you hug them afterward. You will and can punch through anything, with enough training. Perhaps you could even shatter the body of a Vertex with a punch alone at the higher levels.
"
1339,,600,Destroyer of Eternities ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Destruction,"An immense black blade, ornately decorated with gold and almost as long as a man is tall. The Destroyer of Eternities is perhaps the most feared weapon ever to be created in Nehekhara, a weapon capable of destroying the very soul. The blade itself is impossibly sharp, able to slice through even the magically enchanted metal of a Necrosphinx with effortless ease but what it slays, it destroys utterly. When the body of a being is killed by the blade, the soul of that being is destroyed along with it. Not scattered or torn to shreds, simply erased from existence, never to pass on to the afterlife. It’s no wonder a culture so obsessed with the great beyond would shiver at the thought of this black blade.
"
1340,,600,Sword of Rigg ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Destruction,"A gorgeous blade, with a golden hilt, decorated with precious jewels and a blade carved with old and powerful magical runes. No armour can halt the swing of the blade, piercing through any mundane protection without exception, and the blade itself deals terrible wounds to all those it hurts, even more than the attacks should normally be capable of doing. Clashing the blade against magical weapons or protection is little better, as the blade is even capable of destroying magical items on contact, though more powerful weapons will require more and more blows to destroy with the Sword of Rigg.
"
1341,,600,Origin Bullets ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"Through some means you have gained a rosewood case containing a Thompson Contender and a collection of ten bullets. The Thompson Contender is a single shot pistol customised for high accuracy and physical power. The gun also seems to enhance magical alterations to it. The bullets however are conceptual weapons created with ground bone from a magus with an origin of Severing and Binding, when a bullet makes contact with a target it actualises the origin on the target causing an effect similar to cutting a rope then re-tying it. While the surface may appear to heal properly the nerves and capillaries of the location wounded will never heal properly and their original function will be lost. Origin bullets will immediately affect magi upon coming in contact with their Magecraft or their body by severing then binding the magic circuits active and causing catastrophic damage, permanently crippling them. You will gain an additional ten bullets each jump.
"
1342,,600,Fragarach: Gouging Sword of the War God ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"You have gained Fragarach a Noble Phantasm and Mystic Code with the ultimate form of counter attack that works by warping causality to always strike the opponent in the heart with a needle thin concentrated attack right before they unleash their attack. The condition for its use is that the opponent must be using their strongest attack and Fragarach must be used directly after the attack. Despite being used after the attack Fragarach will always strike first by altering the flow of time to change events so that it makes it’s strike before the enemy made their ultimate attack. Keep in mind that it will not kill enemies who can survive a strike to the heart or who would not be affected by an attack on the level of an A-rank Noble Phantasm.
"
1343,,600,Sword of the Quest ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Destruction,"A large hand and a half sword that has been handed down through countless Questing Knights until it reached your own hands. A magical blade honed to a terrific edge, as most Bretonnian swords, the enchantment on this blade allows it to cleave through all armour is if it were naught but air. From steel plate to dragon hide, the blade will tear through any form of armour, natural or artificial, with ease. It has no effect against magical defences however, proving to be just a well-made sword when it comes up against them."
1344,,600,Sword of the Lady’s Champion ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Destruction,"One night, as you rested beside a lake, a hand rose from the waters gripping a beautiful sword. It offered the blade to you, making no comments or instructions on its use and you took it from the hand, which sunk beneath the waters once more. A powerfully magical weapon, when wielding this blade the user’s strength will increase to be just a bit beyond that of his opponent’s toughness. Thus the user will always be physically powerful enough to wound his opponents, so long as they are vulnerable to physical damage in that fashion.
"
1345,,600,Silver Lance of the Blessed ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Destruction,"The lance once forged and held by the First King of Bretonnia. It accepts only the purest of wielders, though you are perhaps an exception, and will alight with powerful holy flames on the wielders command. Just holding the spear greatly increases the strength of the wielder and the flames from the weapon are able to melt steel armour in a second and purify chaos taint from all but the most wretched and evil of foes. The spear cannot miss either, being guided by magic to strike their foe no matter how fast or agile, so long as they are within range of the piercing blow."
1346,,600,Sealing Key ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Destruction,"A key resembling a seahorse with a coin around its head. When activated, it becomes a powerful staff that can smash and cut through many otherwise unbreakable things by nullifying enchantments that strengthen the obstacle’s durability; even so, it is not able to overpower incredibly strong enhancements. First and foremost, though, this is a key, designed to either lock or unlock seals, even strong, magical ones.
"
1347,,600,Aces of Aces ,Lyrical Nanoha,Destruction,"That kind of mage...that’s what they call an Ace. You’re a one-in-a-million, a natural prodigy with this world’s magic and a talent for combat, letting you fight three equally-skilled mages and one a rank or several above you and have pretty good odds of coming out on top. You’re also an incredibly fast learner when it comes to new magical equipment or abilities, especially things applied to combat. Some finer sciences and nuances of the craft aren’t under this ability, but really, who needs to be a nerd when you can blast someone into the concrete? If you join the TSAB or any other organization in regular conflict, expect quick promotions...or lots of frontline roles.
"
1348,,600,Legends Reborn ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Destruction,"Philosophical weapons are... a mystery, to be frank. Not even Alchemists are completely sure what the hell they are or where their properties come from, except from legendary association. By extracting the personal history of a weapon, you can grant it a variety of conceptual effects as it relates to you. For example, a weapon you’ve personally used to slay kings can gain a strong anti-royalty effect, or a weapon you’ve used to break swords can gain a sword breaker effect. These don’t actually modify the weapon on any kind of physical level, being a type of enchantment, or divine effect."
1349,,600,Lance of the Scarlet Devil - Boosted,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Destruction,"Gungnir is the legendary lance belonging to Remilia Scarlet, the mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. The lance is overflowing so much magic that the entire spear is enveloped in a deep crimson, still crackling in excess energies. It is also rumored that this spear will never miss its mark when thrown. Alternatively, you may instead opt for the equally powerful lance resembling a distorted hand of a clock by the name of Laevateinn, belonging to the Scarlet Devil’s younger sister, Flandre. Within it imbues unimaginable destructive power, capable of reducing almost anything it strikes to none. 
"
1350,,600,Enforcer Prodigy ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Destruction,"Among the mages who have specialised in physical combat you are a prodigy. Anything related to combat is far easier to learn for you, accomplishing what would take others a week in a single day. This perk has also increased the abilities of other perks bought:

Physical Fitness: Through some manner your physical abilities have increased beyond what a mundane human could achieve. Whether through being a magical creation or enhanced in some other manner you stand as far beyond the peak of humanity as they do the average human.

Physical Enhancement: Your mastery over this magic has increased to the point that your physical abilities rival an average Servant.

Combat Skills: Your skill at combat has increased to the point that you could combat warriors of legend. If you had the physical abilities you could even fight a Heroic Spirit evenly.

Brainwashing: This skill now allows you to transfer minds into other objects like stuffed dolls and leave the fake personality to control the empty body.

Flash Air: Your skill at Flash Air has reached the level that displacing a mountain to create a castle is possible with enough magical energy.

Rune Magic: Has increased to the level of using a Rune of Resurrection, magic on the level of a Noble Phantasm that can be placed on someone to revive him or her from death when they suffer a fatal injury. The Rune will only work once per person per jump.
"
1351,,600,Forever Tree Sword ,Peter Pan,Destruction,"A sword made out of the wood of the Forever Tree. It has the magical property of cutting just as well as a normal sword, but it’s still not much better than a standard weapon. However, the sword also serves as a badge signifying that you are third-in-command after Peter and Tink; given the two are usually together, this means you can lead the Lost Boys in Peter’s absence. More than that, Peter now favors you, and at random he will gift you with miscellaneous items he has found on his adventures, which may range from simple things to mystical treasures; whatever the case, it is important that you always praise him for his finds. After the jump, as time and space have no hold on the eternal boy, Peter may suddenly stop in out of nowhere to chat for a few minutes and leave you with something new that he found, or even join you for a brief while as a temporary companion (though he won’t show up if you don’t want him to). If you took the Forever Neverland drawback, possession of the sword allows you to recruit Peter Pan as a companion. If you took the Be The Pan drawback, you will instead gain access to the physical form, skills, and knowledge (even things he’s forgotten) of Peter Pan; perks and such you’ve bought here that are based on Peter’s abilities (Betwixt-and-Between, Advanced Flyer, Hidden Kisses, Pretend Eating, etc.) will be enhanced a degree beyond their normal levels, and your overall flying abilities, fighting prowess, charisma, and luck will be significantly improved."
1352,,600,Sceptre of the Titan ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Destruction,"A gigantic rod, large even for an Ogre of great size. Fitted with many sharp spikes at the rounded end, it is a powerfully enchanted weapon. Every blow struck with this weapon, regardless of the original wielder’s strength, hits with the power of one of the great Sky Titans of old. A single strike from this sceptre hits with the force of a giant that towered hundreds of feet into the air, shattering houses and laying waste to all but the strongest of magical defences.
"
1353,,600,Kindleflame ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"The Red Wind of Magic is the only one more straightforward than the Amber Wind, and a Pyromancer’s usual response to his or her spells being ineffective against a foe is to hit it harder. For you, it seems this actually works. The longer you bombard an enemy with spells of Fire, the more and more their protections against it erode. While this does nothing to those born of and sustained by fire, anything else will soon find itself unable to pour enough water on itself fast enough. At long last, you can cast the same fireball at them over and over again until they roll over and die.
"
1354,,600,Roiling Skies ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"To wield Azyr is to command the sky in ways even those beasts endowed with flight cannot. A Dragon or Manticore may laugh at you, bound to the earth beneath its wings. It will not be laughing once you tear the skies asunder and strike them with the fury of the tempest. Your spells of air, lightning, and weather now strike with increased ferocity against any creature which naturally flies. Even those spells which do not deal bodily damage disrupt the wind currents around such creatures, possibly forcing them to land. To battle you under an ongoing storm is an even worse idea, for your presence ensures its hindering and destructive force falls squarely upon your enemy. Coincidentally, this also seems to ensure that you always have access to the proper... “material components” for the Comet of Casandora and similar spells to call down comets. Let the heavens know that you are their true master, not these mere vermin with wings.
"
1355,,600,Metalshifting ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"Armor? Against one who shapes metal with but a touch? The absolute fools. Indeed, whenever you so much as deign to cast an offensive spell which manipulates or holds the properties of metal, the greatest pain will be felt by those wearing the heaviest armor. The more warded by iron they are against blade and bow, the swifter your magic will reduce them to nothing. What is more, the scaly skin of such creatures as Dragons and Lizardmen counts as armor for the purposes of this effect. Finally, the ability to regenerate from wounds will not avail them, for all such spells strike as if they were spells of fire, known to halt the powers of such self-healing creatures as Trolls.
"
1356,,600,Exorcism ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Destruction,"Alone among the Winds of Magic, Hysh resists and banishes the powers of Chaos and Undeath with almighty ferocity. So it is with your spells, which bite deeply into anything that could truly be called a creature of Darkness. Warp-spawn, Cloven One, profane champion, or unliving monster, even those most firmly warded against holy energies find themselves reeling before your every incantation, for purifying Hysh suffuses even the lightest spark. Your blinding incantations of banishment are even enough to subdue the Greater Daemons of the Ruinous Powers. Suffer not the abomination to live.
"
1357,,600,The Fellblade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Destruction,"In the dim days of skavendom’s past, they warred against The Hated Necromancer, the Nehekharan arch-lich known as Nagash. In seeking to use the old Nehekharan King known as Alcadizaar, the ratmen forged a weapon. Dwarven gromril alloyed with smelted warpstone, with the greatest of the Lore of Ruin’s destructive spells hammered into the alloy as it was shaped on the anvil. It was tempered then, in acid bile and magical poisons, and fell runes engraved that could kill the one who read them. When at last the weapon was complete, a perfect warpstone gem was slotted into its hilt - to allow the Council of Thirteen to see through the eyes of its wielder, and channel magicks through them to protect from Nagash’s dark spellcraft.

The Fellblade was created, and thus did Alcadizaar strike down Nagash. The blade disappeared from history upon the Nehekharan King’s death - thrown into the vast crevasse around Nagashizzar. Until recently, that is, when it came into your paws, borne in a lead box by a blindfolded, masked agent of the Council. You wield The Fellblade now: A sword whose mere presence in your fingers multiplies your strength greatly, such that a runty Skavenslave would match an Ogre hand-to-hand. The magicks and toxins woven into the gromril-warpstone alloy allow the weapon to cut through any magical or physical protection to cut deep, while the warpstone and engraved runes tear, warp, and corrode the flesh of both its wielder and their victims. The warpstone orb in its hilt marks you as the Council’s warrior, for its presence lets them watch through your eyes, and channel their magic through you as their agent.

A Word Of Warning: This blade’s deadly pou are marked as their agent with all the good AND ill that entails in the endlesower comes at several costs. The first: The sheer amount of warpstone that has gone into its forging means that even upon placing their hand around the hilt, the wielder begins to succumb to the radiation. Unless one can avoid it, the exposure is all but guaranteed to kill them. The second: This weapon w as such ys cut-throat society. Watch your step, watch your back, and obey the Counas made when the Council of Thirteen, including The Horned Rat’s seat, were in unanimous agreement. All thirteen heads are required to send the blade out, andcil’s commands. Survive your decade with this in mind, and the circumstances will change accordingly - see down in Parting Ways for the exact explanation.

If you purchased The Fellblade, a few changes will come about. You may choose to nullif the warpstone-radiation of the blade, leaving it still a potent and destructive weapon - bu it will not kill you by simply holding it. As well, the Council of Thirteen will be unable to look through the great gem set in the blade - instead, you may have allies and friend capable of spellcasting attune themselves to the warpstone gem in the sword. Onc attuned, they may grasp their connection to look through the sword and you, its wielder - and may use you as a proxy for their own spells, rituals, and auguries.
"
1358,,600,Starfang ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Destruction,"*Ahem* Because ‘Sunfang’ was already taken. This hitherto unknown sister-sword to Tyrion’s sword is that legendary weapon’s equal in every way. It can cleave all but the strongest armor with ease, automatically will adjust its weight and balance to be your perfect blade, and on top of all that can periodically fling gouts of terrible flame literally as hot as the heart of a volcano. In terms of this world specifically, it can harm ethereal entities as easily as if they were flesh. Also, as what may be intuited by the name, the blade is always on fire. And the fire will never harm you.
"
1359,,600,The Silent Knife ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Destruction,"Sometimes, the death of a troublesome rival really is the only option, for those situations, there is this. This knife exists inside of its own magical pocket, and, once a year, you may call it from that pocket to strike, after which the knife will promptly retreat back to its pocket. The knife itself is invisible, the wound will not show, and the target will feel nothing till three days pass. Then your enemy will just drop dead. Naturally you will be impossible to implicate.
"
1360,,600,Combat Casting​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Destruction,"You have been instructed in the ways of combat magic and may apply your knowledge of war and physical combat to the workings of your magic. The more skilled and practiced you are in physical combat, the more damage your offensive spells will do to their target. If you desire, you may combine your magic and martial skill into a fluid style, augmenting your physical abilities with magic while delivering the spells in the most efficient way possible through physical strikes. You have only begun to learn this combined art however and it will take many years of study to fully master mystical martial arts."
1361,,600,No Gods Only Man ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Destruction,"While Ganon may not be a god, nor the one who empowered him to begin with, the fact remains that ‘demons’ and other monsters have long threatened Hyrule. And they have been dependant upon the Goddess and her chosen Hero to defend them. Sometimes ‘Sages’ arise, but they are often blessed by some great spirit. In the end, wouldn’t we be better off without any of this nonsense? Without magic? You certainly seem to think so. While you may not have anything in particular against magic in general, the instant that magic becomes, divine, holy, unholy, demonic, or anything else comparable to heaven and hell, then that magic begins to flicker out and die. Ten times weaker, a hundred, a thousand. By the time they’re close enough to bring the blade to your throat, their divine blessing is gone and all they have is a sharp stick.
"
1362,,600,Silver and Gold ,Legend of Zelda: A LInk to the Past,Destruction,"A choice of just two this time, between a golden sword or some silver arrows. The arrows are simplistic, but extremely useful. They are custom built to bypass as many of Ganon's defensive enchantments as possible, resulting in a weapon that can bypass almost any magical barrier or defense. Even most physical defenses will fail to protect against these. As a small quirk, the arrows will shift themselves to fit into any ranged weapon, be they an ordinary bow or a more advanced crossbow. Secondly, the master Sword. This is quite possibly the most powerful version of the blade I know of, boasting two upgrades beyond its normal power, leaving it four times as powerful. Beyond that, it also has a somewhat unique ability to channel and drain negative emotions from you and turn them into an electrical attack. However, this version of the Master Sword has a slightly different backstory than most others. Iit will also shut down the power of the Triforce should you come into conflict with it. In future jumps, this also affects stolen powers from you or from a patron deity of yours. You may purchase this under the same rules as 'Tools of a Hero' for the other weapon.
"
1363,,600,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: Four Sword Adventure,Destruction,"Once upon a time this blade was known as the Picori Blade, but here and now it’s become known as the Four Sword on account of it’s unusual trait of splitting the wielder in four when drawn. Each clone of you bears only minor differences from the ‘original’ or ‘real’ you, a different color of clothing, a slightly higher or deeper voice, perhaps a slight tendency towards a certain emotion, arguably to help you define yourselves as just different enough to not have an existential crisis. In more combat related news, while the Four Sword lacks the raw power of the Master Sword, it does have the ability to amplify its own power until it possesses the same power to repel evil through the act of absorbing Force Gems. It probably has something to do with them being manifestations of goodwill and gratitude, those things tend to be anathema to the darkness.
"
1364,,600,Focus Spirit ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"For when your best just isn’t good enough, for when you need to push past those limits for just a bit to tear down whatever’s in front of you, there’s this. It would be a common technique if this place was a game, but fortunately for you it isn’t. 

This perk allows you to build up a reservoir of magical power within your body. At any time you desire, you can release that reservoir to enter an empowered state. This state will rapidly burn through your storied magic, but causes you to become excessively stronger, faster and magically empowered. 

This magical empowerment aids with casting magic a bit, but its primary purpose is mixing everything you do with the volatile burning magic. 

This causes whatever you’re assaulting to deteriorate faster than just the beating it's receiving, allowing you to plow through enemy attempts to protect themselves. 

Alternatively, if a super mode isn’t to your liking, you could draw on this reserve into a single attack. This release has the same magic burn quality, but amplified several times over since the internal reservoir will push everything it has into that instance of offense, as if popping like a balloon.

1365,,600,Lord of Darkness ,Hyrule Warriors,Destruction,"More than some run of the mill monster, your heart and soul are as black as the new moon’s night. Just as Ganondorf’s existence is itself a curse of dark hatred, there is no shred of light within you, you are just a being of darkness. 

On purchase, you become a being entirely composed of darkness, both metaphorical and conceptual darkness that is. Emotions or mentalities that shine with the purity of light such as mercy or loyalty are purged from your soul, preventing others from using such soft sentiments against you. 

You are like a walking black hole, your body and soul devouring any light attempting to purify you and crushing it into nothing, only the most divine of light acting as it should. More importantly though, is your ability to command the all-consuming darkness that makes up your form. 

Darkness crushes, it consumes, so casting it upon your attacks, your defenses, your equipment, so too will they borrow these properties of darkness. Everything is more likely to break and fracture after encountering your darkness, with light feeling it doubly so.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Tempered by Light - Hyrule Warriors first.)

Purchasing both “Tempered by Light” and “Lord of Darkness” together will transform you into epitomized Twilight. A perfect balance of Light and Darkness with all that brings with it. Light and darkness, positivity and negativity, altruism and ambition, love and hate. You will be able to blend the light and dark powers you get from these perks into twilight energy, like a Twili Sorcerer.

1366,,600,Magic Wand ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Destruction,"The big gun. Shoots magical bolts that engulf enemies in fire. Strong enough to defeat most of the Nightmare’s minions in one hit. Also handy for lighting torches on the other side of the room.
"
1367,,600,Flame Of Destruction ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Destruction,"Onox's goal for all intents and purposes seems to be nothing more than to cause as much destruction as possible. Whether he succeeded and you stole some, or you wrecked another country to get it, you now have a flicker from the Flame of Destruction. This flame has one very simple effect - things break. Stone crumbles, wood rots, the flesh fractures, and everything comes tumbling down. And as the flame inspires destruction, it feeds on the stolen life energy from those it brought to a close far too soon. The more you break, the brighter the flame burns. The brighter it burns, the easier things become to break. You can turn this effect off, at which point it will burn through its stored energy before going out. Relighting it is a real pain in the ass though, so be careful with that. But, as long as it is lit, you can channel that extra life energy into whatever you want. Onox took that energy and sent it away somewhere, for some reason. You? Do whatever you want. Destruction, it's good for your health.
"
1368,,600,Blade of Legend ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Destruction,"A legendary weapon on par with the Master Sword, wielded by ancient heroes in times long past. An enchanted, indestructible artifact created for the purpose of destroying and sealing evil. The weapon is blessed by both the goddesses and the mercurial gods of the Twilight Realm, giving it the ability to banish darkness and break curses when wielded by its wearer. It will defeat most creatures of darkness- such as the creatures invading Hyrule- in one blow. If an evil enemy cannot meet its demise even by the sword’s blade, it will instead seal them away for a time, or else force them to enter a cycle of reincarnation. The weapon also has the ability to deflect magical projectiles.

"
1369,,600,Magical Rod ,The Legend of Zelda,Destruction,"A rod enchanted with a lethal spell, by waving this rod you will fire a blast of powerful energy at your enemies. The damage is as powerful as the “White Sword” energy beams.
"
1370,,600,Magical Sword and Shield ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Destruction,"The strongest blade in this land, it is 4 times stronger than the original “Sword” and could even carve through the mighty generals of Ganon’s army in a few strikes. You are very wise to purchase this. What good is an offense without a defense, however? You get a great shield alongside the sword - an improvement from the shield given by the Old Man, this shield can easily reflect the magical attacks of both Ganon’s wizardly comrades and the Prince of Darkness himself.
"
1371,,600,Assassin's Blade ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"A dagger in the dark is worth a thousand swords at dawn. When you land an attack on someone when unnoticed, you do ten times the damage you would have. It doesn't matter if it's a dagger, a warhammer, or even a fireball, you are sure to deal a killing blow or fatal wound."
1372,,600,Auriel's Weapons ,The Elder Scrolls,Destruction,"The bow and shield of the elven god Auriel, these powerful Aedric Artifacts are incredibly sought after. Auriel's Bow is imbued with holy sunlight that is exceptionally potent against the undead. Should you fire it into the sun by using Sunhallowed Arrows, of which you receive a replenishing stock of 100 each week, it will cause the sun to undergo an explosion, causing beams of harmful sunlight to rain down on all enemies around you. Auriel's Shield absorbs any physical attack done to it in order to charge it's enchantment, which when used creates a wave of golden kinetic energy that will send others flying."
1373,,600,Megalovania ,Undertale,Destruction,"Fighting is almost never the answer. In most cases, it only makes things worse, and should be used as a last resort, when all other options are meaningless. When what you're dealing with is a force of evil that must be stopped at any cost... That's when your true power awakens. Your magical attacks are infused with Karmic Retribution, and while it's harmless against innocent people, it's poison to someone with a high Level of Violence. In fact, the higher their LOVE, the worse it hurts. In addition, the initial pain of the attack doesn't go away- It burns away at their soul over time as well, as every sin they've committed comes back in their head to haunt them."
1374,,600,Death By Glamour ,Undertale,Destruction,"To someone like you, presentation is everything- And you're at your best when you're presenting! You're so good at putting on a show that when you're performing on stage, you don't suffer from the likes of pain or fatigue- Physical or mental. So long as you keep going with style, flourish, and panache then you could keep going for days on end. As an added bonus, your magical power receives a solid boost whenever you're performing, making you a deadly combatant even while you're showing off to the crowd."
1375,,600,Railgun (True) ,Konosuba,Destruction,"Mage Killer? That’s pansy stuff. What you want is this gun right here. It’s a phased plasma rifle in the 40-kidding. This long rifle might not look like much but it’s genuinely one of the most powerful weapons in the world, being the completed version of the prototype Railgun (Fake) that the Crimson Demon Clan holds safe. By filling it with magical energy, the gun is charged and it can then fire out that magical energy, multiplied several times over in power and focused into a single beam. It’ll pierce straight through any kind of magical resistance, despite the beam being powered by magic and unlike the original prototype, there’s no limit to how much charge it can hold at any one time. It automatically sucks in any nearby magic when in charging mode, so be careful to hit the switch so you don’t waste your own energy."
1376,,600,Living Weapon ,Genshin Impact,Destruction,"That which is not living will not grow. That which is not living may accumulate power, but it will ever be constrained. Made from the remains of a long dead dragon that once did battle with the gods, and infused with the leftover life force of its heart, this weapon could truly be considered to be alive. The form this weapon will take is up to you, be it a spear, sword, bow, or something else of the like. This weapon has formed a connection with its wielder, with you, and so it grows in strength alongside you. As you grow stronger, you will find its form growing sturdier, its edge more keen. This is a weapon you can keep beside you no matter how far you go."
1377,,700,Rétt-ligr,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Destruction,"You are the embodiment of all the fear, hatred, envy, greed, anger, and negativity that is directed toward you. Quite literally, you hold lesser domains and personifications to a vast number of negative aspects from poison, venom,  illness, plague, death and decay, to malice, shadows, darkness, sorrow, hate, war, anger and so forth.  All those negative feelings, if directed at you personally, will empower you and make you stronger, the norse gods do not need worship to be mighty and neither do you, but you will grow mightier in every aspect from these negative forces  and can substitute these feelings for genuine worship in all areas.
        You are an endless well from which these emotions may be drawn either by yourself or others. All of this darkness manifests as a curse upon any who would harm you, any being that brings harm to you in any way, either directly or indirectly, will be cursed to the same level of injury or maybe even a bit more. If you would be cut, they receive an equally detrimental injury. If they harmed your child, they and their children may be struck with bad luck and illness. But should you be killed by the influence of another or kill yourself as a sacrifice, you may declare a death curse in response. This death curse will kill anything, normally being instant, if a being is equal in power and yet has protections your curse will take no longer than nine days, a lesser being with protections may take nine hours or a greater being nine months or even up to nine years, nine months, nine days, and  nine hours..., but the curse will kill them no matter who or what they are accordingly.

1378,,800,Omega Effect,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Destruction,"The Omega Effect is Darkseid’s most feared and infamous power, a force that has
struck terror into the hearts of gods and mortals alike. Perhaps you are one of the dark
children of the Lord of Apokolips, as you too possess this formidable power. The Omega
Effect allows you to unleash Omega Beams from your eyes, beams that are faster than
speedsters, infallibly accurate, and capable of disintegrating any being they strike. You
hold the terrifying power to choose whether to destroy your target permanently or
resurrect them for further torment.
Only a select few substances in the universe can withstand these beams once you
unleash them. In addition to the devastating Omega Beams, the Omega Effect
significantly amplifies your overall power. This boost elevates you to the upper echelons
of power in this world, placing you among the most formidable beings, though there are
still a few who surpass you. Over time, you may unlock the deeper secrets of the
Omega Effect, discovering new abilities and further enhancing your might."
1379,,800,Lifehunt Scythe,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Destruction,"Priscilla was originally feared by the gods due to the fearsome power she was born
with. This power known as Lifehunt was considered the most dangerous ability the gods
had ever encountered. This terrifying ability is capable of almost instantly draining all
magic, stamina, and life force from any target it strikes. However, its most dreaded
aspect is the power to cause true death. Any being killed by the Lifehunt Scythe will
experience a complete and irrevocable end. There will be no regeneration, revival, or
false survival. Even beings that are purely spiritual or soul-based will be reaped and
utterly destroyed once struck down by this scythe."
1380,,800,Lost Password,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"When the fools try to crawl their way up to your level, you'll be waiting at the top with a hammer to
slam down on their hands and send them plummeting back to the distant ground. On contact, you
are able to deeply and permanently weaken any being that you touch. You are effectively able to
'return them to level one'. This removes anything that they do not naturally have or that is not the
basic knowledge and common sense that an average adult of their race would have. They'd lose all
their training in combat, all the skill in using supernatural powers, lose any powers or abilities that
they did not innately possess, have the raw power that they have reduced to what they had at the
very beginning. They retain their memories and can still function but will in effect, be a level one
character compared to whatever they were before. "
1381,,800,Ouroborus Connect,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"A Minus embodies the negativity of the world. Perhaps then the greatest Minus ability would be one
that took hold of the greatest causes of negativity in this world. The power to control calamities and
disasters is now yours. You are able to both create and take control of any kind of great disaster that
has befallen the Earth or humanity or that might befall them in the future. You could call down
meteors of all different sizes, summon up any number of hurricanes or earthquakes or eruptions, create massive spikes of radiation that soak into the dirt and water around you or bring to life the
most virulent plagues of the past. Perhaps by looking to the future, you could create an invasion of
rebellious robots or hostile alien life forms or even create a shining star above the world that is
about to enter into a supernova. "
1382,,800,Mistilteinn,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Destruction,"A missile or arrow or spear or even sword of some kind made from a simple living wood or plant. It will function perfectly as any kind of mundane projectile bolt, bow, piercing, or slashing weapon, being the perfect version of it in any way by mortal standards. The weapon is unbreakable but will bend or behave as the finest possible weapon of its type. At will, this weapon can be sacrificed to pierce and kill anyone or anything; If lent out, this feature can only be used at your discretion. You will receive one of these every 9 years and you may freely change what type of weapon each is."
1383,,800,Blade of Tathagata,The God of High School Jump,Destruction,"The sword of the Jade Emperor himself. A simple katana and matching sheath, neither with any embellishments or additions. This mighty blade possesses no innate power, save its limitless cutting edge. A single, lazy slash was able to slice all of South Korea in half and the blade was also able to destroy the cloned Ruyi Jingu Bang. It can summon gigantic waves of incredibly hot flame at the user’s command and even the sheath of the blade is powerful enough to split in half the super massive swords wielded by Nephilim without any action on the user’s behalf. Even if somehow broken, a feat only accomplished once by the Monkey King using over a hundred National Treasures and multiple Charyeok at once, the blade will be replenished to pristine condition within minutes."
1384,,800,Hero of Hell ,Chainsaw Man,Destruction,"You aren’t just well known in Hell, you’re an absolute legend. Every devil or similarly inherently evil being knows you and fears you in all worlds you go to. As long as they were born evil, every fiber of their existence screams of danger in your presence and so much as looking at you through a computer screen takes a considerable amount of energy and resolve from them. You will often find even evil divinities look the other way or send gifts to appease you as they desperately try not to draw your ire even if you’re weaker than them. Those around your level or stronger’s survival instinct will win out and they will dare to challenge you if they must, but even still they will find their capabilities impacted by facing their greatest natural fear head-on. Of course, you’ll need some things to fit this reputation.. Any racial perks and benefits you have in this Jump are greatly boosted in effect alongside powers of hellish origins in and out of Jump to a lesser degree. Your strength, speed, durability, and devil abilities are also almost peerless in this world. You could fight hoards of high-tier devils for days and then take on two Primals at the same time back to back with just Tier 4 Embodiment of Fear and this perk (with even odds). Like most other perks here, aspects of this are individually toggleable.

Requires Embodiment of Fear(Tier 3) to Purchase"
1385,,800,Conceptual Consumption ,Chainsaw Man,Destruction,"When you kill and eat something it pierces through one measure of immortality, whether it be ignoring all the bound dolls they have taking damage for them or their divine immortality. Furthermore, if you cause their final death and consume them in a timely manner then the things they stand for will be considerably weakened. Depending on their power, authority, and fame, this effect is bolstered. If you were to consume the BBEG who stood for world domination and racial superiority those ideals wouldn’t find hold in the populace for centuries and those following his banner would find themselves second-guessing their allegiance and forgetting what they stood for in the first place. If you were to kill a powerful being that was the literal embodiment of a concept (such as a devil) then you would find that the concept is entirely forgotten about or even erased from existence altogether in the setting, causing sweeping changes throughout. When used in tandem with Devil Consumption you will gain a degree of governance over the concept they represented, taking their place as its embodiment if you so choose and forgoing its erasure. You can lower and toggle the effects of this perk as you wish. If you can’t or don’t want to actually eat the being, killing them and performing some other sort of ritual will suffice (painting your face with their blood, burying them and praying, etc.)."
1386,,800,Everlasting Savage Engine: Heart of the Strongest        ,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction,"It seems that we have another admirer of the Third Arch-Demon. Perhaps even another member of his household and fellow competitor, a fourth active Locust.

Yours is the core power of the Violent Locust Swarm. The ability that sustains their eternal journey on the path towards transcendence, to the throne of the strongest. That is, you have the ability of growing eternally, becoming stronger each passing second, a peerless warrior incapable of exhaustion. This doesn’t mean that you have any regenerative abilities other than you would have before, but you no longer have to fear having to end a battle due to running out of stamina.

While this engine is always active, the gains it provides when you are doing nothing are basically unnoticeable, even during long periods. It can only shine when you direct yourself to proving yourself as the strongest. That is, when you engage in one-on-one battles to the death. The target doesn’t matter. From the smallest pieces of grass and tiniest insect, to the mightiest Arch-Demons, the only thing that matters is that mutual recognition is established. Surely, a sneak attack would prove nothing of your own strength. Once both parties have acknowledged each other, you must kill the other party using your entire might, regardless of the difference of strength.

As long as you continue fighting this way, your internal engine will be fed and use this battle lust to propel you to greater heights. Your senses become sharper, your punches increase in potency, your skin and muscle become more durable and harder to penetrate, your will is hardened. Obviously, the greater the enemy you face, the more desperate the situation is, the more you will grow. Enemies of your same level or higher will provide better gains that tiny bugs that you can easily crush.

However, be warned that while your growth is infinite, your growth rate is not, and even if your stamina is inexhaustible, this doesn’t make you completely immortal. And finally, while stronger enemies will make you stronger faster, this is only true when it comes to putting you in a more desperate situation. Should they restrain themselves, you won’t escalate as quickly as you would if they were going all out."
1387,,800,Cat(Plagg),Miraculous Ladybug,Destruction,"Concept: Destruction

Form: Ring

Tool: Staff

Power: “Cataclysm” - The user’s ring-wearing hand gains a dark energy. Anything that that hand touches (up to the size of a large building), turns to ash. Yes, anything. Okay technically Sentimonsters are not one-shot for some reason, but anything else. Okay and other Miraculous users are resistant enough that (without further magical strain) they would survive another month or so. Also it doesn’t affect gasses or liquids. But literally anything else! Destroyed in one go. Once activated it cannot be canceled except by detransformation. You also get night vision while transformed. If you have The Absolute Power, then this cannot be bought with the Ladybug Miraculous. You’ll need to take the actual Cat Miraculous, or have a Companion buy it."
1388,,800,Balmung,The Song of the Nibelungs,Destruction,"The sword Balmung, Gram or Nothung. This sword was either gifted by Wotan/Odin himself to your father, broken and reforged, maybe even by your own hand, or you won it as a prize for settling a dispute for the kings of the Nibelungs. It is an elegant and beautiful thing, fully seven spans long. If led by a strong hand, this sword can cleave right through an anvil without taking the slightest bit of damage and will prove as one of the few weapons able to damage a dragon.

For an extra -200 cp this sword has been broken and reforged by a smith of truly astounding skill, with no fear in his heart. This way it became greater than it ever was and truly unbreakable. While before Gugnir, the spear of Wotan/Odin, would have broken the sword now in turn the spear would be cleaved by the sword as every other thing would before it."
1389,,800,Hero’s bane,The Song of the Nibelungs,Destruction,"You are the one promised to slay the promised hero. Even if you are not his equal. Even if he was blessed with awesome strength, nigh invulnerability, the perfect weapon and more gold than a man can dream of, in the end you will slay him. The Norns have woven your thread in a way that will lead it to intertwine and ultimately cut off far stronger and greater threads, should you pursue a certain line of action. With this you could completely nullify any of the luck, foretold destinies and plot armor of heroes, their companions and anyone really. To slay a hero such as Siegfried will require great work and trickery however. This perk doesn’t make it so that you can be certain to slay a hero, merely that fate and destiny doesn’t stand in your way.

For an extra -200 cp you yourself can completely destroy the web the Norns have laid out for you. You are able to do what Hagen couldn’t do and change the course of things, and thus your foretold doom or glory, through simple actions such as killing a Priest who was the only one foretold to survive from your party."
1390,,800,Two Can Play That Game!,Asura’s Wrath,Destruction,"You gain perfect insight as to the dramatic sequences and furious attack combinations that empowered or supernatural forces can bring against you­ because you have them too.

You have the Action Commands Perk, and can observe an opponent's own attempts to rise above their dramatic station. Because of this insight, opponents are more likely to fumble their incredible feats of daring, or you are extremely good at confusing them into same.

However, in exchange for this prowess, you have trouble recovering after failing to hit a mark yourself. Every cue you fail to hit increases the lag on your next action by an appropriate amount­ usually some critical fraction of a second.

Cannot be Taken With Action Commands"
1391,,800,Void-Touched,League of Legends,Destruction,"You once visited Icathia, and you were graced with a glimpse into true nothingness. For normal men, this would be enough to drive one mad, but you saw the method behind the madness- Allowing you to wield the unfathomable power of the Void. Whether you use this to combat the alien creatures of the void or herald their coming into Valoran is up to you, but the benefits are the same either way. You can summon blades of nothingness to slice apart your foes, infect them with terrible visions and nightmares, and summon fell energy to render them silent and unable to use magic. You can even give someone an (unwilling) glance into the depths of the void, probably irreparably damaging their soul and driving them insane in the process, but foes with strong willpower can resist the call of the Void. Your void abilities are most effective against mages and Void creatures, but that's not to say they're not perfectly capable of tearing apart normal people, too."
1392,,800,Worldslayer,MtG - New Phyrexia,Destruction,"What would seem like a simple, yet magically glowing longsword, hides a much more terrying power inside. This artifact is a weapon capable of bringing untold destruction to all the wielders enemies- and to the wielder itself. Of course, since you’re paying a hefty sum for it, you will be protected from its horrible power- though it will lose a fair bit of its army destroying strength, but make no mistake- a violent, decisive strike with this weapon will decimate the nearby area- making no distinction between allies or enemies, and rendering the land around you an uninhabitable wasteland in a radius big enough to destroy a small platoon of Phyrexian foot soldiers."
1393,,800,Obsidian Blade,Skulduggery Pleasant,Destruction,"Created when the universe came into being, when a small gap in reality drew in particles of matter and dust over the eons until it gained a weight of it’s own and fell to Earth. This was then forged into a weapon by the Faceless Ones. The resulting blade, which you now own, destroys everything it touches, wiping it from existence. So, you know, be careful with it. You may choose if this is the original blade, or a copy of it. You can also import another weapon into this role. If it is destroyed (though how you would actually do that, I haven’t a clue), it will reappear in your Warehouse at the start of the next Jump."
1394,,800,Mystic Eyes of Death Perception ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"All things die eventually. No matter how clever you are or what paradox you invoke to escape it, all that which is born ‘alive into this world will eventually leave it. And now, having seen such a thing up close at some point in your life, your body has internalized it in those beautiful eyes of yours. You are able to perceive ‘death’ itself on living beings and physical objects, appearing as thin red lines. When You touch or cut along these lines, the object or being in question is immediately cut deeply regardless of their durability, and attempts at healing or regeneration are greatly stunted -perhaps even made impossible for some beings, though the lines are thinner and more difficult to target the tougher a target is. At first, these lines are all you can perceive and influence, but after some time passes they will become clearer to your eyes and you will eventually see circular ‘points’ on their body that the lines all trace back to. Cutting or stabbing this point of death directly will immediately kill the target in question - no form of reincarnation, resurrection, or regeneration will save them from the bitter taste of death. This is what it means to kill something. With time and continued use, you may eventually be able to understand and perceive the concept of death in less tangible things, such as the spells of Magecraft or the empty space between you and an object, though the same general rules apply- and some things can only be ‘cut’, not ‘killed’, for they have no point of death.

However, perceiving how fragile the world and existence as a whole really is...that’s something no human mind can truly bear witnessing. When your eyes are active, the perception of death trains the mind and can eventually cause a human brain to suffer a fatal aneurysm from continued use, and can also damage one’s sanity as they are constantly made to understand the concept of death all around them. Even to an inhuman mind that can sustain the physical damage and the sanity-straining view of entropy, they are tiring to use in the long-term without preparation or precautions. Secondly, the ‘points’ of death may never appear for certain beings- beings that were never ‘born’ or are free of the concept of death entirely, such as a True Ancestor at the peak of their power during the night of a full moon - you would have to remove the source of their immortality or introduce them to the possibility of mortality in a different way, which is beyond the scope of using these alone. The strain also increases the longer you perceive the death of things beyond living beings or physical objects, which can do great damage to your mind if you’re unprepared for it.

1395,,800,Black Barrel,Angel Notes,Destruction ,"The Second Original, found next to its sibling weapon. This Black Barrel is an immensely powerful
conceptual weapon, one of the few things that can reliably defeat even the Aristoteles. It is an
enormous black rifle that is made from a special anti-grain material. Any being with grain in them
cannot even touch the gun, regardless of their power, though you seem to be the single exception. Known as the God Killer, the gun fires a single bullet that becomes more powerful the more grain to
be found in the body of its target. Against one of the Aristoteles, it can defeat them in a single shot, though it should be noted the difference between defeat and kill is quite large indeed. In future
worlds, this grain will instead count as any supernatural being or energy. The greater the power of a
supernatural target, the greater the bullet will become."
1396,,800,Multi-Shot ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Destruction,"Do you want to reach out to everyone, no matter what?​ As long as you have the magical energy to spare, your attacks and magical abilities can reach someone. Your attacks now having a ‘homing’ capability limited only by the amount of energy you can use, and can launch multiple magical attacks with this same ability. While an average magical girl could attack all Wraiths in a small city block with a good chance of success, a true powerhouse could strike Wraiths across an entire continent. That said, that level of competence is rare, and will need a lot of energy and practice...
"
1397,,800,Border of Life ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Destruction,"Though you may never gain the power to simply will a person to death, you will know of the exact, most effective and efficient method needed to bring any being, whether human or Youkai, to their permanent passing. Frequently, this is many times simpler than to go by one’s instincts, and will tend to cause your targets to be caught off guard by your method’s unconventional means. This can also theoretically allow for a way to kill beings that are thought to be incapable of death, such as spirits, or even certain deities, by exploiting loopholes or weaknesses even they might not be aware about. Your power will also cause your enemies to passively lose to will to live, driving those of weaker will to suicide if you let your powers go unchecked. Additionally, you will also learn how to manipulate souls of certain beings to remain lingering on as spirits, zombies or other forms of undead.
"
1398,,800,The Master Sword ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Destruction,"The sword of evil’s bane, this holy weapon is storied for its power and the heroism it asks of its wielders - only the truly worthy may normally be capable of wielding it. The Master Sword is unbreakable and untouched by the ravages of time, its edge keeping forever...and holds a power that rightly earned it its name. 

The power to repel evil, a blessed light within the weapon that can pierce the defenses of any evil being it encounters as well as overcoming magical barriers - by drawing upon its light, a wielder could break through even the near impenetrable defenses of Ganondorf at his peak. This same light also repels any malicious magic that would hope to target its wielder - giving the Master Sword’s holder a strong resistance against curses and forced transformations. The final gift of this power is that even normally unkillable enemies with evil in their heart could be “sealed” if they were defeated by this blade, essentially trapping them in a state where they can no longer harm anyone. This is the sword of the hero, Jumper. Take very good care of it.

1399,,900,Th3 M0m3Nt 05 Cl@Rity,Slay the Princess,Destruction,"A thousand, a hundred thousand, millions, billions, perhaps even more - countless shattered timelines and worlds have coalesced into this singular point, into this...moment of clarity. Every voice you have ever come across has been brought together into this one nebulous point, brought to sit in witness to the rapturous nightmare you have become. Reality breaks and dissolves into madness, then meaninglessness, then finally silence, only to start all over again. And yet you remain, even as your flickering ephemeral existence drives the world to destruction then back then to destruction then back then to destruction all over again, leaving only a mounting fear that shimmers in the air and twists in on itself in a spiralling fog that leaves nothing. Nothing but time, eroding everything. Except for you. You. Are. Still. Here.

Where you walk fear seizes hearts and worlds die, where you touch the laws of physics and stability break until they become no more than echoing howling dust. Everything comes to an end and there is just you, and the fear you've left in your wake. A wonderful feeling to make up for the emptiness inside you."
1400,,1000,Atropos,Greek Mythology,Destruction,"The inevitable end. With the power of Atropos you are the outcome. It is
inevitable that everything has to reach its ending, reach its finish, reach you. When you

single inevitable end you are able to see all possible endings even those that would stop
the “story” prematurely. You see the last moments that everything will experience and in
your presence all things know that they will eventually reach their end especially should
you desire that end to occur. You can slice the threads of fate prematurely forcing an
end but in doing so you weaken the strength of the tapestry forcing it to rethread itself in
a way that allows it to remain together so that fate and the plot can continue without any
adverse threats to itself. Once a year you can end something and force the tapestry to
accept it without trying to rethread itself, this will cause the plot to go on and by some
miracle end how it should just without that single thread."
1401,,1000,Apoptosis: My Path to Hell,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction,"An Apoptosis is the phenomena from which those with divinity produce a being that is both their antithesis and the one with the absolute potential to end them, born from the self-destructive desires that they held. For whatever reason, you too seem to have a similar origin to those existences, perhaps related to one of the divine beings of this era.

However, you seem to be a special case even among these exceptional beings. An impossible being born out of the contradictory World of Dualism. Instead of being a self-destructive factor that brings the end of just its parent entity, the target for your destruction is mutable. If an Apoptosis is basically a divine cancerous cell that corrupts and kills the host from the inside, you are closer to a metaphysical virus that expands until it has consumed everything. 

You have become a vortex of destruction. An engine fueled by killing intent, capable of growing in strength as long your violent impulses remain, as well as empowering yourself with any killing intent directed towards yourself.

By turning your weapon towards someone, you begin to understand them, regardless of how alien they are supposed to be. The more you fight with them, the more you begin to peer into their psyche and the more attuned you become with them, and thus, the deadlier your blows are to them and the less effective their attacks towards you. You develop a resistance to their powers as you keep relentlessly moving forward to their destruction, your weapon never even once leaving your hand, and thus becoming able to see gaps in their techniques and use them to evade even attacks that bend causality to hit you. And when it comes to offense, these gaps also seem to forcibly manifest as your understanding deepens, appearing on even supposedly perfect armors, and then allowing you to strike with surgical precision to utterly annihilate the enemy. Even if those gaps didn’t exist before, your sixth sense will forcibly create and notice them, allowing you to strike the line that brings death. It doesn’t even need to be physical offense, your understanding of your target makes it so you can even crack and destroy their egos with verbal abuse, by exposing their deepest cravings and fears before crushing them. 

And finally, once you have been fully ‘synchronized’ with your victim, you can bring down the full potential of an Apoptosis: the complete annihilation of the host by a power that equals and then eventually surpasses them. You may find that they may even welcome it, being poisoned by the impulse towards self-annihilation that you have attached to them.

But unlike a regular Apoptosis, your strange nature has made it that you don’t die with your host. You have long surpassed the destiny of a mere cancerous cell. You instead take a part of them with you after slaying them, adding it to your strength, and become able to target a new victim. The more you walk this path, the more efficient this process becomes. Those who stand before you become easier to dissect with each new victim, regardless of how alien their minds were or how unfathomable they are supposed to be. Difference is power matter less and less, as your sword cleaves through them quicker each time, moving from one target to another quicker and quicker. Should you not decide to stop at any point, you could go on until every life in the universe has perished under your sword, before turning it to God itself. Until the only thing that remains in this universe is the immutable fact that is your endless desire for blood."
1402,,1000,Star Buster Sword Blaster,HighSchool DxD,Destruction ,"Split between both a longsword and rifle, the sword being capable of cutting through almost all things in their path relative ease, which includes even other Longinus. While the rifle can fire massive aura blasts, capable of defeating most Gods that aren’t versed in war, even without its Balance Breaker, a firepower so high it can easily be on the level of Satans or Gods, and capable of eliminating several islands in a single shot."
1403,,1000,Incinerate Anthem,HighSchool DxD,Destruction ,"This is a semi-independent Longinus, able to manifest independently of the user and act on its own to a limited extent, this version usually acting in the user’s favor. It manifests as any object of its own choosing, and its primary ability to generate purple flames that cause great damage to Devils and other ‘unholy’ creatures, to the same as if not more than the extent of the True Longinus itself. The amount of holy flames that can be summoned are vast indeed, and are the bane of those of evil alignment."
1404,,1000,Titan,Fate/Extella,Destruction ,"Whether from the maturation of an infection or having been created for this purpose since birth, you have taken on the role of an Anti-Civilisation weapon like those used by Velber. You are the
same model as Altera, a standard kind of Anti-Cell. This manifests in two primary abilities, Magic
Energy Absorption and the Crest of the Wandering Star. Unlike Altera, you appear to have been
disconnected from the Umbral Star and receive no compulsions towards destruction from it. 

Your body becomes composed of Spiritron Collectors, which will automatically convert the energy of
any attack designed by intellect- skills, techniques, knowledge, technology, even simple tools made
with rudimentary intelligence -and convert it into Health and Armor Values that are added onto your
being. High powered magic or advanced strategic weapons are useless, only empowering you
further. It’s worth noting that sapient beings created through intelligent design are not fully affected
by this, just the methods they use. An artificially created Servant can hurt you fine with raw energy
as normal but will find techniques blocked as usual. While this absorption has no regard for special
abilities and will absorb despite them, it has two vulnerabilities. Raw power that is not refined can
mostly bypass this absorption, meaning that simply bludgeoning you with little skill will see the majority of the attack pierce this defence. The second is that the Holy Sword Excalibur can work past
this defence and deal fatal damage even after extensive growth and gaining of power. 

The second passive skill represents your new nature as a destroyer of civilisation. Lives, structures
and concepts relating to civilisation that you destroy are converted into spiritron data and absorbed
by your being. Killing humans, their tools and homes, destroying the ideas and inventions that they
have made through civilisation are all valid methods, whereas attacking wild animals or aspects of
nature will give nothing. Data absorbed is treated as mana and will increase your size steadily, as
well as improve other aspects of your being in stages. By absorbing an amount of data mana equal
to your health, your health value will double. Whenever your size reaches double it’s current state, having steadily increased as you destroyed, all parameters will be multiplied by ten. Physical and
magical abilities such as Strength, Agility, Endurance and Mana Power increase this way. When your
size reaches twice your new default, your parameters will again increase by a multiplier of ten. Provided that you continue to destroy, this has no upper limit, but increasing will require enormous
amounts of data to be absorbed. While the Crest passive skill cannot be deactivated, you are able to
channel the data mana it absorbs into you into outside sources as pure energy to reduce your size, also losing the increases to health and attributes as you shrink."
1405,,1200,All Fiction,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Destruction,"Before you, all of creation becomes mere fiction, wished away with a thought. You are able to erase
anything you desire from existence, from a person to the stars in the sky to a colour to someone’s
powers to the love between two lovers to someone’s death or even more abstract things. With just
a thought, these things disappear entirely. It is not impossible for beings of sufficient power or with
similar beings to resist or counter your effects however, nor is it impossible for people to bring back
what you have erased, though one would need to be especially mighty in comparison to you to do so. You could even use this ability to erase your own death, by setting it up in advance or doing it from
the afterlife, though do remember that those who shut down your power or have some way to stop
you coming back will stop you from doing this. Yyou may also gain Non-Fiction
that expands your power to be able to erase the erasure of things, allowing you to bring back things
you or others have removed from existence."
