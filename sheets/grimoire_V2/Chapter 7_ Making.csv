1,,Free,THE INSCRYBER,Inscryption,Making,"Like the other four scrybes, you have access to a unique tool for the creation of cards. With the Canon Replacement drawback, you have the same tool as the Scrybe you’ve replaced. Otherwise, you have one of your own to customize as you will. As far as level of power, these tools should be about equal to those wielded by the original Scrybes themselves. That said, these tools are fairly complicated, so let’s go over their components one at a time, along with two example creations. (These examples are usable ones, if you’re short on ideas.)

First off is the method of inscryption. P03 had a particle scanner that converted robots into cards. Magnificus created paintings of his pupils. How do you capture the essence of your subject? A valkyrie’s blade to be pointed at its target? A telescope that captures what lies within its view? The details are up to you. Bear in mind, however, that this process captures something vital–once you create a card, the subject will exist in the card alone, not outside it. Next, what sort of entity does your tool capture? Often this will relate to the point above. The Valkyrie Blade might capture specifically the spirits of warriors in battle. The Telescope might collect figures wrought from the constellations within its view, the stars themselves remaining but the connection between them lost.

So now you have your cards, and the time has come to play them. Much as Leshy’s beasts require sacrifice, and Grimora’s undead require bones, you must decide what resource your cards require. The einherjar harvested by the Valkyrie’s Blade might require you to gather honor from slaying enemies, and expend that honor in returning them to the battlefield. The constellations from the Telescope may require starlight, a substance that is ever-present, but limited in the number and size of constellations it can support at once. On this note, you may also obtain a single, simple type of card that bypasses this requirement; examples include Leshy’s squirrels, Grimora’s basic skeletons, Valkyrie’s faceless spirits, or Astronomer’s motes of light.

Finally, your inscryber can be wielded in battle directly. As Magnificus’s brush allows him to repaint cards with new abilities, and P03’s scanner allowed him to duplicate an enemy’s cards for his own use, so too does your tool have a use in the midst of a round of Inscryption. Perhaps the Valkyrie’s Blade allows them to dictate, each turn, one unit that is fated to die at that turn’s end, or the Astronomer’s telescope can ‘magnify’ a single card, multiplying their strength but forcing them to fight alone. Again, the details should relate to the form of the inscryber you chose at the beginning.

Requires Inscryption to Purchase"
2,,Free,Character Sheet,Baldur's Gate 3,Making,"You get a multiple page journal that is in the format of D&D 5e character sheets that is
in any style of design you want. This sheet is magical, and it displays all your stats, skills,
abilities and your personal information in an easy-to-read manner. It updates with any new
powers you gain over the courses of your adventure, and it even records your significant deeds.
Only people you get permission can access this character sheet."
3,,Free,Staff,A Mage of Sorothustra,Making,"The lion’s share of adult Sorothustrans possess a magical staff, an object which is
soul-bound to them, and which can serve as a mighty focuser for their magic. While
Sorothustrans do not need their staff or any other implement to be able to use magic, a
Sorothustrans staff can have a number of properties that make them powerful armaments in a
Sorothustran’s toolbelt. At their base, before taking into account additional enchantments, a
Sorothustran’s staff enhances their planeswalking abilities, facilitating much easier travel
through space, allows them to instantly travel to and from Sorothustra instantly from virtually any
place in the multiverse (and once per jump can resurrect you from death/save you from a fate
worse than death such as being trapped forever in a cursed location strong enough to overcome
your magic resistance).
One’s staff also has numerous powerful passive protections such as a powerful force field that
can tank planet-busting hits, providing you with various passive enhancements to your
physique, and providing you with the ability to access a pocket-space inventory. A
Sorothustran’s staff is also a powerful focus for their spellcasting and their rituals, empowering
various facets of spellcasting, such as one’s scale, precision, and even their joint-casting
abilities (their ability to do spellcasting in concert with other Sorothustrans). Every staff is a type
of staff, with additional abilities decided by the Sorothustran who owns the staff at the time of its
creation (which is usually when the Sorothustran in question is approaching the day when they
must join in on the ritual that protects Sorothustra from ascendant invasion and overt ascendant
influence and becomes considered a full adult in Sorothustran society). Please select one of
the following types of staff to determine your staff’s final qualities.
Inevitable: Defenses meant to gainsay the arcane falter and weaken when exposed to the
corrosive magics of your staff. This covers all sorts of defenses, from armor to anything else that
would be between your target and the spell you hit them with. This empowers your native ability
to overcome enemy defenses, and also eases the costs of magic by lowering things like the
focus you need to use your magic and weakens the impact of negative environmental factors
when considering the costs you pay while maintaining your magic.
Indomitable: This staff is a somewhat more offensive version of the Inevitable staff, meant to
overcome anti-magic specifically. Sorothustran magic can be overcome by skilled enough
mages working in conjunction, or powerful enough individuals, most particularly by using
anti-magic charms and wards, but if a Sorothustran is using this kind of staff than such
measures are very likely to be completely nullified. What’s worse, for your foes, is that the
processes by which an Indomitable staff is made instill the maker with knowledge of how to
dispel magic and counterspells, which make them powerful in battle against other mages.
Unbound: An Unbound staff is a free, uncontainable staff. This object is powerfully,
conceptually attuned to freedom and tremendously skyrockets your skill at planeswalking, the
ability to utilize your magic to step from dimension to dimension and to step between and
through universes. This item also powerfully bolsters your resistance to imprisonment of any
sort, working with your soul and reality to either subtly or not-so-subtly give you opportunities to
break free from and out of all sorts of prisons.
Might: This staff is a simple thing but an unbelievably powerful one. This ability has enhanced
enchantments compared to the other staffs and also amplifies the power of the wielder. This
isn’t enough to elevate your magic to star-level, but it’s not considerably weaker than that and if
you happen to be a Wild Dreamer then that trait and this item stack.
Silence: This staff makes it easier than ever to cast spells, removing the need for audible
utterances even when you are utilizing planetary-scale magic. Going beyond that, however, this
staff also allows you to be as perceivable or imperceivable as you wish to be, and with it you
can establish telepathic connections between yourself and others in the same solar system as
you. What’s more, once you’ve established a telepathic connection with someone you can have
telepathic conversations with them across almost any distance but the most extreme, and of
course barring something like deliberate, powerful magic interference."
4,,Free,Lightsaber,The Old Republic,Making,"Is there anything more iconic to Star Wars than the swishing and humming of a lightsaber? Jedi and Sith
receive one lightsaber for free, and may purchase additional sabers at a discounted price. You may
customize your lightsaber's appearance (both hilt and blade) as you see fit, and may choose any canon
saber variant, such as the curved-hilt saber, shoto, guard shoto, long-
handled lightsaber, sabre pike, greatsaber, saber staff, or dual phase saber. The colour of your lightsaber is also completely optional. This purchase is repeatable."
5,,Free,Hardlight,Worm CYOA v17,Making,You can form hard light constructions with a thought. You can have no more than 10 cubic meters of hard light at any one time. There is no limit to complexity if you can keep the blueprint memorized.
6,,Free,Sweet Sweet,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"Careful you don’t overload that sweet tooth of yours. You’ve got an unlimited amount of candy now,
just about any sort you can possibly find on a normal Earth in as great a quantity as you can fit down
your mouth with each gulp. You can even share it with others if you’re actually feeling nice for once
in your life. "
7,,Free,Shared Spirit,Bleach,Making,"Is it even possible to possess the same Zanpakuto as another Shinigami? Perhaps, depending on your
beliefs. It is at least true for you, as rather than something suited to your own being, you have the
same Spirit and powers as an existing Shinigami. Despite this, you’ll find yourself getting along with
and understanding your Spirit with ease, as if you were meant for each other. However, be warned
that Soul Society considers it a highly illegal trait, one that results in the execution of the less worthy
wielder of the Spirit. "
8,,Free,Sticker Album,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Making,"Journeying around the world, you are bound to pick up all sorts of the special Stickers that are
floating around. Here is a nice album to keep them all in one place.

This strange book has a pink cover, adorned with the image of a sticker-like star. It is filled with empty pages of paper. Too add a sticker to the album, simply stick it to one of the pages. Adding or removing a sticker will never cause the sticker to tear, be damaged, or lose their adhesive properties. Stickers can be removed from a page easily, but will not fall out of the album accidentally, and will not degrade as long as they remain inside the album.

The album will be able to expand indefinitely, without appearing any bigger externally or getting any heavier. You will always be able to find whichever page it is you are looking for right away. You can also sort any stickers housed inside in any order you like, just by holding the album and willing it so. Should you have multiples of the same sticker, you may decide whether they appear as separate stickers, or whether the sticker has a nearby number to let you know just how many of it you have.

Finally, if a sticker stored here is one of the special Stickers found in this world, upon touching it whilst it is placed in the album you will be automatically given the knowledge of the Sticker’s name, along with the effect they would have if applied to your Trophy Base.

Should the album be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours. Any stickers that were stored in the album when it was lost or destroyed will also be replaced as they were."

This is the primary weapon you start with free of charge, complete with its own Materia Slots free of charge.

You may import a single weapon into the Unique Weapon slot, or if you buy the Fusion Weapon variant, you may import up to five weapons of a similar 'type' into it, combining them into one."
10,,Free,Mysterious Getup,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"A classic and cute Saber outfit. Rich golds and blue decorate the apparel, a hat and scarf alongside a comfortable hoodie and shorts combination. They’re pretty good at hiding your identity, even if people can totally see your glowing blond hair and dashing blue eyes, they’ll only be able to think that that’s some kind of Saber and not you specifically. Optionally, you can change out these super mysterious clothes for a sensible set of plate armor, which offers decent magical protection at the cost of being really noticeable and not stealthy or mysterious at all. Either choice can be freely manifested and dismissed at will via magic. "
11,,Free,Dime Store Weapons        ,Library of Ruina,Making,"Unless lucky enough to live in a Nest, no one in their right mind would walk around without some form of protection, and the insane here tend to seek out means of dealing out violence regardless.

You won’t inspire envy with these alone, but they’re serviceable. Really that’s all that matters."

13,,Free,Wing Shaped Hairpin,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Making,"This golden Hairpin is an exact replica of Brunhildes own. Its quite stylish and is assured to fit with your appearance seamlessly and enhance it, but it also gives of a passive effect.

18,,Free,Inks & Quills,Wizarding World,Making,"Wizards and witches are odd in so many ways. There are some who would even say that they are rather primitive, especially when it comes to their writing implements. After all, who still uses inks and quills nowadays? Then again, inks and quills aren’t ordinarily enchanted. So, regardless of your feelings on the matter, it’s only proper that you receive your own set of inks & quills.

Appearing to be nothing more than a simple suitcase, opening it will reveal to you your newfound writing tools, an endless supply of them really. You have ink bottles of every color. And you also have some magical inks, like Color-Change Ink, Self-Correcting Ink, Everlasting Ink and more. Even your new quills are fancy indeed, making it quite a pair with the ink. Self-Inking Quills, Quick-Quotes Quills, Sugar Quills, and many, many more. You even have a copy of a certain Senior Undersecretary’s dreaded Black Quill.

19,,Free,“The Wand Chooses the Wizard” ,Wizarding World,Making,"The favored tool of witches and wizards across the globe, the wand is the quintessential magical implement.

Similar to Judgement, instead of getting amazing suits, you instead can choose from a variety of leather/punkish clothing; accessories included. Not into the punk look either?

You can choose the wood type and between one of the wand cores he produces wands with (Unicorn Hair, Dragon Heartstring and l Phoenix Feather). You may instead choose a more exotic wand core (excluding Thestral Hair and limited to parts from other canonical magical creatures/beings of this world e.g. Thunderbird Tail Feather, Veela Hair, etc.) although the three previously mentioned are among the most reliable and powerful. Different cores and woods tend to act a little differently but regardless of what you choose the wand will choose you as soon as you are introduced. Different woods may alter your historical personality (for all but Drop-ins) and therefore tendencies very slightly (e.g. Cypress wands tend to choose brave people and you will as such have been a relatively brave child, Blackthorn may result in you being slightly more combative, etc.). If you already had a wand you may import it into this role and while it will keep it’s wood and core it will gain a significant loyalty boost."

40,,Free,Focus ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Making,"Magically made, focuses are objects that project the electrical energy of your nervous system into the physical world for you. Without a focus – which generally takes the form of a fairly ostentatious piece of jewelry such as a large ring, a necklace, cane and so on – a sorcerer is completely unable to cast. More focuses can be made by a sorcerer, but not without a focus themselves, so keep backups just in case."
41,,25,Animal Repellent Bat Spray,DC Comics,Making,"Sometimes you just have to get rid of some pesky predator tailing you. This high-tech formula

It contains an artificial soul, which may be inserted into a dead body to put a soul to rest. It may
also be used to reanimate the body as a fanatically loyal undead servant, with access to the

memories between “incarnations,” and is designed to tap into its body’s esper powers, which are
advantages a skilled necromancer could reverse engineer. This may be purchased multiple
times."
47,,50,Magic Charger,Overlord,Making,"A small hourglass shaped gem that can fit in the palm of your hand. When

Examples include cooking, smithing, scroll making, jewelry crafting, and so forth. For 200cp you may instead have crafting abilities that are equally applicable to every possible crafting pursuit. Examples include food and drinks that give low level buffs when eaten, low end (but still serviceable) magical weapons, armors, and misc magic items, and so forth. The sort of equipment that would be considered useful and practical enough (in terms of use and cost) for even a more experienced adventurer to eye them appreciatively and think them a worthy addition to their arsenal.

Requires Crafting Classes - Common to purchase."
52,,50,Crafting Classes - Legendary,Overlord,Making,"You now possess classes and abilities aspected towards and in the service of creating a specific type of craft or trade good, and will be able to easily come up with new recipes or innovations for the crafts you select. Examples include cooking, smithing, scroll making, jewelry crafting, and so forth. You could make items that would be considered national treasures by the locals, things like swords so sharp that they could hit ‘above their level’ such as damaging someone that would normally ignore them (for example, bypassing the high-tier physical nullification of a level 100), rings of potent regeneration and stamina recovery, masterwork armor that even a hero would be honored to wear, food and drink that could potentially heal a man of injury instantly or empower him to staggering heights (temporarily at least), and so forth.

Requires Crafting Classes - Rare to purchase."
53,,50,Craftomg Classes - Divine,Overlord,Making,"You now possess classes and abilities aspected towards and in the service of creating a specific type of craft or trade good, and will be able to easily come up with new recipes or innovations for the crafts you select. Examples include cooking, smithing, scroll making, jewelry crafting, and so forth. Your crafting skills have hit their zenith. At this point you could make items on par with Divine Tier equipment, things even beings of godlike strength would find no complaint in, or foods and drinks so nourishing that someone might not need to eat or drink for a month or more afterwards, and conveying extremely potent temporary buffs alongside that. However, of course, no matter what your level of skill one simple fact remains; your skills are largely worthless without materials to use them with. While you might be able to take even subpar ingredients and fashion something workable only with truly excellent materials will you be able to craft something genuinely great, especially at the highest levels of crafting.

Requires Crafting Classes - Legendary to purchase."
54,,50,Howler Bombs,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Making,"The Howlers are known for their use of a special powder created from tropical herbs and industrial chemicals. It’s a fast-acting hallucinogenic that turns any speech the victim hears into animalistic howls, distorts their vision, and interferes with their coordination – a terrifying experience when under assault. You receive a dozen bombs that disperse the powder on impact, as well as the same number of ‘Howling’ crossbow bolts, and a spring-loaded launcher that straps to your wrist to fire them."
55,,50,Musical Style,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"A musical instrument of your choice. It’s a high-end model, whatever it is, and very sturdy too. What
makes it special is that anyone playing the instrument can perfectly translate the emotions they feel
into the music the instrument makes if they desire, with the quality of the music rising alongside the
depth and breadth of the emotions being channelled into the instrument. The audience will be able
to almost tangibly feel the hopes and dreams that go into your music if you feel strongly enough."

primarily by low level Shinigami who have gigai troubles, the glove allows one to forcibly extract a
soul from a corporeal body by simply pushing them out. When used on normal humans, they will

74,,50,Support Materia,Final Fantasy VII,Making,"Alright, we're finally on the meat and potatoes of this world. Or in this case, glowing magical marbles. Materia are crystallized energy from the Lifestream that others can use to unlock special abilities or wield magic. Most Materia only requires a mental act of will from the user, and while the most common and convenient method to wield them is by attaching them to weapons or equipment in little 'slots', simply touching one or having it on person when willing it to activate is sufficient. Most Materia start with a basic ability or a limited-time use, but may unlock more uses or more powerful versions of a given ability as they grow in power. After enough use and experience, a Materia will be 'born' and reach the peak of its power, which has different effects for each type.

Materia purchased here starts at its base level. As for what each one does and how much they cost…

Here's one that will be fun to play with. These pale blue Materia are meant to be paired with other, non-Support Materia to give them unique effects or utility for the user. For instance, you could attach an HP Absorb Materia to a Fire spell to cause it to drain the lost health into the user, or you could attach an Elemental effect to give your weapon the Fire properties of said spell. Many of these are contextual and open to experimentation.

A list of canonical Materia and their effects can be found in Notes.

138,,50,"""Carvings & Knife""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"An odd set of items, we'll start with the carvings. Purchasing this grants you five wooden carvings resembling twisted heads, each letting out a few deep, bellowing words when dropped on the ground. The carvings you have call out ""Very Good"", ""Thank You"", ""Hello"", ""Help Me"" and ""I'm Sorry"" respectively. You also receive a small whittling knife, allowing you to make more carvings like these. Simply think on the one to three words you want it to say while carving a wooden head with an expression fitting for them. The knife doesn't do much else, but it'll stay strong and decently sharp."
139,,50,"""Infinite Prismstones""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Warm pebble emitting a beautiful phasing aura of seven colors, with a very rare eighth."" Prismstones, glowing crystals that can be used to leave a trail for you to follow backwards while exploring some uncharted area. They also possess a secondary unique ability. The fragile stones can be tossed off a ledge, and if the fall would be fatal, they will fracture and let out a loud screech to alert you. The Prismstones can be pulled from your pockets, sleeves or anywhere else appropriate on your person."
140,,50,"""Horsehoof Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Unbreakable Patches adored this ring and the feeling that it gave him when he kicked his marks into the depths of treacherous traps, but suffered no shortage of ridicule from his associates for relying so heavily on the tired old trick. But who is the sorrier? The horse who knows only to kick, or the fool who approaches the old beast without thought?"" A ring depicting a horse's hoof, it magically empowers your kicks which helps with breaking an enemy's guard."
141,,50,"""Knight’s Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Ring engraved with a portrait of a knight. In Lothric, the Knight has long been considered one of the Three Pillars of the king’s rule, and were thus allowed to rear dragons."" One of the enchanted rings often handed out to knights of Lothric, this ring provides a substantial increase to the wearer’s strength. Similar rings that boost the intelligence and faith are also given to Scholars and the High Priestess, as well as the members of the Black Hand, the unofficial fourth Pillar, whose ring boosts dexterity."
142,,50,"""Young Grass Dew""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""A small, transparent stone that once graced the green young grass crest. This semi-precious gem honors a Spear of Church after a battle well-fought, and is said to slightly enhance their blessing of protection."" A small, yellow-white stone small enough to be held in the palm of one’s hand. Simply holding the stone on one’s person provides minor benefits to the wielder, including slight increases in their magical energy, durability, and stamina regeneration. It also doubles the amount of knives thrown when utilizing the Church Guardian Shiv- though, again, the overall damage remains low."
143,,50,"""Aldritch’s Sapphire""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Aldrich, infamous for his appetite for flesh apparently had the desire to share with others his joy of imbibing the final shudders of life while luxuriating in his victim's screams.""

145,,50,"""Pontiff’s Right Eye""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Knights who peer into the black orb are lured into battles of death, transformed into frenzied beasts. No wonder the Pontiff only provides these rings to those dispatched to foreign lands."" This ring rewards aggression, granting its unique ability to the wearer upon landing multiple successful attacks against an enemy during battle. The Right Eye Ring grants a small but noticeable increase in the strength of your soul, making your body and basic abilities stronger with it. This effect will last as long as you continue pressing the attack and land those hits."
146,,50,"""Pontiff’s Left Eye""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Knights who peer into the black orb are lured into battles of death, transformed into frenzied beasts. No wonder the Pontiff only provides these rings to those dispatched to foreign lands."" This ring rewards aggression, granting its unique ability to the wearer upon landing multiple successful  attacks against an enemy during battle.

147,,50,"""Purging Stones""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Ash-colored stone encasing a skull. Inhabitants of Londor, the land of Hollows, use this secret treasure to feign normalcy. Occasionally, a Hollow fools even himself, and turns on his own kind."" Upon being crushed in hand, it completely reverts hollowing back to the first stages, allowing an otherwise desiccated husk of an undead to resemble a human once more. Doesn't not cure hollowing, simply reverts the progress of it."
148,,50,"""Wolf Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Ring associated with Abysswalker Artorias, one of the Four Knights of Gwyn, the First Lord. Artorias had an unbendable will of steel, and was unmatched with a greatsword."" Sharpens the wearer's will somewhat when worn, allowing them to more easily push through pain, temptation or fear."
149,,50,"""Blacksmith's Hammer"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""Metal hammer passed down amongst blacksmiths of the shrine. Serves as a striking weapon, but also excels at shattering poise and breaking the guard of a shield. Of course, a hammer's true potential is realized in the hands of a blacksmith."" Very simple in design, with a simple but sturdy wooden shaft and a head made more for shaping metal than caving in skulls. Functions poorly as a weapon."
150,,50,"""Transposing Kiln""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"""An old transposing kiln from Courland, crafted with stitched crystal lizard hide. This kiln can transpose twisted souls to craft special items with their concentrated essence. Deemed forbidden by those unable to make proper use of it."" As described above, it's used for Soul Transposition. Virtually useless and possibly even dangerous in the hands of those unaware of the intricacies of transposing souls."
151,,50,Wooden Carvings,Dark Souls 2,Making,"“Strange curiosities, carvings of wood meant to appear as faces. When dropped on the ground, they speak! Odd things.

152,,50,“Oil Bombs”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"Glass vials on lines of rope, filled with refined oil. The bombs are small enough to be handled by human hands, while the ropes attached allow drakes to pick them up and drop them from above with their jaws or talons. It should go without saying, but for drakes with the ability to breath fire, these can be dangerous supplementary weapons."
153,,50,“Early Age Portrait” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A noble and powerful knight of Anor Londo, during the height of the Age of Fire a painting was commissioned in your honor. This painting is particularly resilient to the passage of time and depicts you in the greatest light possible at your discretion. Commission a grand portrait of you slaying a dragon, or something humbler like posing with fellow knights."
154,,50,“Silken Clothes” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A set of pristine white cloths with golden stitching. These silken clothes were woven for the gods during the height of their prosperous Age of Fire. They offer no true form of protection, but are luxuriously comfortable and permanently clean, filth just falling from their threads. This set was tailor made for you."
155,,50,“Chaos Eater Acid” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A very bizarre tool, it resembles a large yellow bucket with many eyes that looks suspiciously like a Chaos Eater demon. The interior is lined with multiple rows of teeth and when squeezed it belches corroding acid. Technically alive, but doesn’t need food, doesn’t think much."
156,,50,“Skull Lantern” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A lantern made from the skull of an undead, with handle made of the deceased being’s hair and bearing full beard. It releases light from an internal flame like a normal lantern. A reliable source of light is surprisingly rare and valuable in these tumultuous lands, where all manner of things lurk in the darkness. Can be used as a bludgeoning weapon that bellows fire with strikes, but not work very well in this role."
157,,50,“Covetous Silver Serpent Ring”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"The serpent is an imperfect dragon and symbol of the Undead. Its habit of devouring prey even larger than itself has led to an association of gluttony. The ring acts as a magnet for souls, allowing wandering undead to pull more ‘souls’ from the enemies they slay before they fade."
158,,50,“Twinkling Titanite”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A sack of Twinkling Titanite chunks. After being peeled from their slab they were at some point imbued with special power, taking this form, thus no twinkling slabs exist. Twinkling Titanite chunks are used by smiths well learned in the techniques in these lands to improve upon relics and weapons that bare host to unique powers where more mundane or simplistic materials offer no benefits at all. The sack refills with time. "
159,,50,“Peculiar Doll”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A peculiar doll in a dress, just like one held by an aberration in this world. Has a mysterious power to make abominations and outcasts feel happy when gifted to them, as if they received something truly important. When passed on, a new doll will appear in your warehouse.

Luck regresses to normal over time, effects may worsen if used multiple times during a short time span. "
161,,50,“Dragon Scales” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"On purchase, you receive a large crate filled with the stone scales of ancient eternal dragons.

162,,50,“White Séance Ring” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A divine ring entrusted to the head bishop of the Way of White and apostle to Allfather Lloyd, uncle to Lord Gwyn. It is of great symbolic importance. For mechanical benefits, it is of lesser importance, but useful nonetheless. It simply has the power to allow the wearer to attune one more spell than they ordinarily could, even if they had no talent with magic of any kind."
163,,50,“Prism Stones”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A simple refilling bag of prism stones, shiny crystals that break with a loud scream when dropped from too high, and glow with colorful lights. Curiously, the height they break from is also the same as a drop that would inflict severe injury, perhaps death, to a normal human."
164,,50,“Big Hat”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A gigantic hat reminiscent of Big Hat Logan’s big hat. Just like his hat, which he wore from antisocial tendencies, your big hat covers almost your entire head, blocking your face and ears. Despite these obstructions, the wearer still seems to be able to hear and see as well as if they weren’t wearing it, though may optionally just have it behave as normal. Always stays in place just fine."
165,,50,“Sunlight Medal” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"This appears to be a warm, golden medal emblazoned with a familiar symbol of the sun. It can’t be lost, always finding its way back in your possession. Each time you engage in jolly cooperation with someone, working to complete some arduous task or vanquish a fiendish foe, the Sunlight Medal creates a duplicate. This new medal can’t duplicate itself, but is otherwise an exact copy. You may stockpile the medals as symbols of fond memories, or give them to those you cooperated with as a symbol of friendship. All medals have an aura of authenticity allowing someone to tell a real one from a fake one."
166,,50,“Gold Pine Resin”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"Gold Pine Resin is a rare type of Archtrees resin that sparks with electricity. You receive several a small satchel filled with individually packaged packs of it that recover with time.

168,,50,“Cleaning Cloth”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"While appearing to be a simple, clean washcloth, this cloth is supernaturally, permanently cool and just moist enough to not drip and make a mess. Using this cloth, you could wash away the soot that comes with your profession or simply rest it on your head to cool down. Simply wring the cloth to cause accumulated filth to evaporate."
169,,50,“Binoculars” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A handy pair of binoculars, useful for surveying these dangerous lands from a distance without putting yourself in danger.

170,,50,“Tiny Being’s Ring”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A weak magic ring that fills you with additional vitality. This essentially allows you to cling to life harder and endure ailments or wounds of greater intensity. Doesn’t help tremendously, but one more stab, ten more steps to a safe place, could be all the difference between life and death."
171,,50,“Alluring Skulls”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"This is a sack, a sack of skulls, weird glowing skulls. Alluring Skulls contain dimly lingering souls that produce the scent of life when shattered. While they can’t be used for much, the souls too weak to help you on their own, they make for an incredible distraction for things starved of life that feed on souls, such as undead."
172,,50,“Soapstone Bundle” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"This is a bundle of soapstones, crystals that come in a variety of colors that work similar to chalk. Simply use to write on some surface and glowing letters appear. The soapstones do not wear down with use and can be used to write on virtually any surface, only destruction of said surface truly erasing it unless you use the blunt end of a pink soapstone."
173,,50,Ring of Doomed Betrothal,Bloodborne,Making,"“A mysterious ring with a large diamond in a silver setting originating from deep beneath the city. It is stained with blood at first, though that is easily cleaned up. The ring doesn't seem that special at first, but bares strange ability. When used in a proposal, no matter how much the opposite party may love the person offering the ring, they shall decline.” "
174,,50,Victorian Doll ,Bloodborne,Making,"“A life-sized female doll made of porcelain, wearing Victorian style clothing. It doesn't ""seem"" to do anything, but it is pretty and well made. If you like collecting or playing with dolls, I'm quite sure it could become a prized possession. 

As opposed to this female doll with her white hair and flowing dress, or in addition to it, you may purchase another kind of doll. This doll will have its own outfit of your choosing, providing it could be found around here, and somehow resembles one of the local inhabitants at your discretion.”

175,,50,Hunter’s Torch,Bloodborne,Making,"“An odd torch that never seems to stop burning. It doesn't release smoke or dwindle over time, it’s just on fire. It's not an extremely hot, bright, or large flame, but it's fire alright. Surprisingly effective against enemies that hate fire, especially when used to bludgeon them.” "
176,,50,Bag of Quicksilver Bullets,Bloodborne,Making,"“A curious bag full of quicksilver bullets. These bullets are infused with the wielder’s blood and will prove quite useful during the hunt while facing beasts of various sorts. Though it’s small and easy to carry, it can even fit twenty bullets at a time. 

These bullets, much like Blood Bullets, can assume the shape of larger projectiles or fuel by loading them together into specific weapons. Just by possessing the bag you will somehow come upon this rare ammunition as you forage, but for 50BE it will automatically refill at a rate of one bullet per hour.”"
177,,50,Golden Needle and Sewing Kit,Elden Ring,Making,"Identical to the tools brought by Radagon when he entered into marriage with Rennala, this lustrous series of tailoring implements have one unique virtue: They can mend and improve even clothing worn by the divine. While they are certainly very high quality tools for clothes of all kinds, with this an otherwise mortal tailor could stitch improvements and modifications to even the strangest of clothes worn by demigods of this world. Also, the golden thread looks very fancy on you, and has been enchanted to never wear out.

The Soreseal of Radagon, which greatly increases the power of one’s body at the cost of increasing the damage taken. The moon of Nokstella, which grants the bearer a measure of the wisdom once provided by a lost black moon. A talisman resembling the Elden Lord of dragons, which extends the duration of sorceries and incantations once cast. One of these or other similar baubles may be yours with each purchase.

179,,50,Hallowed Headgear,Elden Ring,Making,"No self-respecting saint or sorcerer would leave home without some sort of fancy headwear that proclaims to all the power they wield. You now own one such example, which greatly empowers a mystic art practiced in these lands. It could be a radiant crown similar to the Noble Goldmask’s namesake. Or a large, floppy witch’s hat akin to Ranni’s. Whatever it is, it’s fashionable and distinctive as well as beneficial for magical proficiency.

180,,50,Valkyrie’s Prosthesis,Elden Ring,Making,"A golden prosthesis once used by the one-armed Valkyrie, this masterwork artifact can be used as proficiently as a real arm given skill and practice. Though it is unmistakable mechanical in character, it is lovingly designed and it’s faded golden lustre has a beauty all of its own. As much a compliment to a beautiful swordswoman as a blade of legend-but honestly, what are the odds of you running into a crippled swordswoman of exceptional skill in this world, particularly in the regions where the Scarlet Rot has taken hold? Perhaps at the behest of a strange old man living in a shack?

At your discretion, this or subsequent repurchases may represent different types of limb than the right arm it nominally is fitted for.

181,,50,The Craftsman’s Hoard,Elden Ring,Making,"Golden centipedes and sunflowers, infused with the Erdtree’s sanctity. Great dragonfly heads and moon eggs, or even blood-tainted excrement. The flowers needed by perfumers to extract the essences with which they ply their trade. Smiths and craftsmen of this world have a great need for many unusual materials, and each time you purchase your item you may buy a crate of them. It may be any combination of materials that can be found in this world-the sum total must merely fit in a crate, and will be mysteriously replenished each week without fail.

With respect to the fact that you can, in fact, purchase excrement with this option to be clear-you are buying an approximate quantity of materials that can fit into one crate and all components can be, at your discretion, stored far away from each other. In airtight containers.

182,,50,Lost Ashes of War,Elden Ring,Making,"Replenishing ere the morn of each day, these ashes of war lack memories of any battle. And yet some old magic, perhaps that which is inherently rooted in the propagation of life from death, sees to it that a skilled smith can recreate other ashes through it. Some further enchantment ensures that simply by touching and meditating on their greatest fighting techniques, skilled warriors and sorcerers alike can impart their own Ashes of War-although the ash must be taken out in bowlfuls from the crate first for the imbuement, so there is no risk of one Ash of War overwriting the whole batch. 

Comes with a lifetime supply of small pouches to separate different ashes.

Each purchase you make here provides a crate full of some of the more unique arrows in this land, which mysteriously replenishes at the start of each day. Arrows enchanted with tempestuous winds that knock all but the sturdiest of warriors off their feet with comparatively little force, arrows imbued with an oath-sworn incantation containing the Erdtree’s holy power, arrows alive with the spirits of small animals or even glintstone-embedded arrows that leave beautiful meteor-like trails when fired. If it can be whittled and strung on a bow, you can own a great many of it here.

184,,50,A Chef’s Trove,Elden Ring,Making,"Hunting and killing are such chores and you have better things to do with your time that track down every tortoise, prawn and crab to make mincemeat out of. Why not invest in some edibles? Whether it’s fresh eggs you need or elk bones, each purchase here grants you a crate’s worth of various animal meats either magically preserved at the height of their freshness or already expertly cured and spiced in the ways common to this land-as well as the spices and herbal mixtures that grant many foods their wondrous effects on. You are free to choose any combination of spices and meats; be assured that your condiments and foods alike are securely preserved without blending into each other.

Alternatively, this or subsequent purchases can take the form of a small breeding population of commonly edible animals in this world-approximating the value of meet that a flock of sheep provides, which can become a self- sustaining habitat attached to your Warehouse if you wish. Want to have a steady stock of fresh crab meat or tortoises to fill your belly with? Now’s your chance.

185,,50,"Life of the Land, Life of the Stars ",Elden Ring,Making,"In future worlds it may prove difficult to obtain the rare woods, the crystal tears and other blessed byproducts of the Erdtree. Aspiring sorcerers may also be concerned about the lack of glintstone in skies where the stars do not guide fate. Worry not!

Not only have you gained two such chalices with your investment here, but you also have 30 golden seeds of the Erdtree. By some wondrous magic, these seeds can enhance the flasks, increasing the number of uses one has when drunk-and even without a Sign of Grace, the flasks you buy here are guaranteed to replenish in full at the start of each day.

188,,50,The Perfumer’s Art ,Elden Ring,Making,"In time past, the role of perfumer was much respected; a blessed apothecary in the eyes of the many. But after entering the battlefields of the Shattering they performed no such role, trading their aromatics for poisons and explosives-as well as scents that embolden the morale of those under their command. Once jealously hoarded the capital, the art has since spread far and wide into the Lands Between-and whether you yourself are a legitimate heir or the art or learned it later, there’s no doubt you’re a master perfumer. From blood-red gels that cause wounds to bleed grievously, to noxious poisons of all kinds, to even elemental forces contained securely in pots all the many means of killing a man subtly or bewitching his mind are known to you."
189,,50,Prawn Chef,Elden Ring,Making,"This is a dread age. A wolf age. An age of strife, and deprivation, and deadly gigantic shellfish roaming the lands. What’s an honest man to do about it? Why not boil them all up? It seems that among your other skills, you’re an experienced chef and can confidently skin, cure, and dress pretty much anything even somewhat edible you can kill.

You know the recipe for the golden medicinal solution that, once a pickled foul’s claw is soaked in, increases the runes obtained from slain enemies for a spell-as well as the medicinal yet delicious solutions to dip cured meat into so that you remain robust, resilient and focused in battle. You even know how to dry the livers of certain elementally empowered monsters in order to take on a measure of their resistance for a time in your battles. From the aphrodisiac properties of turtle meat (as well as the bitter medicine needed to wring uncanny stamina from it) to the fiery spices that ensure flesh roasted in it makes a hero’s blows strike harder than usual, you’re as much a field medic as a survivalist cook.

As a bonus, you seem particularly skilled at cooking up shellfish of all kinds. Even without your medicinal expertise prawn, crab, lobster and such taste so good they noticeably increase a warrior’s mettle in battle."
190,,50,Refilling Zonko’s Bag,Harry Potter,Making,"A bag of Zonko’s products that refills. Dungbombs, sugar quills, hiccough sweets etc. Not much use but good fun."
191,,50,Muggle Worthy Switch,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Making,A switch that can merge with any given lock (and removed as you like). When the switch is pressed it makes the contents of whatever is behind the door or in the container appear mundane and unremarkable.

192,,50,Gemcutter,MtG - Shandalar,Making,"Rather than relying on a steady but limited supply of amulets, this upgrade further expands your options in terms of both acquiring and using amulets. You now gain all the various teachings and lore necessary to craft your own amulets, and you can now find a Gemcutter’s Guild within the Arcane Bazaar. Offering similar kinds of magical lore and spells for a fee, the Gemcutter’s Guild does not trade for coin - rather, it buys (and sells) magic in return for amulets.

Requires Jewelry(MtG - Shandalar)  and Arcane Bazaar(MtG - Shandalar) "
193,,50,Jewelry ,MtG - Shandalar,Making,"Though most kinds of magical power in Shandalar take the form of the various spells and artifacts used by its mages, there is also a long-standing tradition of infusing gemstones with magical power to create ‘amulets’ suited for a variety of purposes. For example, White amulets are most often used in a ritual to teleport to a distant beacon - typically a town or city that is under attack by hostile forces. Amulets can also be traded for coin or, occasionally, for spells, and there’s likely plenty of other uses you’ll be able to find for such highly-condensed stores of magical power. With each purchase you will receive one amulet of each of the five colors per week, to use as you see fit."
194,,50,Sleight Of Hand ,MtG - Shandalar,Making,"These ordinary-looking but high-quality fine leather gloves are as suited to the trade of con-men as they are to more honourable professions. When activated, the gloves allow you to reach into your pocket, a bag, a similarly small-ish container, or even just close your hands and pull out… something that you shouldn’t have had before. Though it does not create such items ‘ex nihilo’, the gloves can be used to reach into your Warehouse or any other such property to acquire whatever item you need or have access to. The effect itself is entirely untraceable barring direct observation, making it quite useful for tricking people. You could use it to swap an item in your hands for one in your Warehouse, swap a copper coin for a goblin-craft grenade, or even switch around the offered spells for your ‘Ante’ in a mage-duel... all without anyone the wiser until the switch is completed.

The Sleight Of Hand gloves can be used once per day for free, and can be recharged instantly by spending an Amulet of any color (such as from the ‘Jewelry’ or ‘Gemcutter’ options below), though you cannot use two Amulets of the same color in a row."
195,,50,Conjurer’s Will ,MtG - Shandalar,Making,"Proof of the concept that only power equals power, this pitted iron crown can be a spellcaster’s greatest ally... or worst enemy. Ordinarily, mages in Shandalar need a not inconsiderable amount of time to prepare and modify the arcane powers they can draw on ‘in the moment’, but the Conjurer’s Will allows this process to be completed instantaneously - enabling a spellcaster to exchange or alter vast amounts of their magical preparations at once. The crown can likewise be used to replace any similar magical or supernatural preparations for abilities you possess, though keep in mind: it merely swaps out one option for an equivalent alternative. It does not grant you any additional power directly. After all, all things have a price.

The Conjurer’s Will crown can be used once per day for free, and can be recharged instantly by spending a Black Amulet (such as from the ‘Jewelry’ or ‘Gemcutter’ options below)."
196,,50,Wordslayer ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"A strange item shaped like a much more dangerous artifact, this glowing blue sword shaped letter opener never seems to dull and has a nifty rubber eraser on the pommel that neatly removes words from any surface."
197,,50,Magic Dorayaki ,Golden Sky Stories,Making,"Dorayaki is a special type of sponge cake, made with a red bean paste filling inside. A notable favourite of kids, foxes, and a special blue cat robot, this bag of dorayaki comes with a sizable amount of cakes inside; still warm from the oven regardless of how long you’ve left it alone. I did say it was magical didn’t I? Should you finish it, and there should be enough inside to feed several people, you’ll find that the bag will refill after a day or so.
"
198,,50,Royal Riches,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Making ,"Princely in blood or just in soul, you’ll be sure to look the part. You’ve a range of outfits, each able to
be summoned onto your body with a thought, that best fit the role of a heroic warrior and charming
prince of these lands. The pure white robes of a man like Arjuna or the combat attire of
Ashwatthama, each giving an impression of nobility or ferocity respectively, are examples. In
addition to your new attire, you’ve a handsome supply of riches in your name. Enough to live the life
of a moderately wealthy prince for a few years in this land, though war does tend to eat up funds if
you use it to that end."
199,,50,Capable Armaments,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Making ,"They do go through such abuse, the tools of all these legendary warriors. Not every man who fights
through a thousand soldiers is lucky enough to have a weapon of the Gods at his side, so this option
provides a capable alternative. These worthy tools are weapons of your choice that can withstand
whatever force you apply in using it. Bows that always stand up to your draw strength and swords
that never melt from being swung too fast, the weapons won’t have any special attributes beyond
this. They’ll be fine weapons that most would be glad to use but nothing compared to what lays
after this. You receive four different tools in this way, enough for a sword and bow and spear and
shield. The classic tools."
200,,50,Divine Splendor,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Making,"The natural splendour of Divinity is present in all that associates itself with you. The garments that
wreath your form are just one sign of many that this is the case. While you receive several sets of
ornate clothing fit for any divinity, this effect covers much more. Any item you own, even extending
to entire properties, can be given an automatic make over to make it fit for an ancient Indian deity. From the gold-blue metals and gemstones to the more sacred Buddhist trappings, you can give all
that you have the aesthetics of a Indian deity or a Buddhist priest."
201,,50,Beniemiya,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making,"It might just be something in the water, both what you’re drinking and what you serve to the guests
that adore ever meal you make. You’re a savant when it comes to making meals, not just limited to
Eastern dishes either. With a little experimentation, you can make almost anything into a mouth
watering feast for both the tastebuds and the eyes. The real problem isn’t making a good meal but
keeping all these greedy pigs from eating you out of house and home. Don’t even try making
hamburgers around any blonde ladies, it never ends well.

Now, while cooking good food is a prize well worth it, you do also have a more useful aspect here. By
channeling magical energy into your tools and ingredients as you work, you’re able to ‘enchant’ the
meal with a variety of useful effects. A hearty beef stew that lets a warrior heal their wounds much
faster than normal, sugary sweets that give people the speed of the wind, a mighty hamburger that
temporarily bulges the muscles to greater heights. Even negative effects are possible, if you want to
taint your food that way. They only last for a temporary period and the effects tend to be fairly weak
without a lot of mana put in but it makes your food all the more popular. "
202,,50,War Paint,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making,"A tightly lidded bucket of paint, seemingly in whatever colour you need at the time. Doesn’t look like
it runs out either. This paint bucket is filled with paint that appears to channel magical energy quite
well, making for a particularly efficient way to paint Runes and other forms of magic that require
sigils or signs. It makes for a pretty fantastic body paint as well, easily letting you breathe naturally
through it and providing a potent way to stock Runes up on your body. You cannot import into this. "
203,,50,Pixie Dust ,Peter Pan,Making,"A small bottle of pixie dust for emergency flying. Never know when it might come in handy.
"
204,,50,Tea Tray in the Sky ,Wonderland No More,Making,"This peculiar silver tea tray has handles that are stylized to resemble bat wings ... and at an opportune moment, the handles will indeed transform into silver bat wings to skillfully carry the tray and its contents around. The tray carries up to 20 lbs of contents and follows its owner, presenting itself when its owner wishes to retrieve something from or place something upon the tray.
"
205,,50,Pocket Watch ,Wonderland No More,Making,"An ornate silver watch with an hourglass engraved upon its casing. Being a Wonderland watch, it measures the day but not the hour. If you wind back the watch, you will gain enhanced speed/quickness until the watch finishes unwinding or an hour has passed. You can also immediately stop the watch’s effect by snapping its case shut. However, the watch is temperamental, and for every minute you use it, there’s a 5% chance it will explode noisily into a shower of parts. If broken or lost, the watch will return to you in restored condition in two days. If you already own a similar watch, you can alternately give it the features/effects of this purchase.
"
206,,50,Walking Stick ,Wonderland No More,Making,"A firm stick that has been whittled out to have what looks like a human foot at the bottom. The stick can hop about to keep up with you. As long as you are walking beside the Walking Stick, your speed will increase a little; the Walking Stick’s speed will match your increased pace.
"
207,,50,Glowy Gubbins ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Making,"Proppa Waaagh!gear is created in the forges of the various Goblins, Black Orcs, and Shaman tents. Orc and Goblins carve glyphs which fill with the power of the Da Great Green, sending them smouldering green with dark smoke, verdant flame, and emerald lightning. These magical items are more effective at the job they are used for, a sword cuts with greater ease and armor which could protect against cannons are among the things you could see crafted in this way. Whilst the weapons enchantments are usually crude they always make an item better than it was before.
"
208,,50,A Bottle of Something,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Making,"This bottle contains either Milk or some form of potion and replenishes every day. Multiple purchases can be taken with this perk, so that you gain more of one thing or one of every type of potion at your wish.

216,,50,Cheese Magic ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"- Well, I mean, at least you'll never go hungry? With this, you are able to summon any kind of cheese right into your hand. You can shape it however you want, so you totally can make a statue of yourself made entirely out of cheddar."
217,,50,Alchemical Reagents ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"In order to perform alchemy, one must first have the appropriate ingredients. Luckily, that is no longer a problem for you. You now possess a storage closet containing fifty of all alchemical ingredients found within the Elder Scrolls series, organized so that you can easily find what reagent you're looking for.

219,,50,Soul Gems ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"In order to enchant, one must possess both the knowledge of the enchantment they want to place, as well as a filled soul gem. The second shouldn't be a problem for you, as you possess an organized chest with fifty of all soul gems. These are all filled with energy mimicking that of a soul, not an actual soul, so that should make your conscience feel better about itself when making a flaming sword."
220,,50,Hearthfire - Bee Hives,The Elder Scrolls,Making ," If there's one thing people like, it's honey. Now, you'll never have to worry about running out, as these three beehives are always filled with some busy bees, allowing you to extract a large amount of honey daily. The bees themselves never run out, making them useful for any alchemist.
(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
221,,50,Hearthfire - Expansive Pantry ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"When you go shopping for groceries, you're going to want a place to put them all. This pantry and ice box are larger than they outwardly appear, allowing them to hold an absolutely ridiculous amount of food. It is also enchanted to preserve all food within, allowing even bananas to be fresh even a century after buying them.

222,,100,A Shovel,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"This is trusty shovel is bound to you, cannot be taken from you against your will, is
physically and conceptually indestructible, and is an excellent digging tool. Now if that was all
this thing could do, it would a pretty ‘meh’ gear with such a price paid. This shovel can be used
a dowsing rod for treasure hunting. It will vibrate with a slight hum that is only audible to you
when loot of any kind is near. Whether it be buried, hidden or out in the open.
A final use for this shovel is that, once per week, you can let it guide you to a buried
treasure that can be found within an hour’s walk. If there isn’t any treasure nearby, it will spawn
one for you. The spawned treasure won’t be anything extreme, often being a decent amount of
gold, supplies and gems along with an occasional minor magical item like potions or scrolls.
It’s not much but it is a decent source of income."
223,,100,Alchemist's Supplies,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"You get a small pouch that contains a variety of materials and ingredients within it,
which are very useful for alchemical purposes. Materials inside or in their natural form and are
of usually common or uncommon quality along with an occasional rare material. Materials
taken out from this pouch and not used in any alchemical creations turns to dust within a day.
At the end of each day, this pouch replenishes all of its used-up content. These materials are not
something truly extraordinary in most cases, but they can fuel your basic creations quiet easily.

These materials are of decent quality, but all shopkeepers assume them as faulty goods, so they
won’t buy them from you.
You also get a basic set of alchemist’s tools like a mortar and a pestle, a brewing station,
a beaker with heating flame and so on. This equipment repairs itself within a day, if damaged.
You also get a replenishing set of glass bottles and bomb casings that can only be used for
containing your alchemical creations."

skills required to effectively use them. These skills start out at the level of an experienced rogue
and are only gained when you are actively wielding these tools. However, you can permanently
gain these abilities, and even improve on them, if you use this tools and train with them
constantly."
225,,100,Keychain,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"This simple keychain can be attached to your belt with ease, and it weighs practically
nothing. You can attach keys you own to this chain without any effort. It can’t be lost, and it is
fully bound to you and can’t be taken from you against your will. It will magically sort itself to
find anything key you need, when you need it.
Any door you open or any lock you pick, has its key copied right onto your keychain,
be it artificial or magical in nature. Any lock with the same mechanism you encounter from
now on can be opened by this key without causing any trouble.
Additionally, you can take out a skeleton key from this keychain once per day. This
skeleton key can open any non-magical lock it is inserted into without any trouble, no matter
how intricate the mechanism is. If it is a magical lock it is inserted into, it doesn’t open it, but
it reduces the difficulty of the lock by half. After it does its job, the key rusts and disintegrates
instantly. You still get the copied key to your keychain though, if you manage to open the door."
226,,100,Magical Equipment,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"For 100 CP, you get a magical item of your choice from either official D&D 5E
sourcebooks, or an item picked from within the game itself. This item may be anything you can
dream of. Be it a shield, an armor, a weapon, a ring or even a pair of boots. Possibilities are
limitless. Only rule for picking this item is that it can only be up to uncommon quality.
For 200 CP, you can pick a magical item with same rules as above, but it can be up to
rare quality.
For 400 CP, you can pick a magical item with same rules as above, but it can be up to
very rare quality.
For 600 CP, you get magical item of your choice as well, but it can be of a legendary
rarity item, if that is what you desire. Same rules as above apply for picking this item too. But
buying this version of the item has an additional limitation too. For balance purposes, you can
only pick a legendary item that is from the game and not from 5E sourcebooks. We can’t have
you picking a ring of wishes or a luck blade cheesing this jump instantly upon your arrival,
can’t we? Still even with this restriction, you have plenty of options left. Maybe you want
Balduran’s Giantslayer to rend your enemies apart or Helldusk Armor to gain a plate armor that
is as strong as a fortress. You can even pick the Orphic Hammer to skip a big chunk of the plot.
I’ll leave the choice up to you.
If you pick a unique one-of-a-kind item that already exists within the game setting, you
get an exact replica of it with same powers, while the original one can still be acquired through
normal ways.
All magic items picked by this purchase are fully self-cleaning and self-repairing. They
cannot be taken from you against your will and will find their way back to you, if they were to
ever be lost.
If you were to pick a consumable item like a potion or a scroll, it replenishes itself with
a certain cooldown period that is determined by its rarity, if you were to consume or use it. This
replenishment period is daily for uncommons, weekly for rares and monthly for very rares. You
cannot choose a legendary rarity consumable item.
You can purchase this item multiple times, but your discounts apply one at a time."
227,,100,Fire Gems,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Making,"A pile of strange black stones with red veins, they
swallow flames, slowly turning bright orange as they do. As they grow orange, they become
more and more unstable, until the slightest impact or a smidgen more heat is enough to set
them off into immense explosions, unleashing all the heat they’ve swallowed. You get 10, and
your stock will restore to that level each month."
228,,100,Ryushushoku,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Making,"Candles made from the essence of a dragon,
when burned, they make it easier to learn how to use Ki. You get another set of 20 each week."
229,,100,Soul Shards,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Making,"A small indigo stone, these crystals are notable for
their affinity to unnatural beings. Peering through this shard reveals the souls of any being,
including making spirits visible, though the stone’s opacity makes it somewhat difficult. Their
best function, however, is in the hands of a summoner; While summoners can bind spirits into
whatever they wish, a soul shard is a natural vessel, holding almost any summoned creature
without any issue. You will find another each week."
230,,100,Otherworldly Cuisine,Amphibia,Making,"Somehow despite being another dimension Amphibia
still has things like tomatoes, granted they’re dangerous fruits and grow on frog
eating plants but they still taste the same. There’s also an assortment of bugs
and beetles with flavors like chocolate, this perk guarantees that in future worlds
you’ll be able to find resources that can supplement your recipes. They may be
dangerous to obtain, however."
231,,100,Basic Model Meihou,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"The technique behind the creation of weapons
imbued with organic materials taken from living beings that keep their special
properties and abilities is an age-old art mastered by Wakoku’s numerous smiths
and sword forgers, as seen by their capacity of creating Meihou through their
legendary techniques and immense smithing technology.
Usually forged and created for the Elite Military Leaders in each of Wakoku’s twenty
two nations, the Meihou are unique weapons that share many similarities with the
Teigu despite being considerably weaker, as their strength and capabilities are
determined by the quality of the raw materials used on their production. However,
there are two main types of Meihou, the Basic Models and the High Grade Models.
The Basic Models are simpler Meihou, that despite their durability and quality
matching that of weapons forged from Orichalcum, still lacks any unique powers or
abilities due to the materials used on their creation being taken from lower class
beasts, as well as not requiring to be compatible with their user nor consuming their
energy to be wielded. You receive one of such Basic Model Meihou, taking the form
of any melee weapon of your choice, such as a spear, a scythe, a sword or any other
you prefer."
232,,100,False Plague,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"During his time working with the Group of Terror, Dr. Stylish
created a drug that simulated the Lubora virus, causing the same symptoms of the
virus and giving mild sickness to its victims, with the effects eventually disappearing
after a few days and the victims returning to normal without any sequelae. You
receive a vial containing a few doses of the drug, as well as the instruction to
produce more of it if you want to."
233,,100,True Plague,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"Aria’s mother is a peculiar type of sadist that finds pleasure
in infecting others with diseases, especially with her favorite one apparently being
the Lubora disease that was Ieyasu’s cause of death. Even if you aren’t a monster
like her, you receive a vial containing the virus responsible for causing the Lubora
disease. Some of the disease’s symptoms include skin lesions and internal
bleedings, making it capable of killing an individual in a few days or even less
depending on their current situation. While the virus being mundane and treatable,
it’s still useful for some due to its high lethality when untreated and its low
transmissibility. Alternatively, you can also use your sample of the virus to develop
better treatments or even a vaccine to combat the disease."
234,,100,The Hero's Journal,A Mage of Sorothustra,Making,"This is a simple, handy enchanted item. This journal is bound to
your soul and is perpetually scribbling down your journey from your perspective, with an
occasional perspective shift to some omnipresent narrator who knows more than you do and
occasionally dispenses some wisdom. If you read this journal and study it you will learn of new
adventures you could go on, as well as, from time to time, gain a vital clue regarding where to
go next."
235,,100,Face Concealing Mask,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Making,"A cloth mask designed for skiing or preventing
illness, this mask has a minor paranormal effect that prevents you and up to three of your
companions from being connected to the deeds you committed while wearing it, except in a
positive light."
236,,100,Enchanted Sight,TES: Magic,Making,"Being the skilled enchanter that you are, people often come to
you for one of two reasons. To enchant something, or to figure out what something is
enchanted with. Thankfully, you are quite good at the latter, capable of figuring out the
effects of any magical enchantments with but a glance. This will also help you learn new
enchantments without destroying the original item in the process. You also know every enchantment."
237,,100,The Orb of Death,Overlord,Making,"A perfectly spherical purple gemstone and magical item
that will automatically absorb the ‘negative energies’ (of any type) of a place in order to gather
and store magical power. It glows from within with a sickly light when charged with energy. Can
be used to create undead, with more powerful undead requiring greater amounts of stored
energy. It also serves as a focus for amplifying and empowering necromancy. Unlike the Orb of
Death you may find in canon this is not truly sapient, and will not take any actions on its own. In
theory there is no limit to the amount of negative energy that can be stored, but in practice it will
be difficult to attain high levels of stored energy unless you provide it yourself."
238,,100,Elixir,Overlord,Making,"A potion of swirling and shimmering chromatic color in a glass vial best compared to a
work of priceless art. When used it fully restores health and mana instantly, cures all diseases
whether physical or mental, removes poisons, removes curses, and heals burns, scars, and
completely recovers missing limbs. This vial replenishes once per week."
239,,100,String of Hagpearls,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Making,"A string of Hagpearls, seven of them, to wear around your wrist or hide in your pocket. These rubbery spheres hold the power to briefly turn luck into misfortune for a day; all you’ve got to do is hit your target with one of these innocent spheres, and watch as their luck inverts and they stumble on loose cobblestones, bet on the wrong horse or even try to throw a malfunctioning grenade. The beads replenish after a week."
240,,100,Grenadier's Belt,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Making,"A strapping leather bandolier, on which are secured a few new implements of pain and death. It holds five hypobaric grenades, which produce a concussive shockwave around their blast to throw foes off their feet, as well as five Hook Mines – little limpet-mine like devices which use gravitics to ‘hook’ the first unlucky target that comes along in a high-powered tractor beam, drawing them to the mine at high speed. They can be set for both non- lethal and lethal strengths. Both the hypobaric grenades and hook mines replenish by the week."
241,,100,The Other Hand,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Making,"A morbid relic, indeed – this is a dried and shrivelled witch’s hand; while one of those hands is already accounted for, this is the other. It allows you to transform into a swarm of white rats at will – though naturally you should avoid being observed using this, as it is obviously witchcraft. Each of the twenty or so rats holds a portion of your life, but are as vulnerable to harm as a normal rat, so while this transformation is an excellent way to sneak through tight areas, escape into the sewers and even bring down an isolated opponent, you should be wary that you do not expose your swarm to too much danger. If this relic doesn’t sense its owner nearby, it will lunge out at whoever happens to be close, trying to claw and strangle them with the malice of the one whose body provided it."
242,,100,A Gift From The Outsider,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Making,"A human heart, bound with their spirit and brought to life with wire, clockworks and the Void’s power. The Heart glows and pulses rapidly when pointed towards nearby supernatural objects, even across a whole district, and the spirit bound to it can whisper to you the secrets of the living people before it. To any but the supernaturally gifted, it is invisible. This Heart has one further use: It can be used to draw out a fragment of someone’s soul from storage in an object: such as a phylactery or horcrux, and then place that
fragment back into the person to whom it belongs."
243,,100,Ainigmata Ostraka,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Making,"A set of three strange stone tablets, with riddles etched upon them.
The riddles provide clues leading to specific locations, where some form of treasure can be
found. The riddle shown will change one month after being solved, and will update to lead to
new locations in future Jumps."
244,,100,Dress Fit For a God,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Making,"When people imagine Medea, they typically think of her renowned magical skills. While
this is true she is also a seamstress of near unparalleled skill. She loves to create
dresses and other clothing of incredible beauty. Like the famous witch you are a master
of all things related to clothes. Measurements, sewing, and every other skill needed to
craft the perfect outfit is within your purview. Additionally, this expertise extends to
armors and other wearable items, allowing you to blend beauty with practicality. Though
the most useful trait of your craft is arguably the durability. Anything you craft is
exceptionally durable. For example, a ballroom dress you made could remain spotless
and undamaged after a bloody battle. Given time you could easily become a world
renown tailor."
245,,100,Scrounger,The Old Republic,Making,"Whether you're trekking through uncivilized space, behind enemy lines, or just too cheap or broke to buy
what you want, you've learned to make do. When disassembling damaged items for parts, you recover
more useful components than others would in your place. You also have uncanny success in getting just
what you need, whether from foraging, scavenging, looting, disreputable merchants, or just bashing
something together out of spare parts. This won't solve all your problems, but it can keep you going where
others would've had to turn back, and sometimes that makes all the difference."
246,,100,Improved Mind Trap,The Wheel of Time Jump,Making,"A mindtrap, known in the Old Tongue as a cour'souvra, is a device used
to trap a channeler's soul. A mindtrap is constructed of crystal and wire.
It usually only possible to activate it in Shayol Ghul, using the blood and
saliva of the channeler, due to the malleability of reality there. Using a
cour'souvra, the victim's soul is trapped. The victim can feel it trapped in
the cour'souvra and know when someone is touching it. The holder of
the person's cour'souvra has complete control over that person. Should
the cour'souvra be crushed, that person will become a mindless puppet,
subject to the will of the one who crushed it. Channeling or using any
supernatural power in the presence of the cour'souvra in which you are
trapped is very painful; the nearer, the greater the pain. This one has
been improved, allowing it to be activated anywhere and trap the soul of
anyone, not just channelers, and also allows you to release anyone you
have trapped. You can choose how painful it is to channel or use any
other supernatural power near the Mind trap, from excruciating to
nothing. Should it be crushed, then you will receive a new, empty one
the next night. If you have the True Power, you can also make more of
this version of the Mind Trap."
247,,100,Improved Bloodknife Ring,The Wheel of Time Jump,Making,"This ring, being a simple black metal ring that changes it’s size to fit your
finger perfectly, is an improved version of the Bloodknife ring, a nearly
useless suicide ring usually employed by the Seanchan. This ter’angreal,
while worn, boosts your strength and speed to incredible, superhuman
levels, equal to someone carrying five of the original Bloodknife rings at
once, and allows you to not only hide yourself inside shadows, but also
travel through them, allowing you to teleport from any shadow near you
(like the one beneath your feet) to any other shadow within a league of
your location. It comes without the drawback of drastically shortening
your lifespan, and can be replicated in a slightly weaker form, the
replication only giving you the ability of the original Bloodknife rings
without the lifespan draining drawback."
248,,100,Black Ogre,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"The Minus always need to have their own, opposing version of what the Abnormals get. At least they
look cool doing it. Black Ogre is similar to Snow White in its’ suitability as a ward against heat and
cold but where Snow White is made of material that excels against defending against blunt force
trauma, Black Ogre is made of a different thread that is best suited for defending against sharp
attacks. Blades or fragments from an explosion work best but raw physical force is something it
performs poorly against. On the upside, it’s easy to pull off some incredible acrobatics in the outfit. If
only one could combine the two. You’ve got a closet full of these outfits, which will resize to fit any
wearer. "
249,,100,Snow White,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"A closet full of white clothes, various styles of jump suits and other fully covering outfits that adjust
to fit the wearer automatically. These special clothes are quite heavy, as they are made from a very
special kind of thread able to hold several tonnes of material on a single strand. The outfits are
impressively resistant to temperature extremes and blunt force impacts, you could stand in front of
a few grenades and survive in not too bad shape if you covered your face with your sleeves. Sadly, the threads add up to a hefty weight and you may find yourself slowed if you’re not too far beyond
the normal level of human strength. "
250,,100,Degrees,The Games We Play,Making,"It can be a lot of trouble to do anything that you don’t have the right paperwork for.
Like when you’re literally a magical healer but people won’t let you work at the
hospital without a medical license, or when scientists won’t take your theories
seriously just because you lack the shiny degrees!
Good thing you don’t, then. As it happens, you now have the paperwork, IDs and
everything else required to prove any and all qualifications you have or would have if
you bothered to get it. If you’re a good enough doctor you have all the degrees and
forms to prove that, and if you’re a mining expert you have everything needed to
prove that too."
251,,100,Letter of Acceptance,The Games We Play,Making,"Ah. Now this is actually rather important, isn’t it? This is your Letter of Acceptance
to one of the Hunter Training academies of this world, your ticket to training and
growth into a legitimate monster-exterminator!
But it’s probably more important for what it does in future worlds. See, in future
worlds this letter adapts to allow you to join any one school or academy or
institution, basically any place that accepts students for any given purpose.
While this doesn’t provide you any innate skills or talents you’d need for such
admission, it does provide you any political/monetary factors that would be necessary
to get in that way. Have fun!"
252,,100,Wind Bag,Greek Mythology,Making,"A tightly closed leather bag that contains an endless supply of wind. When
opened the bag will release the winds inside, the strength of the wind released depends on how
wide you open the bag's “mouth”. At maximum, expect the strength of a category one hurricane."
253,,100,Cornucopia,Greek Mythology,Making,"The horn of plenty. A symbol of abundance and nourishment. This horn
produces an endless amount of fruits, vegetables, nuts, flowers, and sometimes a choice piece
of meat. If filled with liquid, the horn will change it into a highly nutritious milk that holds the same
properties as the original liquid."
254,,100,Megingjörð,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,A simple belt or other garment or accessory which doubles your strength and durability when worn.
255,,100,Atgørvi,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"Everyone has a skill, don't they, something they become known for; this is a single mundane skill of your choice. At 100cp this skill is simply beyond peer by the standards of your kind, able to be counted within the realm of supernatural talent yet still within mortal grasp of understanding, as a swordsmith able to forge weapons that are too light and too sharp that could easily weather the ages environment or wear and tear even with sub par tools. As a runner being able to run upon the water or leap amongst the tree tops. First purchase is free.

May purchase multiple times."
256,,100,Stone Tablet,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"This stone monument, like the one in possession of the
Uchiha clan, has the objective of passing a message and information to those that
you want in the future. You can write any kind of information on it, being invisible to
those without some specific ability or if some technique of your choice isn’t used to
reveal it. Just the usage of some godlike detection ability would be able to discover
what is written on this tablet without the usage of your chosen ability/technique."
257,,100,Box of Chakra Pills,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"You receive a fiat-backed small box, containing ten
chakra-filled pills, equal to those created using the Chakra Edible Creation perk.
When eaten, they enhance their user’s abilities and rejuvenate them, as well as each
one of them having around the same chakra reserves of the average jōnin. You can
summon this box at will and it’ll be restocked monthly. If lost or destroyed, the box
will reappear in your Warehouse in the next month."
258,,100,Divine Gourd,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"At the first impression, this glowing gourd made of red
chakra looks like any other chakra construct, but there are some important
differences. Unlike the other constructs, this gourd is permanent and doesn’t require
any extra energy to stay existing. Its main function is to store energy and techniques
to use later and even replicate them using your own power after absorbing them for
the first time. The gourd doesn’t have unlimited storage, capable of storing up to
energy equivalent to the power of the One-Tail, and will break if its energy limit is
surpassed, making all of the stored energy and techniques to be released in a very
dangerous way. If lost or destroyed, the gourd will reappear in your Warehouse in the
next year, but, if you have the Chakra Construct perk, you’ll be able to repair it
using your own chakra if it’s destroyed.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."
259,,100,Akimichi Three Coloured Pills,Naruto,Making,"Gain three pills that boost your power, but with adverse effects. The first--the spinach pill--increases your power twofold for a short period, though you may feel exhausted afterwards. The second pill--the curry pill--multiplies your power threefold for a short period, though you'd have a tough time moving around or even staying conscious! The third, and greatest masterpiece of the Akimichi clan, is the chili pill. The chili pill can expand your power up to a hundred times its normal capacity for a brief time, but be warned: death may be just around the corner. These pills replenish every day to a maximum of one each."
260,,100,"Rock Lee's ""Medicine""",Naruto,Making,"This miraculous concoction will turn you into a master of the Drunken Fist technique for several hours with just a few sips, and itt never runs out. If you already know the Drunken Fist, this will enhance your skill as well as act like an endless source of your “power”. Just remember to keep a fake I.D. on you at all times!"
261,,100,Kikanshinki,Bleach,Making,"A strange device resembling a toy; when used, a bird’s head pops up from the top and produces a
small puff of smoke. Any human that is exposed to this smoke will instantly fall unconscious and lose
their short term memories. A replacement is then forged in the space those memories occupied, randomly generated based on the human’s sense of normality. This is a standard issue tool used by Shinigami that patrol the human world, to prevent awareness of spiritual beings in those exposed to
them. A ghost monster attacked your house last night? That’s just ridiculous, here, smile for the
birdy. "
262,,100,Object of Affection,Bleach,Making,"Fullbringers are able to draw on the souls of all things, but their greatest powers generally revolve
around an object they have a great affinity towards. This object, that they cherish and hold fondness
for, through which they’ve gone through so much with, becomes a conduit for a unique and
incredible power. This is a mundane object of some kind, and one which you have many memories
and great fondness for, which will be repaired or remade whenever damaged or destroyed. This
object, should you be a Fullbringer, will become the object that your power is drawn from. Whatever
the choice, the object will reappear within a week if destroyed or lots. "
263,,100,Gintō,Bleach,Making,"Antiquated tools of Quincy of old, Gintō are small, silver tubes approximately 5 centimeters in height. Gintō allow a Quincy to condense their spirit energy in the form of a liquid and store it within until
such time they need to draw on these reserves for special techniques or emergencies. The liquid
energy can be catalyzed to cushion falls, imprison enemies, or release immense destructive force
among other application. You receive ten of these Gintō tubes, though their actual utility depends
on how well you use them. Each week, you receive another ten, though nothing stops you from
making more yourself."
264,,100,Quincy Cross,Bleach,Making,"Despite what they might prefer, a Quincy’s powers are not entirely unique to their race. The tools
they made to aid lesser Quincy can also be used to grant the same Reishi Manipulation powers to
other species. This Quincy Cross is one such tool, a silver piece of jewellery that when held, grants
access to this core Quincy ability. Even to an Arrancar, someone normally incompatible with such
powers. While this does allow the formation of Heilig Bogen and even soul destruction, abilities
actually unique to the Quincy such as Blut and Vollstandig are inaccessible through this. For actual
Quincy, the cross is often used to aid control for weaker Quincy or as a training tool for those who
intend to eventually move past it."
265,,100,Asauchi,Bleach,Making,"A single blank sword, apparently one of the only Zanpakuto not created by Nimaiya and thus not
subject to his knowledge. In all other respects, this is a perfectly functioning blank sword. Any non- Shinigami who spends enough time with this blade, continually infusing it with their energy, will be able to awaken it as their own Zanpakuto. For 300CP instead, a supply of these Asauchi can be
gained. There will be eight blank swords in total, along with a further eight swords every five years. Shinigami who purchase this should be aware that it is impossible to awaken a second Zanpakuto from an Asauchi state with one already part of their soul. Though a second Zanpakuto itself is not
impossible. "
266,,100,Arrancar Uniform,Bleach,Making,"An all white uniform of some mysterious make worn by every Arrancar. Who makes such outfits and
what they’re made of is enigmatic, as is why they seem to expand and contort with their wearer. This uniform, even as you transform using Resurreccion or some other ability or form, will
automatically reshape itself to remain form fitting. It can even change style if that would better
emphasize the abilities or aesthetics of that form. "
267,,100,Needle and Thread,Bleach,Making,"The bad guys always have the best looks going for them. It doesn’t come from nowhere, at least not
for the Quincy. Stitching and weaving is a bit of a pastime for many of their number, so skills like
yours are far from out of place. The talents of the thread and needle are well developed, from
designing new outfits and making comfortable clothes from the designs, to creating stuffed toys or
modifying existing fabrics. And no matter how impossible it may seem, you can quickly and easily
embed the Quincy Cross onto anything with a bit of thread. Even metal, somehow. Given their
militaristic outlook, it’s also apparent that you know how to turn a needle and thread into a deadly
weapon, whether directly or in how it improves your use of thread-like techniques quite significantly.
If you could get a handle on Ransotengai, who knows what they’d let you do to the enemy. "
268,,100,Oils & Potions,The Witcher Novels,Making,"How many bottles with strange colored liquids! Before you succumb to all hyperactive children’s natural curiosity and try to determine if your favorite color has good taste, I warn you that potions have toxicity, lesser than normal versions, but it still here, besides the fact that some of this isn’t intended for drinking. Not like I discourage you from trying. While you clearly not understand depth of such generosity this is most superior quality set of all known potions and oils necessary for more than adequate performance of trained witcher. Each bottle signed in big letters so even baby not confuse them by drinking an oil for a sword instead of a healing potion, accidentally at least. Glass of these bottles is special and not break even if troll hit you in the bag with elixirs, you on other hand… Once in week you find that someone kindly refill all used or spoiled elixirs, oils and even give you new bottles, because you definitely going to lose them or break them anyway.

269,,100,Master Armour,The Lord of the Rings,Making,"You are protected in battle by a set of armor and a shield made by supernaturally great blacksmiths. The armor of the Dwarves, Elves, or Numenor guards you from enemy blades."
270,,100,Unique Series Set,Bofuri,Making,"A Unique Series Set drops from a boss that is killed by a single person on their first attempt. That’s rather difficult, so you can just pay for one using CP instead.

A set provides all four pieces of armor (head, body, legs, shoes,) as well as your class weapon(s). The armor is of a type appropriate to your class - Great Shield users get heavy armor, obviously, while Dual Blade users get lighter armor. Also, your set looks really cool. That’s a standard feature of these sets.

Your set will grow with you. When you have newbie levels of power, the armor is only as effective as starter gear. Once you start growing in power, so does it. Pieces will start getting skills as you get strong enough. If you’re already strong, this immediately gains skills and power appropriate for what you already have. These skills will tend towards being appropriate for the weapon class you picked, though.

You may Import both a set of armor and a weapon into this purchase."
271,,100,War Chest,Bofuri,Making,"Look, you could spend all your time crafting a bunch of one-use traps, throwing knives, and explosives. Or you could get this perk.

This provides you with infinite copies of common consumable weapons and ammo. Use up one and another will take its place. Uncommon and rarer consumables will still be replaced, but not all the time. The rarer the item, the less the chance it will be replaced. Spend your time crafting actually interesting things."
272,,100,Bismarck’s Blessing,Final Fantasy XIII,Making,"The waters of Bismarck have an odd effect of flora and fauna...both, when they come into contact with the water, grow to five times their original size. You can create a vial’s worth every day. It can get diluted though, so don’t think about contaminating the Cocoon water source with just one vial."
273,,100,Consecrated​ ​Armor​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Making,"This fine chain shirt is impossibly light and thin enough to wear under a coat or jacket. It can easily absorb most non armour piercing firearm rounds, and will turn away most mundane blades as well."
274,,100,Bracer​ ​of​ ​Black​ ​Defense,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Making,"Made of black steel and cold iron, this antique bracer is engraved with images of warfare and archery. When worn by the user, it can animate their arm with a strange life of it’s own - moving independently of their will to block ranged attacks such as bullets and arrows. It is more than strong enough to deflect a .50 caliber bullet without taking any damage."
275,,100,Soulsmithing Tools,Cradle V1,Making,"You gain all the tools Soulsmiths need to do their jobs. This comes with a free drudge, a tool that is part calculator, scanner, and does numerous jobs to ensure Soulsmiths don’t blow up their houses."

278,,100,Thousand-Mile Cloud ,Cradle V1,Making,"A small construct made of cloud madra, this acts like a hoverboard that can be recharged with pure madra and is as fast as a fine horse. Larger ones can hold entire cities or fortresses."

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
280,,100,Hekt of Knowledge,Egyptian Mythology,Making,"A jar of beer decoratively topped with a sculpted head of Thoth, and inscribed with many words and phrases promising knowledge. This beer may be poured over a scroll or the pages of a book, and the liquid washes the paper clean of the words and illustrations within.

Instead of appearing inky and dark, the resulting liquid, when collected, appears normal but for words and images from the book that seem to swim below its surface. Drinking this knowledge-infused beer bestows on the wearer all of the knowledge held in the book or scroll that was washed clean, even if the drinker cannot read the script or speak the language. It is impartial as to the contents of the book or scroll: an untrue book imparts untrue knowledge. The jar of beer refills every week."
281,,100,The Voice(Constructs) ,Marvel Zombies,Making,"Tremendous sonic power is at your beck and call. Your control over sound waves can be used for a lot of things, not the least of which is a sonic scream capable of shattering glass, metal, bone, and much more. Besides that, you can fly by riding these waves, echolocate, and protect yourself by making some sort of force field. You yourself are immune to all sound-based attacks. Your vocal cords, lungs, and throat have been strengthened to take all this strain. Try not to lose your voice. For an extra 100cp, you gain the additional ability to form energy constructs out of solid sound. You can make forcefields, simple weapons, wings, whatever you can think of - but you have to be making that sound to create the constructs. Additionally, you now possess perfect pitch. Each different musical note can induce various negative effects in those who hear it.

Requires The Voice to Purchase"
282,,100,Dormant Magicite,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"A rock, no bigger than your palm. It seems to be completely devoid of magick, but perhaps if you could find a way to recharge it, you could use it as a skystone or a memstone. A certain laboratory in Archades specializes in the restoring of magicite...and the creation of nethicite."
283,,100,Bloody Banner,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"It’s a well worn banner, and it is streaked with dried blood. It seems rather benign, but the tag reads: “When raised in battle, this banner of the demon shield will demoralize your enemies...” Strange, even reading the tag sends a chill down your spine. And the demon shield emblem seems more...vibrant than before. The shopkeeper nods. “I’ve seen men seize up in fear when they saw that thing unfurl.”"
284,,100,Corrupt Galbana Lilies,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"From the description you were expecting flowers, instead the shopkeeper points at a bag of seeds. When you ask why it was seeds and not flowers, the shopkeeper just shakes his head. “The Seeds are Mist Touched, half of the flowers that bloom emit pollen that paralyzes people, while the other half emits pollen that puts people to sleep. Worst thing is, they grow like weeds...be careful.”"
285,,100,Ancient Tome,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"A fallen Nu Mou’s personal spellbook. It shows signs of wear, but the magic holding the book together is still intact. The shopkeeper says that after he deciphered the first page he realized the purpose of the book. It amplifies the power of spells inscribed into it by a small bit – but only one spell of each element."
286,,100,Staff of Restraint,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"It’s a really long staff with an odd circular ring attached to the end. The space in the ring seems large enough to fit a person. From the rough note scribbled on the tag, apparently the design was based off of a similar weapon called a Ba’Gangsaw. It naturally restrains people that the ring falls around and the ring can also paralyze people trapped inside by applying an electric current."
287,,100,Feather of the Flock,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"“Sacred icon amongst some Garif tribes. Holding it against your head will grant you the ability to listen to birds of all sorts. It also makes sure you won’t get hurt if you take a fall from a short height.”

It seems the ability extends to anything mildly related to avian fauna, because the Archaeosaur in the far back of the store turns to you and utters some words. “Hrm...I’m hungry.” Thankfully he turns away from you."
288,,100,The Fishermen,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"A clan of fishermen, whose motto is “Fishing anywhere, anytime.” They have a fixation to fishing, and will be more than happy to help you with your own fishing adventure. They’ll supply you with everything you need to fish, including a rod if you need it.

When you leave this world, they will leave you with a cooler. A fish magically appears in that cooler every day."
289,,100,Cartographer’s Guild,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"The Cartographers are scattered all over Ivalice, dedicated to mapping every nook and cranny. They will give you all the information about the world that you need and show you the best routes to go to places.

When you leave this world, they will give you a compass, specially designed to point in the direction if you say the name of a location you have been to. Well, at least you won’t ever get lost again."
290,,100,Old Ways ,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"A great gift was given to you, a mask of magicite, passed down to you when your teacher moved on. The mask contains great power - but most notable is that when you don it, a natural barrier against magic falls upon you. When you are struck by an elemental spell, the mask ""holds"" that element and it amplifies your spells of the same element. The mask can only hold up to two elements at a time."
291,,100,Pan Pipes,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Making,"A standard set of pan pipes, typically played by satyrs and their ilk. Aside from being an excellent focus for nature related abilities and magics, you’ll find that any music played from this particular set always comes out well, as though a professional were the one performing even if an amateur were to pick them up. If destroyed, they’ll appear within your warehouse in a day."
292,,100,Butterfly Charm,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Making,"A simple necklace on a sturdy cord, depicting a butterfly. While it’s rather pretty, it’s also completely mundane. At least, that’s what you want them to believe. In reality there is a second, identical necklace, that when given to another person allows for telepathy between the others that even Gods are unable to trace. If you’d like, you can change the butterfly to a different symbol."
293,,100,Monster Killer,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Making,"It seems that every demigod needs a gem like this, these days. This “monster killer” is in fact a weapon of your own design (up to and including guns, although it’ll only come with three rounds if you choose so) made of either Celestial Bronze or Imperial Gold. What this means, essentially, is that it is capable of harming Monsters and Gods, however at the same time incapable of harming mortals: attempting to do so will have it slide through effortlessly without any harm being done. Should the weapon be broken, it will appear within your warehouse in a day, good as new."
294,,100,Orna,Irish Mythology,Making,"A sword perhaps only slightly younger than the world. It has passed through the hands of many a champion and will gladly recount the glorious deeds and battles of its previous holders. All swords once had this power. In future Jumps, it is inserted into local history as a blade of legend, and its historical knowledge updates accordingly. You may import another weapon to gain this boon."
295,,100,Knife of Division,Irish Mythology,Making,"Fionn had a knife like this, that cuts bones as easily as butter. More wondrous, each shaving and splinter removed from a bone transforms into a large cut of the meat of the beast, and the finest cut there is. So a hog’s bones provide pork, a cow’s beef, etc. So they had the finest of eating and could feast for weeks off a few bones, and never did go hunting save for the pleasure of it. Barring all those times the magic knife was stolen."
296,,100,Ochain        ,Irish Mythology,Making,"The famed shield of Conchobar mac Nessa, a magnificent piece with borders of gold. Two enchantments has the shield, first that it is a magnificent shield that can stop the blows even of legendary blades and spears that pierce all.

This item takes the form of a large chest, within this chest is a guide for each job as well as any items (such as puppet blueprints or wyvern eggs for example) required for the teaching or learning of that job. With this you could allow others to learn the many jobs of this world and spread its magic wherever you go. Yes this includes tiny statue versions of the Avatars to allow summoners to form pacts with them."
301,,100,Chocobo Whistle,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"A whistle carved into the shape of a chocobo, when blown a large chocobo will run from the nearest foliage (or from around the nearest break in your line of sight) to you, you may ride this chocobo for quick reliable transportation."
302,,100,Extra Relic,Dies Irae,Making,"Only in extraordinarily rare circumstances is one able to use a different Relic than the one you
bonded to. Even rarer is the case where you have more than one compatible relic at the same time. You’ve gotten this chance, getting another Relic bonded to you. This Relic gains the free First Tier option and nothing else, everything extra must be bought again even if your first Relic already has those upgrades. Only one extra Relic may be bought.

Requires Die Ewigkeit to Purchase"
303,,100,Import,Dies Irae,Making,"If you already possess a specific item that you wish to use as your Relic, this option will allow you to import it as such for each Relic that you own.

It will gain all the properties of an Ahnenerbe and may be increased in size, power or quantity with the above Tier options as well. If you possess the second Tier or above, you may buy this option again to import more than one item that you own into a fitting category. Tier 2 may allow you to import a dozen blades that you own whilst Tier 3 might allow you to import every weapon that you own. Do note that what you import must fit the Tier you bought already.

Requires Import and Ahnenerbe(Second Tier) to Purchase"
305,,100,Ahnenerbe(Second Tier),Dies Irae,Making,"Your own Ahnenerbe. This magical artefact has been bound to be part of your very soul. Relics are often famous artefacts of myth like Excalibur or personal objects of the user, such as a memento of their past. Whatever it may be, the process of turning it into a Relic transforms it. The artefact is filled with countless curses and powerful grudges, bound with numerous enchantments and spells and even imbued with a part of your own will, the item is transformed into a weapon unlike anything else. 

The relic is a powerful weapon that strikes the physical and spiritual at the same time, tearing apart the soul of whatever it hits. Any injury inflicted by a relic is cursed and filled with unnatural venom, making it near impossible to heal for someone without regeneration on the level of an Ewigkeit user and even then, slowing their speed. They are even more effective than normal against particularly old beings and the relics will grow in power as you gain more souls. They are powered by your spiritual strength and thus need no resources to work, such as guns never needing physical ammunition. You are able to control them with your mind as if you were physically wielding them, such as summoning and firing gun relics independent of your body in the air behind you. 

Your relic is a part of your soul and exists entirely within it most of the time. Once you learn to manifest it, it will be able to be called and dismissed from your soul at will. If it is destroyed however, it will be as if your own soul has been destroyed as well. 

An Ahnenerbe can be many things. A single sword, your own body, a collection of torture tools or an entire armoury. The following section will guide you on what to pick for your relic and offer some additional customisation options. 

Tiers
Relics are not limited to a single shape and the following three tiers will dictate how your relic is
expressed. You need only buy the tier you wish for, not the below tiers. 

Second Tier
The second tier expands your relic options into including large objects or small groups of objects. Large objects may include things like motorcycles or even things up to the size of large trucks. Small collections of objects allow you to take things such as a collection of a dozen or two torture implements or a small collection of swords. Unlike normal, having one of a collection of relics destroyed will not destroy your soul, though it will damage it. 

Requires Die Ewigkeit to Purchase"
306,,100,Magic Cleaning Supplies,Hotel Transylvania,Making,"A set of cleaning supplies and other tools designed for use in cleaning that are magically imbued. From brooms that sweep rooms themselves to sponges that happily roll in liquids to soak them up. Heck, it even includes things for “non standard messes” such as a pair of fireplace bellows that can suck up foul odors for disposal."
307,,100,Traveling Pouch ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making,"This is a rather ordinary pouch, the sort that might be easily carried on one’s belt or person when traveling. Well it’s mostly ordinary. The pouch seems to hold about 100 times as much as it should - though things still must pass through its opening - and objects inside of the pouch seem to weigh about 1/100th as much as they should."
308,,100,Suits on Suits,The God of High School Jump,Making,"A Judge has a uniform that being the tailored black and white suit found in businesses all around the world. Unlike most businesses though, a Judge is fighting life or death battles in their penguin suits. Luckily, you’ve got as many suits as you could ever need and you don’t even need a wardrobe to store them. All you need do is just duck out of anyone’s sight for a moment and voila, you’ll be suited up once again, no matter your state of dress beforehand. It’ll be pressed and ironed for you and these suits won’t ever restrict your movement in a fight."
309,,100,BROTHERHOOD,Final Fantasy X,Making,"It’s a fancy sword to say the least, the blade has been specially forged in a fashion that somehow traps water inside. There’s clearly an enchantment involved here, one that makes itself apparent whenever you strike a foe with the blade – as water will be spontaneously generated in a small quantity. It naturally amplifies the power of water related magic and techniques as long as you possess it."
310,,100,PYREFLY INJECTION,Final Fantasy X,Making,"As the owner of the Monster Arena can attest – the use of pyreflies is very effective in making newer and more effective monsters – but it takes a very high level of control to use pyreflies effectively. It certainly isn’t difficult to just stuff pyreflies like some sort of growth stimulant, but with this, you’ll attain a higher level of control – making you capable of using pyreflies, or a very substantial amount of spiritual energy to create “pyrefly additions”.

Those with sufficient skill can take control of pyreflies and weave them into armour components and additional parts for your monsters. Artificial wing components, additional tails or appendages, and other such parts that you can find on Spira’s monsters can be added to your monsters with this."
311,,100,Devil’s Lunchbox,Chainsaw Man,Making,This unique lunch box automatically compresses and stores the edible (to you) remnants of beings you slay and enhances their flavors greatly. Can contain about a dozen times its size in a compressed cube of blood and flesh.
312,,100,Contractual Implement ,Chainsaw Man,Making,A decently well-made mundane item of your choice that increases the potency of any borrowed ability you use through it. It can also store one ability channeled into it willingly for the use by its wearer (though they have to provide the energy and other requirements). The stored ability can be replaced at any time with another.
313,,100,Senpai's Proof        ,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"A gift from a red haired student with no further interest in archery, this classic Yari bow has a few special properties to it, calling back to the abilities of its past owner. It is always perfectly maintained and in good condition, no matter the abuses it is put through. Second, when the user of the bow focuses on aiming their shot for 7 seconds, they can be assured that they will perfectly fire that arrow at their target. As long as the target is stationary and no external influences are present, they will never miss the target. "
314,,100,A Special Ruby,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"A notably powerful magical gem that is attached to a well-made and fancy metal necklace. This gem is capable of holding a large amount of prana, enough to match a dozen full grown Magi's maximum capacities with ease. It can only be used by those you desire to be able to draw from it and drawing forth the energy within is near instantaneously, just as fast as naturally using your own energy. Storing magical energy in the gem is just as quick and easy. "
315,,100,Potion Brewing,Elantris,Making,"Not much is known about the secretive alchemists of Hrovell, though their potions are proof enough of the potency of their art. Crafted from plants grown in local soil, the ingredients for these potions can create many different effects, from the biological and pharmacological to the supernatural. One such set of potions was used to temporarily replicate the Shaod, transforming the users into facsimiles of the cursed Elantrians. Given that the other varieties of Selish magic all can produce similar results, it is safe to assume that these potions can be tailored to healing the injured, strengthening the body, and other effects observed in the other forms of Investiture on Sel."
316,,100,Soulstone,Elantris,Making,"Now this is a curious mineral. Mined in MaiPon, soulstone naturally occurs as a white, fine-grained rock that is as soft as chalk but remarkably resistant to chipping. When heated over a fire, however, soulstone becomes dark in color and as hard as quartz. This makes it exceptionally good for carving, allowing you to craft fine details before preserving your creations. These properties make soulstone an extremely useful material for making Forgery stamps, especially heavily-used ones or those used for Essence Marks, where heavy detail is required. You may receive up to 20 pounds of soulstone per week, to fuel your most daring artistic ambitions or to make a fortune at the market."
317,,100,JinDo Sticks,Elantris,Making,"Among their many advances, the Jindo were the first to study the effect of one’s diet on their health. With this purchase, you can throw all of that away! Any meal eaten with these thin, rod-like utensils will taste fresh and nutritious. So long as your meal is actually food, you’ll never suffer from malnutrition, obesity, or even indigestion. No low-butter diet for you!"
318,,100,Cards(Airships),Final Fantasy IX,Making,"These Tetra Master cards have been enchanted such that they can be used multiple times without vanishing as normal Tetra Master Cards do. There is a time in between the card’s usage, and when the card will reform. Without the Tetra Master skill however, they will only project in solid construct form for a short time.

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Hilda Garde III, Blue Narciss, and Theater Ship cards. When activated by a Tetra Master, the ships can be used for a full day until they fade away, disregarding fuel consumption. No other cards can be used during this time."
319,,100,Backstage Pass ,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"Well, you’re a member of the cast aren’t you? If you’re carrying one of these, there won’t be a theatre anywhere that would stop you if you want to walk in on a show. It’ll work for any sort of show, not just a theatre act or a play."
320,,100,Silver Fork,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"An unassuming silver fork, with a small frog shape inscribed into the handle. It doesn’t seem to be magical in nature, but anything you eat with this fork will magically taste delicious – though it won’t help much with any inherent poison."
321,,100,Custom Weapon ,Knight’s and Magic,Making,A melee weapon combined with a magic staff that allowed the user to use magic while fighting in melee combat. It's made of high quality materials that it's almost impossible to break along with making magic spells easier to cast while holding this item.
322,,100,Nature’s Bounty,Cult of the Lamb,Making,"A sturdy crate made of an unknown wood. Within is held a collection of raw materials such as seeds, wood, rock, and crystal from one of the four known domains of this land. You may choose which, between Darkwood, Anura, Anchordeep, or Silk Cradle. The contents of this crate will replenish at the beginning of every month, but take heed. Any material from the crate that has gone unused will vanish at the beginning of the next month as well."
323,,100,Faithful’s Finery,Cult of the Lamb,Making,"A set of fine robes of excellent make, light and durable in equal measure. They seem to bear twofold benefits upon whoever should wear them. Firstly, they act as a slight enhancer to any faith-based magic the wearer uses. Secondly and perhaps more curiously, the robes will morph to fit the aesthetics of any religious institution that the wearer wishes."
324,,100,Weapon,Final Fantasy VIII,Making,"It's a dangerous world out there, full of murderous wildlife and other threats, so most people will carry a weapon if t hey plan on traveling outside of the cities and the roads. The world is fairly advanced, and most people use guns. Machine guns, shotguns, and rifles being the most popular. However, melee weapons are still popular in certain groups and as side arms in the military, and progress from standard fare such as swords to knuckle dusters, whips, flails, katars, chakrams, harpoons, and finally the rare and storied gunblade.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
325,,100,Appropriate Equipment,Solo Leveling,Making,"By taking this, you will gain a set of equipment appropriate for your level. These could be a basic magic sword for a low-ranking physical Hunter, or a staff for better focusing and a slight increase in magical potential for a mid-tier healer, up to good quality armor and moderately strong weapons for high-tier Hunters or monsters. Nothing too exceptional, just the bare minimum required to operate at your current level."
326,,100,Extravagant Dressing: A Suit for the Devil,Avesta of Black and White,Making,"The Dagravant are known for being quite eccentric and unique, and that also reflects on their clothing. From a majestic robe that seems to show the stars, to a dress made out of blood feathers, to pristine blue armor, you can make your own iconic outfit, complete with whatever minor cosmetic effects that you want."
327,,100,A Shining Weapon: Starter Kit,Avesta of Black and White,Making,"You have gained a weapon. A sword, a mace or even a pair of guns. It doesn’t really matter what kind of weapon do you pick, as neither of these weapons are especially potent, but as weapons crafted in Wahman Yast, they will serve well enough in fighting most Daeva."
328,,100,Relic of the X,Fate/Grand Order,Making,"How many Heroes have had tragedies in their past? Too many to count by now I imagine. But despite those tragedies, they fight on. Sometimes they have something to believe in, sometimes they just have a memory that don’t wish to tarnish. This trinket is like the latter, a memento from your own past that when worn or held, will inspire great courage and confidence in you even in times when you would normally break from despair or fear. It’ll always be with you, even it being destroyed or lost will only let it disappear for a few moments before you can pull it out from a pocket or behind yourself."
329,,100,Saint Gatherer,Fate/Grand Order,Making,"A unique substance to be found in this world, Saint Quartz are powerful multi-coloured crystals that can be attained by accomplishing certain sorts of actions. Completing quests or journeys, making daily significant progress towards your main goals to gain every second day, taking part in important events in the story of the world or forming very close and strong bonds with other people all have a chance or certainty of granting a Saint Quartz. Once obtained, there are three uses for these crystals. One can be used to fully restore your energy and fatigue, one can be used to revive you and a small number of allies from the brink of death to full health again or one can be used to chance the summoning system within the Grand Order system, so long as one has the support of Chaldea. This perk is free for Human Type Jumpers for the duration of the jump but may be kept for future jumps, or bought by Servant Types, for 100CP. "
330,,100,Distinctive Gear,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"Standing out is important in the City, everyone is trying to get attention from customers or just people in general. So it won’t do to just have a plain old suit and regular-looking gear no, you deserve better than that. Whether it be a Sweeper suit, fancy workshop-made equipment, or even Nouveau Fabric, you and your organization have something that definitely makes you stand out in a crowd, the actual effectiveness of it is mostly up to you, though it’s still better than normal kit. Each purchase gets you one pick from each category of: Outfit, weapon, and augmentation. You can take less of one category to get more of another.

If you are a Sweeper then the first purchase is free for the suit and hooks, a list of workshops is in the Notes, and this can be applied to any existing piece of equipment.

331,,100,Will of the Prescript,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"The Index follows prescripts without question, to the point where the proselytes are blindfolded to make them rely on the guidance of the prescripts. This might initially seem like a terrible idea, but things just happen to end up going their way. Similarly, you will receive a golden-colored piece of paper once per month, this prescript will have a task for you that ranges from absurd to simple to frustratingly vague and if you complete the task, nothing happens, at least not immediately but the more prescripts you complete the more things end up going well for you. Think of them like the butterfly effect on a scale where the more you follow them the more things go in your favor, and the more you do the exact opposite of the Prescript the worse things get for you, what exactly is the opposite of some of the more outlandish instructions? Well, that’s for you to decide, but chances are you won’t reverse a Prescript unintentionally though, as if one states to give something to a person, then killing them won’t count as an inverse but stealing from them will be the inverse."
332,,100,Fascinating Fabrics,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"If you want to stay independent of all the syndicates, Wings, and fixer offices you’ll need to provide something valuable enough to justify it but not valuable enough to be “persuaded” into working for one of them. Similar to The Carnival’s fabric industry or the unique... cuisine from District 23’s chefs, you don’t necessarily make fabric or food but you or your organization have some important specialization or product that can’t be easily replicated, this service is desired by multiple of the City’s groups to a degree which would let you remain nominally independent from them all. Though if you want to side with a faction City you are still free to do so."
333,,100,A Snack of Desire,Bibliomania,Making,"You have a very interesting item here being that at will you can summon up any food or drink item you desire as long as it's purely food or drink. It could be anything from a milkshake to a strawberry the size of your head or even a hyperrealistic cake of EVA-01 from Evangelion if you want, though you can’t summon something larger than 1 ton in mass at a time. All food and drink summoned has a fw beneficial effects, first no matter what you summon it's always going to be healthy and nutritious, full of all the minerals and vitamins you need. It will never fully fill your stomach past a comfortable level where you could still eat but could also stop, meaning you could eat that car sized strawberry if you want. And lastly it has a mild cleaning and healing effect on you, the cleaning is stronger and just by eating a small desert after each meal would be enough to clean you as if you had a fresh shower and brushed your teeth thoroughly, while the healing effect would be enough that a bruise that would heal in 2 days would heal fully after a full meal."
334,,100,Buster Blade,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Making,"There are many things that set SOLDIERs apart, but the most obvious is their choice of weaponry. Many SOLDIERs, from Sephiroth to Zack Fair wield impossibly large blades as if they were lighter than a kitchen knife. Now you have an equally distinct blade. You may choose any style of sword that you wish, from a 7-foot katana to the classic chisel-shaped buster sword, and your blade will have three in-built slots for materia enhancements. If you’re going to bring a sword to a gunfight, you might as well make it big."
335,,100,Materia Set,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Making,"Though SOLDIER gets access to the finest materia, thousands of Gaia’s citizens take advantage of the convenient mako crystals every day. Everyone from Shinra’s grunts to the freedom fighters of Avalanche rely on materia to stand a chance in this dangerous world. You’ve now acquired a set of materia orbs to give yourself an edge, and may choose three known materia to add to your arsenal. The orbs you select will change size to fit your given equipment. Only exceptionally powerful materia, like those of Holy and Meteor, cannot be purchased here.

336,,100,Gem Flower Seeds ,Kurohime,Making,"A flower that is widely believed to have gone extinct due to human greed, this is a plant that naturally forms gemstones where another flower would grow petals. You gain a bag containing 10 of these seeds, which will refill twice a year."
337,,100,Ultimate Sword(Shield),Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Making,"For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), the sword comes with a counterpart shield. As with the
sword, it comes in a design of your preference, will feel light for you, and is magical empowered to outperform mundane equivalents.

Should either the sword or shield be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours.

Requires Ultimate Sword to Purchase"
338,,100,Trophy Stand,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Making,"By purchasing this option, you ensure the availability of the Trophy Stand in all of your future battles. Sometime during each battle, the Trophy Stand will spawn on the battlefield. It will always spawn closer to you than to your opponent(s), though it may not always spawn at your feet. If you have no desire to use the Trophy Stand at all for a particular fight, it will not spawn for that particular fight, preventing its use against you. Should the Trophy Stand spawn, your opponent does have the opportunity to use it, if they can get to it first.

The Trophy Stand is a large golden disc, resembling a trophy base. When it is thrown at someone, there is a small chance that a Collectible Trophy of the individual it hits will appear nearby. Should the Trophy Stand deal the blow that defeats someone, then it is guaranteed that a Collectible Trophy of that person will spawn. Should the Trophy Stand create a Collectible Trophy in this way, the Trophy Stand will immediately despawn. Should the Trophy Stand be thrown and miss a few times, it will immediately despawn.

As this purchase is merely for access to Trophy Stands, not the Trophy Stands themselves, you may not import any similar item into this option."
339,,100,Ancient Ministerial Robes,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Making,"A comfortable set of ornate robes, in a colour of your choosing. The headpiece somehow manages to obscure your face in darkness, making it impossible to discern. If your eyes are able to glow, you may choose for them to remain visible when glowing, without revealing any further details of your face. The headpiece will not come off accidentally, even in the midst of a fight. It may be destroyed, or removed by yourself or another party.

Should the robes be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
340,,100,Kwami Food,Miraculous Ladybug,Making,"Kwami’s do not technically need to eat, but it does make them recharge their Miraculous Power faster, and they just enjoy it in general. This is a weekly replenishing supply of your Kwami’s favorite food. Plenty enough for a Kwami that’s not being overworked, but not nearly enough for a full person. Can be purchased multiple times if you have multiple Kwamis to feed (discounts persist).

Requires Kawami Form or a Miraculous to Purchase

341,,100,Cough Syrup,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making ,"An item any user of Cursed Speech would love to have. This is a bottle of generic brand cough syrup that never seems to run out of its medicine. As one might expect it doesn’t taste the best, but its utility is undeniable: any sort of sore or irritated throat is cleared up in an instant, leaving the user feeling as good as new. It won’t do as much if you’re coughing up blood, but for anything short of that? There’s nothing better."
342,,100,Curse-Seeing Glasses,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making ,"A rather simple form of cursed tool, you have a case full of several dozen glasses of various makes and styles. Anyone looking through their lenses would be able to see cursed spirits and jujutsu just as well as any sorcerer – and, by extension, also perceive them with all of their other senses somehow. While for obvious reasons these are useless to a sorcerer, they can be a rather helpful aid for any non-sorcerer allies you might have."
343,,100,Independent Materia,Final Fantasy VII,Making ,"Alright, we're finally on the meat and potatoes of this world. Or in this case, glowing magical marbles. Materia are crystallized energy from the Lifestream that others can use to unlock special abilities or wield magic. Most Materia only requires a mental act of will from the user, and while the most common and convenient method to wield them is by attaching them to weapons or equipment in little 'slots', simply touching one or having it on person when willing it to activate is sufficient. Most Materia start with a basic ability or a limited-time use, but may unlock more uses or more powerful versions of a given ability as they grow in power. After enough use and experience, a Materia will be 'born' and reach the peak of its power, which has different effects for each type.

Materia purchased here starts at its base level. As for what each one does and how much they cost…

Standing opposite of Support Materia are the violet-colored Independent Materia. This allows the user to make use of specific abilities granted by Support without needing to pair them with another Materia, as well as boosting one's natural abilities or durability, or even things like luck or experience gained in a single battle.

A list of canonical Materia and their effects can be found in Notes.

345,,100,Unique Weapon(Fusion),Final Fantasy VII,Making ,"The Buster Sword, Masamune, even just a pair of steel knuckles...you have a weapon that just screams 'you', one that feels as light as a feather in your hands. This is the primary weapon you start with free of charge, complete with its own Materia Slots free of charge. While this bit of starting equipment is reliable but not especially powerful starting out, you may freely choose to 'reskin' any similar weapon into a copy of its appearance, letting you keep your style while also keeping your more powerful equipment down the line.

For 100 points, this weapon is instead a composite or fusion of several smaller weapons, similar to Cloud Strife's Fusion Sword. These individual weapons can be combined to form the original weapon above.

You may import a single weapon into the Unique Weapon slot, or if you buy the Fusion Weapon variant, you may import up to five weapons of a similar 'type' into it, combining them into one."
346,,100,Gems!,Legends of Runeterra,Making ,"Crystals around Mount Targon have strange properties, maybe caused by the accumulation of Celestial magic. By focusing on those properties, they can achieve various effects, the most common being the restoration of one’s health and stamina. Each week you receive a hundred of these gems, to use as you want. Who knows, with time you may be able to use these gems for more than just healing."
347,,100,Pack of Buried Treasure,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"Most of Shurima had been buried under the sands when Azyr disappeared and the God-Warrior fought among themselves. Too much is still buried, but this backpack has the ability, once every week, to autonomously fill itself with any buried treasure in the vicinity. The backpack doesn’t have an infinite capacity, so you may not be able to get all the treasure, but at least you’ll know it’s there."
348,,100,Uncorrupted Seed,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"The only life in the Shadow Isles are the trees that drank from the Water of Life before they were corrupted. Now the trees are gnarly and dark, but you managed to get your hand on an uncorrupted seed. By itself it does nothing, but should you be able to make it grow into a tree, you’ll find out that the sap and fruits still carry some of the properties of the Water of Life. It will not be easy, but the reward is great."
349,,100,Signature Jewelry,Fairy Fencer F,Making,A favorite piece of jewelry imbued with positive feelings. Grants the wearer a modest increase to defense.

351,,100,A Focus,Inheritance Cycle,Making,"A simple magical focus such as a jewel, ornament or rod. With it in hand you may easily clear and organize your thoughts, focusing them through the aid of your tool, allowing you to create and unleash your magic with much less time and a reduced chance of the effects backfiring. You may instead import an existing magical focus into this position."
352,,100,Anti-Scrying Amulet,Inheritance Cycle,Making,"This amulet appears as little more than a worn stone vaguely shaped like a hammer. Its effect activates when someone attempts to scry on the wearer, glowing and becoming slightly warm. The stone prevents the user or their surroundings from being seen through the effects of mystical scrying. This does not come without cost however as it draws on the user's own reserves of power to fuel this function. As such, if someone attempts to scry on the wearer for too long, the user may be drained of their energy. Of course the wearer may remove this at any time but this would allow them to be scryed again."
353,,100,Scatty Swimsuit,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"Straight from the famous Scatty fashion brand, a swimsuit made especially for Servants. When worn, it’ll alter the Spirit Origin of the Servant on a fundamental level, all in aim of giving them a fresh, summer feeling. The Servant in question will feel more cheerful and optimistic, as their abilities and equipment morph to fit the beach holiday aesthetic one is required to have while it’s summertime. They’re no more effective than before but they likely work in a different way. Holy laser swords become powerful water guns and golden sail ships turn into radical surfboards. You’ll get nine customisable swimsuits, so you and all your friends can chill together. "
354,,100,Saber Badges(Bronze),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"The must have collectible seeing a surge in popularity across the galaxy. These little badges are a sign of Saber Superiority, able to transform the wearer into a proper Saber class Servant. Sure, they’re still total fakers to the glory of a true Saber but who can blame them for reaching above their station?

A set of bronze badges is available with this initial purchase. They provide a small boost in physical attributes with a focus on Strength, a noticeable skill with swords and low strength Magic Resistance and Riding. 

You’ll receive nine badges for whatever tier you purchase. Multiple badges at once seem to offer nothing more. Maybe you can only be so much of a Saber at once. Only the first purchase is applicable for freebies, later tiers are not discounted. Optionally, you can pick another of the seven main Servant Classes to have badges for, with appropriately altered benefits and Skills attached. "

357,,100,Poison Culinary Master,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"Even British cooking isn’t this deadly! Your skills in the kitchen have nothing to do with making tasty food and everything to do with making food way too deadly to eat. From preparing the most toxic poisonous fish into a visually tempting trap, imbuing home-made pizza with an intense magical poison to giving sapience and soul to a mountain of mash potato solely to turn it into a heartless killing machine. No need for an armory, you’ll be deadly as long as you have a kitchen to draw on. You’re quite capable of eating your own food and years of doing so have made your body able to secrete deadly toxins at will, making the chef almost as deadly as their product. Some have claimed this is all the result of extensive training as an Assassin on planet Hasshashsin but in reality, it’s just pure (lack of) culinary skills. "
358,,100,Honkai Cubes,Honkai Impact 3rd,Making,"You have an infinite supply of Honkai Cubes and know how to make more. Crystallized Honkai energy that – when used to make or enhance weapons, gear, or anything really – far enhances it beyond normal limits of human capabilities. Of course, just having them does nothing – and if you just slap it on a low-quality weapon, it wont go very far. But with proper application of skill and infusion, you can use these to create incredible things. Just beware potential feedback. Not intended to be fed to Tunas."
359,,100,Anti-Honkai Infusion,Honkai Impact 3rd,Making,"You only get a few of these, but they’re important. Namely, these can suppress Honkai energy. While you could use these to destroy any Honkai beast it was injected into, you’re better off using it for another purpose. Curing a Honkai zombie, suppressing the overwhelming surge of honkai power threatening to destroy somebody, or perhaps even suppressing a Herrscher that has taken over somebody's mind... Keep in mind that all Valkyries use Honkai for their abilities, so injecting one will also weaken their Valkyrie abilities unless they are a Herrscher. They can get it back given effort, but it will take time. Yes, these can be used to buy Himeko more time. No, she will not be happy. You get three of these initially, and replenish fully once per jump afterwards."
360,,100,Smiling Face pipe,Library of Ruina V1.0,Making,"A comically large smoking pipe. Several puffs of this can create an obnoxious amount of smoke, enough to create a smokescreen. The smoke is somewhat calming to the smoker andeases them from stress. People caught within the smokescreen may find it hard to focus and stay awake, unless they’re also a smoker. It is extremely hardy and can also work as a golf-club or a blunt weapon in a pinch."
361,,100,Ether Kit ,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"This cloth pack contains an assortment of magical restorative potions native to this world, all packed carefully enough to survive a fall from an airship. They come in regular strength, high strength, and extra strength varieties. The satchel can hold ten regular strength potions and five of the two other kinds. It will automatically refill any used bottles for you once every month."
362,,100,Diving Helmet ,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"This ordinary looking diving helmet has no air hose connections, only three glass viewing ports on the front and sides. It will allow the wearer to breathe and swim easily underwater. The strangest part about this helmet is how it will extend its enchantment to up to three other people who swim nearby the wearer. An odd item to be sure."
363,,100,Magicite Purchase,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"Normally there’s only one way to get Magicite. Normally. Thankfully, your unique nature allows a loophole to be exploited. Each time you purchase this option, I will import two Magicite from an alternate universe where the Espers have already passed from natural causes and won’t be missed. They’ll function exactly like the original, teaching you a few spells similar in nature to the Esper inside, and allow you to summon them to use a spell unique to each Esper.

These supplies will be able to create roughly 100 potions before running out, and the container will automatically restock every seven days if any of the supplies are used."
365,,100,Mid Mo,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Making,"Even monks have their tools, you know? And this dagger is one of them. Inscribed with various scriptures and having a surprisingly sharp edge that never dulls, it is designed for use in any rituals that might require a knife, serving as a decent channel for spiritual powers. It’s not too significant, barely being a noticeable increase in potency, but it does make such rituals significantly easier to perform in the first place. Due to its sharpness, it’s also decent as a weapon in a pinch, although don’t expect it to carve through armor or something. You obviously know how to make more, provided some source of well-crafted daggers, in case you have a few monk friends that haven’t gotten one of these yet."
366,,100,Magical Fruit ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Making,"Some of the fruit in this world is quite magical. This one in particular, large, yellow, and juicy, extends the lifespan of those who eat it by a few years, and refine their appearance to a small but noticeable degree. You get a box with a few dozen of these fruits, but sadly, there’s only so much fruit to eat for increasing your lifespan and beauty. Fortunately, it has seeds you can plant and maintain. Unfortunately, the tree for this fruit takes a thousand years to produce ripe fruit that carries any magical benefit. You do get another box of a few dozen every jump, though, so at least you have a somewhat replenishing supply."
367,,100,Low-Class Tier Holy Swords,DxD Universe,Making,"Here you will find the generic holy swords the church makes, they are pretty weak, but can be useful occasionally.

368,,100,Low-Class Tier Sacred Gears        ,DxD Universe,Making,"Here you will find very weak sacred gear, most having a gimmick and nothing else, a sacred gear that works like a radar for example. You can choose a canon one or make one yourself.

369,,100,Toolkit ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Making,"You are equipped for your specialities. If you’re a Necromancer, maybe you have a set of heart grenades, a shovel and a pistol that shoots magically guided bones. If you’re an Alchemist, you have a few useful chemicals and a repair kit for any Homunculi. Whatever it is, it’s about the size of a suitcase and while not a workshop by itself it could be the starting point of one, or a useful field-kit. Refills every hour."
370,,100,Brave Blade & Chicken Knife,Final Fantasy V,Making,"A pair of weapons that feed off the wielder’s bravery and cowardice. The more you show genuine bravery, the stronger the Brave Blade becomes, and vice versa for the Chicken Knife. If you show cowardice and flee often, your Brave Blade will weaken, but the other will grow stronger."
371,,100,Twelve Sealed Weapons,Final Fantasy V,Making,"A copy of one of the Twelve Sealed weapons. Each of them are unique and powerful in their own right, and will aid you. Alternatively, you may import an existing weapon into one of these, adding the benefits of the Sealed Weapon to your own.

372,,100,Dragongrass,Final Fantasy V,Making,"A medicinal herb that is highly restorative to dragon-blooded creatures, able to restore them to nearly full health no matter their injuries, but it very toxic to non-dragon-blooded creatures."
373,,100,Adamantite,Final Fantasy V,Making,"An incredibly strong, but light, metal that also seems to give off energy. Can be fashioned into weapons or armor, reinforce buildings, or even be used to power magic sigils and formations."
374,,100,Hero Cocktail ,Final Fantasy V,Making,A drink which is likely just a combination of the other four. All facets of you are improved for 24 hours. Returns once per month.
375,,100,Sword,CthulhuTech,Making,"A nice sword. Because chopping heads off of things usually works. Katanas are popular in CthulhuTech, but this can be any type your want. It can be made of the latest composites for extra sharpness. If lost, stolen, or broken, you can find it back in your warehouse the next day."
376,,100,A winged helmet,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making,"This is a rather flashy piece of gear. A helmet with great wings crafted unto it. While it honestly looks ridiculous it will lead enemies to always focus just a little too long on it. The time they spend wondering, laughing or puzzling may be just the time you need to slit their throats."
377,,100,War raiment that no steel may bite,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making,"Iron and steel just glides off this set of armor, while stones and other heavy matters may still slay you."
378,,100,Spirit-Denying Sutra,Asura’s Wrath,Making,"Anointed prayer strips inscribed with banishment verse allow the wielder to ward a location against Gohma or similar native spirits and impure beings. They are compelled to stay 10 yards away from a properly warded location. You begin with enough prayer strips to defend a large building like a temple or school, and can make more as fast as you can write."
379,,100,Bespoke Facade,Witch on the Holy Night,Making,"Remember that other walk-in closet? While this one is no less fancy, it tends a little more to haute culture and sophistication than what’s up and coming now. The outfits here, while no less stylish and tailored to you precisely, are more geared towards presenting a certain mood with your appearance. Sophistication, menace, demureness-so striking is the cut and the colour you’ll be making a strong statement when you show up in town with one of these. As a little bonus, there’s a collection of Mystic Eye Killers too: (Stylish) Glasses with the power to restrain the power of eye-based magic such as Mystic Eyes, and protect oneself from those of others if they depend on eye contact."
380,,100,Fixer License,Library of Ruina,Making,"A plastic card displaying the basic details of your identity, alongside showing you to be registered as a Grade 9 Fixer. This appears completely legitimate to any form of inspection, the paperwork being correctly filed and some clerk in the Hana Association dimly remembering an individual fitting your description having the proper documents approved. So long as you keep this on your person, you are legally empowered to accept and fulfill contracts for just about anything that falls under the umbrella of Fixer work. Even if Fixers don’t exactly exist in future jumps, you’ll still be able to function in a similar capacity with a roughly analogous grading system. However, as grades are dependent on contracts completed rather than actual skill level you’ll be reset to Grade 9 each jump. That shouldn’t be an obstacle for long though, especially if you want to seem more lowly than you truly are."
381,,100,Legendary Equipment,Final Fantasy IV,Making,"The various legendary weapons and armors sit on the moon awaiting one to claim them, but you can choose one of them now. Arms and Armor formed of Adamantite qualify for this perk. If you have an Advanced Class, you may choose a single one for free. You may also import an existing weapon or armor, gaining the effects melded with the existing."
382,,100,Excalibur Blessing,HighSchool DxD,Making,"This version of Excalibur is perhaps the ‘holiest’ of the bunch, and better used as a ritual aid than a weapon. Its power relates directly to the faith of the user in the religion of the God of the Bible, enhancing the power of blessings and greatly damaging or weakening devils when used together with ritual. Oddly, this version lets this effect apply to all ‘holy’ magic or faiths from this jump onwards, so long as they fit the same themes."
383,,100,"Trust Me, Bro",HighSchool DxD,Making,"Let’s not gamble to see if you have won the extra lottery and managed to get a Sacred Gear, it’s far better to just trust on something more on hand - namely, a normal weapon. Lacking the utter bullshit effects of some holy swords, or the magic of ancient items, nor the soul connection of Sacred Gears, this weapon is still the absolute pinnacle of human forging methods, and it's sturdy enough to trade a few blows with the likes of Ophis before breaking."
384,,100,Dress Me Up,HighSchool DxD,Making,"You can’t be part of a cool group without a properly iconic uniform! Not only are these uniforms appropriate for whatever affiliation you happen to be part of, but there’s two sets each time - one for men, one for ladies. School uniforms, suits, nightgowns, etc. In case you need companions to dress up, too. They’re plenty durable and come in enough numbers to have everyone looking the part. So people will know at first glance what faction you belong to. Neat, huh?"
385,,100,Cardinal Of Red Ashes,HighSchool DxD,Making,"There are quite a few things that Devils take really seriously, one of them is a fair trade when it comes down to contracts and such things. That’s why this machine exists. A true wonder of magic and technology that can determine a fair price for any service rendered. It can even be used to manage a fair trade between objects. This thing won’t lie, even when giving price to utterly nebulous or subjective actions."
386,,100,"Holy Basics, Priestman",HighSchool DxD,Making,"The very baseline, tried and true, gear for exorcists across the globe. The garments laced with holy magic, the guns that shoot holy bullets, the holy lightsaber, the holy water, blessed grenades, and so on. They probably won’t do much against middle or high ranked Devils or anyone beyond that. But it’s more than enough to deal with the common rabble."
387,,100,Needle and Thread,The Voynich Hotel,Making,"A favorite tool of Witches in their more gruesome healing practices. This set has been mildly enchanted by their previous owner and will serve you equally well. The needle will always find the string on your first attempt and will never dull through use. You will also never find the spool empty of thread, which is as fine as spider silk and even stronger. Used together to bind wounds they will help those injuries heal ever so slightly faster."
388,,100,Conversation Cube,The Voynich Hotel,Making,"Sometimes it’s hard to know what to talk about the first time you meet people. Thankfully, the Conversation Cube was tailor made to help break that awkwardness that two people experience during their initial acquaintance. Simply pull this small, ordinary sized dice out of your pocket, give it a twist, and it will unfold in a Conversation Cube! With six sides, each denoting a broad range of story types, all you have to do is give it a roll and you’ll know what kind of story to break the ice with. And thanks to our subtle enchantment, most people will feel inclined to go along the Conversation Cube and tell you a story as well."
389,,100,Item Construction A,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Making,Unlimited Party Favors
390,,100,Vial of Circe,God of War,Making,"One of the most powerful sorceresses to have lived in ancient Greece, few women are as infamous as Circe. It is a well known fact that she often curses those who catch their ire, and this artifact is proof of that. This insidious bottle has been enchanted to turn any water it touches into a deadly poison."
391,,100,Lyre of Apollo,God of War,Making,"The god Apollo is one who possesses a multitude of divine roles, but perhaps his most famous is as the god of music. You now find yourself in possession of his lyre, crafted of the finest materials, and virtually indestructible. It is perfectly tuned, and the music it produces will always be pleasing to hear, even if played by a complete novice, if played by a master, you could even bring the gods to tears through your craft."
392,,100,Coin of Hermes,God of War,Making,"The patron god of travelers and thieves is an iconic and well liked figure, and one of his most beloved items is his coin. Bearing his face on one side and his staff on the other, simply holding it on your person will greatly increase the amount of currency you receive, be it sourced from a paycheck or found in a crypt."
393,,100,Bottle of Dionysus,God of War,Making,"The god of revelry may stand out amongst the Olympian Pantheon, yet none can deny his place among them. This bottle is filled with a drink of his own making, a wine that puts all others to shame. Thankfully for all those alcoholics out there, it will never run out of this glorious liquid."
394,,100,Amulet of the Fates,God of War,Making,"An amulet forged in the image of an eye, the symbol of the Fates, this is a relic that many would find invaluable. While wearing this, you will be able to slow down your perception of time by half at will. It may not seem like much, but every moment counts in the midst of combat."
395,,100,Rainicorn Horn,Adventure Time,Making,"An ethically sourced Rainicorn horn that shoots rainbows that allow you to change the colour of pretty much any object, creature or person."
396,,100,Eye Mask,Final Fantasy III,Making,"The red eye masks of the Gulgan, worn over their useless eyes. This mask is special in that it does not impede normal vision despite covering one’s eyes."
397,,100,A Pauldron,Final Fantasy III,Making,"A single large shoulder plate and a strap. When worn this pauldron somehow manages to catch a large number of hits, protecting you despite that fact that it only covers your shoulder."
398,,100,A Hammer,Final Fantasy III,Making,"A large hammer, useful for both smithing and combat. It is a great tool, the highest quality a smith could ask for, while also being perfectly weighted and suited for combat."
399,,100,Simple Smithing,Final Fantasy III,Making,"You are a trained and skilled craftsman, with a firm handle on smithing all kinds of regular metals, woodcarving, leatherworking, and other common crafting methods. You also have become immune to the side effects of this, such as mercury poisoning, hearing damage, and accidental cuts."
400,,100,Always prepared,Xena - Hercules,Making,"You can produce simple items whenever you need them. Reach somewhere that others can't see, like into a bag or pocket, and retrieve an appropriate item - a length of rope from a backpack, a piece of flint from a pouch, or a lockpick from your boot. Nothing too complex in a chemical or mechanical sense, and trying to get excessive (a crowbar from your wallet, grenades from under your hat) will only lead to failure and disappointment."
401,,100,Holy Grail Blueprints,Fate/Apocrypha,Making,"After Darnic Yggdmillennia leaked the blueprints for the Holy Grail War, many weaker variants of the ritual have been held across the world. It’s gotten to the point where the global population of Magi has notably decreased, and a ‘meta’ of sorts was developed around the Holy Grail War (such as the best ways of dealing with Assassin Servants). If you wish, with this purchase you may gain those blueprints yourself. They’ll let you hold your very own Grail Wars, although without an immense source of magical energy and power such as the Greater Grail, you’ll be restricted to holding wars with 5 Servants or less. Of course, you’re not obligated to hold a true Holy Grail War. There’s at least one case of a Magus simply arranging for all the Masters to order their Servants to suicide immediately after summoning to merely gather incredible amounts of magical energy. Perhaps with the right skills, you could modify the ritual further? Just keep in mind that the Holy Grails may blow up in your face if you aren’t good enough at crafting artifacts of their caliber."
402,,100,E.G.O. Unlock(TETH)        ,Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"Normally over the course of the jump, weapons and armour can be crafted from the energy collected from the abnormalities. Choose a non-tool Abnormality, you now have a single copy of all the equipment (including gifts) it can provide. Their requirements don’t apply to you or your companions. They can be found in your dorm/warehouse and won't be confused with company property.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
403,,100,Crowbar of Chaos,Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"A crowbar with a particular quirk that allows it to easily break security systems and locks with just a few hits. The stronger and more complex the security, the more hits needed to break it. Mysteriously always finds its way into the hands of someone who’ll bust you (or a friend) out when you need it."
404,,100,Mirror of Night,Hades,Making,"This stately and impressive mirror is sure to be the centrepiece of any room. It stands eight feet tall and just shy of that wide, every inch of its frame bedecked in dark wood, ominous carvings, and purple gemstones too large to be believed real. The mirror itself is black, reflecting not the world around it but instead appearing to be a slab of the night itself polished to a glossy sheen. Stepping close to it will allow the mirror to reflect your image, and only your image, as the rest of the surface fills with information about your capabilities. While the language and exact details of how it displays this information is left to your own discretion, it will be entirely accurate about what it shows. You can even search through what powers you possess by asking it questions. Quite handy for anyone."
405,,100,Keepsake Display Case,Hades,Making,"This simple glass and wooden curio cabinet does not appear to be furniture worthy of a child of divinity. But that only holds true so long as it is empty. When you place a small object inside that was given to you by a friend or ally, whether it is magical in nature or not, the design of this cabinet shifts slightly. A pane of glass may become frosted by a familiar design. Carving might rise out of the wood to depict a symbol meant to symbolize your friend along several inches of wood. Each and every keepsake you collect from others will subtly alter the design until it is full."
406,,100,Dancing Dagger,Final Fantasy II,Making,"A lightweight dagger that increases the holder’s movement ability, either for traveling or dodging, a substantial amount, letting you move deftly around the battlefield, like a dancer"
407,,100,Staff of Light ,Final Fantasy II,Making,"A staff seemingly forged of light energy. Resonates with the user, empowering all magic cast through it, either curative or destructive."
408,,100,Dragoon Pendant,Final Fantasy II,Making,"A pendant from Deist, proving your membership as one of the great Dragoons. Additionally, while it’s worn, any dragon-based creatures or Companions (including the Jumper’s alt-forms, if any) will have their strengths and senses heightened."
409,,100,Egil’s Torch,Final Fantasy II,Making,"Despite being called a torch, it looks more like a lantern. Crafted from the same meteorite that fell from space and gave the planet its Sunfire, it’s able to safely store and transport Sunfire. This can keep any flame within, no matter how hot, magical, or mundane, burning forever without a source of fuel."
410,,100,Goddess’ Bell,Final Fantasy II,Making,"An ivory bell, with the clapper formed in the shape of a key. This can open Kashuan Keep to retrieve the Sunfire, but more notably, this can be used to destroy seals that bar entry to any location. For extremely strong ones, this can still weaken the seal, allowing an easier time in breaking it."
411,,100,Map Ring ,Final Fantasy II,Making,"A nice ring with the inscription ‘Select Button and Cancel.’ You’re not quite sure what that means, but you will find that this projects a full world map of any planet you’re on, including your location and any important vehicles that you use to get around."
412,,100,Elixir Pack ,Final Fantasy II,Making,"Twenty elixirs, capable of restoring its imbiber to full life and power. Elixirs return at one per week after use, to a max of 20."
413,,100,Relic,Hellblazer,Making,A true holy relic. The sight of this item will repel demons and other monsters and its touch will burn.
414,,100,Wand,Hellblazer,Making,"A fancy tool for casting spells. Although not required, will increase the power of your spells and your endurance."
415,,100,Put A Gun On A Mage’s Hand,Fate/Strange Fake,Making,"Who said that Magi cannot adapt to the modern world? It has been centuries since the invention of firearms, so it’s only natural that magecraft has started to blend with them too. You have a small set of rifles, submachine guns and hand pistols that have been reinforced via magecraft to fire more accurately and faster, as well as allow a rougher usage than they should without breaking down. You also have been provided with a large set of bullets infused with magical energy. They aren’t going to kill servants due to their mystery being too weak for that, but they could be used to penetrate the defenses of most magi, as well as to kill some of the weaker supernatural entities."
416,,100,A King Sized Toy,Fate/Strange Fake,Making,"A mostly mundane weapon of your choice, or a mystic code of low potency. It is something that can be used by a Servant by being coated in their own magical energy, but won’t be a deciding factor in most fights on their own, and it is far from the strength of a true Noble Phantasm. If you wish to, it can be an imitation of a signature weapon of another legend different from your own, but it won’t have any of the magical properties of the original."
417,,100,Catalyst,Fate/Strange Fake,Making,"A relic belonging or closely tied to your Servant. Both in the world of magi and the regular world, it could fetch quite a high price as a collector’s item, and it may evoke some strong memories, for better or worse, from your Servant. In case you don’t have any Servant contracted, this is then an item related to a Servant of your choice, which could still be used in a ritual if you were to find the appropriate slot. This item is fairly mundane, maybe with just some traces of Mystery in it, so nothing as powerful as one of Solomon’s rings, or the Treasure Key of King Gilgamesh’s Vault.

In future worlds, you may find a similar item in your possession, a memento of a random legendary figure of the world you find yourself in. Nothing truly useful in most cases, but still something that you may find some use for, if only for just using it as decoration or as a museum piece."
418,,100,Bullet Glyph Set,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"This pad of a hundred or so sheets of square lightly yellow paper has adhesive on one edge between each of the sheets of paper. Each sheet has a glyph drawn on it that can be used to absorb a bullet.

After absorbing a bullet, being peeled off, and then placed upon a surface the square will adhere to the surface and become a trap. When enemies get close, the absorbed bullet will fire out of the glyph, causing the paper to turn to ash at the same time. The glyphs are intelligent armaments so won't fire at or be triggered by allies of whoever placed them down. 

Larger rounds, such as a grenade, will take more than one sheet to absorb and fire."
419,,100,Magnet Charm,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"A silver bracelet with a single charm in the shape of a magnet on it. While said to attract fortune, it seems to not mean 'good luck.' Instead, small useful items such as coins, bullets, and the like are drawn towards you. Never enough to be a problem, but enough to be useful."
420,,100,Ninjutsu Talisman,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"The bag is modified to receive an additional enchantment that affects the kunai within as well as the wielder. It will enhance the wielder's speed somewhat, and to the kunai, they are now launched with more force the faster the wielder is moving.

Requires Kunai to Purchase"
421,,100,Kunai        ,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"While it is possible to use individual knives in melee, the true use of this is that the bag that contains the knives is magic. It will rapidly target nearby foes and when a knife from within is thrown the bag will unleash additional knives to hit the other targets."
422,,100,Rare and Powerful,Disney’s Aladdin,Making,"Magic requires a lot of materials, from precious metals, jewels to animal parts and plants and herbs. You have a workshop full of wide-ranging components and stuffs, enough to work some really powerful magic, make poisons and mind altering substances, and whatever else you may want."
423,,100,Shop Menu,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Making,"Using this System feature you can buy and sell items from the system the items and components available to you may vary depending on the Perk settings chosen and the time of the year.

Any money you own can be stored within the shop menu without limit and called out at will. The contents within the shop will change on a daily basis but is guaranteed to have at least five days worth of Food, Drink, at least one basic weapon and shield.

The shop menu may have items or rewards specific to your system type such as new feats or facilities but will often be more expensive than the generic options."
424,,100,Magic Wand,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Making,This wand is a powerful magical tool that enhances any magical abilities you have by giving you a finer control and greater focus over how it is performed allowing you among other things to add conditions to spells cast.
425,,100,The Youth Stone and Magic Flute,The Little Mermaid,Making,"A large, football sized jewel and simple wooden flute that, together, can cause someone to de-age back to their adolescence. To use it, simply get the person you want to de-age to hold the jewel, and then play a tune on the flute. They will lose all memories related to being older. The person will turn back to normal after a day."
426,,100,Raya Lucarian Sorcerer Set ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making,"Robes worn by Raya Lucaria's magic scholars. Those who dedicate themselves to the study of glintstones formed from starry amber receive this modest yet elegant deep blue garb along with their vows of virtue and austerity.

The enchanted knights, anointed by the Lunar Queen, were heroes of the highest honors, but fell into disarray with the decline of the royal family."
429,,100,Gold and Silver Scarabs,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making,"Two talisman facsimiles of scarabs, the carrier of treasures and precious things. Keeping the golden scarab on your person will increase the amount of runes obtained from defeating enemies. The silver scarab, meanwhile, will increase the rate of item discovery."
430,,100,Crafting Materials,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making,"There are many natural resources found within the Lands Between which you might not be able to find anywhere else, much to your potential dismay. Fear not, for you shall never have to go without ever again.

While they have no special properties aside from being self-cleaning and repairing and of course making you look good, there is sure to be something for any occasion."
434,,100,Yaga Rifle,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Making,"This hunting rifle might seem out of date at a first glance, inferior to any truly modern firearm. In a different world not meant to persist, this is still the peak of technology. Wielded by Beastman living for nothing but continued struggling, this is their best friend and the perfect tool to hunt the ravenous beasts. The reason is simple. It is particularly effective for hunts against Demonic and Phantasmal Beasts, impacting their hide and flesh more than any other bullet would. You gain an ever replenishing supply of ammunition for this rifle too."
435,,100,Arctic Mystic Code,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Making,The cold of Russia is unyielding. If you wish to prevail you have no choice but to adapt and endure. Dread not you are not the first to face this challenge so take what they too used. This black Mystic Code has an enchantment on it which protects the wearer from the most brutal and cold of environments. Even a blizzard well below -100 degrees would pose no risk to your health.

Ultimate,Making,"For each additional 100cp you spend on this option, you may either gain a new legendary weapon for your set, or apply an additional quality to one of the weapons you already have.

439,,100,Hylian Set,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"A set of ranged weapons and support gear, for the aspiring adventurer.

First, you have a nicely made bow, along with a supply of arrows. If you prefer, this supply of arrows may instead be fire arrows.

Next, you have a supply of boomerangs, useful for controlling the distance you keep between yourself and your foes.

You have a Hookshot, a machine operated grappling hook, which can be used to pull nearby enemies to you, as well as grab onto ledges to prevent dangerous falls.

Finally, you have a supply of bombs, which can be remotely detonated. They come with a remote detonator. If you like, the detonator may be styled after a Sheikah Slate, but this will not grant the detonator any additional properties.

Your supply of arrows, boomerangs, and bombs never seems to run out, and you will always be able to find them when you need them. Should the bow, Hookshot, or detonator be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
440,,100,Challenge Album,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"A strange photo album. You will be unable to add your own photos into the album, as it will reject them. Instead, whenever you accomplish something significant, a new photo will appear in the album, with some text underneath briefly explaining what was done to earn the photo. These photos are generally goofy in nature, feature people relevant to the accomplishment, and more often than not reflect a scene that never occurred in reality. They are well-framed, and appear to be professionally taken.

The album will be able to expand indefinitely, without appearing any bigger externally or getting any heavier. You will always be able to find whichever page it is you are looking for right away.

On the back inside cover is a helpful list which is continually updated, and provides suggestions for things to do that would earn more photos. The list is based on your own knowledge, so if you have a secret nemesis, you wouldn’t be given the suggestion to defeat them.

Should the album go missing, or be damaged beyond repair, a new one will reappear in your Warehouse after 24 hours. It will retain all of the progress you have already made."
441,,100,Gunner Gear,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"A collection of ranged weapons. Largely arm cannons, though you can see a gun or a blaster here and there. Basically, anything a Mii Gunner might wield could be found here. However, regardless of appearance, all of these weapons function in approximately the same way, and produce the same results. Additionally, you have a supply of missiles and bombs, which you always seem to be able to pull out of nowhere when you need them, as well as a personal deflector."
442,,100,Swordfighter Gear,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"A collection of katanas, laser swords, rods, clubs and other assorted melee weapons. Basically, anything a Mii Swordfighter might wield could be found here. However, all of these weapons are about as useful as a well-maintained, but otherwise mundane, sword. So that Master Sword looking thing there is definitely not the real deal. Additionally, you have a supply of shuriken and chakram, which you always seem to be able to pull out of nowhere when you need them."
443,,100,Camera and Album,Wizarding World,Making,"Muggle technology is so fascinating and useful that you almost feel sorry for the stuck-up purebloods too ingrained in their ways to ever take advantage of it. Take a look at this camera for example. Looking at this, it doesn’t look much more like one of the many mass-produced Polaroids you can find lying around the Muggle world. But it is magical camera and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Just take a picture and out comes an animated snapshot. You don’t need to worry about anything like film or animating the photos yourselves.

To help you store your newfound photos, you also have an album for them that’s fitted with a special charm so that it never runs out of pages or get any heavier. On another note, it seems that photos of your most significant and triumphant moments can be found within the album, even if you never took a picture of them in the first place."
444,,100,A Flask of Silver,Wizarding World,Making,"Magic is a dangerous thing. There are no shortages of stories showing witches and wizards suffering unfortunate fates whenever it comes to experimenting with the arcane arts. And a sizable portion of said folks have even met their untimely end over the course of their practices. In preparation of such an occurrence, or because of such an event, you have this flask.

Filled with what seems to be molten silver, the flask and the liquid within are nevertheless cool to the touch. More importantly, the liquid is enchanted in a rather special way. By pouring the liquid over a lost limb, be it an arm or a leg, the silver shall take on the shape of said appendage, replacing it with something greater. And don’t be afraid of running out. The flask itself always fills back up at the end of the day.

On a final note, should the thought of betrayal even cross the minds of those you’ve gifted with silver limbs, their newfound limbs shall turn against them, doing their utmost best to kill their host. You can control how lenient the gifted hands are on betrayal. Useful if you don’t want your followers dying from simple idle thoughts."
445,,100,Dragon Models,Wizarding World,Making,"Dragons are tremendous and powerful magical beasts, a creature capable of laying waste to the countryside with ease. Dragons are almost never taken down alone, taking nearly half a dozen wizards just to stun them. These... are not those dragons. Instead, these things are dragons made miniature, a model of them used to do little things like roast chestnuts or impress a few friends.

You have a model for every kind of dragon that can be found in this world. If you want more, you also have a small book detailing how to create new ones based on any other beast you encounter. Still, like the miniature dragons, any of the beasts you create will generally be far, far weaker than the original they’re based on. Even when based on something as deadly and lethal as the Basilisk, the miniature you create will only be a mild annoyance to any trained witch or wizard. Still, nothing says you can only make one."
446,,100,Moleskin Overcoat,Wizarding World,Making,"If you’re going to be out and about in the world, you’ll need to have more than just your wand in hand and the clothes on your back. Which is why something like this has been offered to you. Weaved with moleskin, this special overcoat is a shining example of how wondrous magic can be. Enchanted with magic, the pockets within this overcoat are far larger than they appear. You could fit in teapots, sausages, an umbrella, keys, an entire birthday cake, and many more. Wear this upon your shoulders and you’ll never need to fear running low on supplies with just how much you can pack into this thing."
447,,100,Sneakoscope,Wizarding World,Making,"But if you want something more obvious, then this is just the Dark Detector for you! Created by one Edgar Strougler in the 18th century, the Sneakoscope takes the form of a small spinning glass top, its name proudly emblazoned upon it. Place it in your pockets and you won’t even feel the weight! Of course, the Sneakoscope is still a magical thing, and it certainly won’t let you forget. In the presence of untrustworthy fellows, the Sneakoscope will light up, spin and start whistling, preparing you against any nasty surprises headed your way.

Unlike an ordinary Sneakoscope, however, you can modify the Sneakoscope, changing its sensitivity, from detecting things as simple as students cheating at their exams to only activating against those who would be threats to your life. You can even adjust the range, from only working within a small room or covering a mile around it. But most importantly, you can make sure that only you can see and hear when the Sneakoscope is working, ensuring that your foes will be surprised when you turn the tables on them."
448,,100,Foe-Glass,Wizarding World,Making,"A rather useful tool for just about anyone, a Foe-Glass is a Dark Detector that, by all accounts, seems to be little more than a simple hand-held mirror. Of course, if you know anything about magic, things are always far from what they appear to be. Simply speaking, a Foe-Glass is a special type of mirror. Unlike a normal mirror, this shows you not your reflection but that of your foes’. At first, they will appear to only be shadows but as they get closer and closer to you, their reflection shall be made all too visible.

And do not worry. When facing against foes who pose a threat to you from afar, this little device will work all the same. The more they pose a threat to your life, the clearer their image within the mirror shall become. Of course, do remember to keep an eye on the mirror every now and then. If you aren’t looking at it, all it’ll be is a fancy paperweight."
449,,100,Moonstone Maker,Wizarding World,Making,"Moonstone is a rather interesting substance. You see, moonstone is something that can best be described as crystallized magic. With it, one can do many things but for now, it will be most useful when using it for Conjuration and Transfiguration, easing the difficulty of casting such spells. To ensure that you always have some moonstone on hand, your Warehouse now has what wizards and witches call a Material Refiner. Three of them in fact.

Despite what the name implies, this contraption is meant entirely for the creation of moonstone. More specifically, each refiner produces around a dozen pieces of moonstone every twelve hours, deposited within a seemingly endless chest beside them. While a dozen pieces of moonstone may not seem like much, imagine how much you’ll have by the end of a month, let alone a year."
450,,100,Wizard’s Chess,Wizarding World,Making,"Even the wizards enjoy a good old-fashioned game of chess or two. And of course, even their board games are magical. Fashioned and enchanted with sorcery, this chessboard set is indubitably that of a sorcerer’s. With pieces that can move and act on their own, playing with this chess set is sure to be a rather fun time. But merely playing chess isn’t all you can do with this. You may consult with the pieces, receiving advice in both chess and other matters. They seem to have a rather sizable repertoire of useful knowledge when it comes to teaching and war both. Rather fitting, don’t you think so?"
451,,100,The Family Watch,Wizarding World,Making,"It is a tradition amongst witches and wizards that they be given a watch when they come of age at seventeen years old. And while you may not be of this world, that does not mean that you cannot partake in its traditions and culture. Perhaps that is why you have this ornate and fanciful golden pocket watch, something you might consider as a gift from your benefactor, whoever they may be.

And as always, this watch of yours is far from ordinary. You see, unlike a regular watch, this watch is not meant to tell the time and its hands represent neither the minute nor the hour. Rather, each hand is meant a representation of you and your trusted Companions. Like a certain redheaded family’s clock, the numbers on it have been changed to locations such as “home”, “school”, “work”, “prison”, “lost”, “mortal peril”, and many more.

So long as this watch is by your side, you will always be aware of where your Companions might be and if they would be in need of your help. If you do need to use it as an actual timekeeping device, just press the button on its side and the watch’s face shall shift and change to show you the time. It’s perfectly accurate as well so you don’t need to worry about being late."
452,,100,Task Planner,Wizarding World,Making,"Do you remember exactly when you took your first steps on this multiversal journey of yours? Did you have any plans to put in motion once you jumped into this world? If so, this will likely be quite useful to you. Originally a homework planner, this little journal has been enchanted so that it’ll always keep track of any assignments, plans, or responsibilities you must perform and what their deadlines are. And as the deadlines of such tasks get closer and closer, the more the planner will seek to remind you of them, like a particularly strict and annoying alarm clock.

You don’t have to worry about writing down on it. So long as you are aware of the tasks at hand, the journal shall automatically fill itself up. And should your tasks be at risk of failing due to events beyond your control, your journal will seek to pester you to accomplish them before they become unavailable or such events occur."
453,,100,Planters & Pots,Wizarding World,Making,"While the magnificence and glory of well-trained spell work cannot be denied, you would be a fool to disregard the arts of Potions and Herbology both. A proper potioneer and a proper herbologist would be the equal of any wand-wielding witch or wizard. You are no potioneer or herbologist just yet but that, like many other things, is subject to change.

To get you started on this path, you’ve been provided with an endless supply of planters and pots, each one unique when it comes to their design. Any plants grown within these planters are ensured to always grow healthy, never dying of disease or wilting away until you pluck them. For potions, the same principle applies. Whatever potions you brew with the pots will never suffer from any disastrous failures. Any failures here will simply be borne from your lack of skill and training."
454,,100,Fireleg,Wizarding World,Making,"To most wizards, usually those unfamiliar with Muggles, firearms are simply a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other. While technically true, it is also a massive understatement as any knowledgeable Muggle can tell you. But you should at least be well aware of them. If not, perhaps this will be able to help you.

And so, you are now the proud owner of any one handheld firearm manufactured before or during the 21st century. While it may not have as many uses or be as fanciful as a wand, a secondary weapon wouldn’t hurt. And don’t you worry about running out of ammo. All you have to do is reach into your pockets and you’ll find a fresh magazine or clip ready to be used to reload your weapon of choice. Personally, I’d recommend a M1911."
455,,100,Works Everlasting,Wizarding World,Making,"Having created something beautiful, it’s now time for you to make sure that your creations are those built to last. There will be no such thing as obsolescence from you or your wondrous creations. Much like the fabled Deathly Hallows themselves, your creations are built to stand the test of time. No matter how much time passes or how long they’ve been used, they will remain as functional and as pristine as the day they were crafted."
456,,100,Works of Art,Wizarding World,Making,"To be a tradesman in this world is to see your creations and services sold to the people. But the question comes then, how do you entice people? How do you make them buy your goods? For you, this comes by making things that can be truly known as works of arts. Whether it be through great skill or simple good old-fashioned experience, you have learned how to create things that would be envy of men and women everywhere. Paintings, sculptures, and even something as simple as toys would be as beautiful as some of greatest creations of Muggles and wizards alike.

Still, it is important to keep in mind that there is a world of difference between making something beautiful and making something functional."
457,,100,Godrick Knight Set,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,"Armor worn by knights loyal to Godrick The Grafted. Its left breast is emblazoned with a two-headed war axe, an emblem of the golden lineage. The knights surely boasted of their strength in days long gone."
458,,100,Crucible Tree Set,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,"Armor of the Crucible Knights who served Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, this version was typically worn by the knight Siluria and her men. Holds the power of the crucible of life, the primordial form of the Erdtree. It will strengthen Aspects of the Crucible incantations."
459,,100,Drake Knight Set,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,Black iron armor worn by drake knights. Features the spoils of a dragon catch as an emblem of pride as both dragon hunter and partake of communion. The cape is crafted with a dragon wing membrane.
460,,100,Elden Lord Set ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,"The blue and silver armor and golden crown of Godfrey, the first Elden Lord. The age of the Erdtree began amongst conflict, when Godfrey was lord of the battlefield. He led the War against the Giants. Faced the Storm Lord, alone. And then, there came a moment. When his last worthy enemy fell. And it was then, as the story is told, that the hue of Lord Godfrey's eyes faded."
461,,100,Gold and Silver Scarabs,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,"Two talisman facsimiles of scarabs, the carrier of treasures and precious things. Keeping the golden scarab on your person will increase the amount of runes obtained from defeating enemies. The silver scarab, meanwhile, will increase the rate of item discovery."
462,,100,Demi-Human Queen's Staff ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,"Glintstone staff styled as a scepter. A gift once given to the demi-humans to foster peace, it can be wielded even by those of low intelligence. It is sneered at by fools in the academy."
463,,100,Crafting Materials,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,"There are many natural resources found within the Lands Between which you might not be able to find anywhere else, much to your potential dismay. Fear not, for you shall never have to go without ever again. You will receive a stockpile of all natural resources one may find in these lands, numbering fifty each and replenishing weekly when used or destroyed."
464,,100,Bone Cage,The Lion King,Making,"You have access to cages made from bone, that come in various sizes. They are near impossible to escape from, and are quite strong, no matter the size."
465,,100,Gummi Berry Juice,Gummi Bears,Making,"You get a set of ten bottles worth of Gummi Berry Juice every week and you can stockpile these. They come in glass bottles, individually served wooden mini-kegs or all together in a single keg. Gummi Berry juice is a magic potion, fuel and one of the local macguffins which is often the answer to most problems. This potion has different effects on different species. On Gummi Bears it temporarily gives them a very rubbery body and massively boosts the jumping, durability and acrobatic abilities of the drinker. Allowing the Gummi Bears to jump at high speeds over huge distances, both vertically and horizontally. While under the effects of this potion Gummi bears also don’t receive any damage from falls or blunt weapons.

For humans and ogres it increases their strength and durability, the potion however can only be used once a day for humans (It just doesn’t work again until they have slept for eight hours). 

The effects last for about a minute for every species."
466,,100,Gummi Berry Bushes,Gummi Bears,Making,"You get ten bushes of every color of Gummy berry bushes. These bushes never get sick, grow old, ignore bad weather and are always producing fruit. You can clone or breed these bushes using normal horticultural techniques and the offspring will maintain these magical properties.

These bushes/berries can produce all of the various magical gummi-berry based potions seen in the show, growing potions, de-aging potions, Gummi Berry juice etc.

Note that the berries themselves are magical and different types of potions can be made from them by mixing them in different ratios and adding other ingredients."

You are free to pick pretty much any type of gun you’d like, from a pistol to an anti-tank rifle to a rocket launcher. Flamethrowers and portable mortars are also on the table if you so wish. And if you want to duel-wield two of the same gun, like Neru, go right ahead. Pretty much the only thing you can’t get with this is a laser canon like what Aris carries around."
470,,100,Durable Super Suit ,Invincible,Making,"You have a beautifully designed super suit tailor made for you so that it fits perfectly. This suit is extraordinarily strong and will even hold up during super powered combat without ever disintegrating. While it is durable, this suit does not increase your defenses: it simply survives through combat."
471,,100,Shadowstone,Wizard 101,Making,"An unsightly chunk of smoky quartz, jagged, sharp, and not entirely there. Can empower any illusion spell that uses it as a focus, creating almost lifelike visages and realistic sounds at the cost of shrinking the gem. The gem may grow larger by being left in a dark place and forgotten about."
472,,100,Diamond,Wizard 101,Making,A brilliant gem that shines with starlight. Any self-enhancing spell cast may use this diamond as an additional focus to improve its duration twofold.
473,,100,Artist’s Workbench,Wizard 101,Making,"A large workbench designed with the classical arts in mind. Complete with an endless supply of paints, clay, canvas, sheets for writing music, blueprinting, and sketching, and all the tools necessary for sculpture.

474,,100,Scarab Pendant,Wizard 101,Making,"A scarab pendant on a brass chain, which can split into two parts. You may give one-half the pendant to someone you choose. When that person is in danger, your half of the beetle will grow agitated and fly in their direction at a fast pace."
475,,100,Tinkerer’s Workbench,Wizard 101,Making,"A workbench fit for any mad Diviner on a budget. Complete with a standard array of hand tools, several drawers worth of scrap metal, spare gears, screws, and other assorted odds and ends that never seem to run out, and a handful of pre-charged Lumina Crystals that recharge themselves every week. Lumina crystals act like batteries for Storm magic, and as such serve as a fantastic power source for just about any magitech device. You cannot charge Lumina Crystals with anything but natural Storm energy, such as is refined by the Storm Mill."
476,,100,Alchemist’s Workbench,Wizard 101,Making,"Fire is the magic best suited to aspiring alchemists, thanks to the needed control over flame. This comes complete with cauldron, alembic, vial, flasks and all other assorted necessary equipment, and a shelf’s worth of weekly replenishing common ingredients. "

Whether you choose a Raven-Phone, a telepathy necklace, or another small device, now you can enjoy a piece of the electricity-free technology native to the Demon Realm!"
478,,100,Wizard Stick,Disney Princess,Making,"Shaped like a snake, can channel magic through it to greater effect and precision."
479,,100,Magic Staff,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Making,"Those goody two-shoes Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather all use such simple wands to cast their magic. Just further proof they’re nothing but rabble, of course, especially since your own instrument for casting magic is so much grander. Yours is a great staff, one perhaps much like Maleficent’s, topped with a magic orb through which you may show others images, such as their daughter’s dead body or the future you have planned. It’s handy for casting magic, and it makes such a satisfying noise when it smacks the ground..."
480,,100,Magic Wand,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Making,"Well, you couldn’t be a fairy without a wand, now could you? It’s a small thing, easily held in one hand, and it’s not exactly remarkable appearance-wise, looking like a yellow stick instead of anything fancy. But through this, you can channel your magic, coming out in a form that resembles dust willed with tiny stars. In the hands of a normal fairy, it’s capable of doing magic. In the hands of a truly powerful fairy? It can work miracles."
481,,100,White Seance Ring,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"A divine ring entrusted to the head bishop of the Way of White and apostle to Allfather Lloyd, uncle to Lord Gwyn.

483,,100,Covetous Silver Serpent Ring,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"The serpent is an imperfect dragon and symbol of the Undead. Its habit of devouring prey even larger than itself has led to an association of gluttony. This silver ring, engraved with the serpent, rewards its wearer with additional souls for each kill."
484,,100,Darkmoon Seance Ring,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"This silver ring is granted to adherents of Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity and last born of Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight. His followers are few, but their tasks are of vital importance, as such this will make all of your spells more efficient to use, allowing you to use them much more often."
485,,100,Titanite Slabs        ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"Titanite slabs are the heirlooms of a nameless blacksmith deity, who forged the weapons of other gods, and are required to craft and improve the greatest of armaments.

Thankfully, you will receive a shipment of ten of each slab of this legendary material each week."

487,,100,Purging Stones,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"Humans are helpless against curses, and can only redirect them. This collection of twenty ash-colored stones encasing a skull were secret treasures of Arstor, Earl of Carim, and can be used to reduce curse build-up as well as break minor curses, like those caused by basilisks. They do not dispel the curses, though, but receive them as a surrogate. They will replenish weekly after being used or destroyed"

Not only does it have things like a hammer and calipers, but its tools can be used for both forging as well as the improvement and maintenance of one’s gear.

They are essential if you desire to rise against the challenges you’ll come to face."
490,,100,Bottomless Box,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"An invaluable item for any traveler, allowing them to hold onto many of the items found lying about Lordran. This wooden box can hold an infinite amount of items within, so long as they can fit into the box in the first place.

These glossy red bottles contain enough human blood to satisfy a vampire’s daily bloodthirst. New bottles are delivered at midnight, ensuring you always have a steady supply.

Whether you use daggers, throwing stars, or just the classic silvered bayonet, you can summon an endless supply of one kind of small, simple bladed weapon. This doesn’t include more exotic variations, like Anderson’s exploding bayonet-chain, but you’ll never run out of your staple weapons. Don’t let the learned youngsters forget you have bayonets for days!"
495,,100,Agent’s Tools,Hellsing,Making,"The many tools of an exorcist and slayer of demons. Silver crosses and stakes, sealed bottles of holy water, pages of scripture containing warding passages and even a few silvered blades imbued with blessed power.

496,,100,Hunting Weaponry,Hellsing,Making,"A selection of modern military firearms, all equipped with ‘anti-midian’ ammunition. Designed to cause serious harm to the creatures of the night, these weapons are able to leave wounds whose healing is hindered and even better pierce unnatural defenses. They won’t do much against a more powerful monster but the more common vampire will feel almost as much danger from these as a normal man would from any firearm. "
497,,100,Victorian Fashion,Hellsing,Making,"A range of quite old fashioned clothes, not the sort one expects to see at the end of the 20th century. Victorian dress, from overly large cloaks and hats to butler uniforms to the fanciest of suits, yet none of it restricts your movements. Apparently cut for combat, you’ll look stylish as you practically dance your way through any enemy that stands before you. "
498,,100,Bloody Carnation,Marry Poppins Returns,Making,"Fashion can tell us a lot about people, and with this crimson blossom pinned to your clothing, you’ll send an unmistakable message. In addition to remaining constantly in bloom, this elegant carnation seems to spread an aura of intimidation wherever you go, completing any outfit with a sinister flourish. You’ll still have to dress to impress, however - there are some fashion disasters that just can’t be salvaged, and there are plenty of outfits that just don’t lend themselves to the art of intimidation. But pick out the proper outfit, and this brightly colored carnation will leave you as threatening as your threads are bespoke."
499,,100,Artificial alicorn,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Making,"It’s a synthetic unicorn horn, not a reference to another show. It’s effectively a magical multitool you can wear on your head. It can’t cast Mewni magic, but it comes with an integrated chainsaw! Take note – Princess Pony Head will want it back, so best to avoid her. And the rest of her family. Especially the OTHER one without a horn."

It is all but indestructible, save by a god, and even then it can be used to damage even the toughest creatures without being damaged in turn.

525,,100,Workshop Artisan,Bloodborne: Covenants,Making,"The beasts that plague Yharnam are not simple animals that fire and guns can scare away, requiring specialized Hunters to take them down. And what hunter would be complete without a weapon by their side, one perfectly suited to their occupation.

527,,100,Crossing Rings ,Marvel Magic,Making,"Fifty magical rings of Asgardian origin. Any who wears a ring can mentally communicate with any other who wears such a ring. Rings such as these were once used in much greater number in one of vile Loki’s schemes against Asgard.

528,,100,Flames of Regency ,Marvel Magic,Making,"Say what you will about the Dread Dormammu -- he’s an evil demon who wants nothing more than for you to suffer in slavery before him for all eternity and what have you -- but the guy does have a sense of style.

Nowhere is that more obvious than with this beautiful but deadly flower found in Jamaica. In large amounts the flower will poison and kill anyone who tries to imbibe it. Yet should one use small amounts via spreading it upon the body's wounded areas, or attempt to imbibe by inhaling the smoke from its burning roots, the flower will act as a healing agent to help eliminate wounds. Even better, doing this will also temporarily grant increased strength, speed, and durability to those who imbibe it to make them formidable opponents. Just be careful with how long you take it, for it could have adverse effects."
534,,100,Laevateinn ,Loki,Making,"Jumper, you're gonna need this on your journey. At least, it could be useful if you don’t already have a weapon of some sort, or you need to act as a distraction. This sword is quite sharp, creates a suitable sheathe and straps when you place it to your back or side, and the blade can be ignited. Not only will the latter feature burn others or act as a source of heat, but you can use it to easily draw the attention of others to you.

543,,100,Capey,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Making ,"Now be honest who doesn’t want a sentient flying cape. You have acquired a relic similar to the Cloak of Levitation used by Dr. Strange. This cloak is heavily resistant to foreign magic and anything that could damage it. For example, Strange's cloak stopped a lethal attack from Wanda, saving his life. The cloak is also capable of acting independently such as when it saved America on its own and slapped Strange trying to wake him up. If the cloak is somehow destroyed, it will be repaired and reappear the next day. It probably will be a bit cranky though."
544,,100,Karmic Staff,Marvel Cosmic,Making ,"A copy of the Karmic Staff wielded by Adam Warlock, this golden bird capped pimp cane is unbreakable and allows you to focus your energies though it for more precision and a minor boost to the power channeled through it.

While most users will only be able to glide for short distances, a skilled Airbender (or extremely skilled Firebender) can use it to truly fly. It also amplifies Bending when incorporated into most Bending forms, and can be used to fight with in a pinch."
546,,100,Mystic Focus,Fate/Zero,Making ,"One of the first tools you ever received in your training in the arts of magecraft, this implement has served you well time and again. Whether it takes the form of a wand, staff, rod or some other classic tool, it helps to focus your magic in general and improve your control even further in your own specific specialisation, as chosen earlier. This foci will never be out of reach for you, at most requiring you to reach behind your back or into a hat to pull it out, good as new. It’s very sturdy though, so don’t be afraid to use it to give something a good smack in an emergency. This can be imported into."
547,,100,Infinite Wine,Fate/Zero,Making ,"A collection gathered from decades or centuries of personal interest from your family, you have a rather large wine cellar connected to any property you own. The wine from the bottles stored here will never run out and has a vast range of flavours and years to pick from. If you found any such things from the outside world that you had a particular taste for, you could store them in the many open racks here to give them the same never ending effect too."
548,,100,Stylish Clothes,Toaruverse,Making ,"Wearing the same boring and plain clothes everyday is boring and some might ask if you even change your clothes. With this you receive a stylish set of clothes that suits you very well and it also automatically cleans itself from any dirt or stains even odors along with the ability to repair itself into pristine condition. The clothes also change their decorations, color and style everyday giving anyone that sees you an impression of a new and refreshing look."
549,,100,Spiritual Weapon,Toaruverse,Making ,Made from exotic materials when spells or abilities used through it makes it more efficient and less costly in mana usage. The weapon is also very durable and can take a great deal of damage before breaking along with it being so sharp that it’s capable of cutting steel like butter. You can choose which weapon that you would receive and the weapon would be especially tailored for you to use and extremely heavy for others to wield without your permission.
550,,100,Symbolic Weapon,A Certain Magical Index,Making ,"Not exactly an actual symbolic weapon, but this weapon, whatever it is, makes your magic more efficient. Mana flowing through your blood vessels now flows through this weapon when you hold it, enabling it to function like a focus. Your theme decides what weapon this is. For example, an earth magician would get a hammer, while a wind magician would get a crossbow. Though this is otherwise a very mundane weapon that isn’t even of high quality, the safety system built into it that prevents the magic feedback created when the weapon is damaged more than makes up for this. Try not to let others touch this, as you’ll have to consecrate it again in a small ritual after that happens."
551,,100,Shard Dust,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"Ground up shards from the cosmos; can be imbibed to tap into otherworldly power, increasing damage and speed and resetting timed abilities, but has increasingly worse side-effects if overused including insanity. You get one vial a week."
552,,100,Toy Soldier ,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A carved toy, perhaps carried as a token of luck. That seems to be the case as it not only offers protection from blows, but also increases the chance of scoring a critical hit."
553,,100,Dark Crown,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A crown that even now drips blood from its rim, in low-light conditions the disturbing head-wear somehow soothes the mind and hardens the resolve of its wearer."
554,,100,Moon Ring,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A counterpart to the Sun Ring studded with gems, it enhances the wearer’s strength and accuracy to a slightly greater extent at the cost of requiring near-darkness to do so."
555,,100,Stone of Patience,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,A curiously carved idol; despite its strange appearance carrying it on one’s person slows the accumulation of stress and reminds you of your manifest virtues.
556,,100,Incensed,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"“Great is the weapon that cuts on its own!” A censer; a humble weapon for someone who claims to offer aid against the forces of darkness. But the usage of incense has long been a part of ritual works, and their power holds true even outside of those undertakings. You have the knowledge required to create a variety of strange powders that, when burned, provide some utility in combat- slight as it may seem. Poisonous vapour, fumes that fortify the body, and gases that heighten agility. These powders may even have other uses; a volatile mix of gunpowder may explode when thrown to the ground, throwing off aim, and another may be applied to the body to increase resistance to a variety of ailments- at least until sweat washes it away."
557,,100,Mallet of Rewards,Bayonetta,Making ,"What's better than one good drop? TWO good drops. After all, more is more, right? A rare artifact created in the eastern lands by a chivalrous thief and lone witch, this item increases the items that can be collected from an enemy. With this, the ten halos dropping from an angel may become fifteen or twenty."
558,,100,Crafting Countertop,Bayonetta,Making ,"Such worthy opponents you face! They have indeed earned their place at the table... your dissection table. It looks like an unassuming stone slab, sure, but so long as you use it for the purpose of crafting an item or a weapon it will never break under the stress you put on it. What's that? You're punching a monster into a shape on it? Well... if you're making something out of it, technically it counts?"
559,,100,Aesthetics and Flair,Bayonetta,Making ,"A gun isn't quite a gun until it LOOKS good, you know? It's supposed to be classy, make you look amazing just for having it. Likewise, that sword could use a bit of badass styling to it. When you create your weapons, you can make them look DAMNED good even on an off day. Expect any weapon creator to envy you, and those who die by your weapons to count themselves lucky as they perish to such beautiful art."
560,,100,Silver Armaments,Ragna Crimson,Making ,"Unlike regular Dragon Hunters, the weapons of the Silver Corps are a bit less standardized. Ranging from silver infused fists to guns that use silver ammunition, you have gained one of these items crafted by the Silver Princess herself."
561,,100,A Silver Sword,Ragna Crimson,Making ,"You wouldn’t be able to be a Dragon Hunter without one of these: a high-quality silver sword, probably crafted by one of the big figures of the time seeing its general quality and design. This kind of sword is good enough that it won’t break when making contact with a Seija, but unlike the weapons that Ragna makes, it’s not good enough to easily kill them."
562,,100,Charge,Shovel Knight ,Making ,You may stop attacking for a moment to charge your weapon/shield. It will be proportionally more powerful the more you charge it. Has a cap of ten seconds.
563,,100,Alchemical Armaments(100),Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"Alchemy has been known to awaken supernatural qualities in objects before, and this has been weaponized in many cases. This tool is one such example. Be it a weapon, a piece of armor, or something as mundane as a lantern, this armament has been subject to an alchemical treatment that has brought out some supernatural quality.

For 100cp, this is fairly basic, either with an infusion of an element/material or a refinement of the object to make it better at its task. Examples of this include a dagger infused with air being lighter and faster, a lantern refined to be more revealing so it undoes illusions, or a breastplate could be used to counter acid if it were infused with a base of some variety."
564,,100,Resources,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"You have a constant source of income, whether it’s a patron, a business you hold stock in, or something else entirely. Alternatively, you can have a source of raw materials, such as an island that constantly replenishes the materials it has available. Either way, this gives roughly $100,000 USD worth of cash or materials every year per purchase of this item.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
565,,100,Stasis Cabinet ,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"A decently sized series of cabinets, large and small, that are fitted with a carefully tuned set of enchantments that allows time to be manipulated within. The cabinets have a number of shelves, each with a few timers and dials that allow you to accelerate or decelerate time, with a button to completely stop, or restart, the progress of time on a particular shelf. This can be programmed to change its current level of time acceleration or deceleration after a specific amount of time. The stasis and time differentials cannot cause any form of harm nor can it block someone from grabbing a stored item. Comes with an instruction manual."
566,,100,Harvest Bag,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"A leather satchel that is much larger on the inside than its outside dimensions would suggest and always just as light is if it were empty. Any raw material placed into the harvest bag has any and all supernatural qualities preserved as time seems to have less effect within the satchel as it does outside of it. Additionally, any raw material within can be used as if it were in hand of the satchel-holder, great for material-based spellcasting."
567,,100,Material Cultivation,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"You gain the knowledge of how to cultivate the various materials you need, at least for those that can be cultivated, including growing various plants and fungi, as well as how to raise a wide variety of animals that have useful parts."
568,,100,Material Gathering,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"An alchemist is, usually, nothing without materials to work with, so you’ve learned how to get those materials. You know what materials to look for and how to harvest them effectively without harming their quality, as well as where they can most likely be found in any given environment."
569,,100,Toxicity,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"You have the ability to make your potions toxic, pairing a benefit with a detriment of some variety in order to strengthen the benefits of the potion. You also find that your resistance to poison, diseases, and potion toxicity increases with exposure, allowing you to ignore some of the detriments of such potions. This also makes it so that any poison you make or use are faster acting and more intense, if you want them to be."
570,,100,Substitutions ,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"Sometimes, you just can’t find hundred year old mountain ginseng or the blood of a two hundred year old dragon, so, you improvise. You can find a viable substitute for even the most rare, obscure, and seemingly critical materials for just about anything that would require such materials. While these materials may be rare themselves, having more options makes it more likely you will find something regardless. The potency of your creation may suffer a bit from these substitutions or may express unusual quirks, with more substitutions resulting in more divergence, but they will remain serviceable to their purpose."
571,,100,Grenadier,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"You have a considerable amount of skill with explosives, how to make them, how to implement them, how to shape their charges, everything you could need to know about the production and use of explosives. This does not, however, cover nuclear bombs or anything in a similar vein. Additionally, you have an exceptionally good throwing arm, able to throw farther and faster than one would expect and with pinpoint accuracy."
572,,100,Potioncraft,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"Also known as practical alchemy or alchemistry, you know how to make potions using natural materials that have been put through the alchemical processes. The strength of these potions is based on how well you perform the processes, the quality of the ingredients, and the amount of aetheric power (represented by mental stamina) you invest into the potion during its creation. It is also possible to create variations on potions such as oils, soaps, candles, incense, inks, or candies. You are also not beholden to making the effects entirely beneficial and can, for example, make a poison with this knowledge."
573,,100,Doran's Blade,League of Legends,Making ,"This simple steel short sword was created by a young artificer, and was imbued with a small measure of ferocity. Wearing this sword on your waist will heal your wounds whenever you wound another living creature."
574,,100,Doran's Ring,League of Legends,Making ,"This simple iron ring was created by a young artificer, and was imbued with a small measure of cunning. Wearing this ring will slowly regenerate magical energy, and when you strike a creature with your magic, you are able to steal a small amount of magical energy from them."
575,,100,Weapons(100),Arcane,Making ,"This isn’t always the nicest world, and it often pays to have something to put between yourself and an enemy.

For 100 CP, your weapon is a little more special; maybe a sword made by a legendary smith, perfectly-balanced for your style, or a top-of-the-line rifle."
576,,100,Artiste,Arcane,Making ,"Piltover is renowned as a city of industry and innovation, yes - but also a city of art and beauty. You have all the skills required to adorn it with the jewels of human (or vastaya or yordle) artistry, being an excellent painter, sculptor, singer, poet and draughtsman. Moreover, you know how to make whatever you build or craft look good."
577,,100,Ancient Weapons,A Throne of Glass,Making ,"A collection of ancient Fae weapons, artfully made and magically imbued, the slow march of time will never have no effect on these blades, never dull their edges, nor would the harsh rigours of combat. They could sit untouched for millennia and be in as perfect shape as the day they were first made. These blades and their edges never need to be maintained, the magic of their creators making them ever sharp. You gain a collection of 5 different melee weapons in any combination or style you desire."
578,,100,Broomstick,A Throne of Glass,Making ,"You have carved and made a rideable broom of Ironwood for an Ironteeth Witch or Redwood for a Crochan Witch. These brooms use magic and are able to fly faster than birds, with extraordinary agility. Interestingly the broom requires no direct application of magic to fly and may fly at their top speed indefinitely. Magic brooms are unable to fly in null-magic zones."
579,,100,Noble Attire,A Throne of Glass,Making ,"You have a full wardrobe of noble attire, everything a noble would need to fit in anywhere from casually walking the streets to the fanciest dinner with the King himself. You have a couple dozen outfits for every degree of formality you could need, with a few more outfits for each degree generated by this wardrobe every year. These outfits are automatically cleaned, pressed, repaired, and taken care of every time you take them off.

580,,100,Some Extra Kick!,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"By adding some …certain questionable ingredients to existing healing items and using more than one of the items in question as a material, you can “upgrade” the items in question – turning two or three potions into a hi-potion or combining a potion and an ether to make an elixir! In addition, whenever you apply a healing item to someone, it’s vastly more effective."
581,,100,Alchemic Expertise,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"As a basic skill of this world’s Alchemists, you know the recipes and ways to create natural remedies that heal light wounds, as well as stirring someone’s natural health and mana regeneration."

With just this level of knowledge, these status effects are Sleep, Burn, Silence, Fatigue, Blind, and Poison."
583,,100,Tasty,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"A good cook is treasure enough in this world, but you take it to the next level. If you had access to quality ingredients, you could cook up feasts that actively grant the people that eat them the Vigorous (Vastly increased vitality) status effect, as well as resistance to certain status effects and damage types based on the ingredients - warm and hot ingredients could give resistance to Water damage, as an example, or cold ingredients against Fire damage."
584,,100,Maintenance and Logistics,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"Part of why you became a Landship Engineer is your eye for detail and efficiency, and that shines when it comes to keeping your Landship good as new. Not only is your ability to repair your ship enhanced to the point that you can grant it “temporary” health during combat by quickly patching any damage received during it, you can even fortify its main armor mid-combat by spending effort and working quickly, granting it further defense in anticipation of a mighty attack. You obviously also know how to construct new shells and bullets for your tank’s mounted weapons.

585,,100,Cavalier Armor,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"You own and are capable of crafting a one- of-a-kind armor that is designed to your specifications in terms of design. With a single motion and command word, you are capable of donning this armor. While ensconced in this Cavalier Armor, you are capable of endowing your unarmed strikes with the Air element. In addition, you are much faster and stronger in this armor, quicker than a jaguar and striking with force capable of crushing stone. However, taking too much damage while in this mode will cause the armor to disappear, requiring you to manually repair its focus over a peaceful period of rest."

589,,100,Loot table,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Making ,"While loot is scattered around the dungeon, having this perk means that future Jumps will have supplies and equipment just lying around in out-of-the-way corners, and anything you kill will inexplicably have a few coins on their body, or rarely (1%) drop something unusual or valuable. While the value of what you find varies wildly, careful searching or random luck ensures that you'll eventually come across top-of-the-line items appropriate to the Jump every so often. "
590,,100,Premium Pack,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Making ,"Be it a broken piece of ancient machinery, a chipped blade, or an empty magazine, you can perform repairs and recharge items simply by touching genuine currency items to the object in question. The money vanishes as the effect takes hold, and this will cost you about 300% more than if you'd bought the needed services normally, and that's just for commonplace items. Truly priceless items will require staggering amounts of money to restore even to a small degree, but the effect is instantaneous and perfect. "
591,,100,Magical Focus,Dresden Files,Making ,"An extremely high-quality focus that you hand-crafted out of the very finest materials possible, using time and dedication and effort. We’re talking staffs made of millennia old trees studded with Gold and Gems from the temple of a God of Magic level stuff, here. The last Merlin to have a focus this good was Merlin."
592,,100,Storage Unit,The Dresden Files,Making ,"One of the more specialized applications of magic, this is basically a portable magic battery which draws in energy as long as you're wearing it, then releases it whenever you feel it's appropriate. There's a lot of different potential applications here, and not all of them have to do with what you'd commonly call energy either. For example, you could have a ring that collects spare kinetic energy from your hand movements or a chain that stores electricity, or even a ring that stores random memories that you can blast into someone's head at a later point. You can buy as many of these as you like.

593,,100,Magical Focus,The Dresden Files,Making ,"You're rarely going to see a Practitioner without some sort of tool to help them shape their magic, and most are going to carry around as many as they can. Like the name implies, they're not designed to make your magic stronger; instead, they help you control what you're throwing around. Some, like the Shield Bracelets, really work wonders but are limited to specific spells, while some, like a White Council Staff, are less effective but general use. You can decide which you're going to get with each purchase, and any extras are at a discount. Oh, and for the non- Practitioners in the room, these ones work for any Magic Source, not just Magic.

594,,100,Pocket Full of Sunshine,The Dresden Files,Making ,"While it might look like a perfectly ordinary handkerchief, this is one of the rarest items in the world: Something made by a happy Wizard. Alright, maybe that was a little dark. Anyway, this folded-up napkin is filled with a beam of genuine sunlight, and when unfolded, it'll release its payload in a burst of awe-inspiring radiance. Or terror-inspiring, if you're the sort of critter who dies in the sun. Refilling it is as easy as holding it up during a sunny day, but you've gotta be genuinely happy to make it work. If you can't muster that, don't worry, it'll refill about once a week."
595,,100,Power Clothes,Frozen,Making ,"Shouldn’t a dress made of ice be a bit unwieldy to move in? It looks like this was so finely crafted as to remove that problem entirely and add a little more on top. This outfit is a magical one in that it is able to form itself out of any element you can control or the four basic elements of fire, water, wind or earth. The clothes can take on any form of cloth that you wish and will look fantastic whatever you choose. The clothes, despite their material, will not be able to harm you or any other person."
596,,100,Winter Supplies,Frozen,Making ,Its Ice. Lots and lots of ice. And snow too. One might even say an unlimited amount of ice and show to be dispensed from your warehouse. What use might you have for an unlimited amount of ice and snow in a winter wonderland? The ice cutting business would probably pay a bunch of this high quality ice you have. Or you could use it to keep yourself cool even once summer comes around.
597,,100,"""Black Witch Garb""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""The purple garb of the witch Zulie, who intended to seduce Alva the Wayfarer, but eventually became his closest supporter, spending her entire life with him. It is said that Zulie the witch, who was never loved, nor loved anyone, experienced all manner of misfortune, and yet in the end, found her purpose in life."" A lightweight set of witch’s clothes, with low physical defenses and exceptional defenses against the elements and statuses, with only a slight vulnerability against bleeding. Comes with both the hat, symbolical of heretical magical crafts, and the veil, which Zulie used for travel and to hide her affiliation with witchcraft."
598,,100,"""Dragonhead Shield""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""This shield, as hard as a great boulder, is formed by the head of the descendant of an Archdragon. The Ringed Knights, by command of the gods, stood amongst the ranks who set out to slay the dragons, but their contributions were never lauded. "" An unusual shield in terms of construction, being made up of the head of a severed drake, coming in either greatshield or small shield form. Both versions of the shield are highly protective against fire, and when infused with magic power the shield is capable of invoking the dragon’s former strength. The smaller shield enables the dragon to breathe fire in an arc in front of the wielder, while the greatshield unleashes an omnidirectional roar that sends surrounding foes flying."
599,,100,"""Lothric War Banner”",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"“The flagpole that once carried the Lothric crest, and guided the knights long ago. The tip of the pole is fitted with a shapely pointed decoration, letting it serve as a spear."" An overall unremarkable pike, save for the weapon skill which allows the banner pole to be infused with magical energy and conjure an ethereal war banner that invigorates the attacking power of those who gather underneath it when the banner is waved in the air. A suspiciously similar enchantment to the one found on tridents associated with Seathe the Paledrake, perhaps indicating that the King of Lothric wished his knights to emulate even them."
600,,100,"""Canvas Talisman""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Medium for casting miracles of the Gods. Canvas talismans are austere items carried by heralds."" Although simple, it's a very powerful tool for casting Miracles, and helps focus the mind to cast them without faltering, even while under attack."
601,,100,"""Crystal Chime""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A sacred chime, once the possession of Gertrude, the Heavenly Daughter, and defiled by the scholars of the Grand Archives. The power of crystals granted the scholars a degree of success. In this case, their work enabled this chime to be suitable for casting both miracles and sorceries."" As it says above, this is one of the rare tools in this world capable of acting as a catalyst for both Sorcery and Miracles, drawing on both Faith and Intelligence, and it's quite strong at its job. The primary drawback of the bell is how weak ""Dark Sorcery Spells"" or ""Dark Miracles"" are with it, leaving those who practice these heretical disciplines looking elsewhere."
602,,100,"""Court Sorcerer's Staff"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"Catalyst used by the court sorcerers of the Profaned Capital. The court sorcerers laid claim to the legacy of the renowned Big Hat Logan, going so far as to emulate him with copies of the staff he used"" Although looking simple and baring no real secondary abilities, this humble piece of timber is one of the most powerful Sorcery catalysts you can find in these lands."
603,,100,"""Carthus Curved Greatsword""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Large curved sword wielded by swordsmen of Carthus."" The lightest of all weapons in its class, and possibly the longest to boot. This greatsword was crafted with the creation of deep, lacerating wounds in mind and it excels at it. Holds excellent potential for development."
604,,100,"""Astora Greatsword""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""This greatsword, bestowed only upon elite knights, is a relic of the ruined land of Astora. Designed for a focus on thrust attacks, this sword is hard and sharp, but not unusually heavy."" The lightest weapon in its class, Ultra Greatswords, but otherwise doesn't appear to be all that special. In truth, it has great hidden potential, and it's in your hands how to bring it out. (The weapon shines most when infused, excelling no matter which path it's pushed down.)"
605,,100,"""Hawk Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Ring associated with Hawkeye Gough, one of the Four Knights of Gwyn, the First Lord. In his later years, the giant Gough was blinded, but this did not prevent him from striking down a calamitous dragon with his Greatbow."" Imparts a mysterious ability on the wearer. Objects shot, tossed, thrown, lobbed or otherwise sent flying through the air by the wearer take longer before gravity starts trying to ground them. This effectively allows you to shoot/throw things at longer distances."
606,,100,"""Lingering Dragoncrest Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A special ring given to those who are deemed fit to undertake the journey of discovery in Vinheim, home of sorcery. Apropos to the Dragon School, the seal depicts an everlasting dragon. A lingering dragon symbolizes the true nature of the consummate sorcerer."" This ring greatly lengthens the duration of spells that actually have one for the caster who wears it. Contrary to the ring's ties to Sorcery, it works with any kind of spell, including those of Pyromancy and Miracles."
607,,100,"""Ring of the Sun's First Born""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Ring of the Sun's first born, who inherited the light of Gwyn, the first lord. The Sun's first born was once a god of war, until he was stripped of his stature  as punishment for his foolishness. No wonder his very name has slipped from the annals of history."" This ring greatly empowers the Miracles cast by the wearer."
608,,100,"""Sage’s Ring” ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"“A ring given to Farron's Undead Legion by one of the preacher twins, known more commonly as the Crystal Sages."" The sorcerers of Farron's Abyss Watchers were known to be lonesome warriors who would only rely upon more pragmatic spells.” While worn, this ring can significantly reduce the casting time of spells cast by the wearer."
609,,100,"""Bellowing Dragoncrest Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A special ring given to those who are deemed fit to undertake the journey of discovery in Vinheim, home of sorcery. Apropos to the Dragon School, the seal depicts an everlasting dragon. A bellowing dragon symbolizes the true nature of the consummate sorcerer."" Greatly empowers Sorcery spells cast by the wearer."
610,,100,"""Alluring Skulls""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A skull resplendent in the scent of souls. Prepared by evangelists of the Cathedral of the Deep. "" A glowing, crystaline skull that glows blue from the weak souls trapped inside of it. When thrown the skull shatters, unleashing these frail souls into the air and attracting those with a hunger for them, or those who are merely attracted to shiny objects. Although they’re not effective against all foes soul hungry Undead and beasts are usually weak to its alluring scent, distracting them quite well."
611,,100,"""Knight’s Crossbow""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Crossbow used by the proud knights of Lothric. It bears an elaborate gold design. The crossbow has been blessed with the power of lightning, in anticipation of the use of Lightning Bolts."" This crossbow, blessed by the High Priestess in a similar manner to the shields carried by her guards, has low overall damage due to the gold used in its design. However, when used in conjunction with Lightning Bolts, which are artifacts from the dragonless era where the pact between gods and humans was upheld, the crossbow greatly amplifies the lightning damage that the bolts are able to inflict. This crossbow comes with a quiver of bolts, which will replenish slowly overtime, refilling in a day when emptied."
612,,100,"""Crucifix of the Mad King""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A cross spear hung with a malformed corpse. Once, a mad king was born to the pygmy royalty and Shira, knight of Filianore, put him to rest. But Shira’s cross spear, unable to kill the undying king, only pinned itself to him. Shira delivered them together to the darkroom, where she stayed and held them close."" A dark halberd that can also be used as a club, this crucifix deals innate dark damage and that can be increased further with dark weapon reinforcements, making for a surprisingly powerful dark weapon. By slamming the malformed corpse hanging from the halberd into the ground it can be briefly awoken, and then filleted to trigger one of three effects. The first causes the corpse to roar, creating a blast of power that covers your front and side. The second is a blessing which temporarily raises resistance to damage and sturdiness. The final effect is a vexation, and potentially harmful to the wielder as it spawns a floating sphere of dark power that explodes after a few seconds."
613,,100,"""Sacred Chime of Filianore""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A sacred chime blessed by Princess Filianore, matriarch of the church. Filianore’s favor knows no boundaries, and this sacred chime expands the range of vicinity- affecting miracles that heal, cure, or provide other enhancements."" A great catalyst for support miracles thanks to its range-extending effect making even a simple healing spell capable of affecting multiple people at once, the chime can also be rung in order to provide a brief call of favor to Filianore, providing slight restoration of health over time. It’s otherwise a pretty standard catalyst, albeit a rare one as it was created before Princess Filianore entered her eternal slumber."
614,,100,"""Ordained Set""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Garb of Friede, Sister of the Painted World. A light blue dress sewn with thin fabric. After renouncing everything, Friede discovered a people that she wished to protect, and assumed the precise form that they yearned for."" Like many mage robes this set has low-overall defenses, especially against physical attacks, but relatively high protection against elemental damage due to the magic that has suffused its fibers. Its only real weakness other than that is bleeding, though fire is also slightly more effective than other elements- perhaps due to Friede’s own nature as Ash working against her."
615,,100,"""Drakeblood Armor"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Armor of the Drakeblood Knights, worshippers of the blood of dragons. The red cloth is said to symbolize their yearning for blood. Dragon worship has captured the hearts and minds of warriors across the lands for many ages. Perhaps such warriors are attracted to doctrines of few words."" Form fitting armor, well rounded protection with notable resistance to blades and getting cut in any fashion. On the downside, it's pretty heavy, and dense, which may interfere with precision of movement."
616,,100,"""Saint Tree Bellvine""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Sacred chime for casting miracles of the Gods. A bellvine cut from a small saint-tree that has been meticulously tended to."" While not the strongest chime, the Saint-Tree Bellvine focuses the mind, allowing one to pull on the power of Miracles faster than other chimes."
617,,100,"""Evangelist Garb""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"“Robe of an evangelist sent from the cathedral. These teachers, all women, came to enlighten inhabitants of the Undead Settlement and sent carriers on the path of sacrifice.” A bulky set chainmail, leather and cloth armor/clothing. It offers good, rounded out protection at only moderate weight, but due to its many layers can impede movement a bit."
618,,100,"""White Hair Talisman""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Talisman made from a lock of white hair. This lock of hair belonged to a deformed member of the chaos witches, mothers of the art of pyromancy."" This talisman enables the wielder to cast both miracles and pyromancies without need of a Pyromancy Flame. It is a tool of utility first-most however, and a proper Pyromancy Flame or Talisman would be better at their respective jobs."
619,,100,"""Black Iron Armor""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Armor made of black iron, from the set of armor for which Knightslayer Tsorig was infamously known."" Its extreme weight compared to other sets of armor means it impairs of the movement of most, but in return it offers incredible protection, especially against flame."
620,,100,“Budding Green Blossoms”,Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Green flower-shaped weed with small white blooms. Flowers of the Green Blossom are ethereal, blossoming only on the surface of chilled, but not frozen, water.” Purchasing this grants you a small bag with several bundles of Budding Green Blossoms. The plants act as a powerful energy supplement when consumed, filling the consumer with energy and an incredible font of stamina for a short time. Does not replace sleep. The bag refills over time when a bundle is consumed, taking an hour for each bundle. Additionally, the plants can be cultivated if planted in good soil near chilled water."
621,,100,“Fire Witch Armor”,Dark Souls 3,Making ,"“The witches who lead the Pontiff's Knights were originally ordained as holy knights. It was not long however, before their hearts were swallowed by the Profaned Flame.” This armor is quite stylish with the large plume of black cloth around the waist. It offers fairly balanced protection against a variety of threats, but leaves the wearer notably vulnerable to lightning and blunt force trauma."
622,,100,"""Dark Hand"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Weapon that allows its wielder to evoke an art unique to Londor, the land of the Hollow. It is also said to be an ancient relic of a Primordial Serpent."" A red, wriggling mass that fuses with the hand when squeezed. The weapon can be used to suck the vital essence out of an enemy via a solid grip, healing the wielder in the process. Can also be used to project a small, weak shield of energy in times of desperation. Simply will it out when you wish to ""unequip"" it."
623,,100,"""Old Wolf Curved Sword"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Curved sword bearing the soul of the old wolf that stays with the Watchdogs of Farron."" It appears as a great scimitar with two large spikes on the back, like the fangs of a wolf. It seems to be growing fur. While this blade is being wielded or on someone's person, consecutive successful attacks on an enemy will begin to heal you and trigger a temporary small empowered state. The style of fighting employed by the Undead Legion, like a wolf on the prowl, feels natural with this sword."
624,,100,"""Farron Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A ring given to Undead Legion of Farron. The Abyss Watchers, for their hunting, required a sword technique that went beyond any existing art. Wolf's blood provided just that, and this ring further extends the effect."" Noticeably aids with conserving the power of the soul when performing weapon techniques that can exhaust it."
625,,100,"""Skull Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""One of Courland’s transposed wonders. Derived from the soul of a Soulfeeder. The Soulfeeder was a beast that insatiably absorbed souls to feed its own power. Even after its accursed corpse was burned, it is said that the pungent stench of souls left the air permanently stained."" A brass ring inlaid with a hexagonal, crystalline gem inscribed with an image of a skull, reminiscent of the face of the creature the ring was created from. Wearing the ring causes it to unleash the pungent scent of the Soulfeeder, making it easier for the wearer to be spotted by their enemies and oftentimes increasing their aggression, as well. A seemingly useless trinket in most cases, the ring is useful for diverting attention away from weaker cooperators."
626,,100,"""Priestess Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A ring engraved with a portrait of the High Priestess. In Lothric, the High Priestess has long been considered one of the Three Pillars of the king's rule. The High Priestess also served as the prince's wet nurse."" When worn, can empower abilities that rely on some measure of belief or faith such as Miracles or Pyromancy."
627,,100,Dragon Acolyte’s Mask ,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“A bizarre white hood and mirror-like golden mask. The two pieces are attached to one another, allowing one to simply slide it over their head. The mask and hood bestow a strange capacity for self-manipulation while worn, allowing trance-like states where incredible focus, temporary loss of morality may be achieved while worn. Although it allows one to control their minds spectacularly, it does nothing to compensate for where a man or woman is lacking. Those who remove it will often feel as if their mind was not entirely their own.”"
628,,100,Royal Soldier’s Ring,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“A black iron signet ring depicting the helmet of a knight. It greatly lessens the burden of one’s equipment for as long as its worn, allowing one to more easily remain mobile and vigilant even while carrying around heavy armor and armaments.”"

This simple machine bestows the drake’s tail with two metal spikes that can further weaponize the drake’s powerful tail swings and help them punch through armored foes like knights."
632,,100,“Giant Bones”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Massive bones belonging to long dead giants. They’re surprisingly resilient despite the wear of age, and when gnawed they sharpen and strengthen one’s fangs. Along with the fangs, so too do the jaws become stronger. New bones can be found in your warehouse when any of them become gnawed beyond recognition."
633,,100,“White Titanite Slab”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A White Titanite Slab, relic of the nameless blacksmith god. White Titanite has some kind of mysterious, intimate connection with divinity. This slab rejuvenates over time when broken, or replaces itself if used entirely. A knowledgeable smith can use it to craft, reinforce or transform weapons or armor with Divine properties that are the bane of the dead or, in a strange twist, Occult weapons that are the bane of divinity. Those who continue research may yet find new depths to the bizarre properties of this material."
634,,100,“Hawk Ring”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"One of the special rings granted to the four knights of Gwyn. The Hawk Ring belonged to Hawkeye Gough, a giant who led Gwyn’s archers to shoot down dragons. This ring causes arrows to fly farther and true, as if projected with even more force than your body could possibly produce. This makes long distance shots much easier."
635,,100,“Chaos Flame Ember” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A twisted ember once used in ancient rites before taking this form during the fall of Izalith. A flame ember infused with the power of chaos. A smith well versed in this land’s crafting techniques would be able to create or transform preexisting equipment into demonic variants containing the power of chaos flames. Chaos weapons and armor are imbued with flame similar to items forged with a flame ember, but more twisted and become even more potent the stronger the wielder’s connection to darkness."
636,,100,“Pinwheel’s Masks”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Masks of the dreadful necromancer, Pinwheel. The masks bestowed upon you are the Valiant Father, the Kindly Mother and the Naïve Child. The Mask of the Father fills the wearer with strength. The Mask of the Mother fills the wearer with vitality. The Mask of the Child fills the wearer with energy. Only one may be worn at a time, unless you had multiple heads of course."
637,,100,“Dark Moon Talisman” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Talisman given to every Blade of the Dark Moon upon proving their loyalty to Gwyndolin and the covenant’s just cause. It’s an incredibly potent tool for calling upon the might of Miracles, but only for those who have great and sincere faith in something like the concept of justice, the gods or a personally held belief."
638,,100,“Dark Ember”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"An ember burning with a mystical flame with black, occult properties. The ember is able to aid a skilled smith in granting objects Occult abilities. Occult equipment is detrimental to gods, weapons being the bane of divinity while armor and shields carry potent resistances to the holy powers that be. There is a reason such a dark thing was banished to the painted world."
639,,100,“Velka’s Talisman”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A tuft of black hair belonging to Velka, Goddess of Sin, woven into a Talisman. Due to heretical properties, it channels Miracles with intelligence instead of faith. Disbelievers with remarkable intelligence are able to match faithful followers of the gods in their use of Miracles with this Talisman. Better Talismans in the hands of the true zealots still reign at the top though."
640,,100,“Scales of Challenge”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Not dragon scales, but the literal object used to weigh things against each other, only this one is large and made of stone. When organizing wagers and offering something to the scales, it measures not only the actual weight but what it’s worth. When a wager is settled, it also aids in making sure the wager is honored and the loser actually hands over what they bet. Only helps with physical objects being bet."
641,,100,“Enchanted Ember”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Ancient magical ember of the land of Oolacile. Born from some manner of lost Sorcery, the flame produced by this enclosed ember is able to change equipment into an ‘Enchanted’ state in the hands of a knowledgeable smith. Enchanted equipment becomes imbued with the magical nature of the soul while losing some physical substance. Equipment is empowered by wielders/wearers with strong minds or souls as a result. Weapons gain an ethereal quality that causes them to behave somewhat like magic even with a physical form, while armor tends to have excellent defense against magic."
642,,100,“Red Titanite Slab” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A Red Titanite Slab, rare relic of a nameless blacksmith god. This form of titanite is aligned with fire, and like the others available, slowly rejuvenates itself when broken or used. Using Red Titanite, one can improve or create equipment aligned with fire and heat. The more something is improved with titanite, the more titanite it eventually needs to be further improved."
643,,100,“Large Flame Ember”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A large, magical flame contained in a clay box. Odd in that it emphasizes the power of flame more than even other flames, it is able to kindle likened power in other things. In the hands of a capable smith, it is able to make equipment aligned with fire, or transform equipment into something aligned with fire. Armor with this alignment better protects the wearer from flame, while weapons brandish burning intensity that can set foes alight."
644,,100,“Lloyd’s Talismans” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A bundle of Lloyd’s Talismans in a pack that refills over time. Lloyd’s Talismans are a tool utilized by Lloyd’s cleric knights during their undead hunts. On impact when tossed, they burst in a white cloud that blocks undead caught in it from healing for a short time. It is also able to put abominable creatures such as mimics into a deep sleep, leaving them relaxed and vulnerable. Striking them will wake them right back up though, albeit leaving them groggy."
645,,100,“Large Divine Ember”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A potent, mystical white flame with divine properties. Usually reserved for black smiths of the church, it has somehow found its way into your possession. A smith would be able to forge divine equipment with it. Divine weapons notably have the property of being extra effective against the undead, and necromantic constructs tend to crumble, being unable to called back up once destroyed by a divine weapon."
646,,100,“Blue Titanite Slab”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A slab of Blue Titanite, a magic aligned form of Titanite. As with the other slabs on offer, it will rejuvenate when broken, or replace itself when used in its entirety. Because of the nature of the material, it’s used for reinforcing or creating all manner of magical equipment that interacts with the power of the soul. Weapons tend to be better at tearing through normal armor, armor tends to be better at defending against spells and other forms of magic."
647,,100,“Channeler’s Trident” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Signature weapon of Seath’s Channelers, a three-pronged trident. Each tip is sharpened to the point that those who inspect could see the madness in the owner. When thrust into the air in circular motions as part of a martial dance, nearby allies will have their blood lust rush to the surface, invigorating them for a fight."
648,,100,“Sunlight Talisman”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A duplicate of Solaire of Astora’s Talisman. The Knight of Sunlight’s illustration of the holy sun can even be found proudly adorning it. Used for casting Miracles, those with considerable faith will not be able to find a more potent symbol of faith. Such is the unwavering praise Solaire has for the lord of the sun."
649,,100,“Very Large Ember” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A magical ember and flame of incredible quality, kept in an ornate clay box. Although it is similar to the bonfire you’re used to tending, it is of entirely different use. The legendary smiths would be able to use something like this in their craft to create or reinforce weapons of legendary quality for these lands. It seems to stay perpetually aflame no matter how much time passes with it in your possession."
650,,100,“Bandit’s Knife” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Though called a knife, the lethal curved blade is long enough to possibly be considered a short sword, one the perfect size for slaying men. Short and mobile enough to quickly slip it between the enemy’s ribs, the perfect shape to cause deep lacerations with each slash. Whether quick or slow, this is an implement of death."
651,,100,“Titanite Slab” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Titanite Slabs, incredible material of the gods, heirlooms of a nameless blacksmith deity who forged weapons for the other gods during life. This Titanite Slab rejuvenates over time when broken, or replaces itself in a few days when completely spent, appearing in your warehouse. The most common form of Titanite, useful most of the time. Normal Titanite has no special alignment, allowing it to be used to make/reinforce equipment that are fine against all manner of enemies where other forms are usually used for more specialized equipment."
652,,100,“Armor & Weapon Smithboxes” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Two wooden toolboxes filled with a wide variety of sturdy tools. For those who know how to actually use them, these tools would allow for one to craft, repair or reinforce armor or weapons they might have, the only thing needed being a flame of some kind."
653,,100,“Introductory Equipment” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"For those with at least mostly human body types and sizes, you receive a useful boon in the form of some free equipment consisting of weapons and armor. There are nine sets to choose from, the Warrior, the Knight, the Wanderer, the Thief, the Bandit, the Hunter, the Sorcerer, the Pyromancer and the Cleric. The Knight is notable for having the best, yet heaviest armor, the most well-made shield and a broadsword. Warrior, Wanderer, Thief, Bandit and Hunter all have varying forms of leather armor. Warrior has a longsword and the best shield of this group. Wanderer has a curved sword and a poor leather shield. Thief has a dagger and a small shield used more for parrying than blocking. The Bandit has a battle axe and the spider shield which diverts poison well. The hunter has a short sword and poor wooden shield, but also receives a bow and quiver of arrows. Sorcerer, Pyromancer and Cleric all have cloth armor with inherent resistances to the forces associated with them (magic for Sorcerer, fire and poison for Pyromancer, lightning for Cleric). Sorcerer’s set has a knife, a small leather shield and a basic Sorcery Catalyst. Pyromancer has a hand axe, broken shield and a Pyromancy Flame. Cleric has a mace, wooden shield and Miracle Talisman. Additional sets after the first will cost 100CP. (For additional details on what any one set offers, you may consult the wiki. The sets above correspond to the weaponry and armor belonging to the starting classes.)

654,,100,“Bonfire Creation” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"The ultimate duty of the Firekeeper, to kindle and oversee their bonfire for the benefit of travelers and the world itself, offering light and warmth in dark times. This perk allows you to create bonfires, small flames that slowly rejuvenate the body and soul of those who rest near them. Yes, even undead see these benefits despite their cursed nature. Building one is as simple as stacking the bones of the dead, adding a bit of humanity and kindling it with a small spark produced from focus. In a puff, the flames will go up and continue to burn softly, transforming to resemble other bonfires complete with poker. The flame of your bonfire will endure through harsh weather, time away from it and can continue burning as long as you semi-regularly supply it a bit of humanity. It’s also good for warding off mindless monsters and wild beasts, somewhat at least."
655,,100,Tachi & Wakizashi,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,"Twin blades, one a long sword without a guard, and the other is a short sword. The way they appear is like the maw of a beast clamping down. While there is a more dignified dual sword style that is famous in history for its eccentric founder, these blades feel as if they’re meant for a wilder wielder. They’re unbreakable and immune to rust."
656,,100,Katana,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,The classic blade often carried by most swordsman. Lightweight and easy to wield. It can even be used easily for assassination just as well as a tanto. The most balanced blade for ease of use and effectiveness. Unbreakable and immune to rust.
657,,100,Nodachi & Greatbow,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,"A large blade with a long reach. Its weight makes it unwieldy for most warriors to use, but mastering it is well worth it. It’s unbreakable and immune to rest as well. If a katana could be described as a fang, then a nodachi would be the serrated claw. You also get a fairly large bow the size of yourself. Do not be fooled by its size, it can be used in close combat much like a short bow, if necessary, with deadly effect."
658,,100,Fistful of Ash ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,A pouch that seems to contain an infinite amount of ash. It could be used to distract a foe or to create a smokescreen.
659,,100,Shikomizue,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,"A sword disguised as a cane, or perhaps some other form of hidden blade. It’s unbreakable and immune to rust. People assume the worst of strangers, and in this case, they rightly have cause for suspicion if you ever surprise someone with this."
660,,100,Victorian Wardrobe(100),Bloodborne,Making ,"“Befitting the era this place was themed upon, offered here is an extensive wardrobe that’s larger on the inside and already filled. Clothes that would allow you to blend in, show off, or aid in more dangerous endeavors can be found within. 

For 100BE, the wardrobe is filled with normal Victorian era style clothing. From the outfits the common man or woman would wear, to the finer garments of the upper-class. You will also receive one armor set worn by the locals of your choice. "
661,,100,Numbing Mist Satchel,Bloodborne,Making ,"“A bag of ten ""Numbing Mist"" bottles. ""Said to be used by the blood hunters of Cainhurst, its recipe is a secret closely guarded by the line of nobles inhabiting the castle."" 

When the bottle is broken, a cloud of mist forms from the contents that temporarily numbs the life essence of those who touch it; a poetic way of saying it retards healing. The bag replenishes its bottles over time, at a rate of one per hour.”"
662,,100,Explosive Bundle,Bloodborne,Making ,"“A box with a handle full of fire bombs of varying kinds: five Molotov Cocktails, five Rope Molotovs, five Delayed Molotovs, and five Delayed Rope Molotovs. 

Molotov Cocktails are readied and used as you would expect, exploding in a plume of flame after breaking. Rope Molotovs are much the same, but with a bit of rope attached for ease in throwing. 

Delayed Molotovs are more complex fire bombs engineered by the Oto Workshop, with blades that allow them to be lodged in a target, and a timing mechanism that causes them to be blown up several seconds after impact. Delayed Rope Molotovs are much the same, just with some rope attached. 

The box will replenish spent bombs at a rate of one per type an hour and capping at five per type. ""Spent"" bombs are those that have been tossed at enemies and blown up, meaning you can't simply hand them out to allies and stockpile them.”"
663,,100,Augur of Ebrietas,Bloodborne,Making ,"“Use phantasms, the invertebrates known to be the augurs of the Great Ones, to partially summon abandoned Ebrietas. The Augur is a powerful tool in the hands of those trained to use it, and continues to function even if its contracted master is ‘indisposed.’ 

Requiring only one bullet’s worth of blood to use, the Auger of Ebrietas summons forth tendrils that rush forward, crashing against anything in its way. Not incredibly powerful by itself, but scales upwards with the Arcane potency of its user.” "
664,,100,Beast Roar,Bloodborne,Making ,"“A beast's claw converted into a Hunter's Tool by the hunter called Irreverent Izzy. Taking two bullets worth of blood to use, the hunter will borrow the strength of the terrible undead darkbeasts, if only for a moment, to blast surrounding foes back with a powerful roar. 

This roar can also deflect projectiles if timed correctly, even small boulders, but it doesn't really work with anything much heavier than that. The indescribable sound is broadcast with the caster's own vocal cords, which begs the question, what terrible things lurk deep within the frames of men?”"
665,,100,Gifts from the Little Ones,Bloodborne,Making ,"“To make sure you’re ready for the hunt, you are given a choice of one of three trick melee weapons, and one of two projectile weapons. The two weapons of your choosing will appear in your possession after beginning your journey. 

The first trick weapon you may choose is the Saw Cleaver; a saw with large teeth that can flip open to be wielded similarly to a sword. Saws are common amongst hunters for the grisly wounds they leave. 

The second is the Hunter's Axe; a large hand axe with a handle that can be extended so it may be wielded with two hands. It’s a sturdy weapon, reliable in the hands of the strong. 

The third trick weapon is the threaded cane; a sturdy metal cane that can transform into a bladed chain whip. It takes skill to wield the threaded cane, but allows the hunter to strike at great range. 

The first projectile weapon is the Hunter Pistol; a quick, simple, high damage weapon that's handy at short to medium range. This pistol is ideal for close range precision against agile enemies. 

The second projectile weapon is the Blunderbuss; a heavier weapon that fires a wide spread, effective at close ranges, against small groups of enemies. A bit more cumbersome, but easy to use. 

For an additional 100BE each, you may pick additional weapons from the ones listed above, spending a maximum of 300BE to collect everything listed. The choice is yours.”

666,,100,Ring of Magical Dullness,Demon's Souls,Making ,"A soft ring bearing a light green seal made by Geri, a friend of Sage Freke; when worn the user’s defense against magic is increased but at a cost to their magical attack power."
667,,100,Sticky White Stuff,Demon's Souls,Making ,"​A sticky, white, wax-like substance. When applied to a weapon it causes it to shine bright and inflict magical damage upon the target. Has enough for four uses, slowly refills one per hour. Also comes with a nice vial."
668,,100,Throwing Knives,Demon's Souls,Making ,​An infinite supply of throwing knives. Doesn’t do much damage but makes for a decent hold-out weapon.
669,,100,Ed’s Grindstone,Demon's Souls,Making ,"A sharpening stone used by the Black smith of Stonefang, Ed. When used on a weapon it restores its durability and reduces the wear and tearonit. You get enough for 5 uses a day."
670,,100,Turpentine,Demon's Souls,Making ,"Resin collected from a pinetree. Amazingly when applied to weapons it covers it on fire for a minute. You get a small pouch of them that has enough for 4 uses per day. For an extra 50CP ​the turpentine was harvested from a black pinetree, making the flame much stronger."
671,,100,Sacred Seals and Staffs(100),Elden Ring,Making ,"There are some who claim faith is not so different from scholarship, though both sorcerers and saints would beg to differ. Regardless, with each investment here you may purchase mystical implements that allow mortals to wield either sorcery or incantations. From the twisted,crimson dragon communion seal that enhances incantations obtained from that practice to a staff of pure crystal fashioned by the Crystallians, any non-unique magic implement can be purchased with this option here.

672,,100,Jar Cannon ,Elden Ring,Making ,"It seems there was a mixup in munition deliveries, because you’ve somehow come into ownership of an experimental firearm intended for the assault on the Volcano Manor. Shaped like a vase with horizontal handles, it lets out a blast of tremendous power to everything in front of the wielder but is slow to reload. While not particularly attuned to any attribute, it can still be upgraded with smithing stones and enchanted like any weapon in this land."
673,,100,Grafted Dragon,Elden Ring,Making ,"You’re a morbid one, and cruel aren’t you? Who else would seize the remnant of a dragon’s power in its severed head to wield as a weapon? Apart from being a dreadful but effective bludgeon the dragon head mounted on a curved handle flickers with a fragment of life, and with a gesture can be bidden to spray flames over a wide area.

This item can be repurchased three more times, if for some reason you are willing to temporarily trade the use of your arms and legs to have dragon heads attached to them. Or if you or someone you know have four arms. But honestly, what are the chances you could run into someone like that?

The urumi, a weapon of the Night Warriors made of extremely thin, flexible blades that can also be straightened into a spear. And the thorned whip, a crimson scourge once used by the Fire Monks for self-flagellation that is very effective at spilling blood. One of these or other similar weapons can be yours with each purchase here.

675,,100,Basilisk Hide,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Making,"​This is a cool piece of wear. Black or a very dark green in color, it’s a
trench coat that goes down to just below your knees, as long as you’re between four to ten feet
in height. Extremely resistant to all magic but your own, it can turn into a suit of armor at will,
losing none of the effectiveness.
Aside from being extremely light and easy to move in, this comes with a full array of
enchantments, including expansion charms on the internal pockets, cooling and warming spells,
and durability spells that boost its already great durability, equivalent to about five or six layers
of kevlar, by several orders of magnitude. You could brush off a point blank tank shell in this
thing. Or the magical equivalent, for that matter."
676,,100,Extended Mokeskin Pouch,Harry Potter,Making ,A pouch that can only be opened by the owner. There is as much space inside for storage as there needs to be. Opening is around 25cm2
677,,100,Dragon-hide Jacket,Harry Potter,Making ,A Jacket made of dragon-hide that reflects minor spells. Makes you look pretty cool. You’ll grow into it.
678,,100,Sneakoscope,Harry Potter,Making ,A spinning top that alerts the owner to any nearby untrustworthy behaviour by whistling and spinning. This one is special and only goes off when untrustworthy behaviour you’d actually want to be alerted to occurs around you.
679,,100,Nimbus 2000,Harry Potter,Making ,A state of the art racing broom that won’t be obsolete for an entire year. You get permission to have a broom at Hogwarts despite being a first year.
680,,100,Baking,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Making ,"There are machines that can create hundreds of donuts an hour but they are nothing like what you can do. Without magic you can create almost magically delicious breads, pastries and cakes and with magic you can do the same thing but it takes no more time than a flick of your wand as long as you have the ingredients."
681,,100,Prying Blade  ,MtG - Ixalan,Making ,"A plunderer’s best friend. This blade is enchanted and functional as a bladed weapon, but it shines as a tool for looting - the blade designed and mystically proficient at ripping gold and gems off of structures, or perhaps statues...and it’s a particularly good crowbar and shovel in the bargain. It can even be precise enough to hook and scrape jewels or gold off of individual pieces of armor or weaponry, if some maniac in jeweled armor were to charge at you."
682,,100,Hierophant's Chalice ,MtG - Ixalan,Making ,"A silver goblet, this cup is often used in ceremonies by the priests of the Dusk Legion - importantly, blood kept in this goblet never stagnates and is instantly sanctified, allowing it to easily be used for any rites such as healing, empowerment,or for the sacraments of making a new Vampire."
683,,100,Strider Harness ,MtG - Ixalan,Making ,"A harness designed for the dinosaurs of this land, it is enchanted to be capable of fitting any wild beast, and if placed on such a beast, allows the rider to stay atop the creature even in the roughest of riding. "
684,,100,Traveler's Amulet ,MtG - Ixalan,Making ,"A strange amulet found by an explorer and given to you from their fallen body, this amulet acts as a “skeleton key” for magical maps and traps, allowing you to fully present yourself as belonging and giving access...though it’s no good against actual locks requiring mechanical use."
685,,100,Weaponry ,MtG - Amonkhet,Making ,A finely made local weapon of your choosing that will never need maintenance and will reappear in your warehouse a week after destruction.
686,,100,Witch’s Oven,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making ,"A wicked-looking stone oven, it uses a mystical green fire to instantly cook and prepare whatever ingredients are put inside to a perfect temperature...living ingredients are instantly transformed into scrumptious food, and the flesh of humans and fae provide the most wonderful meals this oven can produce."
687,,100,Glass Casket,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making ,"A crystalline case, this casket is see-through...but not intended for corpses. It is instead meant to keep the living in a slumbering faerie sleep, allowing one to stay in a safe state of ageless stasis, especially if they were ill or cursed - a way to keep them safe until their true love comes to save them, presumably."
688,,100,Weapon Rack,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making ,"A common sight on the Burning Yard of Embereth, this rack contains a number of well made weapons of dwarven design, swords, axes, spears, and lances aplenty, each weighted and reinforced enough to be capable of bringing even tough hide low with a strong enough blade hand"
689,,100,Shining Armor,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making ,"There are those who prefer their heroes in dented and beaten armor, showing endurance and survival. But the people of Eldraine adore a knight in gleaming chain and plate, a heroic figure fresh and ready to fight. You have a set of durable armor, shimmering and ever-cleansing, capable of repairing itself in minutes after taking a hefty blow and self-polishing to a mirror sheen. You might even be able to dazzle someone with such a flashy display..."
690,,100,Mighty Carver,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making ,"The faeries, beasts, and witches like to heckle society and order, deriding it as a weakening force that makes the average peasant soft and vulnerable. Laugh they might, yet walls, blades, bows and shields drive them back to their pits all the same. The might of the Realm is in those who build - those like you. Stonemason, blacksmith, wood-carver, you are someone who can work steel, stone, and metal for whatever your mind devises with great prowess."
691,,100,Kitesail,MtG - Zendikar,Making ,"A rather rudimentary parasail consisting of simple wooden frame, vaguely resembling a bird if seen from above while flying. While simple in design, making use of a kitesail is an art form, requiring an understanding of the varied currents of the wind that can go from near nothing to lethally turbulent. Still the utility of being able to fly cannot be underestimated."
692,,100,IZZET GUILDMAGE,MtG - Ravnica,Making ,"Izzet mages have to be quick thinking and smart, otherwise there’s a genuine chance they’ll get fried by their own experiments! Luckily for you, you’re both of these. With a mind geared towards electronics and machinery, you could easily fit in with the Izzet, and would find it trivial to improvise and construct things on the spot, though with all the ideas in your head, you’ll have to be careful with the results. As a bonus, you can conduct electricity. No need to worry about electric shocks any more!"
693,,100,Accorder’s Shield,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making ,"The shield of the Ashioks from the Razor Fields, polished to a mirror sheen on both sides, so one may watch foes coming from behind as well. Perhaps one of the few of its kind to survive the war, this particular shield seems to hold strong even against fierce assault, requiring minimal maintenance and always maintaining its mirrored sheen."
694,,100,Things Lost To Time ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making ,"When one seeks to truly understand the world and all things within it one must look to the Kami first of all, for it is they that know the most about it. It is for that reason that the Order of Jukai, and to a lesser extent the Imperial Army will seek training from the Kami in order to get a little closer to the long forgotten past. Earning that training however, can be more than a little difficult. To that extent, you are quite exceptional at integrating yourself into the affairs of the Kami, usually by performing the acts of a servant. Tending to their shrine first and foremost, but also any smaller tasks that they may require. You have the training roughly equivalent to a miko, or shrine maiden, which outside of an unusual amount of talent at sucking up to divinity, also grants you an acceptable level of skill with a weapon of your choice - or even your fists if you so choose - and the ability to create talismans that encapsulate small portions of your Kami’s power so that it might be used later. "
695,,100,Weapons Of Mass Distraction ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making ,"Everyone has to start somewhere, and it seems that you found yours with the creation of toys, puzzles, and other idle distractions. Your hands are dextrous, your fingers are well suited to fine details, and your mind can create and solve puzzles with ease. Perhaps you’ll carve a wooden maze to roll a small ball around in, or use a blacksmith's hammer to smash a small wind up toy into existence. Regardless of your preferred method of crafting, you’ll find that turning it to these ends comes naturally to you, requiring barely any additional effort and often less to turn your talents from forging weapons of war and towards more playful endeavours. "
696,,100,Tools of the Trade,MtG - Kamigawa,Making ,"Those who walk the path without a guide must cut their own path into the world. This is a large selection of odds and ends that would help the weary soul but looking deeper one can find things that are just out of place. A sword as long as you are tall, a series of plates in otherwise mundane clothes, a selection of poisons so powerful they can take down even oni. Just who or what these things are for is up to you, but this is more than just some mere wanderer’s tools. These are the Tools of the Trade, links to an art of murder as old as factions and politics."
697,,100,A Well Worn Jette,MtG - Kamigawa,Making ,"A very useful sword breaker, sometimes used as a badge of office by some. This one has a very sharp tip and is nigh unbreakable by mundane means, though even if it broke you’d find it whole and well maintained the next day."
698,,100,Mad Genius ,MtG - Innistrad,Making ,"Ludevic and Geralf are the names generally associated with scientific curiosity in these lands, and with them as examples... it's no wonder people are sceptical. You now stand among these mad alchemists, able to craft horrors from the most basic of materials."
699,,100,Arms and Armor,Warbreaker,Making ,"High quality armor and a sword or other melee weapon. Self-cleaning, maintaining and repairing."
700,,100,Ichor-Alcohol ,Warbreaker,Making ,"A liquid preservative, that is great for making Lifeless who do not decay, and can be animated with a single Breath. You get a bottomless casket."
701,,100,Class II Preparation,Warbreaker,Making ,"You know how to distill ichor-alcohol, prepare a corpse for one-Breath animation and oversee Lifeless, and sew them up when they get damaged."
702,,100,CAGE ,Wolfwalkers,Making ,A cage from which no one can escape without outside assistance.
703,,100,Sanguineous Razor ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making ,"A straight razor. This simple, easily concealed weapon is enchanted with a special property, which causes the wounds it inflicts to heal slowly and leave behind scars that will never fade. This item may be imported into a similar weapon."
704,,100,Bespoke’s Best,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making ,"Ghastly Bespoke is many things, but he’s best known for his immense skill as a tailor. With this purchase, you now own a closet full of Bespoke’s finest tailor-made suits, all made to match your size perfectly. Not only that, this closet includes suits made to fit any and all of your alt-forms. These clothes can protect you from impacts, cuts, punches, even gunshots and slight magic. If you have a specific outfit you want augmented with these properties, feel free to import it."
705,,100,Resolute Thread,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making ,"A spool of enchanted thread, magically enhanced so that it grows stronger when more pressure is applied to it. The greater the pressure, the stronger the thread becomes. Your spool contains twenty meters of thread, and you know the ritual to create more."
706,,100,Poisoned Needle ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Making ,"After the death of the current king of Heliohapt, his eldest son will take the throne. However, soon after a divine curse will sweep the land, causing the new king’s supporters to drop dead in the streets apparently at random. Of course, it will soon after be revealed that this was not a curse, but the work of talented poisoners in the employ courtiers trying to get the late king’s younger son installed on the throne. Still, the killings were incredibly effective and, even though they won’t come to pass for another few years, you’ve somehow got your hands on one of the murder weapons used in them.

This tiny needle is easily concealable and its tip seems to be permanently coated in a thin layer of an incredibly potent poison. The miniscule puncture wounds it causes are exceedingly subtle, requiring a thorough examination to find and, even then, they are likely to be mistaken for mosquito bites. Even in such a small wound, though, the poison is terrifyingly effective. Although it requires some time to take effect, it quickly acts on the victim’s heart and not only ceases its rhythms, but also causes no symptoms until right before their death, making it almost impossible to save someone afflicted with it. To any ordinary observer, it’ll appear as if the poison’s victim is perfectly healthy one moment, before suddenly collapsing and dying the next for no discernible reason. Fair warning, though: This needle can’t distinguish between friend or foe, so try not to prick yourself."
707,,100,Wand  ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Making ,"Wands are, as you might have guessed, the tools used by Magicians to focus their Magoi into spells. Without one, it becomes much more difficult to send orders to the Rukh – they’ll still be able to wield magic to an extent, but it’ll become a lot more unstable, unpredictable, and potentially dangerous to the caster. Powerful Magicians (such as those who take the 400 CP option of the perk) may not even need a wand, though most still choose to use one due to the benefits.

You now have a wand, which can take on any design or appearance you like, so long as it can be held in one hand and is rod-shaped. Perhaps yours looks like a thick, wooden stick more akin to a cudgel than a traditional wand, or maybe yours has an ornate, golden shaft tipped with a flawless ruby. No matter what you choose, the result is the same: A useful tool that helps you to focus your magic and attain far greater control over your spells."
708,,100,Spider Princess,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Making ,"Though members of the nobility are often expected to take part in warfare, few would dare risk their lives on the front lines – after all, why would they? Why send an important blue blood to flail their sword about and potentially get killed when one could just put ranks of conscripted peasants between them and the enemy? However,though often inept at conventional fighting, the weapon of choice for nobles waging war amongst each other is a lot more subtle – and potentially more deadly, too.

You’re an experienced hand at the art of poisoning, knowing just how to prepare a range of poisons with effects varying from paralysis to a slow, painful death. But just skilled at preparing poisons, but also using them, whether that be through envenomed daggers that affect anyone they so much as cut or the classic poisoned wine, prepared so well that the victim won’t be able to taste anything wrong and will have no idea of their impending demise until it’s too late."
709,,100,Waste Not ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Making ,"Few things live in the frigid wastes of the northern continent, the Imuchakk tribe know that each plant they grow, each animal they slaughter is invaluable. As such, they have become experts at making use of every part of what few commodities they have available to them, and now so have you. Whenever you slay a beast or harvest a plant, you know how best to use it so that nothing goes to waste. For example, if you hunt a wild beast for meat, you’ll have a good idea how to use the parts normally inedible as meat – its bones and horns could be used for crafting weaponry or, if large enough, structures; its skin and hair turned into clothing, rugs, and ropes; and its fat can be processed into oil."
710,,100,Royal Regalia ,Magi: Alma Torran,Making ,"Sure, you might be a mighty ruler whose name is known throughout the lands, but if you don’t look the part, nobody’s going to take you seriously. Any real king knows the importance of ostentatious displays of wealth, be it in lavish banquets or the way they dress, and as it happens, you’ve received a little something to help you with the latter.

What you’ve received here is a vast collection of the finest clothing and jewellery in all the lands, all made in Magi’s distinctive Arabian Nights-inspired aesthetic, from robes of the most expensive silks to rings and bracelets made from the rarest of precious metals and gemstones. If sold, you could likely earn a hefty fortune from the collection you’ve gathered, but not all of the pieces here are merely for show. A good number of them are moderately-powerful Magic Tools carrying useful enchantments, such as necklaces that can store Magoi for later, robes that confer a resistance to fire upon you, or rings which can be activated to cast a variety of minor spells. There’s nothing major here, but they’ll likely come in handy every once in a while."
711,,100,Mini-Staves ,Magi: Alma Torran,Making ,"When Solomon first spoke to the newly-liberated manticore tribe and told them of his desire to make all species equal, the chieftain of the manticores posed him a question: Could equality truly be possible if one species possessed an overwhelming advantage over all the others? While Solomon denied this, the chief had a point: The only way the non-humans could ever wield magic is by using a Divine Staff, and there were only a handful of such artefacts available, creating a significant imbalance in power.

While Solomon would eventually solve this problem by distributing the Rukh equally between all species, this here is another solution that doesn’t require restructuring the universe on a metaphysical level. Within this crate are a vast number of well-crafted metal rods, enough to equip a small army with, that are based on the Divine Staffs. While they are nowhere near as powerful as the originals, being a mere imitation, these staffs all have the curious property of allowing any non-human or otherwise magically-inept person who holds one to cast magic as if they were a Magician themselves.

Like the originals, though, these staffs would allow a non-Magician to wield only one type of magic. Of course, without a proper magical education, a wielder of one of these would be limited to only the most basic of spells, but that shouldn’t be too hard to sort out, right?"
712,,100,Sticky Stuff ,Magi: Alma Torran,Making ,"Back when humanity was still at the bottom of the food chain, one of the main predators that nearly drove them to extinction were the ogres. No, not those ogres, but tree-sized, headless humanoids with four arms and faces on their chests. The ogres were slow, though, and so relied on ensnaring their prey using sticks dipped in a sticky syrup.

Somehow, you’ve managed to get your hands on an unlimited supply of this strange, syrupy adhesive substance, stored in stoppered ceramic jars as large as a person. It’s incredibly sticky stuff, such that even the slightest touch will leave an average human inescapably caught, leaving them as trapped as a fly on a spider’s web so long as no one else tries to free them, and even then it’ll require a good deal of strength to pull them free."
713,,100,Immortal Breakers Employment Agency,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Making ,"Strictly speaking this name refers to a long defunct mercenary group composed of Valkenhayn R. Hellsing and Relius Clover. They tried to kill Clavis Alucard, and Valkenhayn somehow ended up as his butler. Regardless, as a Bystander Clavis was forever moving through proxies and hiring mercenaries. This will assist you in doing just that. As a fighter of some kind, it will act as a quest board, and fill up with worthy causes and whatnot. As a planner, it’ll instead send those same requests out to a handful of people who just might accept. Either way, I’m sure it will be useful to you."
714,,100,Grimoire Compendium,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Making ,"Despite the name, a Grimoire isn’t actually a book. Or rather, it doesn’t have to be. Anything that assists in the casting of magic qualifies. The Bloodedge’s arm is one, as is the entirety of Yuki Terumi’s body. They’re even the same kind. Anyways, this item is simply your notes on science. Any weapon or interesting thing you observe is recorded, as well as whatever thoughts you have one it. Simply put, it saves you the time of actually writing these things down."
715,,100,Magic Association Uniform,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Making ,"I’ve gotta say, the Magic Association has really got style down pat. They made part of their standard uniform a miniskirt! Well, only for the women, but still. Anyways, you now have one such uniform. Wearing it isn’t actually required, but if you’re a student at the associations academy - which by the way is an entire city - then It’d probably be a good thing for you to wear this. As for why you would do that? Well, the outfit has been modified to enhance your own magics by a small amount, as well as to defend against it. It’s not much, but it’s useful."
716,,100,Bloodedge,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Making ,"A rather complex blade, if we’re being honest. The sword edge of the blade slides up and down the ‘hilt’, which runs up the entire back end. It’s less a sword and more a sharp edge attached to a staff. It does have a relatively unique trick to it though. Since the blade can slide, the sword can change shape to a limited extent, becoming a scythe using the ‘tip’ of the blade or an oddly shaped hammer using the ‘bottom’ of the blade. By all accounts the sword doesn’t have a name, and is instead modeled after the sword owned by the Bloodedge. Or maybe it is his sword…?"
717,,100,Battle Garments,Campione,Making ,"Having to battle creatures from myth and legend as your job is no excuse to not look fashionable while doing so. This is a set of clothes that fit you perfectly, are fashionable, flexible, self-repairing and strong as enchanted steel armor. Because if you’re going to kick ass, then do it in style."
718,,100,Keep In Contact,Campione,Making ,"Made with the latest technology and with the quality of the old Nokia cellphones. This smartphone can survive virtually any amount of damage without breaking or malfunctioning, made to last, it also has good signal and a tremendous battery life and has been enchanted with powerful magics."
719,,100,In The Blood,Campione,Making ,"Eugenics, baby. Blood ties are important for a reason and now you have control over it. You can choose any of your traits, powers or gifts to become a sure pass down to all your blood descendants. It could be your miko gift, your magic reserves or even some natural predisposition or talent you may possess. Whatever it is, it will become a trait carried over all your blood-related descendants."
720,,100,Sword of the Jumper,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"When the hour is grim and your men lose hope, it is your sword held aloft that will catch their eye
and inspire them to stand once more. This simple blade of a design of your choice is a representation
of you as a king and a commander. A magical blade of some strength, it’s real benefits are that your
allies that see the blade will feel themselves filled with vigor, strong morale and a belief that they
can keep fighting even when it seems hopeless. An effect that will become more potent the more
your forces actually do believe in you already. The sword is also linked to a small rift, allowing you to
store any single mount or vehicle of your choice and instantly summon it to your location by cutting
the air with your new sword, which opens a rift of size equal to the cut you made. Sadly, the cuts
don’t have any effect beyond opening this rift, though clever use could make the portal a nice way to
chop things that are hard to cut. Maybe a particularly difficult knot. You may import a melee weapon
into this item. "
721,,100,House of the Witch,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"Every young witch’s favourite birthday present, at least until they know how to make it themselves. This small house is rather rudimentary when it comes to living necessities but quite filled out in
regards to potion making. Not only does it have a high quality set of tools and appliances towards
creating potions, poisons and designing magical rituals, it also comes with a weekly replenishing
stock of low to mid range potions in the pantry. From youth restoring drinks, potions to plump or
slim down the form, some love potions and even a few useful for combat potions that can
temporarily improve strength and speed. The house also always has a fresh batch on pancakes ready
on the stove, covered in your choice of delicious topping. "
722,,100,Sealing Cloths,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"As befits the nature of being a monster, not all your powers may be ideal in all situations, particularly those that are difficult to control. There are solutions for such things, however, and this
small chest contains a range of clothing accessories made for different parts of the body that can
each disable a specific power linked to that body part while you wear it, though you can take it off at
any time and it will not hinder you. A blindfold that you can see through while sealing your
dangerous petrifying gaze for instance. They won’t work on enemies but allies can use them as well. "
723,,100,Soma,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Making,"The holy drink of heaven, extracted from the purest of herbs. The milk of these plants becomes a
nectar that brings eternal youth to those who sup at it, countering any aging of the body or soul. Even the degradation of the mind is halted, so long as the Soma continues to flow into one’s body
every few months. Your supply is stored in a range of decorative jugs and small containers, enough
to maintain eternal youth constantly for several dozen people, as they all refill once a week. The
drink quickly heals wounds and restores lost energy when consumed as well, though it requires
more liquid than just maintaining youth to be drunk at once. Apparently, it tastes quite lovely too. If
you wish, you can change the stored containers for a supply of the original plants that can give
enough of the liquid to match."
724,,100,Traditional Japanese Art,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making,"You may never make your name on the battlefield but those fools running around with metal sticks
waving fail to understand the influence more delicate approaches can have. You have the talent and
the training to become a nationally famous artist in a style found here in Japan. Writing and poetry, calligraphy, some of the varieties of traditional painting or even more modern arts not yet created in
older Japan.

While you have the ordinary skill to create emotionally moving and lasting pieces of art, you also
possess a magical side to your style. You can naturally enchant your works with magic, enabling it to
have a more direct influence on the minds and hearts of those who experience it. Simplest to just
direct the emotions of readers but with time, you can plant ideas and even commands to be later
activated in the minds of others. Art that is similar to your chosen style is easy for you to expand
your skill into, a painter will quickly master other styles of painting, and your art is never boring or
bothersome for you to focus on. More, it is calming and enables you to re-centre yourself no matter
the situation."
725,,100,A Kingdom Is My Horse,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making,"Snap and slash! A fancy little riding crop for a fancy little queen. While clearly of the highest make
and easy to use to spur on a horse or cause a bit of pain to a unruly subject, the crop is actually
enchanted for some additional uses. When intended as a weapon, the crop will strike with enough
weight to break bone or even split a thick tree in two, or when intended to cause pain it can cause
convulsions strong enough to cause paralysis in less sturdy types without leaving any actual wounds
at all! Plus when you use it on a loyal subject, they won’t even protest as long as you don’t cause
them serious harm or pain with it. Unless they want to. Lots of your subjects probably want to if it’s
you."
726,,100,Loner’s Wand,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making,"It’s no big thing but gosh if it doesn’t look shiny. This softly glowing wand is quite the magical
implement, along and thin tool that acts as a excellent focus for magical energy to improve both
control greatly and power somewhat, though it’s probably not too useful for one that isn’t a mage
themselves. Surprisingly, the wand is incredibly sturdy and can absolutely be used to stab someone
in the gut like a very short spear or long knife."
727,,100,Living Under the Hood,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"As fantastical as they can seem, a realistic mindset does folk heroes as much good as any other man. Despite your origins, you’ve come to have a quite pragmatic skillset. An experienced survivalist, able
to last months on your own with no tools or supplies but what you find in the English forests, and
extend your efficient mindset to most things in life. Being able to limit yourself to only what you
need and resist temptation extends rations and budgets a great deal further. While others can be
resistant to giving up their luxuries normally, your guidance can make it much easier for them to
remain comfortable and accepting of a more limited lifestyle.

Your talents for turning natural materials into effective tools and weaponry, even to somewhat
magical degrees, only helps this survival aim further. The bows you carve often have unique
attributes based on the supposed magical nature of the wood they are made from, while poultices
made even with ordinary herbs can have unnaturally potent healing properties. The extensive
knowledge of mundane and magical nature does help too. "
728,,100,Malpractice Methods,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"Still encrusted with dried blood, these may be the very tools used by the true Ripper in his serial spree. A roll of surgical tools are present here, each one unnaturally sharp and capable of dealing agonising wounds to those cut by them. They can’t slice through metal or stone but mere flesh parts with ease and bone is cut in two or three swings. They can also be used for their original intended purpose, performing as sturdy and high quality implements for actual medicine, but they should probably be washed off first."
729,,100,Fancy Loot,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"All the classic accoutrements that any pirate would be ashamed to go without. A murderously sharp cutlass and enough guns to supply a small navy too. They’re only musket and pistol varieties found in the Age of Sail but you seem to be able to pull them out with almost no limit, the same with new pirate swords. If you can aim and fire fast enough, you could just keep pulling out and throwing away a pair of pistols each time. The guns are high quality and work easily even when soaked in water but they tend to disappear a few minutes after leaving the hands of you or some member of your crew that you’ve supplied them too. 

You also receive a set of fantastic pirate outfits to suit your new occupation. While there’s the expected colorful coats and enormous pirate hats, you also have a range of appealing swimsuits to choose from, enough to have a fresh look every day you desire. If you happen to have the classic pirate injuries, you’ll find eyepatches, peg legs and even hook hands appearing in this little armoire. Everything’s sturdy and easy to maintain on your long voyages too."
730,,100,Doctor Jack,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"It was one of the more popular theories on Jack’s identity, that he was linked in some way to the
medical profession. The type and extent of the wounds on his victims would indicate some
experience with surgical practice. You may have been a doctor, a war time surgeon or a back alley
hack but you do have experience. The techniques may be the archaic ones used in the Ripper’s time
in London, dubiously effective in saving lives, but shockingly effective in taking them. 

Your skill with surgical tools and knives, along with an extensive knowledge of human dissection, serves you well in combat. Natural killer instinct added in, you become a deadly dervish for normal
humans to face against. If you happened to find some magical energy within yourself to make use of, channeling it into your tools would allow your out-dated surgical skills to actually heal people, albeit
they still leave visible scarring. "
731,,100,Treatment Tricks,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"Even the best surgeon is unlikely to have much luck using his bare hands and a bit of shoe string to
sew up wounds. Better to come properly equipped. This large yet light backpack is packed full of
seemingly any tool you could need for a medical procedure, provided it’s both mundane and not
bigger than the backpack itself. They’re high quality and sturdy enough to survive rough use on the
battlefield. Those scissors won’t break even after you cut a Krauts’ throat out with them. What else
did you think rough use meant? Along with the backpack are a few apparent ‘nurse’ outfits. Some of
them are reasonable for the time but many appear to be made to fit especially tight across your
body, or barely cover anything at all. One just looks like a few bits of see-through green and purple
plastic. What kind of nurse wears this sort of clothing?"
732,,100,Magical Equipment,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"An incredible gift for any lesser lord and something that even most kings would be happy to have at
hand. A set of magical arms and armor, not of legendary scale but terribly useful still. The personal
weapon, likely a sword or axe, has supernatural offensive power and a minor power of choice, such
as alighting with blazing fire or filling wounds it makes with corrosive acid. Normal plate armor will
be of little use against the weapon. The armor, a full set in a style of your choice, has the defensive
properties to render mundane swords or lances mostly ineffectual and can even ward away the
elements, letting you shrug off fireballs and small blasts of lightning, as well as the heat or cold
despite your heavy armor."
733,,100,Alchemy Lab,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making,"Tools that some may consider to be an investment for crackpots and madmen, this alchemical
laboratory is small but all that’s needed for someone of actual skill to get to work. A small building, with a surprising attention to safety for this era, it is built with several separate lab rooms filled with
a variety of equipment needed for alchemy and creating chemical substances in general. A normal
chemist could brew up quite the variety of substances with the gradually replenishing materials
found in the drawers here, while a trained alchemist will find the tools and materials needed to start
creating low range magical potions."
734,,100,Eternal Flower,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Making,"A plant that grows only at the bottom of a certain river. This plant has legendary powers, said to
grant immortality and eternal youth in body and soul to whoever imbibes a concoction made of the
plant. Despite the magnificent effect, so few seem to consider this worth nearly as much as a limited
life that is lived to it’s fullest. But everyone has their own take and you now have the chance to
decide yourself, as you have a small potion container holding this immortality fluid. Drinking the
entirety of the container will revert you to the prime of your youth as well as ensure you never age
again. The cup will refill once a year."
735,,100,Weapon For A Holy War,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Making,"A relic in it’s own right, this weapon is one of the holiest artefacts of your religion. The sort of object
that millions might one day come to view as an object of worship. For now, it is a mighty weapon
created to carry out your holy orders. What form and what abilities this weapon takes on are not yet
decided until you take this and make that choice yourself. The weapon is notably powerful, equivalent to the weapons that Saints George and Martha wielded, but won’t be doing more than
breaking a few castles on it’s own. You may import a weapon you already have into this."
736,,100,Death Bag,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Making,"To anyone else, this small leather bag would be a item of great wonder for all it contained within. To
you, it’s just the tools of the trade. This sack, about the size of a pumpkin, is easy to carry, weighs
very little and carries a massive variety of tools for your dark work. A seemingly limitless supply of
small black blades known as dirks, a wide variety of poisons for different uses, drugs to improve your
condition or introduce a variety of useful mental and physical states in others, tools to assist in
traversing all manner of terrain, devices to obscure your form and tracks you lead, minor charms
against spirits and the elements and even tools to extract information and pain from any targets you
might need alive. Anything in here will quickly replenish after being used, though putting more
things in this bag that contains so much already won’t have them restore themselves too."
737,,100,Magic Weapon,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Making,"Too many to count and certainly too many to spend all this space on. A magic weapon is a
cornerstone of heroic myth, of kingly legends, of holy wars and even in the stories told by the artists. This option provides a customisable method to create your own magical weapon or to take hold of
an existing one. The physical shape of the weapon and it’s appearance can be chosen within reason
for free and all the blades will be sturdier, sharper or more effective than any normal steel weapon. Be it a sword, a lance, a whip, a shield or something as strange as a helmet or pair of boots.  

For 100CP, tools of weak or moderate power can be created. Vulcano Caligorante, the whip sword
that can extend tens of meters in moments and freely move as the wielder wishes, or the Trap of
Argalia, a lance that possesses relatively weak attack power but can cause anyone it’s tip touches to
fall to the ground regardless of abilities. Even the shield of Bradamante, a potent defense capable of
reflecting blinding light and more could appear here."
738,,100,Liquid Reason,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Making ,"Captured from a lake on the moon, after quite the journey, this glass bottle contains a smoky silver
fluid. It’s pure reason, from a place often thought to cause madness, and drinking the liquid reason
can restore anyone from madness or mental degradation to their original selves. The taste is a little
yucky but when you have a friend driven mad because of rejected love confessions, and cross
dressing doesn’t help, you go with moon reason. The fluid restores a day after it has been emptied."
739,,100,Infinite Wood!?,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Making ,"A weapon to surpass all lumberjacks. Who has a need for axes and chainsaws when you’ve already
attained Infinite Wood? Unlimited, endless, eternal! Every kind of wood in the world. Ash, Oak, Pine, Morning- maybe not that last one. But still! You’ve got an unlimited supply of every normal sort of
wood in the world, in uncut logs and all sorts of prepared shapes. None of it’s rotted or infested with
bugs either. There aren’t even any spiders!"
740,,100,Childhood Diary,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Making ,"A ratty little diary with a simply pen tied to it. The pages look like they’re about 50 years old but they
seem sturdy enough to write on. The book might look like a reject among rejects but it’s got a special
trait. It can bring to life the imaginary people written about in the book, like it once brought about
the existence of young children’s imaginary friends. It’s not a very useful power, as it only works for
ordinary people and simple animals and they don’t know anything the user wouldn’t, but much
comfort can be had from making the perfect friend for yourself. Normally, they’d only last as long as
the book does, but some say that with a strong enough emotional connection, these beings could
become real alongside you."
741,,100,Shining Armour,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Making ,"A knight cannot be so without a proper set of equipment. You have a full set of plate armour, customised to fit your theme and personality. Perhaps it is a brilliant silver set with a lion helm or a
dreary and dark plate with hard lines and no curves. It is fitted perfectly to you and you can channel
your mana into the armour to enhance it’s protection with ease and, unlike most reinforcement, it
appears to have no upper limit. The armour will also repair itself if damaged or destroyed, though
this takes hours of rest."
742,,100,Research Supplies ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Making,"All experimentation requires resources. You receive a steady
supply of whatever mundane resources are required for your research - yes, including
gems if you use jewel magecraft, no you can’t sell them to get rich - arriving on the first
of every month. Does not come with any living humans to experiment upon."
743,,100,Basic Magecraft - Gradation Air,Tsukihime,Making,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement,Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used by Magi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events in Misaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modern Magecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in thatparticular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Gradation Air is able to create physical objects with magical energy, though these tend to be fragile and extremely temporary."
744,,100,Void Egg ,Stardew Valley,Making,"This black egg flecked with blood red spots feels warmer to the touch than a chicken egg really should. Given a little time it will hatch by itself, without an incubator even, into a small, fluffy chick with utterly black feathers and red, burning eyes. Despite its looks, it’s not evil and is really just a chicken with a little extra magic in the blood. It’ll lay more Void Eggs once it is grown, which you might be able to find some magical uses for. But don’t eat them. Anything made with them tends to taste like burnt hair somehow. You’ll get a new egg each week should you decide to eat yours or if something happens to the Void Chicken itself.
"
745,,100,Enchanting Gear​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Making,"A snazzy box filled with compartments containing enough enchanter’s dust to create a wand and a high quality synthetic crystal along with instructions for making more. It also refills once a week.
"
746,,100,Reagents​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Making,"Unlike other types of magic, Fey magic has a rather high requirement for reagents when doing things such as summoning elementals. Fortunately, you seem to have an infinite stock of these reagents, contained within a shiny wooden box the size of your forearm."
747,,100,Cake~! ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Making,"You may use magical energies to summon any sort of pastry or cake you like into existence. You may summon this food to be up to the size of a small house, letting you potentially crush someone with sugary goodness.
"
748,,100,Cake~! - Boosted,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Making,"For an extra 100 MP, this can be any sort of food at all (though copies of unique food won’t have any supernatural properties if they had them) that you’ve seen or eaten at least once. (CG Note: Requires base Cake~! - Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline first.)
"
749,,100,Embalming Kit ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Making,"Carrying out a burial ceremony is quite the complicated task, needing many tools and materials. All Tomb Priests carried with them a collected set of the necessary ingredients and equipment, in case they were ever called to serve a member of the royal family as they died. It is perhaps not much use nowadays, though you’ll find it quite handy for maintaining your own skeletal body. It seems the various pastes are good for your bones.
"
750,,100,Safety Bag,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,Most of the people in this series rely on objects to empower them: the class cards or the kaleidosticks for example. The problem with this is that such items can be taken or lost. Fortunately you have a bag or storage device with peculiar properties that will help with this problem. The bag is larger on the inside with storage space equivalent to a ten meter cubed room and is of a size that is easy to carry. The other interesting property it has is that you and only you can take or put things in it.
751,,100,Reagents ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,You have a source of reagents perfect for use in the Magecraft you have knowledge of. For example if you use Jewel Magecraft you have a stock of gems perfect for that use. They will restock after being used.
752,,100,Mermaid’s Heart ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Making,"Not really a mermaid’s heart, but in fact a very small black pearl that has potent magical and medicinal properties. Might be interesting to see how it mixes with other magic ingredients for potions and the like."
753,,100,Archeology Tools ,Lyrical Nanoha,Making,"An entire kit of mundane archeology tools made for the purpose of acquiring and preserving artifacts, magical or otherwise. Comes with everything you need to nerd out at ancient ruins, and to bore your coworkers to death with your discoveries."
754,,100,Basic Alchemy ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Making,"You can now manipulate the raw energy of the universe, as defined by the Greek, being air, water, earth and fire. This lets you create Noise-resistant shields and project streams or bolts of raw energy, capable of harming Noise. It’s not really for combat, and is akin to using a blowtorch as a weapon, as it’s mostly used during alchemical processes.
"
755,,100,AN OFFERING PEDESTAL ,Golden Sky Stories,Making,"Well, it’s not really accurate to call it a pedestal – it’s more of a small collections box on top of a pedestal, but you will find that over time, as you build more connections with people, you’ll find little gifts and trinkets left inside the box. Generally, the items left behind will reflect the individual who came by, and while the items are generally of little monetary worth, having them will reflect the strength of your bond with them. In times of duress, having such memorabilia can help take away the stress. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)
"
756,,100,Teru Teru Bouzu ,Golden Sky Stories,Making,"In the past, farmers used these dolls as weather charms, in hopes that they would act as wards against bad weather. With the passage of time, this set of dolls has adopted a spirit of their own, and though their magic still isn’t too powerful, they can indeed ward off storms, rain, and all sorts of bad weather away from your location without much effort. In places with heavy concentrations of magic, you might even swear that you saw the dolls move...
"
757,,100,Ofuda ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Making,"A collection of charms inscribed on paper with powerful anti-Youka properties. It can be used defensively as barriers, or offensively to seal or harm. After this Jumpchain, these will be effective against any supernatural being.
"
758,,100,Magic Charms ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You can make ofuda with a variety of uses – sealing creatures away or just hurting youkai in general. Sealing ofuda can hold someone paralyzed in place or lock away spirits harmlessly inside inanimate objects. Ones designed to hurt youkai will sting quite a great deal and potentially destroy them with repeated applications. Though for all their utility, they’re still pieces of paper, and while creatures cannot normally damage ofuda that affect them unless they are very strong, ofuda are noticeably weak to wind and rain. In time you may learn how to craft others based on myths about shrine maidens.
"
759,,100,Spell Components ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a large supply of common spell components, certainly enough to regularly cast a wide variety of spells. Rarer items for your most potent of spells may still require some hunting.
"
760,,100,Mother Knows Best* ,Peter Pan,Making,"Mothers are highly treasured on the island, and you bring with you the talent of a (childish) mother. You are skilled in multitasking, and can cook, clean, darn socks, sew pockets onto clothes (even ones that weren’t made for pockets to begin with), and in general look after a large number of children, even rowdy ones, effortlessly. Plus, you give these different things a “mother’s touch”: beds you make will feel cozier, clothes you make/sew will feel more comfortable, rooms you clean up will make people feel more at home, etc.; this may therefore enhance other domestic-oriented perks you have. You also become a skilled storyteller – at least one for children’s tales – and can easily recall classic tales or invent your own; you can even take existing stories and give your own unique flair to them, such that Cinderella fights off pirates with a revolver, while retaining the wonder of the original. Moreover, it gives you an aura of respectful motherhood that makes anyone with the form of a child (even beings that are actually much older) much more likely to behave like a child and follow your instructions when you are present, with your control increasing the more you act like their mother. You can even have an effect on people with an older physical form if they long for a mother (it helps that the perk makes people more likely to want you to be their mother).
"
761,,100,Pixie Dust ,Peter Pan,Making,"Most if not all fairies constantly produce the magical substance of fairy dust around their body, such that a trail follows wherever you fly. People and even objects as large as ships, when covered in the sparkling dust, gain the ability to fly. However, while inanimate things can fly without any challenge, people wishing to fly must have sincere faith and happy, carefree emotions. During the jump, you constantly emit fairy dust as easily as breathing, and you are constantly surrounded by a cloud of fairy dust, though in later jumps you can control the emission. To help, the perk also enables you to breathe easily without choking on pixie dust or other particles, such that you could breathe and talk even with smoke all around you. If you took this perk and are not a fairy, you will be looked at quite strangely by others, but things are often strange in Neverland so that’s hardly a bad thing.
"
762,,100,Teddy Bear ,Peter Pan,Making,"A cute little teddy bear you can carry around with you. It has a rip in it, but surprisingly none of the fluff ever comes out. On the contrary, you can stuff in much larger objects without much trouble, even cannonballs; even so, anything much larger, such as the size of a human, won’t fit. It remains ever-so-light when carried by you, but reveals its true weight upon contact with someone else. Under such circumstances, the bear may be useful as an unconventional and unexpected weapon.
"
763,,100,Little Mirror ,Ib,Making,"A small, silver hand mirror. Despite being literally drawn from crayons, it is reflective. It can catch and reflect the sun’s rays with enough intensity to melt solid ice.
"
764,,100,On-The-Fly Cooking ,Wonderland No More,Making,"This skill lets you create edible and/or magical treats quickly from anything in your present surroundings. You’ll always find some ingredients to scrounge up and prepare in a hurry, even if your location isn’t the best. If you want your food to have a specific sort of effect, you have a higher chance of your concoction having those properties, but otherwise the effects will be fairly random."
765,,100,Hat for Every Occasion ,Wonderland No More,Making,"You can summon various kinds of hats that represent certain occupations (police officer, jester, engineer, chef, etc.). When worn, the hat slightly enhances the wearer’s skills in regard to said hat’s related profession. For example, a sailor’s hat would improve your nautical skills, while a witch’s hat would enhance your magic skills. The enhancements are lost once the hat is removed. You can place these hats on your head or on other people’s heads. One hat that works better as one on an enemy target’s head is the dunce’s cap, which makes the wearer stupid and cannot be removed by the wearer.
"
766,,100,Thieves’ Tools ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Making,"YOU MEAN SCOU-... S-scout’s to- Okay no. There’s no defending these. A file, a set of lockpicks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow scissors, and a pair of pliers, wrapped up in a rawhide sheet - there’s no other use for things like these except for breaking and entering. But these tools will take you far in that endeavor, and should any one tool break you’ll find it replaced almost immediately. It’s magical nonsense, who knows where they come from.
"
767,,100,Arcana Of Matter ,Endless Legend,Making,"May be taken up to 4 times, each one providing you with a different array of magical powers. Pain Through Power is not required to cast magic, but it does increase the overall power of your spells.

Dust is everything. You need to simply tell it what to become. With this Arcana, you can turn a handful into any portable object, a bag into something it'd take a couple people to lift, or an entire barrel into a hasty fortification.
"
768,,100,Bottles ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Making,"A set of glass bottles with a strange enchantment on them, these bottles have the remarkable quality of being able to keep anything within ‘fresh’ no matter how long they’re kept. Milk stays cool and fresh for weeks, fish remain alive swimming around in stale water indefinitely, and sliced fruit is as fresh as the moment the cork in the bottle is put on. It shouldn’t have to be said what kinds of benefit this can reap. In addition, the glasses are remarkably sturdy and could easily survive being handled roughly across a Hyrule-wide trek!"
769,,100,Magic Powder ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Making,"Made from a toadstool, this stuff will ignite foes, remove transformation effects, light braziers, summon demons (if tossed into certain wells) and do all sorts of crazy stuff. Refills after about half an hour.
"
770,,100,A Patch Of Soft Soil ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Making,"This small patch of earth, conveniently located on or near a property of yours, can only be described as extremely fertile. So much so that you could grow a tree in weeks instead of decades. Not a Maku Tree or similar, sadly. However, it’s still an excellent spot to plant a tree. Take this Gasha seed, for example. You now have a small bag of seeds, about 20 or so, that can be planted here. What do these seeds actually do? Well, when fully grown, the nut that grows on the tree seems to contain magical rings inside of them. There is a great deal of variety, and they aren’t much use unless you know what they do, but surely something here will be of use?
"
771,,100,Cane of Pacci,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Making,"This is one of the ancient treasures that the Minish made for humans. When equipped and directed, the cane fires an energy beam that flips any object in its path. It can flip vases, platforms, minecarts, and even some enemies. When fired at the air, it energizes a section to act like a trampoline: it’ll shoots you into the air upon falling on it.
"
772,,100,Bottle Collection ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Making,"While they might not seem like anything special these bottles are invulnerable to damage or spilling, and their corks are designed in such a way that they are both spill-proof and porous enough for living beings such as fairies or insects to be contained safely within them. One of the bottles is special; once a day, so long as it is empty, it will be filled with a random substance from this world ranging from oil, to a blue potion that is capable of restoring someone from the brink of death. There’s even a chance of it becoming filled with the rare tears of a Great Fairy, which are not only capable of restoring someone’s health to full, but also doubles the damage they do until they take damage themselves.
"
773,,100,Magic Bottle ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Making,"Three reusable, empty jars that allow you to capture fairies and bugs, hold liquids, and... it's a set of jars. Will not break.

"
774,,100,Sorcery - Alchemy (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

[1] The alchemist may create more advanced versions of mundane chemicals, such as painkillers and glue. They are not overtly supernatural, and can easily be passed off as just a “better brand.”
"
775,,100,Sorcery - Alchemy (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

[3] The alchemist’s enhancements can now create mildly superhuman physical abilities and grant low level psychic powers, at least for short periods. They can also create materials and alloys that surpass what should be possible.

777,,100,Sorcery - Alchemy (Four Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

"
778,,100,Sorcery - Alchemy (Five Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

[5] With great study - or a sample - of a supernatural creature, the alchemist may replicate their various mid-level abilities for short periods. More potent abilities come with side effects.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Alchemy (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)
"
779,,100,Sorcery - Alchemy (Six Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as “alchemists,” and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.

[6] At this level, an alchemist may create such miracles as the Elixir of Eternal Youth, or even induce an Awakening.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Alchemy (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)
"
780,,100,Sorcery - Enchantment (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. The creation of such items generally takes three days per dot required to make it.

[1] The Enchanter creates a minor item with limited use only and a tight area of influence. Such as a jacket that works as abnormally good camouflage in a crowd, or glasses that never fog."
781,,100,Sorcery - Enchantment (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. The creation of such items generally takes three days per dot required to make it.

[2] The Enchanter creates a more powerful talisman that is noticeable as magic. A flask that blocks three bullets and no more, objects that increase a mundane skill by a noticeable amount when used.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Enchantment (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
782,,100,Sorcery - Enchantment (Three Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. The creation of such items generally takes three days per dot required to make it.

[3] The Enchanter creates a talisman whose function is obviously magical. Shoes that double running speed, a charm that can protect its wearer from magic three times a day.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Enchantment (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
783,,100,Sorcery - Enchantment (Four Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. The creation of such items generally takes three days per dot required to make it.

[4] The Enchanter creates a talisman that is able to defy several of the limitations of the Consensus. Clothing that grants superhumanly impressive but otherwise mundane abilities, a throwing knife that shall never miss.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Enchantment (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
784,,100,Sorcery - Enchantment (Five Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. The creation of such items generally takes three days per dot required to make it.

[5] The Enchanter creates a talisman with almost miraculous powers. A golem, or a ring that hides its user from magical detection.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Enchantment (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
785,,100,Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (Three Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Making,"[3] The sorcerer can create primitive mana batteries, storing energy for later, as well as preventing wellsprings of such energy from producing power, but only for a short time.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
786,,100,Echo Flower Seeds ,Undertale,Making,"This packet of seeds is for the magical echo flower- Normally only growing in the swamps of the Underground, the Echo flower is a peculiar, bioluminescent blossom that constantly repeats the last thing it heard. This packet contains enough to start a small field of Echo flowers (Not that such a thing is recommended, since they'll babble back and forth to each other and it'll be super freaky)."
787,,100,Mora ,Genshin Impact,Making,"Mora is more than just a coin used to trade. Every single piece of mora was created by the Geo Archon, Morax, and as such every single piece contains some of his power. This power allows it to act as a catalyst for physical transformation. When paying for a potion to be made or a weapon to be forged, you aren’t just paying for the service, you are supplying an ingredient. For 100CP you will gain a few thousand mora each month, enough for a family to live on comfortably. "
788,,100,Enhancement Ore ,Genshin Impact,Making,"Legend has it that this refined ingot contains the memories of battles past. It is not known how or why, but weapons are able to absorb this special ore and become stronger for it. It is even said that the weapons that benefit from these memories naturally become sentient. Whether that is true is yet to be seen, but one fact that has been proven time and again is that it does make the weapons better. You have received a dozen chunks of fine enhancement ore, as well as a steady supply of a dozen more each month."
789,,100,Home Cooking ,Terraria,Making,"There is very little that is more comforting than arriving home to find a nice meal waiting for you, and now, you are easily able to provide such. You are a master in the kitchen, to the point where food you make is guaranteed to provide at least a small ‘stat bonus’ to those who eat it, and you may even discover how to improve your recipes to provide a stronger and more targeted boost. Your skill also extends to potion-making, and as you experiment, you may discover new and exciting potions to make."
790,,100,Planting Gear ,Terraria,Making,"A few tools designed to help with planting and tending to nature, as well as a large, random assortment of seeds. The tools are the Sickle, good for turning grass into hay; the Staff of Regrowth, which helps to boost the yield of plants when harvested; and the Living Wood Wand, a tool that allows you to take dead wood and turn it into Living Wood and leaves, with the type of Living Wood depending on the type of wood used. The seeds include acorns, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and more, with the seeds restocking a few days after being planted. "
791,,100,Planting Gear (Boosted) ,Terraria,Making,"For an undiscounted extra 100 CP, the seeds will include Gemcorns and special acorns that result in fruit trees that always drop fruit, and the Living Wood Wand will be upgraded with the powers of the Dirt Rod, allowing for the reshaping of the landscape with a little bit of mana use.

(CG Note: Requires base Planting Gear - Terraria first.)"
792,,100,Elemental Seeds ,World Seed,Making,"An elemental seed is the condensed essence of an element, and they’re almost exclusively produced by Druids or Mages capable of creating enchantments replicating their methods. They have various uses, such as powering enchantments or magical items, and are required in the process of giving an object an elemental ability. Druids also use them to introduce new elements into their Grove, and need them to cultivate their affinities past the 25% point. As such, each of them is fairly valuable, with the price skyrocketing once you go beyond the basic seven elements and to incredibly rare ones such as Time.

They are also pretty time intensive to make, requiring about an hour of work for each, even for people relatively skilled in their creation. But now, you won’t ever have to worry about that, as you’ll get a dozen Seeds for each of your affinities delivered either to your warehouse or another place you designate, every week. Their quality depends on the level of your affinities: from 5% to 25% you’ll get low-grade ones, from 25% to 50% medium-grade ones, from 50% to 75% high-grade ones, and finally, from 75% up to 100% you’ll get top-grade seeds."
793,,100,Magical Stones ,Danmachi,Making ,Every monster has one of these in the centre of them and core of monsters and is always located in the chest area of the monster. Adventurers and Supporters gather magic stones to trade them in for valis at the Guild. You’ve got a bag full of 500 stones from quite potent monsters. You can sell them for quite a bit of valis but they might be more useful as materials if you’re a crafter of magical items.
794,,150,E.G.O. Unlock(HE),Lobotomy Corporation,Making ,"Normally over the course of the jump, weapons and armour can be crafted from the energy collected from the abnormalities. Choose a non-tool Abnormality, you now have a single copy of all the equipment (including gifts) it can provide. Their requirements don’t apply to you or your companions. They can be found in your dorm/warehouse and won't be confused with company property.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
795,,150,Magic Weapon,Hellblazer,Making ,"An unbreakable sword, axe or other archaic weapon. Makes you better, faster and stronger. Probably has a name that doesn't fit, like an axe called a scythe."
796,,150,Six Demon Bag,Hellblazer,Making ,"What’s in it? Wind, fire, all that kind of thing. A magical trump card, but it has a long cooldown."
797,,150,Galdorstone,The Owl House,Making ,"Whether you bought this treasure off a grave robber or acquired it through more grizzly methods, you now possess one of the most potent magical reagents on the Boiling Isles. This melon-sized chunk of blue crystal enhances a witch’s spellcasting abilities, allowing them to create workings and spells an order of magnitude larger than they would be capable of alone. There are only two catches; you need to be touching the galdorstone to use it, and it cannot enhance illusion magic. After all, you can’t enhance what’s not actually there. Whether you use it as a spell focus or an ingredient in more powerful sorcery, this valuable gem will make a mighty prize."
798,,150,Veteran Equipment ,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"More advanced equipment, suitable for a seasoned veteran than an apprentice fresh off the stage coach. More damaging and more protective, each article is worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, and would make early expeditions much easier. You can import a weapon and armor into this option, granting it the replenishing qualities mentioned above."
799,,150,"""Embers""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""No Unkindled can ever truly claim the embers that burn within a champion’s bosom, which is precisely what makes their yearning for warmth so keen."" Vaguely human shaped embers recovered from a bonfire, still ruminating with light and warmth. Their core will continue to burn for an exorbitantly long amount of time, and they can be fractured to easily create a fire. You receive a small bag with five Embers inside. By spending an additional 100CP, the bag will refill over time when one is used or fades, at a rate of one per hour. (Sidenote: Useful for activation of ""Yearning For Warmth"" in the absence of flame.)"
800,,150,The Smith’s Tools ,Elden Ring,Making,"Hammer, check. Anvil, check. Furnace, check. Tongs, chisels-BAH, what do the young and hot-headed care for the tools of the old anyhow? Just hand ‘er over and let old Jumper give ‘er a good whack, that’ll sort ‘em out. You now have everything a skilled blacksmith would need to care for nearly arms, armour and weapons found in these lands. This includes several sacks full of the smithing stones mined near the Erdtree, and several whetblades (some of which can grant various elemental affinities to weapons)-a veritable crateful’s worth, that replenishes every morning.

There is one exception to the above, which you must pay an additional 100 CP for (although discounts still apply): The scales of the Ancient Dragonlord which lightly twist time. The fascinating mystic and scientific implications of this aside, although still in a raw and unrefined form such resources can be used to forge weapons capable of slaying gods.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
801,,200,Moonlantern,Baldur's Gate 3,Making,"You have in your possession a lantern that emits a pure white light in bright intensity
that almost seems like the same as those of moon own light. Normally these lanterns are made
by enslaving pixies and torturing them to harvest their inner light. Yours though isn’t one of
those out of moral concerns. Your lantern simply has a magical power source inside that
achieves the same effect without violating the rights of small fey folk.
Within the aura of moonlantern’s light no supernatural curse or magical darkness may
take hold, while already existing ones will be dispelled. This light also wards off any hostile
lesser undead, like shadows or zombies. Although it can’t keep away undead big leagues like
vampires and liches, it will slightly weaken them and prevent them from using some of their
abilities (mostly form changing and mental powers)."
802,,200,Chest of the Mundane,Baldur's Gate 3,Making,"This is an extremely fine-looking gilded chest with very detailed engravings on it. For
anyone capable of sensing it, obviously it is quite magical. The enchantment placed on it is very
strange though. This chest can store an infinite number of objects placed in it as it is a literal
bottomless chest, keep in mind that chest still has the total weight of the objects even if it can
hold an absurd amount. Fill it too much and even you may be unable to move it. The weird part
about this chest is that any object placed inside of the chest immediately transforms into a really
cheap looking useless non-magical trash loot. This is not a simple illusion either it is a full
transmutation ability. Luckily the transformation only lasts as long as the object rests within the
chest. Once taken out, the transformed object simply back into its original form without losing
any of its previous effects (if there were any).
Now you might say ‘Well, this is pretty useless.” and you might be right. However, this
chest is the pre-patched version of the original in game chest of the mundane. Any object that
transforms into trash loot also replace their own weight with that of the transformed version.
So, you can stuff a barrel full of gold into the chest to make it turn to a wooden water cup for
example. You can take the cup back out and ‘boom’ it transforms back into the barrel full of
good. And one more good thing is that each of the transformed trash loot is pretty unique. So
as long as you can remember which loot transformed into which useless trash, you can pretty
much reduce their carry weight multiple times.
This even doubles as a really good disguise method for objects, because none of the
objects’ true nature can be determined with supernatural methods. It simply shows as non-
magical objects in magic radars.

This obviously synergizes well with the barrelmancer perk."
803,,200,Cache of Barrels & Boxes,Baldur's Gate 3,Making,"You get an endless supply of empty barrels, crates, boxes, chests and other kinds of
storage containers. They are either delivered to your cosmic warehouse when you need them or
simply appear magically at your campsite. These containers are of decent quality, but all
shopkeepers assume them as faulty goods, so they won’t buy them from you.
Along with those empty containers, you get some full ones as well. You get dozen
barrels that are filled with either highly flammable or highly caustic substances of your choice.
The lid of these barrels are sealed magically and nothing can remove the substances they contain
from inside of them. They get replenished to their full amount or replaced upon destruction
daily.
Oh, and these explosive barrels are totally non-conspicuous. If investigated by
authorities, everyone will simply assume they are full of trade goods."
804,,200,Ondinias,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Making,"Ondinias is an axe born from the sacrifice of a nymph
for the man she loved, despite knowing that he loved another woman. Although normally just an
axe imbued with the power of water, it can temporarily turn liquid in order to trap something
within itself, or be used to strike the earth and create a powerful wave of water. Recharging the
wave requires dunking it in saltwater."
805,,200,Ring of Erebus,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Making,"An item common to the Magus Order, these
rings enhance the magic of the bearer, increasing their magic accumulation as well as the range
of their spells."
806,,200,"Ego, Book of the Inner Self",Anima Beyond Fantasy,Making,"This enchanted book serves as a
diary of sorts for whomever carries it. It contains within its pages the entire life story of its bearer
up until the current point in time... including things the bearer does not know. It will also narrate
useful things like, “Although I did not know it, an assassin was sneaking up behind me while I
read my diary.” You may choose who is allowed to read it, to those you have not allowed it is
nothing but untranslatable gibberish."
807,,200,Loggle's Apprentice,Amphibia,Making,"Loggle is the local woodcarver of Wartwood. You have
trained under him and learned the art of carving, not only wood and metal, but
also your own body. Like Loggle you can craft magnificent statues of wood in a
short amount of time, you can also obtain incredible gains in a matter of weeks
going from a toothpick to looking like you’ve been a body builder your whole life."
808,,200,The Fumigator,Amphibia,Making,"The humans present in amphibia all seem to have a single
miraculous power. They can fix anything in a matter of a few moments, Marcy
rebuilds a town in minutes, Anne does all her chores in a few seconds, and Sasha,
well she founded a rebellion in a few hours. Now like the other humans, you’re
capable of fixing things supernaturally fast. You can clean any mess, fix anything
that breaks, it only takes time and even then very little of it."
809,,200,Mermaid's Flesh,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"According to Wakoku’s legends, the meat of the freak
Mermaid has the ability to slow down the aging process and extend the lifespan of
whoever eat them, to the point to allowing someone to live close to one hundred of
years in a time when others die before reaching sixty or even allow them to live up to
close to two hundred of years in better conditions (or even longer if the one that eat it
had a longer lifespan than that of a regular human). However, this only grants them
longevity, not actual immortality. Despite Mermaids not being a kind of Danger
Beasts usually found on the continent, you still managed to catch one of them,
acquiring around twenty small pieces of fresh Mermaid’s meat, each one of the
pieces capable of granting longevity to one person that fully eats it. Each piece of
meat will be replenished yearly if lost or consumed. A certain king on Wakoku would
love to put his hands on one of these pieces of Mermaid meat if they discovered you
had them."
810,,200,Performance Enhancing Drugs,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"From the survivors of the 100 children
that were taken in by Empire to be trained, the strongest seven survivors were then
recruited into the Elite Seven, however the remaining survivors joined another
squad, the Group of Terror. In order to compensate for their lack of innate talent, the
members of the Group of Terror were instead given performance-enhancing drugs
that then artificially gave them their superhuman abilities similar to the innate abilities
naturally developed by the Elite Seven. Apparently, you were one of the many
members of the now-disbanded Group of Terror, as you managed to acquire your
own bag of pills that contain these potent enhancement drugs. When a pill is
consumed, the drug within it will increase the user's strength, speed, reflexes and
endurance and even spiritual strength, putting them on the level of being able to
easily overpower veteran soldiers and spies, with its effect lasting for a few hours
before wearing off and making needed to take another pill to keep it.
Unfortunately, in addition to being highly addictive, these enhancements came at the
cost of severely shortening the user’s life-span and causing them to suffer severe
withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, body pains, spasm and seizures should
they stop taking them in regular intervals, however, as you’re paying a special price,
the drugs you’re receiving are special and won't be addictive and/or damaging to the
user’s body unless you want them to be for some reason. There will be around a few
dozens of pills (or candies if you prefer) inside the bag and they’ll be replenished
overtime if consumed at a rate of three pills per day, however, if the bag is lost or
destroyed, it’ll reappear in your Warehouse the next month."
811,,200,Diplomatic Immunity,A Mage of Sorothustra,Making,"This neat item serves as a marker of your diplomatic immunity
and in future jumps confers an equivalently powerful status to you. There is a lot you can get
away with with this."
812,,200,All Ages Pass,A Mage of Sorothustra,Making,"Your age is not a weapon that can be used against you when it comes
to things like working and social responsibilities such as voting. This pass you have certifies
that, and also acts as certification for any other relevant thing you have from other jumps such
as a medical license if you are a doctor or if you are an experienced lecturer."
813,,200,Tarantula,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Making,"A many legged mech, equipped with weapons such as a
massive Gatling gun and flying murder... top... things called String Juicers. They’re more
effective than they sound, and the whole thing comes with a full tank of gas, and ammunition
that replenishes itself daily."
814,,200,Ultra High Pressure Water Cutter,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Making,"You probably stole this, either from some
shady scientists or a band of thugs attacking you, but its suit of armor, equipped with
nitrogen-based cannons and explosives which can blast through buildings. As a bonus, they
deprive the target area of oxygen. For some reason, this doesn’t affect you or any allies within
three meters (or just under ten feet) of you. Your ammunition is limited, but it automatically refills
daily."
815,,200,Magic Item Creator,Overlord,Making,"You’re really, unnaturally, good at making magic items. If you know how
to make something then you can make it magical. Spoons, bowls, armor, books, weapons,
toasters, anything. You actually have to know some magic in order to enchant items with a
magical effect, and you don’t gain any skills in actually making items, so if you want to make
magic swords you’ll have to learn some magic and then how to make regular swords first. You
can copy down into scrolls any spell you know, which others can use to learn those spells (if
they are capable of using that magic system and put in the time to study) or use them as
one-use magic items. Additionally any magic item you create will be marginally better than it
would have otherwise been, regardless of whatever abilities you might have brought with you
from other worlds. You don’t have to have this talent to make magic items or spell scrolls, but
someone that does have this talent will always be much better than someone that doesn’t."
816,,200,Modularization,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Making,"Tinkers are individuals whose Shards happen to specialize in some form of technology
or scientific field. You have a Tinker-Tech specialization in modularization, a field
focused on variety and interchangeability. This allows you to design and create
technology with interchangeable parts, providing unparalleled versatility and
adaptability. For instance, you could transform a simple pistol into a high-powered rifle
by swapping out modular components. Your creations are designed with flexibility in
mind, enabling you to customize and modify your gear on the fly to suit any situation."
817,,200,Faerie Feast: Master Chef,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Making,"When you are in charge of, or at a minimum supervising, the staff of a cooking facility, the benefits of your Faerie Feast perk will apply to the end product as though you had personally produced any food cooked there. If the staff primarily consists of your waifus, you don’t even need to be present, provided they follow a specific menu and set of guidelines that you’ve instructed them in. These guidelines can include extraneous non-food related steps. This does not apply to industrial-scale food production or ingredients that are not themselves edible.

Requires Faerie Feast to purchase."
818,,200,Faerie Feast,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Making,"Your cooking is supernaturally good, capable of making miracles from the worst ingredients. Just one taste is enough to hook a person for life - assuming, of course, that they can taste. Even if they doesn't like you, she'll be unable to imagine a world where she can't eat your cooking every day, and stay with you for that alone. Over time, you can leverage this dependence into obedience through simple operant conditioning and, in turn, create real affection by enforcing faked affection.

The quality of your ingredients doesn’t matter, but they must be real ingredients. This lure will not let you cook without the proper tools, unless you have an adequate substitute. This lure also covers drink-mixing, butchery, and chemical food processing, but does not help with gardening, farming, animal husbandry, fishing, etc. - that’s biology, not chemistry. If you want to use this lure’s gifts as a professional skill, you can dial your ability down to world-class-chef levels, enough to ensure great business (and plenty of repeat customers) without tripping any ""this food might be literally addictive"" alarms.

This lure cannot affect targets who lack a sense of taste."
819,,200,Psycho Mask,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"A pale white mask in a design of your choice, perfectly fitted to your face. This specialised mask
works to filter the air you take in, like an advanced gas mask that never needs replacement, while
also focusing any mental powers that you possess. It’s not going to multiply their power too much
but you’ll definitely see a fair boost in effectiveness and range when you are wearing the mask as
opposed to when you are not. "
820,,200,Brazen Bull,Greek Mythology,Making,"A life-sized bronze, hollow bull with a door on one side. Should you lock
something inside, the bull will begin to heat up, roasting whatever was inside it at the time. Great
for ancient BBQs, right? On a completely unrelated note, it also has an enchantment that transforms any screaming into the sounds of a bull."
821,,200,Brísingamen,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"A necklace, pendant, or really any jewelry or accessory of your choice. This is the single most beautiful item in all of existence, it is inherently mesmerizing to look at, to the point that other people in the middle of a movie premier might keep taking glances at you, though you can tone down this attention at will. Whoever wears this item will instantly appear to have more authority, royalty, charm, charisma, and beauty, to the point you could wear a literal used brown trash bag covered in a dead skunk and baby vomit, and everyone would say that you were the best dressed best smelling person there. But the real secret of this item is its value. It is priceless with a big T truth. You may give this item as payment for any one thing and it will be accepted no questions asked. You need 1,000,000 million pure human souls, an eternally lost golden lama, and a copy of the unreleased manuscript that doesn't exist yet to get that deal with satan going? This will cover it. Enemy army shows up demanding 100 young men and all your food to spare your land? This will cover. But what's really nifty is that it will always return to you. The more expensive or bigger the purchase, the longer it will take to return, but it will never take more than 9 years to return. May be purchased multiple times."
822,,200,Hamr,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"A skin, pelt, fur, feathers, bones, or mantles from an animal, any animal you like, beautifully wrote into a garment like a shawl, scarf, or drapery. When worn by someone they can take on the form of that animal.  You become the animal in full with all its capabilities. The capabilities of yourself and animal form do not enhance or blend (no transferring kryptonian durability to your otter form), unless you purchased Eigi Einhamr."
823,,200,Atgørvi,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"Everyone has a skill, don't they, something they become known for; this is a single mundane skill of your choice. At 200cp your talent has gone clearly into the realm of the supernatural skill, able to forge immaterial things like light or fire or wind into a blade or infuse it into your armor creating weightless objects, nearly indestructible weapons, or craft impossibly sharp edges as narrow as a wavelength from simple metals. If your skill was running, walking upon the air itself would be possible.

May be purchased multiple times. "
824,,200,Sympathetic State,DC Comics,Making,"This elegant statue shoulders your magical burdens, taking the sacrifices you would have had to
pay for rituals and such things. It resembles a terrified young women, eternally locked in a pose
of near-collapse, and cries tears of blood when you call on it. Frustrated demons are forced to
accept that your magical pact compels them to claim the statue in lieu of your soul, hexes
directed at you hit the statue instead and fireballs burn the statue instead of you. It is only
elegantly carved marble, and while it can therefore take virtually any number of madness-
inducing effects and nasty illusions with enough damage it’ll crumble and it’s protection will
lessen-disappearing altogether once nothing of it is recognizable as the person it depicted.
The statue sometimes wobbles when taking on your burdens, as if shivering in pain. And if you
cared enough to do so, lighting candles around the statue or otherwise decorating it to and
treating it as something other than a scapegoat seems to make the light and shadows cast
around it give an adoring, joyful cast to its features. But it isn't actually alive...right? What’s one
potential victim cast into perpetual agony, in the pursuit of magical power?"
825,,200,Palace of the Dragon King,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"Following the clan’s rules, an Ōtsutsuki is
prohibited from killing a fellow clan member, unless in special situations, even if they
aren’t a pure Ōtsutsuki, so, when a clan member break the rules, the Palace of the
Dragon King is usually the option used to make them pay for this. This black box can
release a gaseous substance to its target, causing their entire body to petrify and
become frozen in time. This effect lasts for ten thousand years and the victim will be
preserved alive during all of this time. It’s possible for others with time manipulation
abilities to try to stop the time freeze, but this is a hard task. If you ever freeze
yourself in time somehow, the time you spent frozen won’t count for the time that you
need to stay in the setting. You receive one of these black boxes and, if used, lost or
destroyed, you’ll gain a new one at the start of each Jump.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."
826,,200,Chakra Constructs,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"You’re able to manifest a special red, glowing,
malleable chakra, letting you use it to create tools and weapons made of it, like
swords, spears, claws, stakes, chains, shields, fishing rods and many others. You
can manifest multiple tools and weapons at once and even control them
telekinetically, but they can’t go too far away from you without disappearing, with a
range similar to the Truth-Seeking Balls. These chakra constructs can be
disintegrated like shattered glass, letting you reshape them at will."
827,,200,Training Journal,Naruto,Making,"This tiny little book happens to contain the collective knowledge of every jutsu in the series, as well as in-depth learning guides to each one. For some reason, this book never exceeds the size of a regular notebook."
828,,200,Reagents,The Witcher Novels,Making,"Did you ever needed piece of fresh guano when situation become tense, or tears of virginal cow raised on diet of chocolate coins... for... for... very important reasons? Now you have this, many exotic, and not that exotic materials for your spellwork or alchemy somehow packed into this incredibly stylish small bag. No it’s not empty, even if someone look inside bag they can’t remember what lie inside, and this is totally not something so horrible that mind refusing to comprehend content of bag to protect fragile sanity of observer. All you need just put your hand inside and thinking what you need, miraculously you find this here. This work only if it needed reagents for magic and alchemy, not personal enrichment, if you want simply sell what you take from bag something inside will very painfully bite you hand regardless how tough or invulnerable you are. 
"
829,,200,Alchemical Knowledge,The Witcher Novels,Making,"Alchemy is a key part of a Witcher’s toolset; witchers are masters of crafting not only potions to further enhance their superhuman abilities but also bombs, weapon oils and other chemical contraptions. In future worlds you will be just as capable at creating analogies of these mixtures as you are at creating those found within this world. Just remember that certain alchemical creations are ​not for the consumption of the standard populace. Who knows if that poor woman will be cured of her ailment by the use of a witcher’s brew; she might get better, or ​much worse. "
830,,200,Flying Devices,Bleach,Making,"In the human world, which has little to no ambient spirit energy in the atmosphere, Shinigami and
other Spirit Beings are able to diffuse their own spirit energy into the air in order to stand or fly. This
same task becomes impossible in places with with spirit energy, such as Hueco Mundo or Soul
Society. To give you an edge over others in places like these, we bestow you with two devices that
enable flight. The first is a long wand of bone and some other material; by channeling their spirit
energy into the wand, a tentacle will wrap around the user’s arm, while a series of bony protrusions
will stretch outwards and form a wing. The second is a brown mantle displaying the Shihoin Clan
Crest, which is as easy to use as slinging it over your shoulders. While the wand allows for speedy
flight but takes up one’s hand while in use, the mantle allows for sustained floating and causes no
real impairment. Neither are very hard to use at all, with even beginners being able to use them with
ease. "
831,,200,Hojiku-Zai,Bleach,Making,"A limited production drug developed by Mayuri Kurotsuchi, and normally kept for his personal use. The Hojiku-Zai, also known as Flesh-Healing Medicine, is presented as a green fluid sloshing around
in a syringe. When administered, it will cause rapid regeneration of the recipients body parts, able to
quickly mend large wounds or even entire missing limbs. Not quite so effective with vital organs, but
then most wouldn’t survive long enough for it to be administered anyway. There is the unfortunate
side effect of intense pain while the drug is in effect, but I’m sure you can grit through that in return
for a lost arm, right? You receive three vials per day, with the contents usually being expended after
one use. "
832,,200,Bakkōtō,Bleach,Making,"An extremely illegal weapon whose creation and methods are kept as secrets of the Kasumioji Clan. Similar to Zanpakutō, Bakkōtō are weapons that can have many varied supernatural powers from
one to the next. The latter is more sinister however, a parasitic monster consisting of roiling flesh
bonded to an exotic weapon, and spreading to the wielder’s arm or body when in use. You may
dictate the shape of the weapon at the time of purchase. Bakkōtō do not have release states,
instead feeding on the wielder’s reiatsu to fuel strange, innate abilities that become stronger and
more flexible the more reiatsu they’re fed. This potentially even leaves to release state like
transformations, albeit these tend to be more permanent changes. Their parasitic nature would
threaten the user with their reiatsu and mind being consumed in time, but those with great enough
power are able to placate it. Yours, even if you don’t reach this level, will be more docile towards
you; but the same can’t be said if others attempt to wield it without sufficient strength. "
833,,200,Ancestral Zanpakuto,Bleach,Making,"Not all Zanpakuto are personal tools, made from the soul of one Shinigami. Some are the result of an
entire family line, each holding and passing down a mighty weapon. Rather than an ordinary weapon, you possess one of these ancestral tools instead. For some reason, possessing this Zanpakuto doesn't prevent you from wielding your own Asauchi. The ancestral Zanpakuto
is set in it’s ways, with already established powers independent of your own. While this means they
will not grow with you further through power or maturation, it also means that every ancestral
weapon is already mighty. They possess incredible and often numerous abilities as a result. A mirror
blade that perfectly scatters, reflects and even destroys those said to be ‘gods’ is one example. Another is a sword with the ability to copy and manifest the abilities of any Zanpakuto the wielder
has seen, scaling these individual powers to the user’s own level of Reiryoku. These are only
examples of their Shikai, as well. The downsides are that they usually entail a cost or significant threat to the wielder as a result of this
power. The mirror blade, Shinken Hakkyoken, can result in the wielder’s destruction if they don’t have the strength to hold it against the reflected attacks. The copy sword, Enrakyoten, drains from
the life force of the user to mimic other Zanpakuto. Perhaps some of these downsides can be
countered with skill or enough power but for now, they remain in tact. Other than their inability to grow with you, they work as normal for Zanpakuto. You may apply the
below options to them, they possess a Spirit, a Shikai and Bankai, as well as the other limitations of a
soul sword. If desired, you can also pass the sword on to a descendant. False Release- 100"
834,,200,Wandering Spirit,Bleach,Making,"A Zanpakuto spirit cut off from their own, having either died or rejected their spirit. Somehow, they’ve come to forge a connection with you instead and, after a great deal of troubled thinking, offered something sure to be quite, quite illegal in the eyes of the Central 46. You’ve against all odds
managed to bond with a second Zanpakuto Spirit, one originally created from another Shinigami. The functions and problems of such a connection, their soul being not of your own, will be entirely
new issues as such an act is almost unheard of. Purchasing this, as opposed to a companion, will allow you to have somewhat succeeded already. Through understanding of each other, you have unlocked the Shikai state of your new ally. Unlike
normal, this Zanpakuto is designed with powers based on the soul of a different person than yourself, though their level of power is still relative to your own."
835,,200,Famous Sword,The Lord of the Rings,Making,"You have an ancient and unparalleled blade, possibly with extra powers. A Elven Blade that warns you of danger, a sword of the Numenor that grants swiftness in battle, or a Mithril Waraxe from the height of Moria’s Craft, the choice is yours.”"
836,,200,Ingredient Pouch,Bofuri,Making,"NWO may give players a finite inventory space, but you’ve got so many different ingredients that you need access to. And playing inventory management simulator 20XX is just a pain.

The Ingredient Pouch provides infinite space for you to put crafting ingredients in. (And before you argue that “this sword is an ingredient because it’s used in that recipe to upgrade it,” I’ve already heard it. Nope. Its primary purpose is as a weapon, so it’s not an ingredient.)"
837,,200,Trapezohedron,Final Fantasy XIII,Making,"A prism that casts no shadow when light is shone on it. Once exposed to a weapon, it adds a quality to that weapon opposite to one trait the weapon possesses. (If the weapon deals fire damage, it now also deals ice. If the weapon is ranged, now it also bears a blade). Can only be used once per weapon and the trait it picks is random."
838,,200,C’ieth Stone,Final Fantasy XIII,Making,"A C’ieth stone, the leftover remains of a L’Cie who failed in their calling. It appears this one is a bit odd, because it randomly contacts the dead. Sometimes the dead just want to say hi, but other times they may have jobs for you – which probably don’t have a reward waiting at the end. Useful to talk to the dead with though, and gives undead a voice they otherwise may not have."
839,,200,Sword of Attacus,Final Fantasy XIII,Making,"You happened upon a meter long blade when you woke up. It appears that other people cannot see it, but this blade will not leave your side. When you fight with it, it grows as you take damage, until it is as long as you are tall. It reverts back to its original length as you heal."
840,,200,Slayer’s​ ​Scythe,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Making,"This scythe seems to fragile for any serious reaping work, but it cuts souls, not wheat. A blade of thin, almost translucent black metal sits at the end of a length of blackened wood, worn by aeons of use. Other than the wielder, any mortals who touch the blade have their souls severed from their body. If unwilling to kill, the blade instead causes a paralyzingly painful cold. The scythe leaves no visible wounds after it’s blade passes through a living body."
841,,200,Spirit-Cutting​ ​Sword,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Making,"When wielding this blade, you can sense nearby spirits and can see even hidden ones as a hazy outline or smear of darkness. This blade cuts through such creatures easily and has no trouble attacking those who are incorporeal. You may import another melee weapon to gain this property."
842,,200,Flaming​ ​Sword​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Making,This weapon is a shadow of the weapon Michael raised against Lucifer and burns with a bright flame that refuses to harm it’s wielder. It’s flames burn hot enough to superheat steel and can cause nearby flammables to simply ignite from its intense heat. You may import another melee weapon to gain this property
843,,200,Ghostwater products,Cradle V1,Making,"You gain 3 fountains in your warehouse, producing dream water, life water, spirit water, dream water, and once per jump you get 10 drops of ghost water in vials."
844,,200,Skysworn armor,Cradle V1,Making,"This armor comes with some awesome features. A dream construct that can send long range messages like a radio, a thousand-mile cloud in the compartment on the back, triggerable defensive wind barriers, passive defenses in the form of scripts that weakened hostile madra and spiritual attacks, and a long list of additional options that can be added by Soulsmiths. This baby does it all, except defend against attacks that can affect the spiritual and physical world at the same time."
845,,200,Scale machine,Cradle V1,Making,"You gain a small device the size of the planter with handles. You can pump your madra into it, and it will pump out the currency of the world, scales. Condensed madra made solid. This machine is special, you get a 1:2 ratio of madra in to scales out."
846,,200,Badges,Cradle V1,Making,"You gain a simple badge that you pin to your clothing. As you advance, it will change its size and material to represent whatever stage of advancement you’ve achieved. As you start out at foundation stage, it starts out at wood."
847,,200,Wealth beyond dreams,Cradle V1,Making,"You have lived such a charmed life under the care of your parents, and why stop once you leave. Once a year, you gain a cache of elixirs and pills that will be incredibly potent and can help you advance whenever you need it. These are the highest quality and will update in other worlds to be made of the most beneficial materials. Think meat from 1000-year-old dragons, and lettuce that been frozen in an iceberg for a million years."
848,,200,Solar/Lunar Disc,Egyptian Mythology,Making,"A highly visible mark of your favor with one or more of the solar or lunar deities (Ra, Aten, Raet- Tawy, Khonsu etc.), it rests just above your head, either with a framing head dress or floating in position. It is, in truth, not a disc, but a fully-fledged miniature sun (or moon), somewhere between basketball and beach ball in size, as radiant as the celestial body is in the sky. As well as providing a controllable source of pure celestial light (either sunlight or moonlight), its presence repels creatures who favour the darkness, burning demons, unfriendly spirits and any hostile deceased of Duat like they have touched red-hot metal or been scaled with boiling oil. You are immune to any negative effects of having a small sun or moon in such close proximity. If you purchase both solar and lunar versions, your celestial disc may swap between sun and moon, and in its lunar incarnation, may swap between different phases of the lunar cycle, its light being treated as coming from the moon in that phase.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
849,,200,Magical Stone,Marvel Zombies,Making,"This isn’t one thing. It’s a choice between two. You can have one of two options - either the Amulets of Damballah or the Bloodstone. The former are a pair of golden pendants with a snake design. Steeped in voodoo lore, they’re involved with the creation of zombies. Not the flesh-eating kind we’ve been talking about, but the sort bokors used to reanimate. You wear one amulet. The other can be worn by a zombie, who will become your thrall as long as they wear it. They’re incapable of taking it off. If you are capable of necromancy, the amulet will amplify such arts.

Alternatively, you can have the Bloodstone (sometimes called the Bloodgem). It’s a heirloom of the monster-hunting family of the same name. Bloodstone, that is. That  family used the stone to boost their already-redoubtable prowess to superhuman levels. The stone boosts your physical strength, durability, reflexes and speed to a level where you might give Spidey some difficulty, gives you a regenerative healing factor and immortality. You can also fire energy blasts, but only from one hand. The stone makes you immune to vampire bites - rather, any vampire that dares sink their fangs into you won’t exist for much longer. That doesn’t mean anything to zombies, though. The caveat to this is that you have to keep the stone on your person. 

By taking this twice, you can have both the Amulets of Damballah and the Bloodstone.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
850,,200,Perfected Nethicite,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"A shard of perfected nethicite, strong enough to inhibit all magick within a ten meter radius. Spells will fizzle out as they hit the outer boundary, and magick users will have a hard time drawing out arcane power. You could grow this by inserting it into a person, but that would really be cruel and hideous of you to do."
851,,200,Bunny’s Tail ,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"“A vorpal bunny’s tail has magical properties, but most notably, when mixed with a slightly acidic concoction, it can create a compound that makes things transparent until the end of time. Have a suit you want to make see through? Want to see through a wall? One tail is good for ten mixtures.” You suppose there could be uses to making things transparent... The shopkeeper points you to the disclaimer sign. “If used on living beings, beware they may become permanently invisible!”"
852,,200,Matamune,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"A fishing rod that seems to glow when you look at it. The shopkeeper nods vigorously, as if urging you to take it. “That there is the Matamune, the rod with no equal! You’ll catch a fish no matter what waters you cast your reel into – though you might have to wait hours – even if you’re certain the waters hold nothing, you’ll still catch something!”"
853,,200,Forbidden Chest ,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"You spawn a set of sixteen chests in a square grid around you. Fifteen of those chests are bugged so that if they are opened, a spear will shoot out at whoever opened it. One of those chests is rigged so that if it is opened, all of the chests explode.

The chests are as large as a human, so it gets in people’s way rather well. Typically once a day has passed, the chests will self detonate – however, if you attempt to summon more than eighty, it seems the oldest chests will also detonate as the magick supporting it falls apart."
854,,200,Nectar and Ambrosia,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Making,"The food and drink of the gods, guaranteed to cause mortals to instantly turn to fire and sand if consumed, with demigods to do so as well if they consume too much. Despite the fact that it's only truly safe for godly consumption, it also boasts an extreme healing effect able to set and mend even life threatening injuries and as such is treated as both a commodity and a valuable resource around these parts. They also have a strange magic to always taste like the consumer’s favorite food and drink as an added bonus. You start out with a baggie filled with ambrosia squares and a canteen of nectar, which each refill every week."
855,,200,Monster Killing Metals        ,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Making,"About ten pounds of Celestial Bronze, Imperial Gold or Stygian Iron. All made to destroy godly and monstrous creatures (save the last, which also hurts mortals) weapons crafted from these materials are incredibly durable and able to hold enchantments of the like seen in ancient myth. Your supply restocks every two weeks, with the type of metal delivers being of your choice."
856,,200,★ Outfits,Black★Rock Shooter,Making,"A wardrobe, here? Huh... well, this wardrobe attached to your workshop or placed somewhere inconspicuously in one of your homes or Territory is filled to the brim with clothes and outfits that fit the general aesthetic of the Otherworld, kinda skimpy for some, elegant for others, lots of hoods, giant bladed heels and removable claw arms, due to being made of thought and emotion these clothes are as about as durable and sharp as your will and wit and restore themselves quickly after they’re destroyed. They fit you perfectly, and can resize for anyone who is trying to wear them. Most of them have a star pattern on them, though you can go without them. They are quite iconic and seem to inspire hope when seen by your friends or allies."
857,,200,Corrbolg,Irish Mythology,Making,"A bag made from the hide of Aífe, a woman cursed and transformed into a crane, it was the possession of Mannann for many years before passing through various heroes' hands, accumulating treasures though many of purely sentimental value. One of these was the backbone of a whale, so it’s safe to assume the bag is a great deal bigger on the inside, and will keep your things safe and dry. Can only be opened by you or with your permission."
858,,200,Uaithne,Irish Mythology,Making,"The Dagda made the first harp, and the first music, and when it was stolen for a time, all the world turned bleak and joyless. It has a special power to enhance music played with it, to make people laugh, or dance or weep as the feelings your music stirs are so much... more to the listener. Finally, it can return if you dedicate a good song to it, in legend killing nine Fomor on its flight home."
859,,200,Fragarach,Irish Mythology,Making,"A sword of the sea god Mannan, once wielded by Lugh, that can part metal and stone as easily as silk. Further, who wields Fragarach can command the winds, and none with the blade held to their throat can lie or fail to answer questions."
860,,200,Borabu,Irish Mythology,Making,"The great conch horn discovered by Oisin, all true warriors can hear the horn-blast, regardless of distance or obstacles, and make haste towards the sound."
861,,200,Little Black Book of Mischief,The Games We Play,Making,"In your trade it can be very useful, every now and then, to have certain types of
information on certain types of people. Which you do now, with this black book. This
is a collection of prime-quality blackmail information on some of the biggest
up-and-coming movers and shakers in your neck of the woods, information they
would go to a lot of trouble to keep away from the public eye.
The kind of people you have info on are never the topmost rungs of the ladder, of
course. But things like the habits and depravities of middle-management, just the
people you can bully into working for you, or information a whole company would
want to suppress, like how Dust is running out... such things and more are what these
books are full of."
862,,200,The Long Memory,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Making,The very same Weapon that Ozpin build in his previous lives... or more accurately would build at some point. This cane has the ability to store kinetic energy and release it in the form of magical blasts. This can be done in small portions or all at once at your digression or even done to form shields. The energy will automatically regenerate but said process will last a long time. Expect at least a year for something that could block the blast of a more powerful magic user.
863,,200,Craig Blueprints ,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"Blueprints and spells required to create the crystals used for teleportation between craigs such as those found at the craigs of Holla, Dem, and Mea along with the corresponding spells to allow one to quickly teleport between them."
864,,200,Monstrosity Orb,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"A large glowing orb that rather draws the eye, this orb is the monstrosity orb! By placing your hand on it your mind will go into a artificially created monster body, though no powers are usable but the monsters own you can level up and achieve new bodies by killing and devouring other monsters. When your monsters body is destroyed or you decide to stop participating in monstrosity you will return to your body. Though the orb is useable by anyone who touches it there is a size limit on the monsters you can become, nothing larger than a large van is compatible with the monstrosity process."
865,,200,Coruscant Rosary,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"A rosary that glows with an eerie light. It has the power to weaken magic seals of any and all kinds, allowing you to enter areas or unleash beings you really probably shouldn't."
866,,200,Ahnenerbe(Third Tier)        ,Dies Irae,Making,"Your own Ahnenerbe. This magical artefact has been bound to be part of your very soul. Relics are often famous artefacts of myth like Excalibur or personal objects of the user, such as a memento of their past. Whatever it may be, the process of turning it into a Relic transforms it. The artefact is filled with countless curses and powerful grudges, bound with numerous enchantments and spells and even imbued with a part of your own will, the item is transformed into a weapon unlike anything else. 

The relic is a powerful weapon that strikes the physical and spiritual at the same time, tearing apart the soul of whatever it hits. Any injury inflicted by a relic is cursed and filled with unnatural venom, making it near impossible to heal for someone without regeneration on the level of an Ewigkeit user and even then, slowing their speed. They are even more effective than normal against particularly old beings and the relics will grow in power as you gain more souls. They are powered by your spiritual strength and thus need no resources to work, such as guns never needing physical ammunition. You are able to control them with your mind as if you were physically wielding them, such as summoning and firing gun relics independent of your body in the air behind you. 

Your relic is a part of your soul and exists entirely within it most of the time. Once you learn to manifest it, it will be able to be called and dismissed from your soul at will. If it is destroyed however, it will be as if your own soul has been destroyed as well. 

An Ahnenerbe can be many things. A single sword, your own body, a collection of torture tools or an entire armoury. The following section will guide you on what to pick for your relic and offer some additional customisation options. 

Tiers
Relics are not limited to a single shape and the following three tiers will dictate how your relic is
expressed. You need only buy the tier you wish for, not the below tiers. 

Third Tier
The final tier allows a frightening degree of expansion. Relics at this level may include things as large and powerful as an aircraft carrier or battleship or as numerous as, quite literally, every gun used by the Nazis during World War 2, from personal weapons to artillery guns mounted on rails.

Requires Ahnenerbe(Second Tier) to Purchase"
867,,200,Contact Lenses ,Hotel Transylvania,Making,"Huh, these contact lenses are weird. Not only do they correct for any vision allowing people with even the slightest sight to have 20/20 vision but also protects the user from any sight based attacks or abilities. Things such as hypnosis or non euclidean eldritch geometry will have no effect on a person wearing these contacts. Also comes in Glasses form though those can be removed far more easily."
868,,200,Throne of Fire,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making,"Said to be a gift from Odin, this surprisingly comfortable iron throne (albeit not one made from swords) serves as a proof of legitimacy, as this throne will burn anyone but the rightful ruler who sits on it with holy fire. There may be beings strong enough to survive its flames, but that will not hide that they are struck by the wrath of the gods for their false claim at rulership. Each jump you can choose which specific nation’s rule it judges, and it will import into the appropriate place to be the seat of its head of state and it will be well known that none can rule - and be recognized by the people as having right to do so - without being able to sit in the throne.

What exactly determines a ruler’s right to rule will vary between time and place. But it’d be perfect for detecting rigged elections in a democracy, that the psychotic manchild king is the illegitimate child of his own uncle, or that the dynasty has officially lost the mandate of heaven."
869,,200,Obviously Prop Weapon,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making,"This medieval melee weapon of choice looks like an obvious, cheaply made prop, the sort that if you squint and work to suspend disbelief you might be able to pretend it’s a real weapon. Tests and examination will reveal it to be nothing more than a cheap prop, and for anyone else that’s all it is. But in your hands this sword will be fully functional, able to cut as well as any other blade, and even sturdy enough for you to use it as a weapon no matter how strong you become. In the hands of anyone else who you have not given authority to wield it, it will be nothing more than a prop, and you can rescind or bestow this authority with nothing more than a thought.

You will find that it is easy and acceptable to bring this sword along with you to almost anywhere, as it is dismissed as a safe, non-weapon prop by those who see it and have not seen it used as a true weapon. This will even include places where props would not normally be allowed as being too dangerous, though you might get odd looks.

If this weapon is broken while a prop it will immediately repair itself when you touch it once more. If it is broken when normal, or lost, it will be replaced within 24 hours."
870,,200,Such Expensive Tastes,The God of High School Jump,Making,"Certain Charyeok require regular treats to keep them happy and motivated. Certain humans too. It gets a bit expensive indulging your partners and loved ones over and over though, so this suitcase might help take that load off. A simple black leather case, what’s inside is where the value is. As you open the case, you’ll be able to think of any piece of mundane jewellery you’ve got your eye or a friend’s eye on. Once you fully open the case, it’ll be right there waiting for you. You’re even able to make multiple copies. Problem is, the more expensive the gift you ask for, the longer it’ll take before the brief case works again. Just want a gold bar or two? The case will be good to go in an hour or two. Wanting an enormous ruby and sapphire encrusted necklace of pure diamond, platinum and gold? Might take a good few months before you get another use."
871,,200,Weighted Clothing,The God of High School Jump,Making,"A classic staple of martial artists everywhere, at least in some realities. You’ve got a set weight clothes, coming in a full set from cloak and shirt to socks and shoes and everything in between. The more you wear at once, the heavier you’ll find it weighs upon you. Putting everything on at once will leave you barely able to crawl, at least until you work that weight off. It’ll never get outdated either, as soon as you are able to comfortably wear the full set of clothing without much trouble, it’ll increase its burden until you’re back to crawling and need to work your way back up again. Won’t make for great fashion either but at least you’ll spend a lot less on weights."
872,,200,Weapon Creation,The God of High School Jump,Making,"You have the ability to create weapons from nothing but the energy that dwells within your form. Any sort of martial weapon, from swords to spears to whips to hammers, can be created with little more than a thought and then directed with nothing more than your mental commands. Whilst you could simply fire these weapons en masse at any target like they were bullets, you may also wield them as if you help them in your hands, though the concentration to do so will mean that you will have to train to wield more than a small number at once in this way, at least to any great effect. The number and the size of the weapons you create will increase as your own power does."
873,,200,Aegis Shield,The God of High School Jump,Making,The spirit of the legendary Aegis carried by Athena and Zeus. This Charyeok manifests as a full body energy armour made of transparent energy shards. These shads can split up and move as the user wills. They can be used to attack as a swarm of flying energy knives or form into singular weapons for the user to wield or to enhance the user’s existing weapons. They can also be formed into larger weapons on their own and fight independently of the user or form shields or platforms to defend or stand on.
874,,200,Adam and Eve,The God of High School Jump,Making,"A pair of holy pistols. The ammunition for these two guns is reliant on the life energy of the user, which is turned into Silver Bullets as the two guns fire. Silver Bullets do significantly increased damage to any God or Demon that is struck by them, then the energy bullets would normally do."
875,,200,Bong Seon,The God of High School Jump,Making,"A mystical long sword passed down through the family of one Yu Mi-Ra for generations. It has no unique abilities of its own, simply the innate traits of a National Treasure and a terrifyingly sharp edge."
876,,200,Tiny Dragon’s Nunchuks,The God of High School Jump,Making,"The Tiny Dragon’s Nunchuks take the form of a basic black coloured Nunchaku. A simple Treasure, they are able to change between two alternate forms as the user wills it. A long black spear combining the two Nunchuks, named Large Dragon Spear, or a pair of Tonfas named Bruce and Lee."
877,,200,Jinxy’s Auctions,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Making,"This Item comes in the form of a Caravan that can occasionally visit you. You can not steal from it but the owner Jinxy has quite the interesting wares. He will exchange them to you for a variety of things, every Item purchasing here functioning under the rules of the Auspicious Auction Perk. It is but a matter of what you are willing to trade."
878,,200,DRESS SPHERE,Final Fantasy X,Making,"Well, in case you’re really lazy and you have issues with actually going out and hunting for Dress Spheres, I have some in stock that you can pick and choose from. That’s right, even if you’re not a Sphere Hunter you can still use them. God it’ll be awkward to see you Guardians transform. Wait...how does a Cactuar even transform?

You don’t need a Garment Grid to utilize the power within the Dress Spheres – but it would help in amplifying their powers. There are other Dress Spheres out there in Spira – so go out and hunt them all down!

Gunner

Shoots guns, specialist in taking down wildlife. You have a wide range of shots to choose from, and a gun with unlimited bullets. You can also shoot really fast when you need to.

Thief

Steals things: self-explanatory isn’t it? Ok fine, you also have an ability to disassemble machina at will. And you also have an easier time pilfering things from even inanimate objects. Not sure why you wanted to steal that apple from the tree though.

Warrior

Your normal sword swinging warrior. Has most of the abilities you’d expect from somebody swinging a massive hunk of steel. Pretty good durability too.

Songstress

You sing, and things get a bit weird. You can inflict statuses upon enemies by singing. Maybe because you have no singing voice, but I jest. In odd occasions you’ll find yourself compelled to dance and sing out of the blue.

Black Mage

A specialist in the four destructive elements, fire, ice, lightning and water. Your spells grow from just the basics to massive area spells. Just run away before they file you for property damage.

White Mage

You heal people! Goodness knows we need healers with all the damage Sin is causing! Unfortunately you’re also a bit of a pacifist with this Dress Sphere, so you can’t fight more than swinging a rod to bonk somebody.

Gun Mage

You can hunt specific monsters even better than Gunners can! But you do need to designate your target. Also, similar to the Ronso’s racial ability, you can learn enemy attacks. You just need to survive it first.

Trainer

Pick a pet, and you’ll be able to train this pet into a ferocious fighting machine! Could be a monkey, an eagle, a dog, or really any small sized animal that you like. Small, because things tend to get awkward when you have a pet Shoopuf try to enter the house.

Berserker

You get really angry, and when you do, you tend to get really destructive. You swing around with your fists and break things – but somehow you have enough mental capacity to weave in and out of a fight flawlessly. You’ve basically become the master of “Angry Fist”.

879,,200,CAT’S NIP,Final Fantasy X,Making,"It’s another weird looking charm, though this one looks like a herb instead of a normal ribbon. Whenever you have this charm on and you’re knocked into a critical status, everything you do seems to triple in effect – a last ditch measure fitting for a desperate struggle. The effect of this fades immediately once you’re safely outside critical condition."
880,,200,Grid Designer,Final Fantasy X,Making,"A more advanced way of using the dress spheres is by placing them within grids. While the grids that you make won’t have any particular effect to them to begin with, it does help anyone trying to learn how to use a dress sphere by making it easier for them to manipulate the powers of the spheres. Making a garment grid doesn’t take much effort or many resources at all – and though it’ll take a substantial amount of time, eventually you’ll be able to merge grids together as well to share their effects."
881,,200,Salvaged Goods,Final Fantasy X,Making,"Lots of fiends will be harassing you, and with lots of fiends...well you’ll find plenty of loot as well. Sometimes you’ll even find that the fiends leave equipment behind when they fall – but not necessarily equipment that you actually need. That can certainly be a headache, especially when there’s no merchant nearby to sell your things off to.

Good thing that you can break down equipment with simple tools and recover a good portion of the materials which were used to make them. At least it’s better than having to leave equipment behind because it had no worth to you."
882,,200,Distillation,Final Fantasy X,Making,"Spheres...the exact science behind how they work, what they are, is still not understood by many. Few outside the Church of Yevon truly understand spheres; even fewer will ever find themselves needing to possess that knowledge. But when you know how something works...you know how to manipulate it as well.

Fiends and monsters you lay low will always drop a sphere of a specific type. Aggressive beasts may drop attack spheres, passive beasts may drop defense spheres, but with these spheres you can slowly enhance yourself, or another, or even an item. It’d be more effective if you had a system which could manipulate spheres or perhaps some enhancement skills...but this will provide you with the basic step."
883,,200,Vagrant Merchant ,Final Fantasy X,Making,"You might not be the 23rd generation of any notable family, but thankfully, you don’t need to be in order to become a wandering merchant of renown. After all, the fact that you wander about selling things to begin with will probably get you into more than one Guardian’s good graces – supplies are hard to come by in the wilderness after all.

That being said, a certain “merchant extraordinaire” seems to be kind enough to ensure that you’ll always be stocked with a sum of mundane goods, like potions and whatnot. He doesn’t really care what you do with these, but considering his supply drops show up rarely...you probably shouldn’t depend on them too excessively. As a merchant though, bribing people will come a fair bit easier.

Did I say bribe? I meant negotiation of course…"
884,,200,Torashinai,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"This totally ordinary shinai comes with a cute yellow tiger accessory. It is completely normal and any feelings of impending, utter doom that surround the blade and its wielder are simply imaginations on behalf of the viewer. If such an aura did exist, it would be quite effective in unbalancing any opponents the wielder might have. But such an idea is obviously foolish. "
885,,200,Tools of the Trade,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"Every wizard needs a wand and a cauldron and you're no different. If you have not picked The Family Art at least once, buying this will simply give you a series of tools to enhance the power of Formalcraft to a good degree. However, purchasing The Family Art will mean this perk can instead grant you specialised tools for that specific magic specialisation. These tools will always take the form of very useful enhancers or ingredients to the specific magic form. Gem craft users will gain a bag filled with high quality gems, all of which respawn a day after they have been destroyed through use. Alchemy users will gain large assortments of alchemical tools, all of the highest quality craftsmanship that will never break. If you have taken The Family Art more than once and also bought this option, further purchases of this option will be discounted to you, with it being reduced to 50cp per buy for Magus Heirs as they gain both discounts at once.

886,,200,Bloodsealing,Elantris,Making,"Originating in Dzhamar, the often-scorned art of bloodsealing is as useful as it is unsettling. Using blood-ink and stamps made of bone, bloodsealers can craft intricate runes to animate and command skeletal constructs. Built from human skeletons, these constructs can be used as servants, soldiers, or even trackers. Skeletals may also be crafted to form specific tasks, such as guarding a room or serving a designated master. Though fresh blood is needed to initially animate a skeletal, these constructs only require periodical upkeep. Other uses for bloodsealing also exist, such as creating alarms or tracking down specific individuals, however that requires blood that is both fresh and taken from the person of interest."
887,,200,Forgery,Elantris,Making,"A versatile and powerful art native to MaiPon, Forgery uses specially-carved stamps to alter the past of an object, transforming that object into something else. The carvings that go into each stamp are incredibly intricate, dictating exactly how the target’s soul must change to reflect the desired physical transformation. Forgeries that create drastic transformations will last for a shorter duration, if the original object even “takes” the stamp at all. For example, it would be easier to transform an unpainted wall into a heavily decorated one than it would be to forge a cheap cup into an antique vase. The more plausible the transformation, the more likely it is to last. Forgery can also be used to alter an organic body for multiple effects. Forgers like the Resealers use their powers to heal injuries, transforming damaged flesh and organs into unscathed bodies. There are even groups like the Soulforgers who can rewrite a person’s personality, memories, or even their very spiritual essence to grant them different skills and experiences. However, this amazing technique is not without its drawbacks. Because the human soul is constantly growing and changing, no forgery attached to a person will remain for more than 24 hours, requiring regular reapplication. The souls of objects are more fixed, however, and inanimate stamps may last indefinitely if well preserved and protected from damage."
888,,200,Essence Mark        ,Elantris,Making,"This pocket-sized blasphemy is one of the most complex constructs a Forger can make; a soulstamp built to alter the very soul of a person. Crafted from the lattice of one hundred smaller stamps, each Essence Mark rewrites the target individual’s memories, history, and even soul for a short period of time, allowing for both stunning transformations and a wide variety of experiences and skills. For example, a well-crafted essence mark might rewrite one’s soul to someone who was raised as a warrior, temporarily imparting them with the body and training of a skilled fighter. A different mark might change the target’s history to make them a former street-urchin, giving them the years of experience in sneaking and thievery for the duration of the stamping.

Like all essence marks, this soulstamp is specifically crafted to affect a specific individual. Upon purchase, you may designate either yourself or another person as the stamp’s target. As it is of the finest construction, this essence mark will rewrite the target’s soul for a full 24 hours before it needs to be reapplied. See the Notes section for additional details on the transformation."
889,,200,Lockbox,Elantris,Making,"Made by the finest Svordish locksmiths, this heavy steel box is protected by several intricate combination locks, false dials, and other complex mechanisms. Completely tamper-proof, one would have to physically destroy the hardened steel exterior to access the safe’s contents. Additionally, this lockbox has been reinforced with a secret, invaluable layer of protection; a thin lining of Ralkalest. Known as the unForgeable Metal, this material will shield the contents of the safe from any hostile Investiture or magic while also blocking any supernatural interaction with the objects inside. Though this safe may still be physically breached, it will take far more effort than most would spend to get a crack at your valuables."
890,,200,Practice Uniform,Elantris,Making,"Specially made to protect sparring fencers, this light gray coverall contains the padding and hardened leather to protect you during your training, no matter how vigorous or intense that training is. Additionally, this practice armor bestows a second benefit; while wearing it, you’ll find you learn new fighting styles at twice your normal speed. Why, with more of these uniforms and a decent teacher, you could turn a bunch of middle-aged socialites into a confident athletic troop in just weeks."
891,,200,Smuggler’s Crates,Elantris,Making,"At first glance, these boxes may seem painfully ordinary. However this is all by careful design! Perfect for smuggling contraband, this set of crates will alter their size to best fit their cargo, ranging from hand-held boxes to large wagon-filling chests. When filled with illicit goods, you’ll find these boxes will be easier to move than they should be, and will arouse less suspicion from local law enforcement. These would be perfect for stealing artifacts or sneaking weapons into a forbidden city."

895,,200,Pumice Piece,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"It’s just a piece of volcanic ash right? It shouldn’t be anything special, but as long as you hold it, you can absorb most incoming attacks and spells of the Holy or Shadow element. It also teaches you how to boost yourself up for a short period, increasing your own power."
896,,200,Feather Boots,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"These boots don’t seem very substantial even when you hold them, but the moment you put them on, you’ll realize that you’re floating slightly above the ground. It’s not just that! It also teaches you a spell so you can levitate."
897,,200,Coral Ring,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"How did they attach corals to this thing? Well it’s a bit cumbersome, so I don’t need it anymore, but it’ll teach you some basic tricks to becoming a master spear user while you hold it. It also neatly prevents you from falling asleep."
898,,200,Moonstone,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"This stone teaches you how to identify the critical flaws on enemies, but also how to cast a spell called “Shell”, which reduces magic damage on whoever it was cast on. Neat eh? Oh, it has no passive effects except looking shiny."
899,,200,Lapis Lazuli,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"Well I suppose this stone is a bit unique, because it doesn’t actually teach you anything, it just amplifies all of your abilities slightly. At least your accuracy with ranged weapons improves significantly!"
900,,200,Emerald,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"This stone here rather, teaches you how to increase your own speed in all things, as well as recover your own magical reserves slightly. It increases your magic pool somewhat."
901,,200,Diamond,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"The stone will eventually teach you the skill to control your internal body temperature, but unfortunately this burns your energy to do it. It does however, allow you to divert attention away from yourself passively."
902,,200,THE CLOVER,Inscryption,Making,"To ensure luck remains on your side. When you draw your opening hand, a small clover will sprout from the earth alongside it. You may pluck the clover to shuffle and draw again, getting a second chance to draw what you were looking for. Additionally, any time you receive a randomized reward (Inscryption-based or otherwise), there too the clover will sprout, allowing you a single reroll of the dice.

903,,200,Dagger Key,Knight’s and Magic,Making,"One of the dangers of this world is that nobody bothered to create a security system for the giant robots despite all the espionage or terrorism. That’s where this dagger comes in, it's inscribed with a magical sigil that can’t be replicated, recreated or even examined by anyone you don’t grant access to. This dagger will find its way back to your pocket whenever you need it and all of your vehicles have been given a slot for it to work. This can also be used to unlock locked doors or chest that you don’t have a key for."
904,,200,A Relic of Old Faith,Cult of the Lamb,Making,"A relic, hand-crafted by the madwoman Chemach, has found its way to your possession. These relics channel the dregs of power of gods and other powerful beings, affording even those unable to wield the magic of these lands a fighting chance against the horrors of the Old Faith. (See notes for details)"
905,,200,A Mystic Armament,Cult of the Lamb,Making,"Barring the weapons of the gods, you have been granted access to one of the more esoteric weapons of these lands. In your hands rests a tool that far outstrips simple armaments of iron and steel. Poison your foes, steal their fervor or vitality for yourself, strike with guided hands at their weakest points, or channel their souls to tear through their fellows, the choice is yours. (See notes for details)"
906,,200,A Curious Necklace,Cult of the Lamb,Making,"A selection of one of five necklaces, enchanted by the magic of the old faith. Feather, granting the wearer greater vigor and stamina and increasing their speed of movement twofold. Flower, making the wearer significantly more infatuated with whomever gave them the necklace. Moon, removing the wearer’s need to sleep. Nature, granting its owner enhanced productivity and yields from any endeavors they embark on, such as double the number of crops harvested from and field tended to by the owner. And finally Skull, granting unnatural long life to the wearer, twice what they could normally be expected to live. This item can be purchased up to five times, granting one of each type of necklace.

907,,200,Feathers of a Star: Hawk’s Blessing,Avesta of Black and White,Making,"The blessings of the Star Spirit Vohu Manah, located in a tattoo on a part of your skin, each of these feathers can be consumed in exchange for any of the five blessings of increased attack, increased defense, regeneration, teleportation, and flight. Yazata already gets this as part of their joining, but you will get a large number of them, comparable to that of Magsarion, and yours will regenerate on their own regardless of what the current Holy King or Vohu Manah desire, and without needing to return to Wahman Yast."
908,,200,Dishonourable Warrior: Gunslinger,Avesta of Black and White,Making,"The usage of firearms is really unsuited for this universe, let alone the Yazata, who value the refinement of their sword styles and the discipline that comes to attaining power through harsh training. After all, it is a combat style that doesn’t really display one’s martial prowess nor dedication, and while it can be quite effective at the lowest levels, it doesn’t really let much room for growth.

Perhaps you can prove them wrong. Not only do you have an aim that borders the supernatural, as you are able to nail several headshots in a row and even perform trick shots even without the usage of special abilities, but you have the ability to create bullets with your your own special powers, allowing you to channel them directly into the enemy if you manage to land a hit. Which shouldn’t be hard for you."
909,,200,Fixer License,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"Every Fixer needs a license, without one you’re just a vigilante without a Syndicate at best, and a Rat at worst. Thankfully you are properly certified through the Hana Association’s system, though you’re only a grade 5 right now or perhaps soon to be demoted if you’re not cut out for the industry, and every purchase afterward improves your grade by 1, up to grade 1 since not even the richest Fixer can just buy a Color, those are granted on merit alone. The license is special, however, impossible to counterfeit and also immediately accepted by anyone who needs to certify your identity or rank. And in later jumps, this can be turned into an ID of your choice with each purchase representing a higher ranked version.

910,,200,Battle Symbols,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"Almost every conflict is memorable in some way, be it a hard-won battle, a close debate, or even a one-sided tragedy. Regardless it would be nice to have physical reminders of your encounters, even just for reminiscing when you have time to kill or bringing up while talking with your associates. Though taking physical trophies is generally looked down on in most places, and also dangerous depending on who you take them from. Instead, you get small accessories and decorative marks occasionally, with a higher likelihood the more important or dangerous the event is to you, you can wear up to 9 at once, and each of them gives a minor boost or a slightly larger one that's conditional based on what you did to get it."
911,,200,EGOist        ,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"After the White Nights and Dark Days, the Distortion Phenomenon was not the only thing that arose across the City. People who aspired to something better than their current lot in life received more of the scraps of Light spread across the City, which would be able to bloom into a power known as EGO. You have a larger part of the Light than most, and given time and enough of a will to make your dreams into reality, the power of your EGO will be available to you. This does require dire circumstances to activate, such as avenging the death of a dearly loved one. This still works even if you’re already distorted, with your warped desires refined to the point where you’ve become something akin to the original intent of the Seed of Light rather than the stunted and unstable power present in most distortions."
912,,200,Meister’s Mark        ,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"Workshops can’t just work with just being decent, they need to set themselves apart by doing something special. Stigma Workshop doesn’t just make incendiary weapons but they also sear intricate patterns into their targets. While other workshops like YuRia Atelier have quality and quantity but demand premium memberships of their customers.

You now have a signature quality on whatever products you make, this can be a part of its functionality or aesthetic but regardless of what it is anyone familiar with the type of product you make will recognize it as your handiwork. This mark also makes it better or easier to produce in a specific way, like making a weapon that’s light while not sacrificing power, or giving muscle memory for making a usually complex key component. This can also be used to temporarily give Puffy Brume to anyone using one of your creations, as long as you also have that perk."
913,,200,Sealing Resources,Bibliomania,Making,"A collection of various woods, metals, papers, inks, tools and other equipment you may need to do any form of sealing magic you encounter. All of this is an infinite supply though the rarer the material and the more magically powerful the less you directly have available to the point that you only get a small box of the rarest materials an hour. Though always a usable amount."
914,,200,Stabilizing Injections,Bibliomania,Making,"This is a collection of needles that have a silver tinted green fluid that seems to lightly glow in the dark which have one very useful effect for those without supernatural defenses. With a single needle you can inject anyone who is in the middle of going through enhancement or suffering from some condition and within moments they will be fully stabilized and depending on the enhancement and condition will be improved. This means that using the needle with enhancements such as captain america's super soldier serum or Aldritch Killians Extremis will see them enhance to the peak of what the enhancements could give as well as perfect stability and compatibility, so no overheating or explosions from extremis for example. If suffering from something like the Rot or poison though this will stabilize and cure them fully per injection. You get an infinite supply of these injections in a small needle case and using it on someone without a condition or enhancement will simply provide minor healing and mental stability."
915,,200,Spectral Cogwheel,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Making,"Magic is a demanding discipline, draining your strength as surely as any physical forms of combat. To counteract this, cunning mages use this artifact to build up additional reserves of energy. While you have this item equipped, casting spells will grow the energy you have available for other special attacks. If you have the Limit Break perk, this artifact will charge your Limit Breaks. You can instead choose for your physical stamina or other reserves of energy to be charged by your spellcasting. With an artifact like this you can constantly alternate abilities, never giving your opponents any room to breath."
916,,200,Black Tie,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Making,"Despite their appearances, the Turks employ substantial defenses. This tailored suit is both fashionable and functional. You may have these garments shaped to any style you wish, so long as they are dress clothes. Laden with enchantments, this formal wear can defend against both physical weapons and magical attacks. It doesn’t matter if your work takes you to a pockmarked desert or a corporate battleground, you’ll always look stylish."
917,,200,Bullet Hammer ,Kurohime,Making,"The cursed lovechild of a warhammer and a revolver, this massive hammer has a head that looks like a revolver cylinder, complete with huge bullets. When you press the trigger, it will let loose all six bullets at once; the aim is terrible, but if you shoot right after hitting a target as a hammer, then at point-blank range it will unleash a devastating explosion sufficient to shatter large boulders."
918,,200,Magical Bullets,Kurohime,Making,"This is a case of 30 magical bullets, each set with a spell as per the Magic Bullets perk. These include spells such as Hulk Bullet, Soaring Talonfang Bullet, Mimic Bullet, Armor Piercing Poison Wasp Needle Bullet, and Binding Chain Snake Bullet. Each week these bullets refill, and you can choose a new set of spells to fill the bullets, but do take note that these are only equal to what you’d get with the first tier of the Magic Bullets perk. And remember—all that’s needed to cast the spell in these bullets is to fire them. You don’t need to actually be able to use magic to use these spells, just be able to pull a trigger.

If these spells are too weak for you, then for another undiscounted -100 BP, you can also include 10 bullets that are empowered by the advanced level of the Magic Bullets perk, letting you have a supply of spells such as Sakura Body Bullet, Full Body Metal Armor Bullet, Powerful Raging Dragon Body Bullet, Steel Teeth Dragon Bullet, or Phoenix Dragon Bullet."
919,,200,Gunslinger’s Best Friend ,Kurohime,Making,"You have a six-shooter. But this isn’t one of the sleek, streamlined revolvers you may be used to; no, these are larger and clunkier, with a barrel fully as large as the cylinder, and with elaborate artistic detailing to decorate it. Your gun is a work of art, a personalized representation of who you are. If you’d rather have a gun other than a revolver... well, too bad. But you can have fancy types of revolver. Like a revolver-rifle or a revolver-shotgun.

Comes with a holster, and a supply of 50 bullets that refills each night. If you pay another -100 BP, then you will have as many revolvers as you can physically shoot; for most people, this is one per hand, but if you have Jumper of the Lightning-Fast Quadruple Guns, that would be twice as many as you have hands."
920,,200,Dedede Brooch,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Making,"A golden brooch, depicting the face of King Dedede. It can be carried on your person or stuck onto another in their Trophy Form. It is designed as a contingency measure.

If carried on your person, should you be forced into your Trophy Form it will activate and restore you. The brooch will wait for a convenient moment to do so; it won’t immediately force you back into battle with the guy who just kicked your butt. Generally, it will wait until the person who defeated you leaves, but it will settle for when their attention shifts if they have no intention of leaving anytime soon.

If placed on another in their Trophy Form, it will restore them after a few minutes. However, when placing it, you can set an alternate condition for it activating. This could be a different length of time, or something specific like ‘after person X uses this attack’ or ‘when X% of the world is pulled into Subspace’.

Once it has activated, the brooch will not function for the next 24 hours. Should it be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
921,,200,Pig(Daizzi),Miraculous Ladybug,Making,"Concept: Jubilation

Form: Pink Anklet

Tool: Tambourine

Power: “Gift” - Summons a box which, when opened (either by the user at will, or by the target opening it normally) shows the target’s greatest desire in a pink orb. This makes them happy, dispelling any negative emotional effects/creatures. It can also be used to distract or stall."
922,,200,Dog(Barkk),Miraculous Ladybug,Making,"Concept: Adoration

Form: Collar

Tool: Ball

Power: “Fetch” - Summons an object that was hit by the Ball. The Ball will fly any distance and phase through objects to retrieve the object within a couple seconds at most."
923,,200,Cutter Dance,High School DxD,Making,"Taking the form of a thin longsword with a golden hilt, this Sacred Gear moves in the air accordingly to the user’s will, moving with the skill and swiftness fitting a master swordsman even if you yourself were an amateur. It can also create up to thirteen copies of itself that dance with just as much skill and effectiveness...the downside being that if your mind is distracted or if you’re thrown off-balance, the blades become confused and stunned with you. Maybe with time, this weakness could be overcome?"
924,,200,Trick Vanish,High School DxD,Making,"A staff with a short but sweet power: it can seal a single ability of an opponent away by cursing them, making very foul-looking marks appear on their body. This is incredibly draining to use, however, and the curse can be overcome by someone else aiding the victim. Still, if someone relies too much on a particular trump card..."
925,,200,Special Grade Cursed Tool(200),Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"By purchasing this option, you receive a cursed tool imbued with one of the abilities from the cursed technique section, allowing you to wield it through this item. The exact form of your cursed tool, as well as how it specifically interacts with the cursed technique it carries, is up to you. Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

The price for such an object is equal to the original cost of the cursed technique.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
926,,200,Parasitic Bud ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"You have a small bag full of ten or so buds from a strange plant indeed – these may, in fact, be one of the few things more dangerous to a sorcerer than a regular human. While only in bud form currently, they grow quickly as soon as they come into contact with cursed energy, growing into grotesque-looking masses of wood with small flowers bearing fanged mouths. If one of these hit a non-sorcerer or someone not using any cursed energy, it’d bounce off harmlessly. Against a sorcerer reinforcing their body with cursed energy or using their cursed technique, though, it’ll latch onto them and not only begin to absorb their energy the more they use it, but even extend its roots into their bodies, potentially causing lethal damage. Assuming someone figures out how the buds works before thy digs in too deep, though, they aren’t too hard to remove.

The bag refills every month, and in other worlds the buds will continue to grow in response to other supernatural energies."
927,,200,Cursed Talisman,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"You have a set of talismans – pieces of paper imbued with cursed energy, allowing them to perform specific functions. To be specific, the talismans you have were designed for two different functions: sealing and creating barriers. Just by wrapping a cursed object or some other source of cursed energy up in one of the sealing talismans, it’ll not only completely stop any of its cursed energy from escaping, but turn the object into a sort of repellent for cursed spirits. While intelligent curses will just feel some discomfort being near it, unintelligent ones will actively avoid the general area its in. They’re rather powerful talismans too, lasting pretty much indefinitely on any cursed object that isn’t ranked special grade, such as a finger of Sukuna, but even one of those can be safely kept for several centuries before the seal starts to degrade.

The other type are those used to create barriers. Just by making contact with one of them, you can decide the exact details and nature of the barrier it’ll create, though you can only ‘program’ it to make barriers you’d be capable of forming yourself. Though they will last for a few minutes or so based on the cursed energy infused, they will require a constant, albeit small, supply of cursed energy from another source to remain active. Because of the above traits though, such talismans are often used by experts at barrier techniques to allow lesser sorcerers to create complex barriers with relative ease. 

You have a half-dozen of each type of talisman, which restock after a month."
928,,200,Chain of a Thousand Miles,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"A special grade cursed tool in the form of a metal chain with a clip at one end. So long as the end without the clip remains hidden from anyone’s view, the chain can keep extending with no known limit, though it can also be shortened by retracting the chain as well. While it can be used as a weapon by itself, the clip allows for other objects, including cursed tools, to be very easily attached to it, greatly extending their range."
929,,200,Absurdly Spacious Inventory ,Final Fantasy VII,Making,"Carrying a small arsenal of various weapons, armor, potions, supplies and various nick-nacks you might never use again tends to get a little encumbering, to put it mildly. Lucky for you, you now have a rather ridiculous amount of storage space in the form of a backpack, napsack, or some other portable storage method. What's special about it is that you can store up to 99 of any item within it without any additional weight or space lost, letting you hold a truly ridiculous amount of supplies or equipment within it. The only downside is that this equipment counts as 'unusable' while it's in the storage, so don't expect to activate a whole host of Materia you're holding within it. It also can't store anything bigger than a grown human. Potions, weapons, clothing? Easy enough. An entire vehicle or an artillery cannon? Not going to happen."
930,,200,Hero Drink,Final Fantasy VII,Making,"While Jenova cells tend to have a more immediate and potent gain at potential risk of mutation and a Source will bolster a very specific part of you permanently but for a small amount, a Hero Drink is when you need a pick-me-up and you need it RIGHT NOW. Consuming this drink will give your body a substantial boost, increasing your physical attack power, durability, magical power, and magical defense by about one-third. This boost increases with each one you drink, capping at four effectively doubling your regular power. However, this is temporary and will fade after whatever battle or situation you're in has concluded, changing you back to normal. You start with a single bottle and regain it each week. You may purchase this perk multiple times, undiscounted, to gain an extra Hero Drink for each purchase.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
931,,200,Source,Final Fantasy VII,Making,"While not as quick and dirty as a Jenova cell injection, this may be one of the safer ways to boost your personal abilities. This is a single drink that adds a small but permanent boost to one of the following: Your physical attack strength, your durability, your magical power, your magical resistance, your speed, or (oddly enough) your luck. If a human is rated on a 1 to 255 scale, 1 being the bare minimum and 255 being the peak, each drink of Source of your chosen type raises that particular area by 1. After consumption, you gain a new one the following month. You may purchase this perk again for another of the listed Source types, although you may only discount the first.

932,,200,Personalized Gear,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"You possess a rather strange object, Jumper. Either a weapon of armor with quite a significant story behind them. Not necessarily exceptional or magical, it could be a lamppost you use as a staff, but it's very recognizable. It is indestructible and, while it doesn’t have any power, just wielding it fills you with confidence. And it could have a role to play in the future. Who knows..."
933,,200,Soul Catcher,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"This is an evil thing, Jumper. A lantern, or some other object, that can be used to trap the soul of the living. It has pretty much infinite capacity, but aside from storing, it actually doesn’t do very much. However, if you’re practiced in the art of necromancy, there are a lot of things you can do with souls. And who knows, maybe you could also use it to trap the souls of those that dwell in the Black Mist."
934,,200,Siege Vehicle,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"Noxus is built on conquest, and so they have developed the art of siege. This machine is one of them, infused with magic to make it operate on its own and a mobile platform to move around. It can be a trebuchet or a similar ancient weapon, and it’s quite more powerful than it should be. Ideal if you just have to demolish a fortified position."
935,,200,Mystical Instrument,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"This is a minor magical item with pretty much no combat use. Not directly, at least. The most common of these items are musical instruments that incite emotions or grant minor manipulation of nature. For example, you could have a flute that lets you create water shapes, a sickle that helps harvesting plants or a rock that helps meditation."
936,,200,Great Cauldron,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"You managed to get your hand on something a lot of people would kill for. It has no name, because Orrn’s naming sense needs work, but its power is undeniable. Anyone who will eat from this cauldron will find himself not needing sustenance for quite a while. It doesn’t even require much, just a spoon will fill the belly of a man for several months, more or less depending on how active they are."
937,,200,Artifact,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"There are plenty of magical items around Runeterra. Most are nothing special, but these have peculiar abilities that make them deadly on the battlefield. Want a weapon made of True Ice, or a pair of gauntlets made of dragon scales that let you channel the fury of the monster? This is where you can obtain such a weapon."
938,,200,Gems Grafter,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"The gems of Mount Targon have strange properties, maybe a product of the exposition to the celestial light coming from the top. You have learned how to dig and cut these gems so not only are they aesthetically pleasing, but also to extract their power more efficiently. The most common uses for these gems are healing and a little boost in offensive power, but who knows what you can really do if you put in the effort?"
939,,200,Building of Power,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"Shuriman’s seems to have the habit of creating huge magical buildings. From obelisks able to attract magic to chambers full of healing waters to the mythic Sun Disk, ancient and powerful structures fill this land. Now, you share the ability of the ancient Shurimans from magical architecture. You can infuse buildings with different kinds of magic and to all sorts of powers and effects, assuming you actually know the magic in question."
940,,200,Amulet of Protection,Fairy Fencer F,Making,This amulet is capable of warding off harm caused by the different status ailments. Grants a moderate increase to all status resistance.
941,,200,Medium Armor ,Fairy Fencer F,Making,"Now this is much better, Jumper. This set of armor provides better protection than the basic set. Even comes with a single special resistance chosen at time of purchase. Can be merged with your Unique Outfit."
942,,200,Rider's Blade,Inheritance Cycle,Making,"A sword made out of Brightsteel by the Elven smith Rhunön. It is of extremely high quality and will never break, it also matches the scales of your Dragon if you have one. It is expected to be given a name in the Ancient Language, and the name is engraved on the blade. You may also import any melee weapon you own to take on the appearance and strengths of the sword."
943,,200,Talisman,Inheritance Cycle,Making,"A Talisman, usually in the form of a highly polished and flawless crystal inlaid into a piece of jewelry is able to store your energy for future use. If you are exhausted you may regain energy by drawing it out of the talisman or use it instead to fuel any spell that you may cast. Its storage capacity is finite however and likely cannot store more than half a day’s exertion. If lost or stolen it will return to you within a day’s time."
944,,200,Herbalism,Inheritance Cycle,Making,"You are skilled with plant and animal parts and can use them to make a number of useful potions, poisons, and poultices. You gain a kind of sixth sense of what can used and how to bring the best effect in potions or elixirs, and by studying the materials at hand you can find the best ways to use it. This applies to ingredients you may find in future worlds as well."
945,,200,Santa’s Sack,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"A sturdy sack filled with treasures. This Santa-class phantasm can be a powerful weapon, if properly filled. Right now, with just a few common Craft Essences crammed inside, it’ll smack into people like it’s full of bricks. It doesn’t even weight more than if it was full of pillows! But the more valuable things you managed to shove in, the heavier it’ll hit. Start cramming in powerful Noble Phantasms, rare gemstones, priceless artworks, you’ll find that the sack can smash even a mighty Servant flat. And when you smack people around with it, they’re a lot more likely to drop treasures of their own out of their pockets."
946,,200,Amazoness.com (Subscription),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"For 200,000CP instead, you can simply subscribe to the Alpha Amazones service instead. You won’t own the company but you will be able to order from it anywhere and anywhen, even in future worlds. Almost anything that isn’t entirely unique can be obtained, as long as you’ve been to a world where it probably existed, but it’ll get pretty costly the wilder the purchase and cross-world delivery costs are just obscene these days."
947,,200,Mask of Darkness,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"A dark and menacing mask, the mere act of breathing with it on risks a copyright strike. This full-head helmet helps one deal with all sorts of difficult questions. Who’s going to interrogate Darth Servant over here, especially with that unfortunate breathing problem he has? The helmet’s actual qualities are pretty straightforward. It’s a tough piece of Star Metal to protect your head from chopping blades, it’ll filter out anything nasty in the air and it enhances the user’s vision almost without limit. You could spot a quark in the air or track a person’s movements from orbit with ease, somehow the helmet even takes care of any natural disorientation."
948,,200,Space Gem Stockpile,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"Ishtar’s secret supply of Space Gems. Apparently all her profits from bounty hunting was going towards creating this great big hoard of gems. You can even faintly hear the scream of rage as she realises it’s all disappeared. It’s a genuinely huge stockpile of space rubies and space diamonds and space lapiz lazuli and more. All large, well formed and shiny. Perfect for magecraft, given each Space Gem naturally stores a large amount of cosmic energy. Each one could boost a spell many times over, if the appropriate gem is used, and they serve as incredibly potent fuel for any technological device. Not only giving a few hours normal operation time, they can boost machines like warp drives to way beyond normal output for a few moments. You’ll have a few dozen gems of almost every kind of Space Gem one could find here, hundreds in total. Unlike a greedy Goddess, these gems will very slowly replenish in time. "
949,,200,Honkai Constructs,Honkai Impact 3rd,Making,"Like the very constructs Sirin, the Herrscher Of The Void, uses to fight, these constructs are shapeshifting weapons made out of solidified Honkai Energy, which is why they can be manipulated by you extremely easily. You have six of these constructs, and can control them telekinetically, and you are also able to reinforce them to make them harder than even the strongest of materials, allowing them to cut through anything if sharpened enough. You are able to import them as any man-portable weapon, regardless of the type, and can continue doing so in the future, and the constructs will retain all of the properties in every form."
950,,200,Honkai Armory ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Making,"You have a surplus of Anti-Honkai weaponry. The weapons are nothing to write home about, they mean basically nothing unless they’re in the hands of a Valkyrie, but still – They surpass the quality of normal blades and guns, instead raising the survival chances of anyone you give one to above zero. And in the hands of a skilled warrior, even if they aren’t honkai-infused themselves, these weapons can more than suffice to fight back against them. Against a non-Honkai foe, you’ll find these weapons to be much more effective and dangerous than anything normal as well."
951,,200,Reburn Ticket ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Making,"This isn’t so much an item as it is a voucher. Once per jump, you can retool your kit any way you like. This doesn’t let you purchase new perks or items, or even change them. Instead, what this Reburn Voucher does is it lets you retool your kit from the ground up in terms of what it means to you. If you previously were a fire manipulator, you could become an ice one. If you were a long ranged expert, you could become a melee fighter if your perks support it. No matter the context, nobody will question the change and treat it as if it somehow was a natural effect. You may only change the powers from your current jump. You may not use this to change powers from previous jumps, as those are locked in."
952,,200,Rage Ring,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"Anger is a powerful force, magical anger doubly so. While the simple copper band would appear to be unremarkable in any way, those who wear it quickly discover themselves able to tap into a primal sort of rage. One that specifically offers short bursts of strength that are enough to allow the wearer to throw a person like a ball. An oddly specific enchantment to be sure. The ring also protects the wearer from fire and lightning magic."
953,,200,Black Belt,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"A simple cloth sash worn around the waist would not seem to be useful as anything beyond a fashion statement. This one, however, has been heavily enchanted to aid those skilled in the martial arts. When worn, the belt sends your muscles into overdrive when you are attacked, allowing you to throw a counter blow without even thinking."
954,,200,Genji Glove ,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"An odd little piece of armor from ages past. It’s hard to tell which hand this armored gauntlet is designed to fit just by looking at it. One moment it seems to be more suited for the left hand, the next, the right. It fits equally well on both, but that isn’t the extent of its magic. When worn on a person’s non-dominant hand the gauntlet allows them to use it just as well as their primary. Ambidexterity in one easily worn, and armored, package."
955,,200,Gold Hairpin,Final Fantasy VI,Making,This stylish hairpin has been etched with fanciful designs depicting each of the magical elements of the world in miniature detail. It’s true power is something much more useful than mere fashion. Those who wear it will find the drain of casting magical spells reduced by a moderate amount as the hairpin draws from the ambient supply of the world.
956,,200,Lich Ring,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"A cursed ring originally made by a sorcerer mad with jealousy. Or so the story goes. Those who wear it will find their body grow cold as their heart stops, yet they will not die. The wearer will become an undead with all that entails. Healing spells will damage the wearer while death and poison type spells will heal them. Additionally, those who attempt to use draining spells on the wearer will find themselves drained instead. Thankfully the wearer can take off the ring to restart their natural processes once again."
957,,200,Efficient Design,God Of War (2018),Making,With this perk anything you aim to make you now know how to make it with less material while still having it be the same quality that it would have been before. Do you need the echoing screams of twenty Frost Trolls for an enchantment? Now you only need ten.
958,,200,Potions and Elixirs,God Of War (2018),Making,"In this land there are many potions and elixirs that have been created by skilled sorcerers, elixirs to treat illnesses and even potions that can reanimate the dead. Now you have the knowledge of potions and elixirs that can do things from healing to more unnatural things like bringing life back to the dead. Very little is impossible given enough time, resources, and experimentation."
959,,200,The Great Gatherer,God Of War (2018),Making,"How did you find that? No seriously how? You seem to have an odd talent for finding, gathering, and using materials that would be considered rare, legendary, or even impossible in some cases. An example would be how Sindri and Brok used the echoing screams of twenty frost trolls to craft the Leviathan Axe."
960,,200,Jotipasana ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Making,"Uttarakuru has no need for technology, for the bounties of the northern continent are boundless and incredible. This large red stone is one of such things. Having two flat and smooth sides, these stones are always comfortably warm, should you want to lay on them, but their main function is cooking. Place raw food on top of it, and it’ll be automatically cooked and prepared, doubtlessly a fascinating process to watch. You won’t need to worry about undercooking your food with this handy little stone. Additionally, food cooked with this stone cures people of any mundane disease or crippling wounds such as missing limbs, and additionally strengthens the resistance of those who eat from such things (obviously more noticeably for diseases). If you break or lose this, or if it’s stolen (not a surprising event), you’ll get another one the following day, or it’ll simply find itself back to you if it’s intact."
961,,200,Middle-Class Tier Holy Swords,DxD Universe,Making,"This is where the holy sword with the power of the excalibur fragments except ruler are, they can do considerable damage, but still aren't that great. You can pick a canonical one or make your own.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
962,,200,Middle-Class Tier Sacred Gears,DxD Universe,Making,"Here you will find sacred gears of moderate strength, they can have a lot of effects and be of average power like Sword Birth, or have amazing power but have that power to be very limited In some way, an example of that being Mirror Alice. You can pick a canonical one or make a new one.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
963,,200,Hearty Meal,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Making,"Sometimes you or your allies may have inconvenient or potentially illegal dietary requirements. If obtaining ingredients would be a problem for whatever reason, this should cover you. It’s a large plate with a silver dome covering, and when served to anyone who requires a specific diet removing the lid will reveal something perfectly suited for them to survive on without breaking any taboos they might have, and pretty tasty and nutritious too. It just appears inside it from thin air, perfectly and hygienically prepared and cooked as needed, comes with napkins so messier meals don’t cause too much of a problem, provides suitable utensils, and this setup is self-cleaning and will reappear in your Warehouse if lost or destroyed. Now you’ll have no problem catering for blood-drinking vampires, organ-devouring serial killers, people with allergies and even vegans!"
964,,200,-Chemist-,Final Fantasy V,Making,"A job focused on alchemy, rather than combat. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Chemist’s abilities, while Mastery allows you to identify all herbs and alchemical creations by sight, even in unfamiliar jumps.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
965,,200,POTIONS,CthulhuTech,Making,"Pick a set of three potions (duplication okay). You get that set each jump.
• Corporeal Restorative Salve - Ten doses of healing balm. One dose for minor cuts. Five for mortal wounds. Only for trauma.
• Talisman of Fortune - Catch one lucky break
• Powder of Ibn Ghazi - Powder that reveals invisible in an area.
• Glamour Lock - A gem that creates a minor illusion (like changing hair color). It lasts for three months once activated.
• Potion of Il-Sahr - Enhances hearing, allows reading surface thoughts. Activates in 1 hour, lasts 12. May be distracting.
• Restful Inhalant - Six doses of sleep inducing incense."
966,,200,A Net ,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making,"A net big enough to cover a whole house, but with thread thin and fine enough that it’s only visible if held against the sunlight and can easily fit fully in a man's hand. The net itself is stronger than normal steel."
967,,200,Arms of a Valkyrie,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making,"A big and thick shield of iron and gold. Four men are needed to carry it. A spear heavy enough that three men are needed to carry it with at least 100 pounds of iron worked into it and a set of perfectly fitting armor heavy enough that 3 men must carry it. Only one of awesome strength can wield those weapons, but if you do the mere sight of you in arms will leave most men shivering."
968,,200,The hoard of Fafner ,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making,"This is the treasure stolen by the gods from the dwarf Andvari to pay off their debt to Hreidmar for the slaying of his son Otr. The treasure, which then went to Hreidmars son Fafner who turned into a dragon and watched over the gold day and night. This is enough gold and jewels that scarcely three horses may carry it. Any of the treasure spent will replenish by the next jump."
969,,200,Divinity Banishment Staff,Asura’s Wrath,Making,You have a rare tool fashioned of the crystalized ire of Gaea combined with resonant sutra and blessed materials. Striking someone with this staff immediately terminates all hostile possessions by spirits. Striking someone empowered by prayer or similar energies immediately reduces their effective Mantra Level or equivalent by 2. This effect does not stack.
970,,200,A Tangled Web Weaved,Asura’s Wrath,Making,"You gain a true god's understanding of Mantra's fundamental nature. Strangely, it seems to resemble a spider's web, and you are able to manipulate it into a batch of silken threads. You may spin silk in your spider form, or from your hands. It can be anchored to air itself, and are made of glittering golden Mantra. The strands are nigh­-unbreakable save by superhuman effort.

With skill, care and practice over centuries, perhaps it can be manipulated to more complex tasks than mere ensnarement..."
971,,200,An Unpleasantness Collection ,Witch on the Holy Night,Making,"Ah. Yes. That. These curated set of substances represents the seedier side of mage society. A tasting flight of poisons that if not taken consecutively, will kill after half a day or so as the older poison dissolves the newer poison. A collar that can tighten around a neck hard enough to strangle the average human. Rowen pills that once forced down the throat of a mage, damages their ability to use magecraft until it is processed in a day or so. And similar nasty, nasty things that restrain, inhibit or otherwise cripple others. The best thing you can say about them is that if used correctly, you can guarantee none will do any permanent harm as long as the subject cooperates. Restocked every week by what appears to be a tiny injector needle with arms and legs."
972,,200,Signature Outfit,Library of Ruina,Making,"Be they part of a Fixer Office, a Syndicate or a Wing an individual’s choice in attire is very important. The fabrics might showcase an air of class and decorum, or portray a riot of individuality and color, both options carry a different impression that reflects the one who wears them. A purchase here grants an entire wardrobe arranged towards a particular theme, minor divergences are to be expected but the intent is to work towards a singular style. These articles of clothing will be reasonably reinforced according to the City’s standards, but none of them will be on the level of Nuovo Fabrics which can cause any blow to falter or fully negate weaker impacts. However, an additional surcharge of 100CP can be paid to change this, your ensemble changing into clothing fully composed of those coveted silks. "
973,,200,Augment,Final Fantasy IV,Making,"A smal object that holds a great deal of potential. An augment allows you to store a single perk within it. You still have access to it, but can allow your Companions (or others if you choose) to receive the perk permanently. Companions can use this in the same way to gift perks to you. An individual may give or receive 1 Perk in a 5-year period."
974,,200,Alchemy,Final Fantasy IV,Making,"A lack of magic makes you no less useful, and you’ve learned how to make use of the various potions and other items on a grand scale. You can mix together multiple items, compounding their effects. It doesn’t create something new, but instead additively combines the source materials into something with as much potency, to the upper limit of five times the strongest of your source materials."
975,,200,Twice Critical,HighSchool DxD,Making,"A commonly occurring but extremely powerful Sacred Gear, this gauntlet manifests over the user’s hand with the fingers uncovered. Its power is short and simple: it doubles the power of the user, both physical and magical. This effect doesn’t stack with itself and it expires after some time, but you know what they say: double or nothing, right?"
976,,200,Re-Spec,HighSchool DxD,Making,"A type of Sacred Gear that naturally manipulates energy in a very limited way. Letting you categorize and allocate your reservoirs to different 'stats' to enhance them; the more you devote to one category, the more bang you get for your buck. You can shift your stats around at will to be exceptionally fast or strong at any given time for example, but it would be a trade-off when it comes down to it. The regular Balance Breaker is an armband that allows the user to ‘steal’ energy and magic from the ambient and enemies, while permanently increasing its own. It’s also known to have a sub-species that allows the users to spend energy into brute forcing learning skills or obtaining traits they normally wouldn’t be able to."
977,,200,Excalibur Rapidly,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Speedy, aren’t we? This blade has another simple power, but a potent one - it enhances the speed of both itself and the user, moving faster than the eye can follow and can create phantom after-images that make them difficult to predict. It also creates enhanced flexibility, letting the user better avoid attacks or danger."
978,,200,Chaos Break,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Time to take out the drugs, son. This one here is an injectable doping drug made with the blood of the original satans, and made with Sacred Gear users in mind. Drinking it means increasing the user’s overall power by several levels as well as granting the user the ability to undergo Chaos Drive, a transformation form that takes on the physical characteristic of the user’s Sacred Gear on their body, as they mutate into various monster-like forms with enhanced physical capabilities in addition to their strengthened Sacred Gear's ability. Unlike the original ones, the dozen I’ll give you are free of unintended side-effects. You will get another one each month aside from the initial batch of twelve."
979,,200,Gear Scanner        ,HighSchool DxD,Making,"This one is very simple and highly useful. A fist sized pocket-watch looking thing that’s actually both a Sacred Gear finder and a Sacred Gear Scanner in one. It can tell the location of any activated sacred gear relative to its user in a three-mile-radius. If close enough to an active sacred gear, then this can tell the type, abilities, and weakness of said Sacred Gear. If it is lost or broken you will find another in your pocket next week. In future worlds it will evolve to have the same characteristics with other artifacts similar to the sacred gears."
980,,200,Witchly Censer ,The Voynich Hotel,Making,"At first glance this small, clay incense pot may not seem like anything out of the ordinary. But simply light the small candle inside and wait a moment. A sweet, light smoke will begin to issue forth that seems to all but invite people to breathe it in. Those who inhale its smoke will grow sleepy almost immediately and sleep peacefully for several hours at least. Of course, should you have a potion or your own mixture of incense you wish to disperse, this censer can share their magical effects with equal ease."
981,,200,The Raven of Lies Mask,The Voynich Hotel,Making,"Normally you would have been offered the Rabbit Mask of Truth at this point, but it seems as though that artifact has gone missing. So instead we’re excited to offer you its darker, more dashing, brethren. This crow-like mask isn’t all that realistic, but offers enough detail to ensure that nobody looking at it mistakes it for anything else. There is no small amount of magic woven into its feathers as well. When it is worn over the entire head, it allows its wearer to tell when other people are lying. Others are also more likely to believe the lies spoken by the wearer if one is careful and smart when they weave them. Finally, it gives its wearer truly excellent night vision. All nights with any amount of moon in the sky would appear just as bright as noon with even moonlit nights being only as dim as twilight."
982,,200,+1 Weapon ,The Voynich Hotel,Making,Most hitmen and assassins can be identified by their choice in weapon. They strive to make them distinctive and in doing so imbue them with a bit of a soul. Or so the stories go at least. This weapon could be any handheld weapon one might find in the modern world. A pistol is just as valid a choice as a sword or hatchet or even a rifle. So long as you can carry it around you are free to choose what suits you best. This weapon will be unbreakable by anything that isn’t at least a +2 weapon. Which is a silly stipulation in any case. Nobody has a +2 weapon. They’re a myth. You will find it impossible to misplace your +1 weapon and will discover it more accurate and damaging in whatever way that is appropriate for your chosen type.
983,,200,Divine Weapon,God of War,Making,"There are countless artifacts in this world, items of great and terrible power. Standing above them all are weapons, tools for war and destruction. And now, you are given the chance to create a weapon of your very own, capable of standing with the best of them. And if one is not enough, then you can buy another for [200 CP].

You will receive 1000 Weapon Points to customize your new weapon.

984,,200,Urn of Gaia ,God of War,Making,"An urn depicting the Mother Earth herself, it smells of morning dew and fresh soil. It will constantly draw energy from the earth, stockpiling it without limit. This energy can be channeled into your gear and equipment, increasing a number of their capabilities and their potency. This is not just limited to weapons and armor, but things like jewelry and vehicles as well, though the cost for improvement will constantly rise as this is used on them more often."
985,,200,Schematics of Daedalus,God of War,Making,"The creator of the labyrinth was among one of the greatest mortal minds, and his creations impressed even Hephaestus. Now you find yourself in possession of his schematics and notes, detailing all manner of things from deadly traps to flying contraptions, though the most notable inclusion is that of an ever shifting maze, as well as the manner in which to safely navigate it."
986,,200,Ring of Midas,God of War,Making,"Given his gift by Dionysus, King Midas was well known for his less than stellar choices. Still, this ring is the solidification of his most famous myth, with all of the benefits and seemingly no drawbacks. While wearing this ring, you can transform almost any inanimate objects, or even corpses, into solid gold at will. You are even able to reverse this effect, if you so desire."
987,,200,Garter of Aphrodite,God of War,Making,"An item that the goddess of love often gives to her bedmates, if they can satisfy her that is. While wearing this garter, you will find that both your charisma as well as your skills in bed are greatly improved. You could talk practically anyone to do almost anything for you, with only the promise of a single night with you, should they succeed."
988,,200,Amulet of the Uroborus,God of War,Making,"A golden amulet inlaid with a pulsating turquoise gem, it was stolen from the Oracle Aletheia by the Prophets Castor and Pollux long ago. While wearing this, you will be able to repair and decay inanimate objects around you, able to affect entire buildings at once. Additionally, you will find your time related abilities enhanced while wearing this."
989,,200,Ax Bass,Adventure Time,Making,"A battle-axe that’s been converted into a bass guitar. Heavy and potently (albeit vaguely) magical, mostly just a good bass and a good axe. Does not dull."
990,,200,Spider Wand,Adventure Time,Making,A wand that shoots large amounts of spider silk at the target. Easily incapacitates most human sized targets.
991,,200,Holo-Pendants,Adventure Time,Making,A pair of holo-pendants. Provides hologram map of local area and allows for communication between wearers regardless of proximity.
992,,200,Noah’s Lute,Final Fantasy III,Making,"An enchanted lute, copied from the one which belonged to the powerful mage Noah. When played it can awaken anyone from their slumber, even those suffering from a cursed sleep."
993,,200,Levigrass Boots,Final Fantasy III,Making,"A pair of enchanted boots, these allow one to travel across chasms or bottomless pits as if walking across land. They do not allow one to fly, only to traverse across two points that are separated by a potentially massive gap."
994,,200,Alchemist,Final Fantasy III,Making,"Equipment is one thing, but not the end all be all of an adventurer’s kit. You know the methods of brewing healing potions and elixirs, the various concoctions for curing status ailments, all manner of bombs and single use weapons, and how to properly grow Gysahl Greens. Even the mighty Phoenix Down, which can bring back those on the brink of death but have yet to truly slip their mortal bonds, can be made with the right resources."
995,,200,Enchantress ,Final Fantasy III,Making,"More than just simple arms and armour, you can create equipment with elemental effects and resistances. Most anything you craft can be reinforced with a measure of magic, either for simple reinforcement or basic effects coming from the standard final fantasy elements."
996,,200,Ariadne's thread,Xena - Hercules,Making,"After Theseus refused to stop and ask for directions, the daughter of Minos gave him a ball of red thread to help him find his way around. Once the Minotaur was dead and Theseus was back on the road without her, Ariadne abandoned this item and it eventually came into your possession. By tying the end of the thread to something and letting the effectively infinite length of thread spool out, you'll have no problem retracing your steps. Magical in nature, the thread can't be damaged accidentally, and is so fine as to go unnoticed by all but the most perceptive of beings, though you'll have no problem following it. The thread will even slip out of space with you to remain unbroken should you teleport or employ similar methods of travel. Because magic."
997,,200,God-forged craft,Xena - Hercules,Making,"By blessing or theft, you've acquired something forged by Hephaestus himself. A single weapon or piece of armor (which may be a pair of boots or bracers) fitted perfectly for you. It's nigh-indestructible, able to resist absolutely anything but attacks from a god or other entity on a similar scale.

On the downside, it's completely indestructible, which means that until you develop smithing skill to match a deity it can never be refitted or altered in an way. It's otherwise just an ordinary piece of equipment, so an invincible breastplate won't do you any good if they aim for your head."
998,,200,Mystic Code,Fate/Apocrypha,Making,"Mystic Codes are artifacts crafted by Magi, usually for the purposes of combat. With this purchase you can skip the crafting process and simply obtain a Mystic Code of your own design, ideally made to work with whatever magecraft you utilize. Whatever you choose will be quite high grade as a Mystic Code, even if perhaps not on the level of masterwork Mystic Codes such as Volumen Hydragyrum. An example for the kind of Mystic Code available here would be the Bronze Link Manipulator, a set of four mechanical arms imbued with dog spirits that sprout from your back, allowing you to use them to walk (or even climb up buildings), as well as possessing various functions like shooting bullets of condensed energy like a machine gun, and automatically defending you from danger even without your awareness. Try not to break it."
999,,200,It’s A Fake,Fate/Apocrypha,Making,"But does that really matter? What you have here is some kind of incredibly valuable resource, one fit for whatever you specialize in as a Magus (or whatever type of magecraft you use). For example, for a necromancer or poisoner it could be the preserved corpse of an infant hydra, a source of immensely potent venom. Whatever you choose, it’ll be an amazing material to make powerful tools or weapons out of. In general, it’ll be very useful for making powerful trump cards, perhaps even the kind of thing to turn the tables in a fight between Servants if used properly, such as giving your Servant an antidote to combat hydra poison. You may purchase this item as many times as you want, either choosing a different thing each time or getting another sample of something you already have.

1000,,200,E.G.O. Unlock(WAW),Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"Normally over the course of the jump, weapons and armour can be crafted from the energy collected from the abnormalities. Choose a non-tool Abnormality, you now have a single copy of all the equipment (including gifts) it can provide. Their requirements don’t apply to you or your companions. They can be found in your dorm/warehouse and won't be confused with company property.

1001,,200,Pale Fixer Gear,Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"This pack includes a fedora, a snazzy business suit, a briefcase, a rune-engraved knife and rune-engraved pistol. All the pieces of gear focus on protecting and damaging one’s soul. The briefcase only contains blue tentacles of energy that violently thrash about, attacking everyone but the owner. The case can be entered, at which point it can teleport a short distance, releasing the traveller and attacking anyone else nearby with tentacles."
1002,,200,Black Fixer Gear,Lobotomy Corporation,Making,Black feathered clothes with golden goggles. Grants immunity to powers that would corrupt and corrode. Comes with a powerful feathered hammer that can emit soundwaves that aggravate or even harm nearby Abnormalities and animals. 
1003,,200,White Fixer Gear,Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"White angelical armour (even with a floating halo) along with a floating cannon. The armour provides immunity to mental attacks and grants the ability to hover slowly. The cannon fires a 2m wide penetrating beam that disperses into a foggy white cloud. Those caught in the fog suffer continuous mental damage that quickly deteriorates into insanity. The fog only lasts a minute, after which it harmlessly dissipates. The cannon also holds a secondary function: while held up, the wielder is granted ""divine protection"", reflecting all incoming damage back onto its attackers."
1004,,200,E.G.O. Gift ,Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"You may bestow a gift (an accessory of your choosing that can be worn) to employees that visit you, providing them a minor boost to an aspect of your choice."
1005,,200,Hammer of Daedalus ,Hades,Making,"Master artisan Daedalus never encountered a peer in life or even in death. So it is little wonder that Hades selected him to create the labyrinthine chambers of Tartarus and even the House of Hades itself. He works even now to perfect the inescapable trap the Underworld claims to be. This hammer is a golden tool that will subtly change its form to suit whatever architectural, engineering, or blacksmithing needs its holder may ask of it. Additionally, it is capable of working with any metal, no matter how normally immutable it may be. Should you happen to lose it you will always rediscover the hammer waiting for you the next time you visit your forge or workshop."
1006,,200,Poseidon’s Fishing Pole ,Hades,Making,"Strange to think that the God of Oceans would create a tool that would offermortals the ability to plunder his waters for the riches within. Then again, Poseidon is a boastful fellow and likely just wants to show off all its splendors to the world above. This fishing rod is an exquisite example and far more useful than one made of simple wood and twine. It is capable of fishing in any ocean, streak, or lake, even those made of roiling lava, and its hook never needs bait to attract ocean life of all kinds to their doom. Its line will never snap unless you wish it and it will always be close at hand. Simply reach into any body of water to retrieve it."
1007,,200,Charon’s Loyalty Card,Hades,Making,"It is one of the odd mysteries of the Underworld why the boatman of the dead should also be so interested in commerce. After all, what use does one such as he have with coinage, even if they are included with every soul he ferries down the rivers? But sell odds and ends he does. This slim black card embossed with gold is a token normally granted to those who have defeated him in fair combat, a featmanaged by fewer beings than can be counted on two hands. Those who present the card to the ferryman will be granted a substantial discount on whatever they happen to purchase from him. It also works on all but the strongest willed or stingiest of merchants found elsewhere."
1008,,200,Crate of Ambrosia ,Hades,Making,"While the divines aren’t required to consume neither food nor liquid for their continued existence, many do for the sake of simple enjoyment. While Hades is rarely, if ever, in such a mood, he refuses to keep his kitchen as anything less than fully stocked. Thus you find yourself in possession of a box of twenty bottles that the god might miss... if he ever bothered to imbibe. Ambrosia is a liquid that defies description. Everyone who attempts to describe its taste does so differently and many claim its taste changes on each occasion they have had it on their tongues. There is one universally known quantity of this drink though. It always tastes better when shared with friends, allies, or is otherwise freely given to others. This crate will refill itself of all used bottles every other year."
1009,,200,Beyond Blacksmithing,Final Fantasy II,Making,"Blacksmithing is a trained talent, of course, and one that one can learn over time. Of course, you needn’t worry about learning how to do that, as all the knowledge of master blacksmiths is now available to you. This knowledge can also be applied to other disciplines. Working with metal, even types you’ve never even touched before, becomes as easy for you as working with iron- no matter how difficult it might normally be."
1010,,200,Demon Blood        ,Hellblazer,Making,"A single dose of blood voluntarily offered by a greater demon. Drink it to be fully healed of anything, including the incurable disease. The healing process is pain-ful. Drinking demon blood will make you tougher, permentantly. Grants the disadvantage Demon Marked. If already Demon Marked, it increases the effect. Drink- ing several doses may turn you into a demon."
1011,,200,Lost Item,Fate/Strange Fake,Making,"An artifact from a bygone era, recently rediscovered by you. This is an item with great potency as a magecraft ingredient, but whose true potential will probably require a great magus to bring forth. Think of something as the remains of a baby hydra, or something like several samples of an alien mesoamerican bacteria."
1012,,200,Historical Memorabilia,Fate/Strange Fake,Making,"Dating from the era you are from, this is a rather large collection of valuable items and artifacts. Nothing powerful in the mystical sense, albeit some of them may have some traces of Mystery if your origin is quite ancient, but each of these items are worth quite a fortune on their own. You can summon this collection at any location, and they will instantly replace the current decorations and furniture to make it closer to your old home."
1013,,200,To Be Alive,Fate/Strange Fake,Making,"Is to eat. While this is rarely a central theme in the tales of Heroic Spirits, they are also rarely without an episode associated with food. Whether as a great king that has participated in many banquets, a writer interested in all kinds of subjects, or something else entirely, it seems that you have a particular talent in the culinary arts. As you stand now, there would be few chefs in the world that could outshine you in the kitchen when you are cooking at your preferred school. And outside of it, you are also quick to take notes from the local ingredients and recipes and incorporate them into your own.

Finally, even when it is not the main focus of your legend, it seems that you have a particular talent when it comes to putting your supernatural abilities into your cooking process."
1014,,200,Bottomless Pouch,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Making,"This special pouch is quite useful thing for any cunning combatants who know show to use it. In it is a endless amount of space where anything you put in can be stored to be resummoned by simply thinking about what it is you need. Not truly everything can be in here however, as a human must be able to hold it in your hand comfortably. Still a limitless amount of knives, piano wire or other such nifty tools could be stored here and taken when you need it most."
1015,,200,Entry Ticket,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Making,"All of humanity was invited to see their greatest face the Gods of Heaven. A shame that not every event like this is available for everyone. Well with this Ticket you might change that. You can chose to apply this Ticket to every Festival, Event or similar needing a Ticket to enter, taking with you as many +guests as you want. However this can only be used for things that theoretically are allowed to be visited by public. Concerts and Sports Tournaments are fair game… not the Secret Death Matches of shady elites. Though for 200 CP you may use this Ticket for any event you could need access to."
1016,,200,Dancing Weapon,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"For the most part, melee weapons aren't used in the usual way here. Instead they are enchanted to swing themselves, providing utility while not restricting a user's hands.

By purchasing this, you get to select two things.

First, you may select a melee weapon, such as a sword, scythe, spear, etc. The weapon is of solid make, and can have any purely cosmetic ornamentation of your choice.

Second, you may select a pattern for it to attack. A few examples are to 'strike the closest enemy and return', or 'spin in a circle around you', or even 'bounce between nearby enemies'. Whatever you choose, the weapon can't travel too far from you while active."
1017,,200,Dancing Weapon(Pair),20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"For an additional 200 CP, the dancing weapon comes in a pair. Changes can be done cosmetically, but it will follow the same pattern as its twin. If the base purchase is discounted, so is this additional purchase.

Requires Dancing Weapon to Purchase"
1018,,200,Warding Stones,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"These two black stone shards have a series of symbols somehow carved beneath the surface that you can see when the light shines through them just right.

While active they will float around you and send out occasional waves of force that push nearby foes away from you."
1019,,200,Focusing Lens        ,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"Not a true physical lens so much as an arcane focus contained in a loop about as wide as an average human is tall. The lens orbits you slowly while active.

Projectiles that pass through the lens are improved in a variety of ways, depending on what the user would deem as 'useful' for the projectile. This improvement can't grant anything the projectile doesn't already have, it just makes the projectile better at what it already was capable of. The more attributes it is enhancing, the less potent each enhancement is individually as well."
1020,,200,Countless Blades,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Making,"This modifies the bag to have a somewhat increased capacity, from twelve blades to just shy of a thousand. The bag being somewhat larger also has improved targeting making it target much faster than before.

Requires Kunai to Purchase"
1021,,200,Tent ,Final Fantasy I,Making,"Often, as the party’s jack-of-all-trades, it falls to you to keep the comforts of the journey stocked. This tent will magically fit up to four different people with comfortable sleeping arrangements and enough food to last a night out in the wild. It restocks each time it’s re-deployed as well. Just note that it doesn’t come with any kind of special protection against ambushes or otherwise. The tent’s interior size will grow to match the size of your active companion roster, though attempting to use it for storage will just make it violently eject anything still contained within once you’re done using it."
1022,,200,Power Vest ,Final Fantasy I,Making,"A light vest that easily fits the body. It doesn’t look like anything remarkable, but when it is worn, it increases the physical strength of the user in a subtle but potent way. An sickly man could lift a horse with one hand while wearing this vest, and a trained martial artist could shatter stone with a well-placed punch."
1023,,200,Thief Gloves,Final Fantasy I,Making,"A nifty pair of fingerless gloves that feel as light as air. The magical enchantment on them allows the wearer to move more swiftly and quickly, making them fleet of foot and dexterous. This greatly eases the flow of acrobatics and parkour attempted by the user, as well as letting them run a bit faster, making them more difficult to hit."
1024,,200,Snake Staff,Disney’s Aladdin,Making,"A powerful artifact of magic, this is the dream of any wizard or sorcerer. Headed like a snake, it's eyes glow whenever you use it to cast magic. It’sa powerful thing, too. Not only can you channel any and all magic you can use through it flawlessly, it cuts down the effort and power you need to put into anyspell or working by an order of magnitude, while boosting the effects to be even better than normal.

Also, the magic cast from this spell is almost completely undetectable, meaning only people or items who are absolutely the best and greatest at such things may detect it. Also,you can beat people over the head with it."
1025,,200,Amulet of Silencing,The Little Mermaid,Making,"This amulet can steal anyone’s voice, it simply needs to hear them speak. This can prevent them from talking at all, as well as letting you perfectly mimic how they sound. Only one voice at a time may be stolen. You can also use it to prevent someone from talking about something specific (i.e. making it impossible for them to use the word ‘Tuesday’ or say ‘Good morning’ or say anything about you)."
1026,,200,A Locket From Your Parents,The Little Mermaid,Making,"A beautiful golden locket bearing your name that, when opened, displays a holographic/magical image of Atlantica and plays a sweet, soothing melody. It reminds you of home, dispelling mind/memory altering enchantments and non-magical effects with its song. If you wish, you may change the image and song to something you associate with 'home'."
1027,,200,Graven-Mass Talisman,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making,"A talisman depicting the first school of graven mages, a nightmare that would continue to haunt the academy. Greatly raises the potency of sorceries. The primeval current is a forbidden tradition of glintstone sorcery. To those who cleave to its teachings, the act of collecting sorcerers to fashion them into the seeds of stars is but another path of scientific inquiry."
1028,,200,Carian Filigreed Crest ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making,"A talisman adorned with the royal crest, it will greatly lower the cost of all spells cast. An honor said to have once been awarded to Carian knights who served as direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses. Now there is only one princess: Ranni, daughter of Rennala."
1029,,200,Crystal Staff ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making,"Staff fashioned from pure crystal; a deed impossible for a human. It will enhance all sorceries that utilize glintstone or other celestial crystals. The Crystalian's faint cogitation is known as the ""wisdom of stone."" This staff can only be wielded by those of intellect high enough to grasp such wisdom."
1030,,200,Giant Smith,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making,"There are few professions as respected, nor as needed in these days, as blacksmiths. You have learned the methods of the trolls allied with the Carian Royal Family, and as such you will find that all of your creations are more durable than ever, with blades never losing their edges."
1031,,200,Potion Supplies ,The Road to El Dorado,Making,"An assortment of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and other assorted ingredients. While this may sound more like a list for a larder, everything here is useful for creating mystical potions and not necessarily edible. Also includes a stone cauldron for mixing your brews, as well as some festive tiki umbrellas for serving (how they got here is anyone’s guess). Any depleted supplies will replenish at the end of the month."
1032,,200,Dragonite,Outlaw Star,Making,Raw materials with properties for absorbing the Ether through the universe for power generation.
1033,,200,Lipstick Catalyst,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Making,"Gota look pretty when following your ambitions right? This lipstick is the last piece of Makeup you will ever need, taking whatever color you want and easily applicable to perfection. Treat your lips with it and you find even the rest of your face suddenly being treated just how you wanted it to be, even if you wouldn’t have mascara. Of course that by itself isn’t worth much. The true benefit of this lipstick comes however from its direct connection to you, making it applicable for any magical rituals that require a connection to you. You could be summoned or summon yourself once to any place where this lipstick is, no matter where you yourself are or even if you yourself lack any teleportation powers or are otherwise unable to go there. Just a matter of ensuring the right person hangs on to it."
1034,,200,Royal Doll,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Making,"What an adorable little puppet! Tiny enough to be held in your arms comfortably, simply holding it brings with itself a feeling of peace and comfort. However there is a more tricky aspect of this doll, as if blessed by the whims of a certain elemental. It can move around by itself at night, attacking any suspicious intruders to your sleep. 

If purchased with Viy Viy Viy, you may let the elemental take hold within the Doll."
1035,,200,Berza Damask,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Making,"What does a Bogatyr need almost as much as a steed? A set of worthy armor and weapons of course. In your hands is the same set of armaments as Dobrynya Nikitich possesses. Made of Damascus steel, this mighty set of equipment consists of the armor itself, a melee weapon of your preference and a handy dagger for more casual needs. The armament is of top quality and further effective against draconic enemies. Finally you receive a small supply of Damascus steel, with which to form even more of these tools, though they by themselves will not have any Dragon Slaying properties. Unless your new Damask creations end up killing a Dragon of course, in which case they will be equally as effective as the armament you already possess with this Item."
1036,,200,Arms and Armour of Legend,Godbound,Making,"Speaking of divine artifacts, some of the theurges and Made Gods of old forged armour, weapons and even instruments of divine power to win worlds for their cause. The Flute of the Joyous Empress for example could call sky-darkening hordes of birds-and spiritual crows to peck at the wounded, while the Impervious Hauberk of Lady Yelem can transfer the wearer’s wounds to their devotees while resisting all change to its structure and maintaining an illusion of pristine health to the wearer in combat. The Red Sword of the Bleeding Emperor converts all great wounds to the wielder into divine power, and can cut down all in sight with a single great swing. You own one such artifact scaled to the size and purpose of a tool, weapon or piece of armour. Such artifacts may have a handful of powers rivalling or emulating Gifts, and you may buy additional artifacts here as well.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1037,,200,The Armory,Godbound,Making,"This vault, a prize of the Fallen Empire, is larger on the inside and holds an army-sized collection of minor enchanted armours and weapons. Each holds a power that can bring an ordinary soldier the edge to take down warriors much greater in skill and strength, although such boons are generally insignificant in the hands of the godbound. Still, they could mean the difference between life and death for untrained villagers in endanger from one of many rampaging hordes in this land."
1038,,200,The Ring of the Mountain Sage ,Godbound,Making,"This ring allows the user to enter a state of meditation and thought in which they require no food, water, or even air. As long as they are not physically tampered with, they could remain in this state for countless eons, thinking, pondering and planning freely. An excellent piece of equipment for mastering the sublime intricacies of theurgy without dealing with those pesky bodily needs."
1039,,200,Set of ARMS,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"You have a set of equipment known as ARMS (not to be confused with the extendable limbs of the same name, for which the equipment is designed). Worn on your hands, they perform best when used in combination with extending limbs. They can be changed almost instantly, allowing you to mix up your approach mid-battle.

First, you have a Ramram. This ARM is modelled after a chakram. It is designed to be thrown at the end of the extension of your limb, where it can boomerang back to the holding piece on your hand. This allows the Ramram to cover a wide arc. Fully charged, the Ramram is briefly wrapped in flames, allowing it to burn those it comes into contact with. The lightweight nature of the Ramram allows it to be used quickly, but it is relatively weak compared to the other ARMS in the set.

Next up is the Megawatt. This yellow, ball-like ARM is very heavy, limiting both its speed and manoeuvrability. What it loses in these qualities is made up for in raw power, and it is capable of dealing large amounts of damage to the foes it connects with. Fully charged, it grows in size, takes on a black colouration, and is wrapped in electricity, causing it to electrocute those it hits.

The last of the ARMS in your set is the Dragon. In fact, you have two of these, allowing you to wear one on each arm if you wish. Aptly named, the ARM looks like the head of a dragon. When charged up, the ‘mouth’ of the Dragon is capable of firing a laser after the standard punch. You have a degree of control over the aiming of the laser, affording you novel vectors of attacks. With two Dragons equipped, these lasers can be used to effectively pressure your opponents. With the ARMS ability, the Dragon is able to act as an effective grappling hook by ‘biting’ onto ledges. The Dragon can also be temporarily powered up by successfully grappling an opponent with it. This power up causes the limb equipped with the Dragon to become green and scaly, as if it were the body of the dragon, and the Dragon to emit flames. Whilst powered up, the lasers shot from the Dragon will be even more powerful.

As a bonus, you also have a facemask in a design of your choosing. Beyond concealing your face, this mask offers no additional boons to the wearer.

Should any of these items be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
1040,,200,Phantom Thief Set,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"A set of equipment, perfect for an aspiring thief.

Firstly, you have an airsoft pistol. Strangely, it seems to function much better than one might expect, performing comparably to a blaster or similar gun that could be found in the Gunner Gear item. It seems to never run out of ammo, allowing you to fire it repeatedly without having to reload.

Next, you have a knife. It is reliable, but otherwise unremarkable.

You have a grappling hook, which can be utilised to pull opponents within striking distance of you. It can also be used to grab on to ledges, which can prevent falls to certain doom.

Finally, you have a cool-looking outfit, suitable for either a gentleman or lady thief. It never tears or stains. It will be line with your general tastes, and should it possess any coat or cape component, you will never get caught on it. It provides no extra defence beyond that of normal clothing, however.

Alternatively, in place of your thief’s outfit, you may instead receive a high school uniform, which possesses the same properties. 

Should any of these items be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
1041,,200,Box of Black Holes,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"You have a box of Black Holes. No, I am not talking about actual black holes, I’m talking about Black Holes, the item appearing in the Super Smash Bros. series. The small orbs, when thrown, expand dramatically in size, then pull nearby enemies and objects into their centre. You or your allies are never affected by this. Although the pull of these items is quite strong, they cause no actual damage to anyone, instead leaving your foes stuck floating in the centre of the sphere for a small period of time. After that, the used Black Hole vanishes.

These items are useful mainly for trapping an opponent in place, before hitting them with something that can really hurt, or for delaying them for a brief period of time. The box never seems to run out of Black Holes, no matter how many you use, and you’ll always be able to find it nearby when you want it, no matter how improbable that might be. The Black Holes cannot be activated whilst still in the box."
1042,,200,Arcade Legend Set,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"A set of various items that seems strangely nostalgic.

First, you have a supply of ‘Power Pellets’. These sphere-like objects enable an odd form of movement. When thrown, they leave behind smaller pips. After the pellet has travelled a short distance, it will freeze in place. Then, you will be pulled along the path made by the pips until you reach the pellet, with the pips and pellet disappearing as you reach them. The pips and pellets can also be safely consumed. The speed at which you travel allows you to use the pellets both defensively as a recovery option, as well as offensively as a charging attack.

Second, you have a supply of fire hydrants. The red hydrants will, when placed on the ground, mysteriously produce water without truly being hooked into anything. A few moments after placement, a hydrant will begin to spurt out water. If someone is standing on top of the hydrant, or is only a short distance above the hydrant, the hydrant will spurt water upwards. Otherwise, it will spurt both in front and behind itself simultaneously. The water is not particularly harmful, but comes with enough force to push even the largest of Fighters away from it a short distance, giving you a brief reprieve from battle, or helping to force an opponent into a bad position. After a few spurts, the placed hydrant will then disappear completely. Fire Hydrants that you lose control of before placement will also disappear after a few moments.

Third, you have a supply of pixelated objects referred to as ‘Bonus Fruit’, though technically not all objects in this collection resemble fruit. They aren’t for eating either; each of these objects are best used as thrown projectiles, with each of the eight different varieties of objects possessing slightly different properties. When retrieving a Bonus Fruit, you may choose to retrieve a specific object, or randomly choose between any of the eight objects. A Bonus Fruit will disappear a few moments after it has been thrown or you have otherwise lost control of it.

Finally, you have a supply of another type of pixelated objects collectively referred to as the ‘Namco Roulette’. These objects are in fact a representation of video game sprites found in various Namco games. When retrieved, a sprite will hover over your hand for a few moments before disappearing. As with the Bonus Fruit, you may choose to retrieve a specific sprite, or randomly retrieve one of the twenty-one different sprites. Unlike the Bonus Fruits, these sprites offer little practical function, simply serving as a fun novelty to distract yourself with.

For each of the above categories (Power Pellets, Fire Hydrants, Bonus Fruit, Namco Roulette), you may have a single copy of an item out at a time, and must wait until the previous instance has disappeared (or been consumed in the case of the Power Pellets) before you can retrieve a new one. Besides this restriction, you will never have any difficulty retrieving any of these items, no matter how improbable that might be."
1043,,200,Two-Way Mirror,Wizarding World,Making,"Throughout history, men have always sought ways to make communication easier for themselves. In more ancient times, they relied on couriers and messenger birds while today, you’ll rarely find a person with no idea of what a telephone is. Wizards and witches are no different. Owls are a common sight in the wizarding world but even they have their limitations. After all, owls take time to travel from place to place.

And so, for more urgent matters, this will do quite nicely. What you have in your hands are a pair of small handheld mirrors. Through magic, these mirrors have been linked together, even across vast distances. Simply speak the name of the mirror’s bearer and you will be able to communicate with them as if you were right next to each other. And if you need to communicate with more people, simply break the mirrors. Their shards will possess the same enchantment and you won’t have to worry about fixing the mirror. Both of them will be as good as new in the coming week."
1044,,200,Revealer,Wizarding World,Making,"Invisible ink is already common within the Muggle world, especially with all their conspiracies, machinations, plots and secrets lying around. Can you imagine then what the magical folk can get up to? So, to save you some trouble, you have this! Looking like a regular, if large, two-colored Muggle eraser, the Revealer is anything but. All you have to do is rub it onto invisible ink, doesn’t matter what kind, and it shall be revealed. It doesn’t just work on ink alone either. You can use it to rub off the invisibility of just about anything. Sadly, this only gets rid of their invisibility temporarily, around a few hours or so. But what about the other side? Well, if you rub the other side on something, you can make things invisible, even on things that aren’t ink. Finally, the Revealer itself hums whenever something invisible is nearby. Useful when you forget where you place your invisible cloak."
1045,,200,Skull-Hookah,Wizarding World,Making,"While Dark relics don’t necessarily need to look the part, like the one above for example, this one certainly does. Bearing a heavy resemblance to the skull-hookah Gellert Grindelwald once possessed, this aged and yellowed skull has been emblazoned with engravings and markings of symbols of the Dark Arts and of your own.

And much like Grindelwald’s own, you can use this skull to project the visions within your mind over a vast area, large enough to encompass a colosseum. Useful if you need to impress the masses or perhaps convince them of the righteousness of your cause. However, the skull has one more fascinating ability to it.

If it is broken, either by your hands or that of another, the magic within the skull shall rush into the next spell you cast. In doing so, the might of this spell shall be massively improved. A fire that burns down a house, for example, will become one that shall burn down a town. Once broken, you will receive a new one at the start of the next week."
1046,,200,Ryusaki’s Amulet,Wizarding World,Making,"Apparently, Dai Ryusaki was not content with simply creating one magnificent artifact that could stand the test of time. In truth, this amulet was not purposefully made. Rather, in the throes of his final moments, Ryusaki cursed it, infusing with all the rage and hate burning in his soul, forever turning the once bright and beautiful amulet into a thing of darkness.

While wearing the amulet, you will find it slightly easier to use abilities of a darker nature but you will quickly find that is not where its true power lies. For you see, this amulet shows its true colors when worn by another, one that might not be so inclined to the Dark Arts.

When worn by another, the curse upon the amulet shall make itself known. Within moments, it shall begin to influence the wearer’s mind. Day by day, the wearer’s will shall be tested and they will find themselves more and more willing to use the Dark Arts. And when their path towards the Dark is complete, the amulet shall leave their clutches and find its way back to you.

And the best part? Unless they know about the amulet’s curse, they’ll never even notice that they’ve found themselves on a darker path. Like moths to a flame, or clay to be molded, by you."
1047,,200,Pensieve,Wizarding World,Making,"Exceedingly rare and exceedingly valuable, a Pensieve is a useful tool for teachers and scholars everywhere. With it, you’ll be able to store any memories, yours or that of others, and review them as you please. And you even have two options when it comes to viewing them. The first option is simple projection, allowing you to watch the memories as if it were a show on the telly. It is useful but it pales in comparison to the second option.

By immersing yourself with the Pensieve’s light, you can immerse yourself within the memories, viewing them in amazing detail and letting you spot things you might have missed before. By using it in this manner, you are seeing memories as they truly were at that point in time, a third-person recreation of the events involved. So long as the memories weren’t tampered with, you can discover the truth of the past. As a bonus, you will also be granted knowledge on how to extract memories for use in a Pensieve and how to tamper with them flawlessly, unlike a certain influential Potions professor."
1048,,200,Exploding Snap,Wizarding World,Making,"To give you a brief description, Exploding Snap is a wizarding card game. Unlike Muggle cards however, the cards in Exploding Snap... explode, as the name implies. Fortunately, wizards are a bit more durable than Muggles so the worst injuries one might suffer would be mostly cosmetic, like singed eyebrows and burning hair.

This set however, is a different story. Unlike ordinary Exploding Snap cards, these cards blow up with the force of an Blasting Curse, strong enough to blast through stone and more than enough to serve as an effective weapon against many a foe. And the deck is seemingly never ending, making sure you’ll never run out in a critical moment.

On a final note, should you use these cards for Divination, such as card reading for example, you’ll find that whatever results you see will generally be clearer and more accurate. Even if you have no skill in Divination, surely you can learn a thing or two?"
1049,,200,Goblin-Forged Sword,Wizarding World,Making,"Goblins are truly fascinating beings, wouldn’t you agree? And they can make such wonderful creations if this new sword of yours is any indication. Forged and enchanted through methods so jealously guarded by goblinkind, this sword crafted from pure silver is a beauty to behold. Inset with flawless gemstones of your choice, and a title of yours is engraved upon its hilt, its silver blade can pierce through flesh and bone with ease, even in the hands of a mere child. But that is far from its greatest enchantment.

Like all things goblin-made, the silver is supernaturally strong. A thousand years could pass and it would be as beautiful and clean as it was on the very day it was wrought. And this is due to one fact, the thing makes the creatios of goblins special. Goblin silver imbibes only that which makes it stronger. For example, by bathing in the venom of a basilisk, the blade shall gain the venom’s properties. With so many strange things in this world, such a blade can be quite handy indeed."
1050,,200,Diadem of Ravenclaw,Wizarding World,Making,"Beyond being tremendously skilled witches and wizards, the four founders of Hogwarts had an aptitude for the creation of magical relics. Look no further than Rowena Ravenclaw, a witch who believed that wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure. Even now, her legacy of intelligence, wisdom and creativity stands strong within the halls of Hogwarts and its Ravenclaw students. And yet her legacy remains incomplete, until now.

Lost through the ages, it seems that somehow, Rowena’s diadem has found her way into your hands. Whether it’s a copy or the real thing, the diadem is nonetheless a powerful magical artifact, as befitting of one of the finest witches to have ever lived. So long as the diadem lies on your head, you shall find yourself cleverer and wiser. Things once shrouded in fog shall become clear to you and decisions can be made with a steadier hand and a more knowledgeable mind. However, it is wise to remember that this remains but a tool. It alone does not provide you the knowledge you seek."
1051,,200,Wandcrafting,Wizarding World,Making,"Wands can be found just about anywhere but unless you know just where to look, you’ll be hard pressed to find a witch or wizard who can actually regale you with the finer details of wands. Which is why you’ve taken it upon yourself to learn what you can about wands, from their history, their influence, and most importantly, the creation of wands. Complex and mysterious it may be, you have nonetheless gleaned the art of wandcraft.

You know how to create wands, whether it be through magical and mundane means. You know how each and every single component of a wand will react with one another and how they can best be synergized. You know how to repair them if they ever get damaged and perhaps most importantly, you have learned how to apply your newfound knowledge to create more than just wands. Perhaps you fancy wielding a staff or maybe even something more Muggle, like a sword. With a bit of experimentation, you can have all the fancy casting implements your heart desires."
1052,,200,Portrait Painting,Wizarding World,Making,"To many, art is so much like magic. In your hands, that statement is quite a bit more literal. You see, not only are you a masterful painter, good enough to have your work displayed in museums, you are also knowledgeable in the intricate and delicate art of enchanting said paintings to move and think.

By pouring your magic into a painting of some sort, preferably one representing a sapient being, said painting shall come to life. And if it is a portrait, the person within will behave in a manner most reminiscent of the person they were originally based upon. At first, these portraits will only be a simulacrum of the original person, a copy of their most notable and significant traits with only a few of their most important memories.

But by making portraits of those you are more familiar with, you will find that said paintings will act far more like their original counterparts. And by making a portrait of someone you are truly and intimately familiar with, the portrait shall be an exact copy of them at that very moment."
1053,,200,Ritual Sword Talisman,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,"A talisman patterned after swords used in ritual combat held to honor the Erdtree. It will raise attack power when you are uninjured while held. The practice had died out by the age of King Consort Radagon, but remains of the arenas where ritual combat took place can still be found in every land."
1054,,200,Godfrey Icon,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Making,"A legendary talisman depicting the Elden Lord Godfrey, a ferocious warrior. When he vowed to become a lord, he took the Beast Regent Serosh upon his back to suppress the ceaseless lust for battle that raged within. While bearing this talisman upon your person, you will see an increase in the attack potency of all charged sorceries, incantations, and skills. "
1055,,200,Shaman Staff        ,The Lion King,Making,"You possess a staff much like the one held by Rafiki. The gourds attached to the top of the staff can be broken in half, and the juice used to paint images on walls. The juices can also be used to give blessings, and the staff makes for a great whacking stick! The holder of this staff is also acknowledged as a person of a mystical persuasion. Whether you are treated with reverence or fear depends on your actions and attitude. For no extra cost, you may import an existing staff or wand into this one to gain all of the features mentioned."
1056,,200,Sculpture Magic,Gummi Bears,Making,"You get a sack of refilling dust that when thrown on other animals or beings causes them to turn into frozen statues of themselves. They do not change color or texture but they do become indestructible. You also gain a stone tablet that contains the reversing spell on it, you can of course just memorize the spell."
1057,,200,Great Gummi Medallion,Gummi Bears,Making,"Within this jump this Gummy Bear medallion specifically unlocks and opens/unlocks/turns on ancient gummy bear technology, books and devices. This also lets the magicless cast magic. In future jumps this works in a similar manner, opening, unlocking and turning on ancient devices. These medallions cannot be stolen from you as they will shock the crap out of any thieves. These can only be transferred willingly."
1058,,200,Potioneering,Gummi Bears,Making,"You're good at engineering and altering potions. Basically magic effects in a liquid form that can be stockpiled, sold and distributed to the magic-less for them to use. You can turn just about any magic effect into a potion for others to use and you understand the various magical ingredients and mixtures' effects on each other."
1059,,200,Speed Building,Gummi Bears,Making,"You can build things in a rush, taking roughly 1/4th the time it would normally without the quality suffering. Giant catapults in a few hours, a life-like mask in an hour, a stone bridge built by one person in a day or two."
1060,,200,Control Amulet,Invincible,Making,You have a mystical control amulet. This amulet gives you control over any shape-shifting abilities you have but can not consciously control or are restricted in their use. With this amulet a Werewolf could turn into their wolf-form in broad daylight. This amulet also allows you to cancel out other beings’ attempts to change your form.
1061,,200,Universa’s Staff ,Invincible,Making,"You now possess a perfect replication of Universa’s staff. A tool that is able to absorb and emit seemingly any kind of energy safely, while being physically indestructible. This staff has a functionally unlimited amount of storage capacity for energy and can emit energy in a destructive fashion at such a rate that even weaker Viltrumites could be killed. The only issue with this staff is that it doesn’t auto-regenerate energy and must be refilled from other power sources."
1062,,200,Bloodied Athame,Wizard 101,Making,"A simple dagger with a wet, red sheen to its blade that never seems to wash off. By using this blade on yourself, the blood you draw can be used in any application, enchanting, alchemy, gardening, spellcasting, whatever for a twofold boost in potency. Hypothetically, you may draw on the blood of another, but... Well, I would recommend against it."
1063,,200,Shooting Star Robes,Wizard 101,Making,"A classic Wizard’s attire, a night-blue robe emblazoned with several dozen shooting stars. Enchanted by a powerful Celestian Wizard, the robes empower the Wizard who dons them with the combined power of Sun, Moon, and Stars. Base physical attributes of the Wizard are doubled, magic power is increased by half again, and the robes will resize themselves to fit any form."
1064,,200,Green Thumb Gloves        ,Wizard 101,Making,"A pair of extremely comfy leather gardener’s gloves. Enchanted by faerie magic, working a garden with these gloves increases the plant growth speed dramatically, though less for plants with more magic in them. In purely non-magical vegetables, fruits, and herbs, growth is sped such that it is visible to the naked eye. The growth of magic flora is still increased such that the overall growth time may be half what it would normally be."
1065,,200,Staff of Balance,Wizard 101,Making,"A staff that burns with an inner glow, unearthed from the heart of an ancient tomb upon Krokotopia, it grants its wielders great power, accelerating their accumulation of pips and the regeneration of any of their other sources of magic threefold."
1066,,200,All-Weather Boots,Wizard 101,Making,"From freezing tundra to blasted deserts, from tropical jungles to volcano interiors, these dragon-leather boots are enchanted to keep you nice and comfortable. Cannot protect you from proper environmental hazards, so don’t try running over boiling magma, but you could survive the wilds of Polaris with these boots and your birthday suit."
1067,,200,School Robes        ,Wizard 101,Making,"A full set of Wizard Gear, from your athame and pendant to your boots and pointy hat. Enchanted to enhance your primary school of magic by a moderate amount, about twice as powerful as you are without it, all together."
1068,,200,Enchanting Luminary,Wizard 101,Making,"The Solar school is all about power. Having it, using it, and getting more of it. Now you know how to use Solar magic to enhance your gear. You may impart various buffs to your gear, equivalent to two Solar spell cards worth. You may even infuse entire spells into clothes and wands to be cast at a moment’s notice in battle. You still need to have the pips or mana available to cast it, but it is cast instantaneously. You can have either two Solar spells enchanted into any one piece of gear, one Solar spell and one weak-to-middling attack spell card, or one powerful attack spell."
1069,,200,Friendship Necklace,The Owl House,Making,"This piece of jewelry is no carnival chachki. Made of two halves, this heart-shaped pendant splits to be worn around two separate necks. Reserved only for the bestest of friends, these two pendants will allow the wearers to telepathically communicate with one another, as well as allow each one to sense the other’s emotional state. Perfect for your partner in crime!"
1070,,200,Force Cage,The Owl House,Making,"It’s difficult when people try to worm their way out of a deal with you. Thankfully, you’ve taken precautions. Should anyone try to renege on an arrangement with you, you can trap them in a cube of pure magical force using this dice-shaped gem. If your target still refuses to fulfil their end of the bargain, you can contract the cage to provide… incentive, or even press them into a small, cube-shaped, easy-to-imprison doll. So long as you haven’t voided your contract, you’ll always have a way to enforce your deals."
1071,,200,Cold Steel,The Owl House,Making,"Well, your mileage may vary. Maybe this is a leftover from GROM night, or perhaps you pulled this out of a trash heap one day. Either way, this is a genuine weapon; not the battery-powered kind. Whether this is a flail, a longsword, or something straight out of your human world video games, this melee weapon is more effective than usual against demons and other monsters. It’s also very receptive to enchantment, but you’ll have to figure out how to do that the hard way. The Boiling Isles are an amazing but dangerous place. Maybe it’s best to be prepared."
1072,,200,Black Dragon Set,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"An eerily shaped set of armor, crafted from the scales of the Black Dragon, said to have been a true calamity that even the gods feared. Fitted to your form, the legend of the dragon has imbued this armor, making all enemies who gaze upon your form feel immense dread and terror, liable to make those weak-willed run away at the very sight of you. This can optionally be fused to you, turning your skin or scales a dark obsidian color."
1073,,200,Ring of the Evil Eye,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"A ring inlaid with a black gem that has a white stripe going through it, causing it to resemble the eye of a terrible beast, its gaze as unwavering as its effect. Wearing this ring will make you as vicious as one, allowing you to restore some of your wounds with each enemy that is slain by you, or those that happen to perish nearby."
1074,,200,Ring of the Sun's Firstborn,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"Lord Gwyn's firstborn, who inherited the sunlight, once wore this ancient ring. Lord Gwyn's firstborn was a god of war, but his foolishness would lead to a loss of the annals, and rescinding of his deific status. Today, even his name is not known, but wearing this will see all of your offense focused miracles and holy abilities doubled in potency."
1075,,200,Crystal Ring Shield ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"A shield crafted with the soul of an artificial being, one imbued with a pure magic power. It is quite effective at protecting the user from threats both physical and magical, but the magic imbued within allows it to fire off a disc of magical energy, striking at foes from a distance."
1076,,200,Bellowing Dragoncrest Ring,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"A blue ring that depicts an Everlasting Dragon, the typical symbol of the Vinheim school of magic. This is typically gifted to those who are deemed fit to undertake the journey of discovery, and will greatly improve the potency of all spells the wearer would cast, practically doubling in power. It is an essential tool in any sorcerers kit, one that supplements their hard earned talents."
1077,,200,Master Key,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"Ths iron key may seem lackluster and unassuming, it hides its highly useful ability from casual glance. When inserted into a lock, the blade of the key will shift in order to match, allowing it to unlock any mundane lock you come across. A simple, but very useful tool to have in your possession."
1078,,200,Fashion Souls,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"In the ages to come, many types of armor and numerous differing styles will emerge, each as unique as the kingdoms they hail from. But then, one must decide what they want to wear themselves, what style they’re going for and if they can handle the weight. Should none of the armors or clothing options found here be to your liking, then you can use this to acquire any four sets of apparel found in the Dark Souls series, mixing and matching them as you wish. This can be taken multiple times.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1079,,200,Draconic Weaponry,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"Some of the most powerful weapons to be found are those ripped straight from the flesh of dragons, turning their scales and flesh into deadly instruments of war. This process is a painful one, but it does have its uses, especially for you. You can break off parts of your body, automatically transforming them into potent weapons imbued with a sliver of your power, especially if it was originally your tail. All your broken parts will regrow back slowly, but only if they were lost in an effort to create these weapons."
1080,,200,Golden Arrow,Walt Disney’s Robin Hood,Making,"A solid-gold arrow that nevertheless flies as steadily as a regular one. Gifted to the most talented archers in England, the arrow grants increased accuracy to the user. Furthermore, it makes a surprisingly effective melee weapon as well."
1081,,200,Bitches Love ‘Em,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Making,"Well, you’ve got yourself a piece; a cannon, to be more specific. The armorers of your faction have outfitted you with a piece of heavy ordnance, on par with the Harkonnen Mk1 AT Rifle. This weapon can take many forms, but it will always be weighty, powerful, and memorable. You could have a magazine-fed panzerschreck, a man-portable maxim gun, or another mundane heavy weapon appropriate for a supernatural monster."
1082,,200,Silver Tooth,Hellsing,Making,"A useless little bauble, yet it seems to change shape and material every time you look away. Sometimes it’s a little cross of very old wood, other times it’s a tooth made of silver, sometimes it might even be a little fork of raw iron. Whatever you might be fighting, if you have this little object on you, it’ll take the makeup of the weakness of your foe. It’ll still remain small, thus unlikely to do damage unless the enemy is already critically vulnerable, but it does give you a chance even when your hands are otherwise empty. The curio will always appear in your hand when needed, though using it on an enemy will see it gone for a few days after. "
1083,,200,Shimabara Blade,Hellsing,Making,"A relic of the Shimabara family, from the far east. A sword that shines blue with holy might when in the presence of the unclean, the edge is honed to an unbelievable sharpness even against mortal foes. Cutting stone and metal with ease, the sword only becomes more deadly the more heretical or unholy it’s opponent becomes. If desired, this can be changed for an alternative weapon that operates in a similar fashion. From other melee weapons that grow sharper or stronger against the darkness or even a gun whose shots’ land with greater force. "
1084,,200,Blackbeard’s Bandolier,Pirates of the Caribbean,Making,"This magical bandolier is excellent for storing firearms. It has convenient holsters for 8 different flintlock pistols. Though they’re each only single-shot, they fire despite the weather, and a new one will appear in any holster 1 minute after you’ve fired the last. If you’re fast enough on the draw, you can keep up a withering barrage of ill-aimed fire."
1085,,200,Siren’s Net,Pirates of the Caribbean,Making,"A net woven from the hair of mermaids, this net is attractive to fish. All you have to do is touch a corner of it to the ocean’s surface, and fish from miles around will appear from nowhere. You can try to attract a specific type if you want, and actually fishing with the net is sure to make you wealthy beyond dreams of avarice. Or you can just start a shark feeding frenzy out of nowhere."
1086,,200,Art Supplies,Marry Poppins Returns,Making,"What kind of painter doesn’t even have their own supplies? Well, certainly not you. This handy little tin of Victorian-era art supplies might not be the most advanced set of artistic implements to have ever existed, but they’re superior quality more than makes up for their limited variety. Besides, the materials stored within the vividly-colored tin come with an added advantage, as their mere proximity stimulates the creativity of those around them, banishing artist’s block from even the dullest of individuals. The materials produced from the tin will vary based on the type of art you intend to create, and will automatically refill themselves upon being returned to their original container."
1087,,200,Pocket Watch,Marry Poppins Returns,Making,"Every gentleman needs a good timepiece, and for you, nothing but the finest will suffice. And while it may not be a time machine, this charming gold pocket watch never fails to tell the time. It is perfectly synced to whatever time zone you’re in at the time, and will infallibly adapt to any complications which come up during your travels, no matter how strange or esoteric. Time loops? No problem. Unpredictable and constantly changing lengths of time? Easy. The fabric has started to collapse in on itself like a complex and non-euclidean origami sculpture? Old hat. Of course, this doesn’t actually help to solve any temporal issues you may encounter, but recognition of the problem is the first step towards finding a solution."
1088,,200,Carpet Bag ,Marry Poppins Returns,Making,"It’s full of stars! Well, that’s not quite true. This winsome and perfectly elegant handbag, lovingly crafted from a fine oriental rug of your choosing, is in fact a portal to a pocket dimension far bigger on the inside. Containing nearly 27 cubic feet of storage space on the inside, any object which you manage to fit through the mouth of the bag will find itself perfectly preserved - at least, until you decide to remove it again. In addition to its unusually roomy interior, the bag also comes with a handy self-sorting feature, ensuring that you’ll always find whatever object you desire to retrieve at the very top of the bag. And don’t worry about it getting lost or being destroyed, as it’ll respawn, along with all the objects interred within, after a good night’s sleep."
1089,,200,Pirated Discount Copy Totally Legitimate Magic Wand ,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Making,"You have YOUR OWN wand, not The Royal Wand, that you can cast magic with. This way, you’re not being hounded by the Butterfly Kingdom for stealing one of their royal relics (unless you did, then it totally is.) You can cast magic that’s themed somehow, which is prone to weird sub-effects(“Narwhal Blast”, for example), but can be incredibly potent. Star still has hers, unless you choose to have stolen The Royal Wand. Even if you have Dipping Down, the wand can still help you use your magic; you don’t need it at that point, but it’s still useful. (Comes free with a Wand Charger, because you can’t insert triple A batteries in this.)

The cheap model is either damaged or a cheap knockoff, worthy of the worst stereotypes of such things, and prone to wild side-effects in its spells. Or it might have a mind of its own, with plans. The expensive point model is as good as the Royal Wand; however, you still need the skill to use it. (If you stole the real wand, it’s a 200-pointer, and yes, the Fugitive drawback matches that cost.)

Note: The Magical Wand changes its appearance to match its user, somehow. Umbrellas, baking equipment, weapons, and other such forms have been assumed by the original Royal Wand, so don’t be surprised if the wand you get from this perk abruptly shapeshifts into a form more appropriate to you when you get it."
1090,,200,Box of Truth,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Making,"Perfect for trials or teen parties... that you’re not attending. Lying near it turns it into a being beyond the power of most creatures in this universe, intent on destroying the liars. (Unless you can present it with the right kind of truth/lie paradox. That resets its mood.)"
1091,,200,Rite of Kindling ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"Kindling was a sacred rite passed down among clerics, but all Undead can imitate the process, in the same manner that they restore their Hollowing with humanity. With this, you now know the secret to empowering as well as the creation of bonfires of your very own. How peculiar that humans had found little use for humanity until they turned Undead."
1092,,200,Sunlight Talisman,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"The talisman of Solaire of Astora, the Knight of Sunlight, is decorated with a holy symbol, illustrated by Solaire himself. This talisman is a projection of Solaire's upstanding, unwavering faith. WHen it is on your person, you will find that all of your miracles and similarly holy abilities, regardless of their origins, will be enhanced to new heights of power, as incandescent as the sun itself."
1093,,200,Dragon Bone Fist ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"A thick and heavy weapon made from the bone of an ancient dragon, meant to be worn over one’s hand. The Gods fused the power of a specific golem’s soul with the great bones of the dragons, forming an appropriate core for the giant creation."
1094,,200,Masks of Pinwheel,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"Three masks, once worn by the necromancer Pinwheel. The mask that belonged to the valiant father will improve your strength. The mask that belonged to the kindly mother will improve your vitality. And finally, the mask that belonged to the naive child will improve your stamina recovery. Whether these masks are separate or fused together into one is entirely up to you."
1095,,200,Gold-Hemmed Black Clothes,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"Worn by the witch Quelana of Izalith, mother of pyromancy and Daughter of Chaos. She wore this gold-hemmed black set before even the Age of Fire, but was cast aside, guarded by her mourning brother. While wearing these clothes, you will find all of your fire abilities improved in potency, as well as offering resistance to fire and poison."
1096,,200,Brass Armor,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"After becoming undead, the Darkmoon Knightess visited the Dark Sun Gwyndolin at the Mausoleum of the Spiral Depths, became a Blade of the Darkmoon, and assumed the flame-keeping duty. She received this armor, which hides her hideous form and helps her hunt the guilty. While wearing this armor set, you will find yourself more resistant to the Dark."
1097,,200,Rings of the Four Knights,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"A set of four rings, each of whom once belonged to a knight of the Great Lord Gwyn. The Wolf Ring, owned by Artorias the Abysswalker, makes one more resistant to being staggered or stunned. The Leo Ring, owned by Dragonslayer Ornstein, will improve counter attacks with piercing weapons. The Hawk Ring, owned by Hawkeye Gough, increases the range of bows. And the Hornet Ring, owned by the Lord's Blade Ciaran, boosts the damage dealt by critical attacks."
1098,,200,Master Key,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"Ths iron key may seem lackluster and unassuming, it hides its highly useful ability from casual glance. When inserted into a lock, the blade of the key will shift in order to match, allowing it to unlock any mundane lock you come across. A simple, but very useful tool to have in your possession."
1099,,200,Fashionsouls,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"There are many more armors to be found in Lordran than what is documented here. Should you prefer a different set of armor, either due to its effects or aesthetics, then this is the option for you. Each time you purchase this, you may take any four pieces of armor that can be found in these lands of ancient lords, mixing and matching them so long as they haven’t been mentioned here.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1100,,200,Collection of Humanity,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"An invaluable resource for any undead traversing this land of ancient lords. Small black sprites that, when crushed, will revert the effects of Hollowing, while also replenishing a large chunk of your health. But if the soul is the source of all life, then what distinguishes the humanity we hold within ourselves? You will receive ten of these, which will replenish weekly if used or destroyed."
1101,,200,Hidden Danger,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"In such a lush and vibrant garden, it can be so easy to miss things like rocks or roots, leading to some rather nasty falls. When you are left in such an area, though, it is sure to become a death trap for the unobservant, for you are quite skilled when it comes to the creation of deadly traps and hazards. Spiked pits and punji sticks are the least of what you could create."
1102,,200,Knightly Armour ,Shrek,Making,Armour fit for an ogre. You have a full set of plate armour that is designed for your prodigious size and girth. No matter what form you take this armour will resize to fit.
1103,,200,Fairy Wand,Shrek,Making,"The wand of the fairy godmother, while it initially seemed to have failed on her death, it still seems to make magic twice as fast and half as costly when cast using it. This is a magical focus. Any existing Magic Focus or regular item can be merged with this. Which form it keeps is up to you. So if you want a magical codpiece as your focus go right ahead."
1104,,200,Regenerating Furnishings,Encanto,Making,"This is a set of furnishings with enough pieces to outfit a standard home. These furnishings are saturated with the same magic that formed and maintains the “Colorful Columbian Casita”, and when placed in a home or building they tend to self-propagate to fill out rooms as they are needed or as new ones appear. This magical saturation grants these furnishings regenerative properties that will repair wear and tear and even full destruction. Any new furnishings placed in rooms with any of these pieces will also gain the same magical saturation and regeneration and become part of the furniture collective."
1105,,200,Death’s Cloak ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Making,"This is Death’s cloak which possesses a number of features. First and foremost the cloak is fashionable, granting the wearer a stylish appearance. Second, the cloak conceals the user from all allowing them to remain hidden even from the watchful eyes of Death. Lastly, while it may not look like it, the cloak is incredibly resilient armor. Magical and physical damage alike is incapable of bypassing this fabric. Although sufficient force will still fling the wearer and could damage them. Should the cloak somehow be damaged then it will be restored within a day."
1106,,200,Atlantean Crystal Necklace,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Making,"The crystal that each Atlantean is given at birth gives them a connection to the Heart of Atlantis, lengthening their lifespan far beyond that of ordinary humans. Although they age in a manner similar to ordinary humans during their first years of life, once they reach young adulthood aging seems to halt entirely, to the point that an Atlantean can be in the prime of their life for thousands of years. An old and venerable Atlantean may very well be over twenty- thousand years old. In addition the crystal seems to enhance the physical strength of Atlanteans to a minor degree, allowing them to move noticeably quicker than the average human, vaulting over obstacles with ease, and giving them the strength to floor lesser men with one punch. Finally, the crystal itself has the power to heal minor wounds when pressed against an injury- small cuts, bruises, and the like can be healed, but internal bleeding and gunshot wounds cannot- and can also be used as a “key” for Atlantean technology, though the secret to doing so has been lost due to the great upheaval that sent Atlantis to the bottom of the sea, and the struggle to survive subsequently causing literacy for their own language to become a lost art for all Atlanteans."
1107,,200,Djinn’s Lamp,Twisted,Making,"This ordinary-looking lamp has a magical power to it. By giving it a light rub, you can suck yourself and any willing allies nearby into a small living space located inside of it. Like the lamp of this world, this contains media from beyond time and space - meaning television, film, books and the like from all throughout history can be found within - even from the future. Unfortunately, you struggle to remember details from this media which directly gives insight into future events, although you’ll know plenty of references from all the seasons of your favourite show which have yet to be released."
1108,,200,Heart Box,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Making,"This is a small but well-crafted box with a lock. Prominently displayed on the box is the symbol of a heart being pierced by a sword.

A heart or similar organ that is placed inside the box will be kept in the same condition it was when put inside. This means that the box can be used to keep one or two hearts as trophies from your most hated enemies. Or maybe you can find some other use for them, such as organ transplants or magical ingredients? This box cannot be used to bring people across jumps. If a being is sentient when reduced to a heart or similar organ, they will lose that sentience and be treated as dead if that heart remains in the box at the end of a jump. Likewise, hearts or similar organs that can regenerate from that state back into a “proper’ form lose that regenerative ability if inside the box at the end of a jump. Post-chain, these limits are removed, and any hearts or similar organs will regain sentience and/or the ability to regenerate if they had lost them.

Should the box be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
1109,,200,Cauldron and Ingredients,Brave,Making,"A cauldron, fit for potion brewing.

In addition to the cauldron itself, this item comes with a replenishing supply of all ingredients required to create the bear and message potions created by the witch – not including the hair of specific individuals.

Finally, included with this item is a welder’s mask custom made to fit your face. Handy for the
occasional flash that may occur during the brewing process.

Should the cauldron or mask be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours."
1110,,200,Unlimited Painting Pallet and Brush ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Making,"You have a small lidded travel paint pallet with an endless paintbrush. When opened the pallet will display up to twelve different colored paints that will never run out and whose makeup and color can be changed each time it is opened. The paintbrush will morph into any desired shape and size to be used with the pallet. Want to paint your silver color using adamantium or mothering? Well now you can, you can feed the pallet small samples of various materials to impregnate your paints for various effects, colors, and such. The pallet will remember these materials."
1111,,200,Alchemy ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Making,You have skill in and base knowledge of the use of alchemy and creation of alchemical products
1112,,200,Love Bribes,Tangled,Making,"A special box. Without first taking off the lid, attempts to observe the inside of the box, or to retrieve what’s inside, will invariably fail.

In order to open the box, simply picture a person in your mind as you attempt to remove the lid. The contents inside will vary depending on the person, but will act as either a gift or treat for that person. They might be ingredients for that person’s favourite meals, or a set of paints that would normally take a bit of effort to get your hands on. The contents will never be especially valuable monetarily, but provide an opportunity for you to worm your way into someone’s good graces, or to make up for a bad argument.

The box can be reused once a week. Should the box itself be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours (this doesn’t reset the time between uses of the box)."
1113,,200,Tattoocraft,Moana,Making,"You become a master of tattooing in the traditional Polynesian fashion, and can apply those tattoos far faster and with less pain and swelling that is entirely natural. You instinctively understand the meaning of all tattoos you see from now on. By an act of will, you can alter existing tattoos, either to improve bad ones or repair damaged ones."
1114,,200,Quiver of Thunderbolts,Disney’s Hercules,Making,"Goodness me, what’s this that fell off of Olympus? It’s Zeus’s spare quiver! The one he lost back when... well, never mind. This is an empty quiver, decorated with greek designs. Simply by reaching into it, you can draw forth an endless number or mundane arrows, as well as any exotic arrows you personally have the capability to make. They just appear as you reach in, perfectly ready to be fired.

However, that’s just the first thing about it. The second thing is that once per day, it can create something rather more powerful. It provides you twelve bolts of lightning, one per Olympian. This is very, very powerful lightning, although the exact nature can change. You can have it as magical lightning, capable of slaying even weak immortals and injuring gods and titans... or you can have it as real lightning, several million volts of electricity discharged the instant makes contact with the target."
1115,,200,Bag of Spoils,Disney’s Hercules,Making,"Heroism can be a pretty thankless job, at least unless you can make it really big, And even then while fame is nice and all, real, tangible benefits can remain fleeting. Thankfully, you have this to fix that! This is a simple brown bag, about the size of a coin purse. The size isn’t the special thing about it, though. The special thing is that it tends to collect ‘loot’, of sorts, for you.

In any given universe if there is a possibility of you getting loot for defeating enemies, this ensures you always get that loot, without exception. In universe without such conveniences, it makes sure you get some benefits from slaying the monsters, again in similar patterns. Perhaps a tooth from a dragon you kill may spawn a soldier, maybe an invulnerable beast’s hide provides quality armor, things like that.

The best thing about this bag is, however, that it removed the need to do anything as gauche as actually collecting such loot. Any rewards you’re entitled to are automatically collected in this bag, requiring not a smidgen of effort on your part."
1116,,200,Potioneer,Disney’s Hercules,Making,"There is a lot of magic in this world, and a lot of it takes the form of potions. Which is great for you, as you’re now a truly superb potioneer and alchemist. You have a gift for mixing ingredients, enriching them with magic if you need to or just cutting and preparing them just right. You’re also brilliant at coming up with improving recipes or coming up with new ones, having a gift for these things.

Making a potion that turns a god into a mortal is well within your capacities provided the right ingredients, and that’s only one potion."
1117,,200,Fearsome Staff,Disney Villains Victorious,Making,"A simple staff, it as an imposing aura of authority surrounding it that gives you gravitas - it’s a rather useful tool to get your points across too, whether it’s drawing attention by tapping it against the ground or swinging it to demonstrate action and power! The gem set as its topper also appears to magnify magic channeled through it, and contemplating your schemes while eyeing the gem seems to make the dots connect all the easier."
1118,,200,Crate of Crystals,Disney Villains Victorious,Making,"A collection of magical crystals that hold the energy of Atlantis within them, these valued treasures may act as a power source for small vehicles or personnel-sized items. The crate holds 20 within, and will replenish spent or destroyed crystals."
1119,,200,Magic Focus,Aladdin,Making ,"Most magic users have some sort of foci. Just like many feel the need to grow beards. While staffs are the most common foci, rings, amulets, gems and the like are also used. With this you gain a magical foci of your very own. If you are a proper magician then you have some sort of theme going on and this will reflect that. Besides being a foci, your item has a simple, but useful additional ability. Jafar had the whole snake motif going on and his staff was a cobra that could hypnotize people. You can import previous item for this."
1120,,200,Mood Stones,Aladdin,Making ,"A set of six magical stones each representing an emotion. Those holding the stone will have their emotions changed to match the stone. The stones are; blue (sadness), white (joy), yellow (fear), pink (love), Green (envy), and purple (snobbishness)."
1121,,200,Enchanted Blade,Marvel Britain,Making ,"You own an enchanted blade, its edge is magically enhanced, durable, and nigh-unbreakable, and able to resize itself to fit your body. This blade would allow a normal human to be a genuine threat to powerful supernatural entities. For further costs you can enhance the blade you get in a variety of ways. This blade is in the style you desire, and can be reshaped into a new style of blade every 10 years or new jump, whichever happens first."
1122,,200,Enchanted Blade - Holy ,Marvel Britain,Making ,"For a further 200 cp your blade becomes intensely holy. Like Blade’s paper-mâché sword made out of bible pages. Your blade is able to damage intangible opponents and deals immense damage beyond what should be against any dark or evil creature. Vampires, demons, devil lords, zombies, werewolves, ghosts and beyond, your blade will be a bane to all creatures of the night.

Requires Enchanted Blade to Purchase"
1123,,200,Magic Tool ,Black Clover,Making ,​A tool that helps in the usage of spells. This magic tool enhances and lowers the cost of all magic you cast with it. This can come in any shape and size including a syringe if you desire or even a stereotypical staff.
1124,,200,Loch Shield ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Making ,"An artisanal shield crafted with blue glass. It was originally used to safeguard the leader presiding over a sacred Healing Church ceremony, and later supplied to tomb prospectors, in particular those exploring the labyrinth of Isz. The blue is fashioned after a lake, and the shield nullifies all forms of non-physical damage that strike its surface."
1125,,200,Bloodied Materials,Bloodborne: Covenants,Making ,"Blood, when left alone, typically dries and hardens, though the blood found in Yharnam is different, getting to the point where they may as well be stones. You now have a large collection of both Blood Stones and Blood Gems, the former being used to enhance your equipment while the latter grants them new properties. This collection will restock weekly if they are ever used or destroyed."
1126,,200,LiNKER Recipes,Symphogear,Making ,"Dr. Ver’s LiNKER and Ant-LiNKER recipes, except these will work on other powers too. So long as power compatibility is a concern, these formulas can temporarily increase or decrease compatibility."
1127,,200,A Special Transmutation,Symphogear,Making ,"The bullet-type Lapis Philosophorum, created by Prelati to dispel the Curse of Balal but instead used to destroy a nuke. Upon detonating the Osterman, it created a barrier that gave the three alchemists enough time to transmute their lives to negate the destruction and purify the radioactive fallout. Alternatively, you could shove this up someone’s ass. Respawns once per the shorter of ten years or one jump."
1128,,200,Crown of Allurement,Marvel Magic,Making ,"Many beings are vain, particularly those with the power to make themselves as beautiful as they please. One such being was the creator of this circlet, a sorceress who desired beauty more than all else. This simple circlet will amplify the natural beauty of any who wears it many times over, turning even someone homely into a thing of beauty and turning those already beautiful into something out of myth and legend."
1129,,200,Gram,Marvel Magic,Making ,"​Gram is an ancient straight sword, first wielded by the first hero of Asgard, Sigurd (the Ever Glorious), to slay his brother who had become the dragon, Fafnir. These events were unknowingly orchestrated by Loki to lead to the creation of a magical sword with certain abilities. The magic in this sword allows it to cut through nearly anything, but it curiously is incapable of harming living flesh, instead simply harmlessly passing through it. However, any being stabbed with this blade will find themselves unable to lie while it remains within them and furthermore the sword will cut any mental bindings or magical compulsions from the target’s mind, freeing them from outside influences."
1130,,200,Ring of the Ancient One,Marvel Magic,Making ,"Astral projection, for all that it is a simple ability for most any magician or psychic, is also an immensely useful tool even for a master of the mystic arts. But it also greatly limits the type and amount of the Art they can call upon, preventing them from interacting with the physical plane except in the most limited of manners. Unless, that is, this ring is worn upon the sorcerer's finger. Utilizing this artifact allows the magician to call upon any magic they could in physical form while in their astral form. Of course, you’ll still have a limited amount of time you can spend separated from your physical form, but the time you do will be much more valuable."
1131,,200,Cloak of Levitation,Marvel Magic,Making ,"It, of course, possible to levitate and even outright fly through the use of spells. But such is often draining and requires active conversation, so many sorcerers opt to instead utilize enchanted artifacts to assist them in doing so. You have come into possession of one such artifact -- a replica of Doctor Strange’s Cloak of Levitation. This crimson cape in enchanted to not only allow you to levitate and fly with no drain on your personal reserves and little conscious focus required, but also to move to your mental commands, allowing you to summon it or even utilize it as a clumsy extra limb."
1132,,200,Shield of Perseus ,Marvel Magic,Making ,"The cursed Medusa could turn men to stone with but a single glance upon her. This golden shield of ancient Greek make was reverse-engineered from the Gorgon’s head, bestowing its effects upon it -- though in a reduced form. Any who look upon the stylized gorgon head emblazoned on the center of the shield will find themselves temporarily turned to stone, but will eventually “thaw out” and be freed. More powerful beings may be resistant or even immune to this effect."
1133,,200,Enchanted Guns,Marvel Magic,Making ,"Mortals have prover they are mighty in their own way, standing amongst gods with tools of their own creation. How mighty, then, are the union between the two? These modern assault rifles serve as symbols of human might and are infused with divine magic. With the combined power of mortal and divine, they are vastly bolstered in their ability. The ammunition fired from these dozen rifles can bring great harm to even magical or divine foes that would normally laugh in the face of mortal weapons."
1134,,200,Holy Splinters,Marvel Magic,Making ,"​There are many dark and unholy creatures that seek to prey on the weak and the unprepared -- you are neither. You have come into possession of a number of pieces of the True Cross, upon which Christ was crucified. The holy powers that suffuse these simple splinters are such that even being near them will repel and bring great pain to creatures of darkness or things infernal -- though you yourself are immune -- and actually touching them will bring indescribably pain and boil the skin from their bones."
1135,,200,Avatar suit ,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Making ,"You are now able to materialize a suit of your own design at will. While wearing this suit, you will have superhuman physical capabilities alongside an incredible regeneration factor. If you are an Avatar, you may choose to have the suit be connected to the God, though this is optional. If you do decide to do so, then the suit will give you additional abilities depending on the god/goddess you are the Avatar of."
1136,,200,Fallen Relic,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Making ,"Long ago, a god left behind a weapon on par with Mjolnir or Hela’s headdress behind. It seems that weapon has judged you worthy enough to bond with you, bestowing powers akin to that deity’s even if not fully equivocal. Moreover the damage this artifact has sustained has enhanced it in a way, allowing it’s brittle form to strike remotely of its central mass-yet retaining full force, held together by whatever that god’s power was. Mjolnir was already a terrifyingly powerful weapon capable of accelerating to and from the atmosphere’s edge in seconds, what can it do now it can dissolve into buckshot? (For something like the headdress, it’s safe to assume the blades that it generates are what crumble to fragments at your will)"
1137,,200,Forge of Heroes and Villains,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Making ,"A dark legacy fuelled by grim deeds, this red-hot cauldron offers neither arms nor armour for weary travellers. Only the promise of a miracle paid in blood: The resurrection of an entire destroyed universe. And the payment is significant people from different realities, heroes and villains alike. Oddly the actual power of the individuals doesn’t seem to matter-only their significance. How many lives would you trade to bring back everyone in a world you care deeply fore? Just remember: Those cast into the forge die forever, not even resurrected in the new reality."
1138,,200,Claws of Menhit,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Making ,"The might of a lion is terrible indeed, for those who find themselves hunted are not expected to last long. It would only make sense then that the same applies from one who possesses a boon from She Who Massacres. Metal claws stained in red, those who wield them will find they possess heightened senses and an instinct for hunting and killing that can turn even the meek into a fearsome hunter. Furthermore, allowing the claws to feed on the blood of those it slays can nourish and heal the wielder from wounds sustained in battle, allowing no end to an endless carnage."
1139,,200,Spinning Wheel of Arachne ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Making ,"Taking the form of an old spinning wheel with webs and spiders nesting inside the circle, this relic is a testament to the skill of those who would dare challenge the gods themselves. The spiders within eternally produce a silk that is as glamorous as it is tough, letting one weave with a thread that never allows itself to be torn or ripped by normal, mundane means such as fist or blade. In addition, any fabric you attempt to feed the spiders will soon have its traits mixed with the silk, making the spiders create something marvelous."
1140,,200,Vaulting Boots of Valtorr ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Making ,"Sometimes you get pushed off a building. Sometimes there’s a large canyon you need to cross. It happens to the best of us, and that’s why you need to be prepared. A pair of unassuming boots, they have been enchanted to nullify the adverse effects of high-distance landings so long as you land on your feet. They also increase the wearer’s natural jumping ability significantly, and create magic circles which allow the wearer to briefly walk along the air itself! Truly a boon to any adventurer."
1141,,200,Berserker Staff ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Making ,"Technically more of an Asgardian relic rather than a purely magical one, it is nonetheless an effective tool that brings honor to the Nordic legends of warriors who would drown the fields in the blood of their enemies. Made from a strange metal, any who wield this staff receives a surge of both super-strength and adrenaline that allows them to fell entire groups effortlessly. This is also helped by being fueled with their inner rage and hatred, giving that extra push needed to go from a mere user to a mind capable of breaking bone and sundering flesh."
1142,,200,Vibranium Sample,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 1,Making ,"Vibranium is an extremely rare element that possesses unique attributes. In a pure mass, vibranium forms a solid metal that is stronger than steel, but only a third of the weight, as well as being completely vibration absorbent. This means it can absorb the impacts of a great deal of attacks, but bear in mind high-energy attacks WILL do damage... especially if it is consistent. Purchasing this gets you a container a foot in length with some Wakandan Vibranium shards that will replenish itself every month."
1143,,200,Infernal Contract,Ghost Rider,Making ,"Less of an item, more of a specific trick you can do; you’re capable of summoning contracts in a small burst of Hellfire, written to your specifications and tailored to the deal that you have in mind. It’s also perfect, with no loopholes or anything that would allow the person you’re making a deal with to screw you over, unless for some reason you want them to do that. Very cool, if nothing else."
1144,,200,Megingjord ,Marvel Primal,Making ,"A great golden belt, adorned with small circles, which doubles the strength, durability and powers of whomever wears it. Beware that you may be greatly weakened or pass out for several hours after removing this belt of strength."
1145,,200,Muramasa Equipment        ,X-23,Making ,"The legendary Demon blacksmith Murasama himself has forged a piece of personal equipment for you. This can be a shield, sword, gun, or even armor. What makes his equipment so legendary besides the fact he is one of the greatest smiths to ever live, is his power of Soul Forging that puts a portion of the recipient's soul and emotions into the piece. This Soul Forging makes his weapons so deadly they can cut through Adamantium and reduces the healing speed of wounds. Soul Forged shields and armor gain incredible defense that even Murasma weapons can not pierce. Be careful with anything made by Murasama since anyone can use the equipment once it has been made."
1146,,200,Sling Ring,Ultimate Marvel,Making ,A small two-finger ring imbued with the power to open and sustain dimensional portals between any two points within the universe. Only usable by those well versed in the mystic arts.
1147,,200,Summonable Armor,Thor: Love and Thunder,Making ,"There’s nothing wrong with the Einherjar armor, but at the same time, you may want to distinguish yourself from the rank and file. Don’t be a redshirt. You have a beautiful set of armor, on par with the former king of Asgard’s. It’s more durable than the Einherjar armor, equivalent to an Iron Man suit. This personalized marriage of style and practicality can be summoned and summoned whenever you want, so you can protect yourself at a moment’s notice or take it off when you need it to."
1148,,200,Worthy Sliver,Pet Avengers,Making ,"This is a small piece of uru metal broken off of a worthy weapon. When struck against the ground it becomes a hammer sized for you to wield, and you find your form shifted into something somewhat humanoid, able to stand on its hind legs, and with prehensile hands as well as possessing a throat capable of human speech. This weapon also is an excellent channel of your other powers, able to withstand the full force of your blows - unless you use it to channel them above their normal limits - and even amplifying your powers slightly. Also, much like Mjolnir, you can call this weapon back to your hand with your will, leading it to smash through impediments in its path. It does not have Mjolnir’s other powers.

If you give this worthy sliver to another, they may use it to change into an anthropomorphized shape and to gain a small (<1%) fraction of your powers while wielding it."
1149,,200,Elixir of Long Sleep,Pet Avengers,Making ,"This magic elixir can be used to put whatever drinks it to sleep. This enchanted sleep will last until woken by outside forces, or many centuries have passed. Once used you will get a new elixir at the start of the next jump."
1150,,200,Los Amuletos del Tigre,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Making ,"The head and paws of a jade tiger statuette, broken off by a dying kung fu master so his pupils, the Sons of the Tiger, could avenge him, then discarded and found by Hector Ayala, the White Tiger who passed them to his little sister Ava after his death. The amulets grant the speed, strength and grace of the tiger- which seems to translate into about enough to make Spider-Man sweat- and the ability to reflexively, instinctively fight with the skill of a Shaolin Master. Though without the same discipline, experience and academic knowledge, understanding of the hows and whys, you would lag a few steps behind the likes of Iron Fist and Shang Chi in pure skill. If the amulets are returned to the statuette, also provided, it would open a portal to K’un L’un where the masters would be all too happy to teach you the folly of relying on borrowed power and shortcuts to mastery."
1151,,200,Crystalline ,Marvel 2099,Making ,"You are able to create and project crystalline objects from your hands. This is limited to simple objects, but you could create a crystalline weapon, a shield, or a wall. You can control the hardness of these crystals, from relatively fragile, to hard as solid stone, and potentially could learn to make them even as hard as diamond though that is beyond you at this point. It is easiest to create objects directly in your hands, but you can create them at a range, even across a large room. You can create these crystals fast enough to encase multiple people who are surprised and unaware of your presence, though encasing someone actively dodging would be difficult for you."
1152,,200,Demonic Freemasons ,Helltaker,Making ,"The same way Hell is full of construction materials and Judgement’s SIN MACHINE is a magitech wonder, you too can construct puzzles. Apart from being an engineer, freemason and electrician, you’re able to work flawlessly with esoteric materials and magic when crafting something. In general you also get a boost to compatibility when using demonic or eldritch substances. The only thing limiting you now is your imagination and the materials available."
1153,,200,Sling Ring ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Making ,A sling ring is a tool used by sorcerers to make it easier to open portals. This is your personal ring and will be enchanted to return to you if you lose it or if it is stolen. You can use this ring even if you have no talent in magic. It will make it noticeably easier to travel to other locations and will be able to access hidden areas such as other realms and warded areas such as Kamar-Taj.
1154,,200,Adamantium,Amalgam Comics,Making ,An indestructible metal unique to Wakanda. You get one ton that replenishes weekly.
1155,,200,Wind Sword ,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Making ,"Looking for all the world like nothing more than an empty hilt, the Air Sword is a rare but remarkable weapon designed by military-minded Air Nomads. Using Airbending, one can focus a gust of wind through the hilt, creating a razor sharp blade of wind that can cut through most materials with ease. Though designed for Airbenders, other Benders may learn how to use the Blade for their element as well, creating lethal swords of water, earth, or fire."
1156,,200,Black Keys ,Fate/Zero,Making ,"A Black Key is a long, weighty sword with a cross like guard that is considered to be a symbol of the Executor group within the Church. Sharp enough to easily slice through metal, they are partially spiritual weapons and can be filled with magical power to increase their size, durability and sharpness, as well as eventually becoming able to take on different properties, such as pinning shadows to the ground to immobilise people or to be imbued with fire. Black Keys make for awkward swords, though they can be mastered to be such anyway, and are more commonly used as large throwing knives. Only the guard is physical, with the blade being manifested from magic and this allows one to store dozens or hundreds under a coat with ease. You receive one hundred Black Keys in total, each regenerating an hour after being broken. "
1157,,200,Black Keys,Fate,Making ,"You receive a group of long cross like throwing knives, numbering roughly one hundred and able to be shrunken down and carried in your sleeves. While these blades do not possess any special killing power beyond being exceptionally sharp blades, they are very good at pinning or binding spiritual entities. Even a Servant could be locked down for a minute or so if you can hit them with a couple. "
1158,,200,Awesome Shades ,Toaruverse,Making ,It is annoying for enemies that always use flashbangs to escape. With this you gain stylish sunglasses to protect your eyesight from being temporarily blinded by your enemies or when in fighting no matter how bright it is even if the distraction is made of magic especially made to do that and looking directly at the sun with it should be fine as well. Wearing normally should also be fine as it improves your appearance and style.
1159,,200,Lotus Wand,A Certain Magical Index,Making ,"This ordinary-looking metallic religious staff has an ornamental statue of a seraph at its head. When the correct chant is chanted, the seraph’s wings open up and its special abilities come into play. In a similar fashion to voodoo dolls, damaging the wand will cause an attack to happen at the wielder’s choice of location. Giving it a good whack will create a blunt impact, while scratching or cutting it will create cutting blades of air. Despite the numerous possibilities, there is a small delay between the initial damaging of the wand and resulting attack. You’ll need to lead your targets for this one."
1160,,200,Seven Wires,A Certain Magical Index,Making ,"These seven enchanted magical wires seem to possess a few strange properties. They don’t seem to break, can change in length, and are incredibly sharp. You control them with your magic, and they can attack from several different directions. Though they have a limited range, and you don’t seem to have as much fine control over them as a certain Saint does, they do allow you to shred others into pieces from afar. Most armour has nothing on you."
1161,,200,Ascalon,A Certain Magical Index,Making ,"A 3.5m long, 200kg heavy sword made specifically for killing dragons. The blade itself has seven sections in total, namely an axe blade, a razor blade, a church-key spike, a fretsaw wire, a giant saw, a hook spike, and a regular spike near the grip. The blade changes colour when mana is channelled to the different sections of the sword. There are two hidden weapons inside the whole thing, namely a regular longsword in the pommel, and a giant mace produced from the wire. Strength to wield the whole damn thing not included."
1162,,200,Cloak and Dagger,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A grand cloak, concealing a half-dozen daggers. Increases melee damage and lethality, and gives the bearer an uncanny ability to dodge attacks when stealthed- and also allows them to bypass the protectors of guarded enemies to strike at them when unseen. "
1163,,200,Absinthe,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A jug of rotgut; carrying it around will increase resistance to blight and disease substantially, while at the same time greatly increasing the odds of poisoning an enemy. "
1164,,200,Mask of the Timeless ,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A mask/helmet combination that leaks blue mist; when worn it offers enhanced reflexes, making it easier to dodge blows and move more quickly in battle. "
1165,,200,Padded Armguard,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A studded gauntlet meant to offer protection when training beasts for the purposes of battle. It enables you to evade blows better, and when protecting an ally it offers greater physical protection against damage."
1166,,200,Tempting Goblet ,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A goblet full of foul, yet fragrant red… wine? Carrying it invigorates and quickens the body, making you faster, more able to dodge, and fortifying health; but the substance strains the mind, deepening the stress and fears of its cup-bearer- or anyone who has the misfortune to have it splashed against their skin, let alone the tongue."
1167,,200,Materia Pestis ,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A vase of rare and poisonous flowers. Holding a bloom will not only make it easier to poison your foes, but it also makes poisons last longer than they would normally."
1168,,200,Fasting Seal ,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A talisman depicting the agonized face and skeletal body of one who succumbed to starvation, this item completely eliminates hunger and starvation in the bearer and makes it a bit easier to dodge- as if their frame was thinner. "
1169,,200,Salacious Diary,Darkest Dungeon,Making ,"A well-kept and possibly heretical book of carnal fantasies belonging to a certain Vestal. Although sharing it may be ill-advised, simply carrying it makes your healing moderately more affective and grants a contagiously good mood when at rest."
1170,,200,Fires of Creation,Bayonetta,Making ,"Humanity has always been fascinated with the gift of fire. It molds and shapes the power of metal. It gives life, and takes it away just as easily. As a part of the God that loved humanity so much, should you not harness this wonderful gift? In addition to being immune to normal fires, you will find that any creation you make while using fire in the process is shaped much more easily, becoming higher in quality in the process. The fires of creativity are stoked by you... make this gift count."
1171,,200,Time to Work,Bayonetta,Making ,"You know how to create all kinds of weapons. Miniguns, swords, daggers, rifles, rocket launchers, shotguns, the works. Any mundane weapon is as easy as pie for you to create, and if you put your mind to it you can even alter these creations to have infinite ammo. You are even able to modify other weapons to possess this feature. How? Good question, but is that a secret you really want to share?"
1172,,200,Conjurer's Coat,Shovel Knight,Making ,"You will be much frailer, but get more mp and regain mp on enemy death."
1173,,200,Reflexium,Trinity Wonder,Making ,"Reflexium is an extremely rare, not to mention valuable, alloy developed in this world. Due to the interesting arrangement of the atoms within it, it has the singularly unique quality of being able to near perfectly reflect any kind of kinetic impact that hits it. This means that projectiles such as bullets or even Enhanced shockwaves will be all but worthless against it. The metal is not magic though, and so this reflection has a limit. A good ki blast from a powerful Murim Warrior is more than enough to tear a hole through it. You will receive a good few tons of this metal in molten form each jump, sealed within a heat proof container. Simply cast into the shape you desire and allow to cool. Not to be confused with Vibranium. Along with this is the formula on how exactly you would go about forging more of this precious alloy."
1174,,200,Potion Chest ,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"A simple chest designed to safely store potions, keeping them in perfect conditions to last and not be broken. However, its main feature is a pair of glass tubes on the lid that, if each is fed a potion, will combine the two doses of potion into a single one with the effects of both, whether they have different or identical effects. These composite potions can be further combined, but each one after the first has a chance of the potions destabilizing and spoiling. There are also four slots in the side of the chest that will produce three copies of any potion fitted into the slot after 24 hours, so long as the potion doesn’t require exceptionally rare ingredients."
1175,,200,Alchemist's Flask,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"the opening at a material will give you some information on the alchemical properties they have. Doing so with a solvent in the flask will give you information on how it will react with the solvent. Potions can be made using this flask alone, though they will not last long outside the flask. To help with this, the flask can store up to ten different potions with a total of ten doses of each type of potion. You can choose which of these potions is currently in the flask with a simple thought.

If you find a stabilizing agent, you may be able to bottle and sell the potions created with this flask, however, without such an agent, the potions only last a few hours outside the flask itself."
1176,,200,Potioneer's Cauldron,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"A surprisingly light cauldron that naturally brings out and enhances the magical properties of materials placed inside of it. Potions made in this cauldron have twice the yield for the same amount of materials, last twice as long before they spoil, if at all, are generally more stable than they normally would be when it’s beneficial for you, and have a slightly higher potency than they would if made with a normal cauldron. The cauldron has a convenient spigot at its base and comes with flasks and vials to store the potions."
1177,,200,Alchemical Armaments(200),Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"Alchemy has been known to awaken supernatural qualities in objects before, and this has been weaponized in many cases. This tool is one such example. Be it a weapon, a piece of armor, or something as mundane as a lantern, this armament has been subject to an alchemical treatment that has brought out some supernatural quality.

For 200cp, this is a stronger example, made with specialized materials infused directly into it during the creation process. To use the same examples as above, the dagger would be able to fire off blades of razor sharp wind and fly back to the wielder’s hand, the lantern could fire off rays of light to revert a shapeshifter to their base form and cause its flames to lash out, while the breastplate could instead absorb acid and synthesize a resin able to repair itself from damage done to it."
1178,,200,Homunculus Creation,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"The knowledge of how to create homunculi is at your fingertips. By shaping various materials into the form of a living creature and imbuing it with a touch of life through various alchemical processes, you can create small living beings as companions and allies. While not particularly strong, they are fully living beings and can aid their creator, possessing a subtle bond with them from the moment of creation. With time and practice, it is possible to create stronger, more dangerous homunculi and to deepen the bond between creator and creation. This can also allow for the creation of golems for more mindless servants."
1179,,200,Compounding,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"You have the ability to create alchemical compounds, a proper fusion of similar materials that combine and bring out new qualities in a way normal reactions cannot. This takes the metaphysical properties of the materials used in the compound and brings them to the surface, combining the results into an altogether new set of properties, often with supernatural results. While this is easiest with minerals such as copper, carbon, and iron, it can also be used on non-mineral substances such as herbs and solvents, however, this requires considerable practice and a lot of experimentation to even begin to achieve."
1180,,200,Artificer ,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"Alchemy isn’t all about potions and transmutation, it is also about the creation of devices that carry the mystical and supernatural qualities put into them. You have learned how to use alchemy to create various artifacts with supernatural effects in a form of enchanting, using what properties you can pull out from the materials and combining them to create something new."
1181,,200,Spellvials,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"You know a process by which you can create what is known as a neutral potion; a potion that carries no effect of its own but is receptive to supernatural powers. By channeling a supernatural ability into the potion, it takes on the effects of that supernatural ability. It can also be mixed with a few drops of another potion to take on that potion’s original effects at the same level of strength."
1182,,200,Material Purification,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"You are able to draw out some of the innate properties of a material or substance and allow it to project that property in some small fashion, creating a Pure form of that material. This works best with metals, but can be quite effective with non-metallic materials. While a pure material is in contact with an individual, even through clothing, it grants a few minor abilities, such as Pure Silver having a disease warding effect as well as a bastion against supernatural influences."
1183,,200,Renewable Resources,Generic Alchemist ,Making ,"You have learned a number of unusual alchemical processes that can be used to allow for normally non-renewable resources, such as metals, to be renewed in some fashion, effectively allowing you to treat such materials as a plant that can be cultivated. You also know how to recreate certain magical properties in baser materials to turn them into alchemically active variations."
1184,,200,Talisman of Ascension,League of Legends,Making ,"This gleaming, golden disc created in the image of the Shuriman Sun Disc holds a powerful defensive enchantment. When the wearer is bathed in sunlight, they will feel hardier, they will be able to shrug off blows easier, and their body will naturally heal wounds faster. Holding the Talisman up to the sun will grant the bearer and their allies a burst of incredible speed- if only for a short time. The Talisman can be invoked in this way once an hour."
1185,,200,Abyssal Scepter,League of Legends,Making ,"A weapon infused with the energy of the Void, this wicked staff has an ominous air that inspires dread in all who behold it. Crafted of the skull and spine of a wicked mage, this staff boosts the user's resistance to hostile magics, and reduces the magical resistance of nearby enemies in turn."
1186,,200,Shimmer,Arcane,Making ,"Shimmer, the drug of choice for many in Zaun, is one of the miracles of chemtech. Able to be used to give a burst of energy and healing, to grant incredible strength, or even as a fuel, Silco’s organisations have made a pretty penny selling this in the lanes, and now so can you. This item is a chest filled with vials of shimmer, as well as the equipment needed to manufacture more, and the seeds for the flowers from which it’s extracted. Even if you don’t make more yourself, the chest will be refilled once a month."
1187,,200,Hexcrystals,Arcane,Making ,"Though beautiful in appearance, these blue crystals are worth far more than their looks. You have twenty of these blue, roughly-spherical gems, each of which has tremendous magical power locked inside them. These could each power large amounts of hextech, or perhaps be used for some other purpose. You may choose whether these gems are the unstable, natural variety or the more refined and stabilised kind used in later hextech, choosing for each gem, and each gem seems to be able to provide power indefinitely, though they each have a limit in terms of how much power they can provide at a time. While inside their case, the gems are held in place and you can be assured they won’t detonate. The case will refill once per three months - so use your gems wisely."
1188,,200,Weapons(200),Arcane,Making ,"This isn’t always the nicest world, and it often pays to have something to put between yourself and an enemy.

For 200 CP, what you’ve got is quite the treasure; a weapon with real magical powers, or just great technological potency. This might be something like Vi’s Atlas Gauntlets, Jayce’s Mercury Hammer, or the shattered blade used by Riven."
1189,,200,Cackling Crafter,A Throne of Glass,Making ,"You are masterful crafter of all of the Witch Crafts, able to make flying brooms from Ironwood or Redwood, craft spaces that are larger on the inside, and mirrors that can help you gaze across vast distances and through wards. You are even able to craft the potent mirrors that can focus and increase magical power that they have been exposed to, mirrors that would normally permanently diminish the witch who made them in their creation. Your greatest gift is that when enchanting or creating magical artefacts you will never be permanently diminished or damaged through the fact of their creation, and the item will be made at its full intended power. While their creation may take chunks out of your life force or magical power, you are now guaranteed to not only never die in their creation but to always regenerate anything taken from you back to your prime, within a few months at most."
1190,,200,Grafting Mastery! ,Super Dragon Sword ,Making ,"You are capable of harvesting body parts from monsters you’ve slain, giving you the opportunity to graft them during a period of peaceful rest. These body parts can be used to grant innate traits and natural weapons from monsters onto your allies, and yourself if you’re willing to risk it."
1191,,200,Perfumer,Super Dragon Sword ,Making ,"You are capable of creating potent perfumes that grant desirable boosts in motivation and clarity of focus in yourself and your allies. You are able to infuse the Courage, Focused, Determined, and Regen status effects into your smoke-bombs and other alchemical creations."
1192,,200,Vanish into Smoke ,Super Dragon Sword ,Making ,"Your ability to use your smoke to evade foes is extremely precise. You are able to create smoke-bombs that grant you the Enshrouded status effect, imposing the Blinded status effect against both your allies and opponents when they are targeting you, making it difficult to attack you with melee strikes and nearly impossible to target with ranged attacks or spells. "
1193,,200,Better than New,Super Dragon Sword ,Making ,"When you fix things up, they’re more than fixed. They’re improved. You can take time over the course of a peaceful rest to maintain a piece of gear such as a weapon or piece of armor, after which the piece of equipment is at Peak Condition. This wears off after a day or so, but during that time, the equipment is working at beyond its maximum capabilities, being much more durable or powerful than it has any right to be, just by the sheer amount of attention drawn to bringing out its best."
1194,,200,Armed Mode,Super Dragon Sword ,Making ,"The secrets of an even stronger armor have been revealed to you. You are capable of modifying your armor to have up to two of the following status effects active while wearing it, as well as a simple weapon such as a crossbow or dagger integrated Into the suit: Haste, Phys. Shell, Regen, and Elemental Omen. (Any element)

1195,,200,Oils Essentia ,Super Dragon Sword ,Making ,"You are capable of creating ‘oils’ that apply elemental effects to your weapons and ammunition, allowing you to take advantage of weaknesses and any creatures that can only be harmed by magic. In addition, you are capable of utilizing oils that enhance your vitality and strength for a certain amount of time."
1196,,200,Magic Bag,Ben 10,Making ,"Aw, what a cute little bag you’ve got there with those little shark teeth for a zipper. This is a magical bag that stores both magical energy and spell components. It has a lot more room than it seems, being able to fit a house’s worth of stuff inside of it and then ejecting whatever you happen to need that second on command. Good for sorcery on the go!"
1197,,200,Potion belt,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Making ,"This snazzy belt holds six potions. Each is clearly labelled, and the belt protects the potions from most attacks. Each potion has a useful effect. There will always be at least one healing potion on the belt, while the others provide temporary stat boosts or effects like flight and invisibility. An hour after a potion is drunk, destroyed, or lost, a new randomized potion will appear on the belt. "
1198,,200,Artefact,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Making ,"A potent item that provides several benefits, these are not damaged by mundane phenomena up to and including being dropped in lava - it requires serious effort to destroy one of these. An artefact weapon is potent and includes elemental attacks, a ring might make you all-but-immune to a single element or slightly resistant to every common source of damage in the dungeon. But being made with a dungeon crawl in mind, the enchantments they carry are all rather simple in design. "
1199,,200,Fae Made ,King Arthur ,Making ,You've been blessed with an item made by fairies. Such items are completely unbreakable and completely out perform other similar items made by human hands. Even magical effects are more effective when applied. May also have another item upgraded including any you’ve bought here for no extra charge.
1200,,200,Enchanted ,King Arthur ,Making ,Not an item but an upgrade for an existing one or one bought here. By choosing to enchant an item you can give it a number of special effects. This can be anything from giving it elemental properties to making it absorb other items to gain their effects or draining your enemies of their blood and making the item stronger. There isn't much you can't have it do.
1201,,200,Sword plant,King Arthur ,Making ,"In your hands hold the power to grow nearly anything, even man made objects. Just plant pieces of objects and they grow bigger or more complex. You might plant a branch and grow a log, or a bee and grow a hive, even metal objects can be planted."
1202,,200,Alchemy  ,King Arthur ,Making ,"Healers must use a variety of methods when trying to cure the common peoples and sometimes even nobles. Among this arsenal of healing techniques is knowledge in use of Herbs, poisons, and even explosive or flammable compounds. While you probably couldn't reconstruct an arm with just these you could cure almost any disease. In a time where more people die of diseases than in battle it's a great skill to have."
1203,,200,Self-Made Equipment,Dresden Files,Making ,"A focus is good, but it’s just a start. Over the course of time, any self-respecting Wizard comes up with their own little collections of tools and tricks, like Harry Dresden’s duster and rings, or the Warden Swords designed and made by Anastasia Luccio. This is yours. It’s a collection of small-scale, superbly made magical tools, weapons and equipment designed to be highly useful in day-to-day work. Maybe there’s a map that you’ve enchanted to be extremely useful in tracking people and things, maybe there’s a suit of clothes tougher than any armor…everything here is things anyone wizard could make with some time and effort, but these ones are notable for being made really well."
1204,,200,Potions Cabinet,Dresden Files,Making ,"A small cabinet holding about a dozen vials of any combination of potions you can think of. These can be any potion seen in the books, or other potions that can logically be considered to exist. These can’t be anything truly rare or impossible, mind you. No fairytale love potions or elixirs of immortality. But powerful healing draughts, lust and escape potions… all that can probably be found here, and more. Oh, and everything here is made from the very finest ingredients that can possibly be. No shortcuts here, no sirree. The contents of this thing get restocked every week. Unused potions stack."
1205,,200,Thorn Manacles,The Dresden Files,Making ,"A nasty piece of work first invented by Trolls, these manacles are built to keep the person inside from using magic. Any time a caster is locked in them, they'll not only shut down the casting, but reinforce how bad an idea trying is by sending dozens of razor-sharp points to stab the wearer's wrists until they get the point. If you'd like, you can trade them in for a set of fuzzy ones without the sharp points, but with the same magic-disrupting qualities. A good caster can get through that variety, but if you'd like to shut off your own magic for a bit, and don't mind the side-eye, they'll do the trick."
1206,,200,"""Anri’s Straight Sword"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Sword precious to Anri, another Unkindled. The dullest type of blade found in the ruined land of Astora. Only, it was once the sword of an earnest noble figure, and its attacks are boosted by that elusive, essential property unique to humans: luck."" A copy of the unique sword wielded by Anri of Astora, this seemingly unremarkable straight sword is actually host to several enchantments that, when combined together, make for a wholly unique weapon found nowhere else. The first is that, the power of the blade scales with the user’s luck without the need for a Hollow infusion. At the same time the blade has a power blessing on it, mending minor injuries over time and inflicting additional damage against the undead, and even preventing certain types of undead from rising up after death."
1207,,200,"""Iron Dragonslayer Armor"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Stark melted armor of the ancient Dragonslayer Armor. The Armour, defeated by the Champion of Ash in Lothric, was left ages to rust, until it slipped into an abyssal swamp, where it was possessed once again by the memory of the hunt."" A heavy set of armor worn long ago by a dragonslayer who served the Nameless King and resized to fit a human body. This suit possesses great defenses against most sources of damage, especially lightning due to the former owner’s affinity for it, with only a slight vulnerability to curses. Bears a faint resemblance to the armor worn by Ornstein, sharing a similar red plume, further strengthening the armor’s ties to the old dragonslayers of Gwyn."
1208,,200,"""Profane Coffers"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"This provides three seemingly normal strongboxes overflowing with treasure. Gold, silver, jewels, the stash has great monetary value, yet it is stained in blood and sin. The treasure in these coffers have two distinct abilities. When the treasure is donated, offered freely or otherwise given away in a charitable manner, the one who gave it away will experience good luck that fades over time. The greater the show of charity, the longer this luck will last. Those overcome with greed or avarice have another thing coming however. The treasure carries a curse that will feed on the sinful behavior of hoarding or stealing the stealing the treasure for personal gain. Simply keeping it will not trigger the curse, but keeping it to one's self when it would knowingly be far more helpful in someone else's hands would. Stealing even a coin of it from someone who needs it would. If the person with a piece of the treasure in their possession does not repent for their harmful actions, the curse will trigger. Fire from the sky, visible only to the one overcome with greed, will burn them black, leaving their surroundings untouched. The greedier one's actions are, the stronger the flame and the quicker it will come. As a rule of thumb, the more treasure in the equation, the stronger the resulting effect, though there are exceptions. If one of your coffers ends up completely depleted, you will find it full again at the beginning of the next jump."
1209,,200,"""Lapp’s Armor""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Steel armor of the amnesiac Lapp. This plate-armor body, that covers the torso cleanly without even slight gaps, provides heavy defense. Quite fit to conceal a hollowed body, and indeed one’s very identity."" Heavy armor that provides appropriately heavy defense, the armor conceals the wearer’s body entirely when worn save for the thin holes in the helmet for seeing. The only exception to this defense is the curse resistance, which is more middling in comparison to everything else; fitting, considering how curses vexed the wearer so."
1210,,200,"""Millwood Knight Armor"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Armor worn by knights of Millwood. The charbronze breastplate and the thick black cape are adorned with the symbol of the Ethereal Oak. When the fabled Millwood forest was discovered it was a vacant ruin. The only thing left was the Ethereal Oak, stood rotting. No corpses were discovered, yet their belongings lay neatly on the ground."" Protective, if heavy armor with high resistances to everything save for fire and curses, where it has more moderate defenses. The helmet is adorned with antlers, believed to grow from the blessed beast of the Ethereal Oak; the set as a whole is good for wanderers of frigid landscapes who expect to find battle on their journey thanks to the heavy steel and thick furs providing both protection and comfort."
1211,,200,"""Millwood Battle Axe""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Battle axe wielded by Millwood Knights. Its blade is blessed by the symbol of the Ethereal Oak. A hefty axe normally wielded by the mightiest of warriors. "" Much lighter than its description would have you believe, this axe is a fantastic weapon for warriors due to its light-weight and easy heft enabling it to be swung quickly. When properly infused and buffed the deadliness of the weapon increases greatly, particularly if its wielder utilizes the running slash used by Millwood Knights."
1212,,200,"""Dragon Tooth""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Created from an everlasting dragon tooth that will never break. Left by Havel himself, along with his boulder-like great shield."" This tooth, fashioned into a huge, sturdy club. It possesses a mysterious property as well, somewhat warding the wielder from magic and fire."

The Archdeacon McDonnell's trespass, the sin of channeling faith for sorcery, transformed what was once merely a symbol of ecclesiastic authority into a catalyst of sorceries."" As it says above, this is a staff used for casting Sorcery, but is curiously empowered by faith, and is quite receptive of the force at that. (Sidenote: An ideal Sorcery staff for those who picked up ""Twisted Faith"".)"
1214,,200,"""Duel Charm""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""Tool used in duels of judgement. Nulls effects of special area effects for a short time. Allfather Lloyd's knights lived in fear of his duels of judgement, in which verdicts were carried out by his Sword of Law."" You receive a bag with five inside which refills over time, one talisman per day. Cutting straight to the mechanics of the item, when you throw one of these charms it explodes into a cloud of dust on impact.  Anyone caught in the cloud will have any actively applied buffs stripped from them as part of a temporary effect. Active buffs can come in the form of empowering spells or miracles, temporary transformations and things in that vein. The effect lasts a few seconds, and those caught will find themselves unable to reapply or activate their buffs until it ends."

Of the Archdeacons of the Deep, one (Klimt) attended to Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth, whom he deemed a goddess.""

These robes, once tainted and discarded, are no longer seen as holy, yet keep their old power. Surprisingly light compared to other forms of protection in these lands, they don't offer much physical protection, but do wonders for the wearer at protecting from the immaterial, especially curses and darkness."
1216,,200,"""Witch's Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""The Witch of Izalith and her daughters, scorched by the flame of chaos, taught humans the art of pyromancy and offered them this ring. Every pyromancer is familiar with the parable that tells of the witches espousing the need to fear the flame, and teaching the art of pyromancy to men in hopes that they might learn to control it."" Has the very simple but powerful effect of noticeably empowering the strength of the wielder's Pyromancy."
1217,,200,"""Outrider Knight Armor""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"“Armor of an Irithyll outrider knight. Enveloped in a dimly cool air. The knights were given the eyes of the Pontiff, but the eyes transformed them into savage, raving warriors who only knew how to serve as mindless guards.” Though a little weighty, this armor offers excellent physical protection and is fantastic for insulating and protecting the body from the cold. It fails in insulating the body from the abyss very well, however."
1218,,200,"""Wolf Knight Armor""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""A vanquished knight left behind only wolf's blood, and legacy of duty. The Undead Legion of Farron was formed to bear his torch, and the armor of these Abyss Watchers suggests their own eventual end."" Made up mostly of warped metal compared to the Undead Legion armor, this set includes the helm of a knight tainted by the dark of the Abyss. The twilight blue tassel is damp, and will ever remain so. Offers significant protection for its weight, though focuses more on the physical side than insubstantial, unlike the above armor. Despite that, the protection it offers to flame is just as impressive."
1219,,200,"""Undead Legion Armor""",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"""These undead warriors vowed to partake of wolf blood. They acted in the dark, seeking out any sign of the Abyss, fighting a constant war with its abominations. This pointed steel helm was a distinct symbol of the Legion, shirked as a sinister omen by the masses."" This was the armor of the Abyss Walkers, made up of equal parts black dyed leather and iron. A leather vest worn over chainmail, a single gauntlet on their left arm, iron kneecaps aiding their techniques are notable pieces, outside the helmet. Offers great protection for its weight, the unique leather insulating the body from all sorts of things, from hot and cold to foul liquids and even electricity or magic. Notably vulnerable to the edge of a blade however."
1220,,200,Dragon Tooth,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“The tooth of an ancient stone dragon fashioned into the form of a great club, mostly by the addition of a handle. It is as long as most men are tall. Sturdier than actual stone, this won’t be breaking on you anytime soon, even as you smash whatever you encounter in these lands. Additionally, the ancient powers of the dragons flow through the wielder, making them more resistant to magic and flame alike.”"
1221,,200,Second Life Coffin,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“What a bizarre curiosity. It resembles a coffin, though far greater in size than those meant for man. Despite its immense size, you always seem to be able to manipulate the heavy lid, and push it around with a bit of effort. The coffin will be nearby when you look, as despite ease of pushing it’s still large and awkward. Most notably however is what happens to any living thing that sleeps inside of it once sealed. After a period of time has passed, the one sleeping inside will have swapped physical gender. Men become women, women become men. The process is reversible and can be performed infinitely.”"
1222,,200,Ore Merchant,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“You have just gained the partnership of a travelling merchant, one who has an inventory that you’re sure to find interesting. This travelling merchant sells a bizarrely large quantity of exotic stones with you getting a special discount. You always seem to be able to find them when you look hard enough, though never in the direct line of danger. While their inventory is always bizarrely large, you can still buy them out if you have the currency to back it up, whatever that may be locally. If you do, they’ll disappear for a while to restock. In future worlds they will continue to sell the various stones and ores of this world such as Titanite or Boltstone, but will also temporarily stock themselves with whatever earthen curiosities can be found in the world around them. Limited time offers! They’re practically giving this stuff away!”"
1223,,200,Specialist’s Hammer,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“Bridging the mystical and with the mundane, mystical with the tools of man, are there many acts more satisfying than that? With a solid hammer and good ember, you are capable of just such feats. You may harness the qualities of magical, supernatural or just outright strange materials to improve existing constructs not composed of such things. An iron sword could be imbued with the arcane nature of the soul to better bypass armor, or a shield with the power to halt darkness infused attacks. You are also bestowed skill with smithing, though mostly towards the area that the above powers require. That is to say, hammering and burning the powers of material described above into things.”"
1224,,200,“Drake Nest”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Assembled from the collected twigs and branches of the giant trees native to Lordran, a veritable fortress of flexible stone “straw” and twigs for drakes to nest in. The nest shares the magically durable properties of the trees it was made from, resisting magic, fire and blade alike and making it difficult to attack your sleeping form from any direction but above. This will be an arduous task, especially if the nest is placed in a high location, as climbing it is a danger in itself due to the wicked wooden spikes ticking out at all angles."
1225,,200,“Drake Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Armor smithed and fitted for an adult drake by a mad man. Made from vast quantities of titanite, it consists of a helmet and numerous plates that protect various vital spots. The Drake Armor includes a long saddle for potential passengers. The armor is also strong enough to protect drakes from most potential dragon hunters providing they don’t carve off the armor or inflict such severe damage that they die even with it still on, due to how thick the plates are."
1226,,200,“Silver Knight Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Spotless, shining, silver armor of Gwyn’s knights. When Gwyn departed to link the flame, his knights split into two groups. The silver knights are the ones who stayed in the capital in service of the remaining divinity. Heavy, exceptionally well crafted and durable against blade and lightning to enable the knights to spar with fewer concerns. This silver armor functions perfectly and was made by the gods, for the gods."
1227,,200,“Balder Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Armor worn by knights of the ancient, ruined kingdom of Balder. Although lacking in coverage compared to most other armor, the thick iron plates offer significant protection. The protection against physical threats is heavily emphasized, but the pieces offer decent protection against most things you’ll face in these lands. No defense against curses however."
1228,,200,“Indictments”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A book of never ending Indictments. These are black slips of paper with gold lettering and a blue seal that carry some of the power of Velka, goddess of sin. Using one of these you can force acknowledgement of someone’s sins or crimes that you’ve witness by tearing out an Indictment, causing it to crumble into ashes. Those afflicted in this way have a way of being chased down by evidence of their crimes and proof of their wrong doings making its way into the hands of those with the power to enforce justice."
1229,,200,“Brass Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Brass armor like that of the firekeeper who tends to their flame in Anor Londo, who is in reality a member of the Blades alongside yourself. Although magnificent to behold and on the weighty side, it is neither spectacular nor terrible in any one regard for the most part. It is however spectacularly durable, allowing you to go through long tours of combat or adventuring without needing to worry so much about maintaining it."
1230,,200,“Darkstalker Armor” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"The black, skeletal armor of the Darkwraiths. Some say the skeletal mask is partially fused with their faces, though thankfully for you this is not the case. Despite its heavy, metal nature, it does not actually offer much in the way of physical protection. Instead, it has significant supernatural warding against poisons, divine lightning, flame and especially against the soul born powers of the arcane."
1231,,200,“Xanthous Cloth Armor” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Cloth armor of the Xanthous King, no one knows its true origin. Its most pronounced features by far are likely the bright yellow color that burns the eyes and the absurdly large crown with mysterious origins. While not matching actual metal armor, the cloth armor is surprisingly protective despite its absurdity and light enough to actually see use for those who prize speed. It also bares incredible resistance to magic, giving it utility in hunting or combatting Sorcerers."
1232,,200,“Transcendent Apostle Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A unique set of armor made of stone, or perhaps something like it. Crafted and fitted for transcendent apostles who have taken their first steps to rising above. This is armor made to accommodate the draconic transformation that leaves a human in the form of a dragon hybrid. Though it is heavy, it offers great physical and magical protection, but fails drastically in the face of lightning."
1233,,200,“Eastern Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A suit of armor from the foreign land that Shiva of the East hails from. It is exquisitely crafted, and offers emphasized protection against blades, befitting given those are the most common threats from his distant home. Cutting you will be difficult in this, rest assure. "
1234,,200,“Gold-Hemmed Black Clothes” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Clothing worn by the Daughters of the Witch of Izalith. These robes were bestowed upon you by Quelaag who had little need for them after transforming into a demon, her sister keeping them out of sentimentality. Although lightweight, the robes are not true armor. That said, they offer remarkable protection from flame and caustic fluids, allowing one to navigate the dangerous depths of these lands with more ease than others."
1235,,200,“Paladin’s Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Armor of the legendary Paladin Leeroy, recovered from his corpse in an alternate world. This golden armor adorned with white cloth is of the Way of White’s paladins. As armor, it’s quite heavy, but offers significant protection against all manner of things, especially the physical weapons of man and wretched curses. In fact, the only thing it could be considered weak towards compared to other suits of armor is, ironically, lightning, the power of the gods."
1236,,200,“Seath’s Embers”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"A pair of magical embers belonging to Seath the Scaleless. The first is his white Crystal Ember, the second is a large, blue Magic Ember. The Magic Ember is used by smiths to forge magic equipment, equipment that carries the arcane nature of the soul and benefits from a wielder/wearer with vast knowledge or strong soul. The Crystal Ember can make crystal equipment. Crystal equipment is very brittle and excruciatingly difficult to repair, but weapons with these properties become extremely sharp and jagged."
1237,,200,“Channeler’s Armor Set” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"The signature armor of Seath’s Channelers, the heaviest armor employed by a Sorcerer. Their helms are adorned with six eyes, and the armor itself seems to be built in layers with various odd ornamentation. While its worth as armor is questionable given just average protection for the most part, it is imbued with magic and tends to be accommodating for helping the focus of those wearing it."
1238,,200,“Iron Armor” ,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Well-made iron armor with a bucket helm just like Solaire’s. It’s good armor, well rounded, but nothing so great so as to be notable. Like Solaire’s armor, it even has handmade decorations like the symbol of the sun and the feather in the helmet. Your decorations seem just a bit different, as if Solaire took the time to make some for you."
1239,,200,“Fireguard”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Although Firekeepers are often safe due to their services benefitting wanders and warding off mindless hollows, sometimes the especially depraved look to steal away their souls. For you, I offer this iron bar. When placed at the entrance of a room or cave, it branches and spreads out to form a cage, preventing entry from that direction and keeping you safe. The bars are extremely strong and dig deep, requiring something of incredible strength to pull them down."
1240,,200,“Dingy Clothes”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"The clothes of a maiden who became a firekeeper, caked in the ashes of a bonfire which have dyed them black. This same coating, however, provides benefits. These clothes carry a great resistance to magic, curses and lightning, but are lacking when it comes to behaving as normal armor. Due to many thin layers, they cling to the wetness of lacerations, helping to stop up the bleeding."
1241,,200,“Master Key”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"The Master Key is a key ring that will always have a key for almost any lock when checked. Only magical intervention or keys of an entirely different scale can prevent its use. A popular tool among thieves. In this accursed land of hollows and monsters though, some doors are better left closed."
1242,,200,“Elite Knight Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"“Armor of a nameless knight, perhaps an elite knight of Astora, based on the fire-warding heraldic symbol on its blue surcoat.” A construct of steel, adorned tastefully, one of the most efficient suits of armor when looking for a balance of protection and weight. Good at protecting against both magic and physical dangers. The only failing of this Elite Knight Armor is the absolute zero resistance or protection against curses, of which can prove lethal."
1243,,200,“Favor Armor”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"Golden armor representing the Goddess Fina’s love. The chest plate is designed symbolically with arms wrapped around the wearer, to show the goddess’s love. Favor armor offers moderate physical and magical protections apart from defending against blade or flame. The snug fit and high durability notably keeps the wearer’s body contained and protects against lacerating wounds, vile toxins and even curses fairly well compared to other armor though."
1244,,200,Ceremonial Tanto,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,"A dagger with a white blade and hilt. It has the name, “Devoted Soul” inscribed into it. This dagger was used to cut from one’s own life force as an offering to the dragon. You can use this to cut from the life force of others to restore your resurrective power. Though this method is painful, it is not fatal, and it will not spread the dragonrot. You can even use this to share your own life force to heal others or restore their resurrective power should they share in your Dragon’s Heritage."
1245,,200,Divine Confetti ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,"A box filled with glowing purple confetti. It refills once a day. When spreading these confetti over you or someone else, they gain a divine glow that repels apparitions for the entire day. It will even bless their strikes, allowing them to inflict massive damage against the undead. The box has enough confetti for three uses."
1246,,200,Snap Seed,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,"Fumewort seeds that, when crushed, produces a loud snapping sound that pierces mental interference. Any who hear this sound will be able to dispel any illusion they’re placed under. You will receive a pouch that replenishes at the end of the day."
1247,,200,Prayer of Nature,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,"You notice these Buddhist sculptures here and there that burn a blue fire that’s warm to touch, often times whenever you find a new place or area. When you make camp and rest by them, you find that you feel fully rested, even if you only had a 10-minute nap. Your health is fully restored, any sickness is eliminated, and your wounds have healed. Unfortunately, it can’t do anything for curses or scars. If you have some means of immortality or ability to escape death, next time you wake up, you will find yourself next to these sculptures."
1248,,200,Workshop Equipment ,Bloodborne,Making ,"“This is actually a package deal containing a variety of workshop tool The first set has some basic tools for repairing equipment, and some more specialized tools for upgrading weaponry with varying Blood Stones. 

The second set allows for the slotting and removal of Blood Gems; items that as previously mentioned can greatly empower weaponry. The last set of tools allows you to etch Caryll Runes into the mind to attain their wondrous strength, or remove them just as easily. 

Runesmith Caryll, student of Byrgenwerth, transcribed the inhuman utterings of the Great Ones into what are now called Caryll Runes. As previously mentioned, these can contain a variety of benefits, and you may etch up to three upon your mind.”"
1249,,200,Cannon,Bloodborne,Making ,"“Large prototype firearms fashioned by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. Use of this weapon is equivalent to toting a mounted cannon into battle; complete with its ridiculous weight, staggering kick, and lavish use of ammo. Such a monstrosity was doomed from the start, and indeed its development was cut short. 

Yet, against impossibly gigantic foes, it might be just the thing. You may expend Quicksilver or BloodBullets in place of cannonballs, though it requires ten bullets total to reload. Projectiles produce a powerful explosion upon impact. Comes with the blueprints so you may repair it or make more.”"
1250,,200,Victorian Wardrobe(200),Bloodborne,Making ,"“Befitting the era this place was themed upon, offered here is an extensive wardrobe that’s larger on the inside and already filled. Clothes that would allow you to blend in, show off, or aid in more dangerous endeavors can be found within. 

If you instead spend 200BE, this wardrobe will include all the various sets of armor and equipment available for use within the game of Bloodborne. Although armor plays a backseat to evasion much of the time, this will nonetheless prove to be a great boon”"
1251,,200,Eye to Behold,Bloodborne,Making ,"“The cadaver, so reminiscent of the living in all but spirit. Does flesh, regardless of life, not split under sharpened knife? Does blood not flow even if curdled? It seems so easy to imagine a time when the dead may rise if they can only think to do so. In our dreams, perhaps?

You have much greater skill with dissecting, pulling apart, studying, preserving, and stitching corpses back together. It matters little whether it’s of an otherworldly nature or not, a corpse is a corpse, even if it still writhes. Perhaps you had a past as a mortician, but they usually look well when you’re done too. 

More curious, you have a knack for ‘Making Contact’ with otherworldly minds, consciousness with no form, and guiding them to the cold bodies you’ve been tampering with. Though it may be far easier in the dreaming lands, the fact remains, you may make the dream of the living dead a reality.”"
1252,,200,Ring of Sincere Prayer,Demon's Souls,Making ,​A ring said to have been found by the young Sixth Saint Astraea. When worn the wearer’s miracles powers are said to be increased.
1253,,200,Fragrant Ring,Demon's Souls,Making ,"A nobleman's ring, forged with spices. Recovers mana slowly over time when worn."
1254,,200,Eternal Warrior Ring,Demon's Souls,Making ,​An old bronze ring that once belonged to Old King Doran. When worn it allows the wearer to recover their stamina faster.
1255,,200,Faithful Soldier’s Garb ,Elden Ring,Making ,"The divine beings and forces of this world alike know that well-equipped servants are effective ones. Two options are laid out before you here: A set of armour of good quality but relatively common wake by the standards of this world, fitted to you if necessary. Anything from armour worn by those loyal to Miquella or Radahn’s legion or...Godrick the Grafted’s soldiers if for some reason you desire to wear something like that. Or the bulky chainmail of the Fire prelates, or even the layers of mushrooms worn by those who once served the Scarlet Rot. Alternatively, you can purchase a custom suit of armour comparable to those examples-also fitted to you. For either option, the armour is guaranteed to fit you comfortably."
1256,,200,Mohgwyn’s Sacred Spear,Elden Ring,Making ,"Not a metaphor for the Lord of Blood’s marital arts. Hopefully. As well as a trident fit for a demigod’s hand, this instrument grants communion with the Formless Mother: An outer god that bestows power upon accursed blood. By piercing her unseen presence you can create explosions of blood that coat the instrument in bloodflame. The arcane insight his arts favour empower this spear’s lethality too. Perhaps in time, you may be able to achieve a similar compact with her through this weapon as Mohg himself did to bring forth the secrets of blood magic and all it entails.

But though the Formless Mother counts among the most generous of the powers that be, perhaps she is not the only one. If you wish, you may purchase a symbol of office consecrated-or perhaps, defiled-in the name of another Outer God’s service and granting similar benefits. A rotting branch that spreads the Scarlet Rot’s decay perhaps, or a shield bearing the aspect of the One-Eyed God that echoes the will and flame of the god believed slain by Queen Marika.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1257,,200,Carian Royal Sceptre ,Elden Ring,Making ,"Either a perfect replica of Rennala’s symbol of office or an equally magnificent stave, the Carian Blue glintstone mounted on it enhances full moon sorceries in particular. But make no mistake, this is the finest of all glintstone staves and its ability to empower sorceries is unrivalled in all the Lands Between. A particularly skilled sorcerer can even have it fight independently around herself-twirling and blocking and striking in rapid motion before returning to her hand, forcing foes to remain at a distance if they do not wish to experience successive attacks."
1258,,200,Sacred Seals and Staffs(200),Elden Ring,Making ,"For an extra CP (making this item count as a 200 CP slot-discounted item) instead, you may purchase a mystic implement of unique character that offers a significant advantage over more common examples-typically one touched or more deeply attuned to a divine force. It may be something like the Prince of Death’s Staff, said to be part of dead Godwyn’s body and augmenting sorceries through faith as well as intellect on top of boosting sorceries that invoke the power of death. Or the Golden Order Seal, a formless sigil depicting the ceremonial observance of order, which similarly enhances incantations with both intellect and faith as well as further enhancing those drawing on the holy power of the Erdtree.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1259,,200,Sublime Form,Elden Ring,Making ,"Why wave a wand around for each and every thing, when you can fill those things with the power of the cosmos? You’re quite talented in imbuing magic into objects, whether to enchant a crossbow with the power of the full moon or to create a key that permits entry through a specific magical barrier. Autonomous construct sentinels of great strength and mobile vehicles with a will of their own are also possible for your hands to construct. However, your greatest talent lies in the area of crystalline prosthetics. Arms, legs-and perhaps even greater portions of the human body can all be replaced with crystalline duplicates that amplify and refine control over all magic associated with the stars above.

Curiously your knowledge base also carries with it an exceptional background in making dolls. Not only are you able to expertly construct, maintain and modify doll bodies for disembodied souls in need of one to inhabit, but you also know how to brew potions that can slay the drinker-and enslave their soul to be bound into a puppet of your design. Thus bound, they can be summoned and commanded at will like any spirit save with far less volition of their own. Whatever you could intend with such an art?"
1260,,200,Crest of Legend ,Elden Ring,Making ,"What started as an earnest desire to never leave a scrawny steed behind became the magic that made Radahn renowned as the mightiest demigod in the Lands Between. The power of such iconic heraldry is shared by you. You can engrave crests representing any magical abilities you know on your weapons, armour or other artifacts to grant them a small measure of your power, just as Radahn did for his blades to grant them a gravity well he controlled-whether to fling around his foes, or augment them with layers of rock. And while the innate magical abilities given to such items are comparatively modest, this also makes them powerful implements for the whole of the magical ability itself when wielded by you."
1261,,200,Smithing Master,Elden Ring,Making ,"As long as there are warriors, there will always be a demand for those who can forge weapons and armour. You are one such skilled smith now, with a breadth and depth of experience that can match the Roundtable’s own slaved smith. Be it a common cutlass, heavy plate or some exotic weapon touched by a god’s hand, even if you haven’t come across it before given enough time and the right crafting materials you’ll be able to repair, improve on and tinker with just about anything from this world. It doesn’t matter if that giant’s sword yet blazes with fell flame or a certain glaive sparkles with the light of the moon-you have the care and metalworking knowledge to handle both safely, while ensuring your hammering only makes it better, not worse.

For an extra 100 CP, it seems you’re something of an engineer and enchanter too even if you otherwise have no particular gift for the mystic arts. For you also fully comprehend the mechanisms needed to build the gigantic lifts providing transportation across the more far-flung regions of this world, as well as the arcane defences rooted in specific key items such as those used by the Carian royal family, or the materials needed to construct guardian entities such as golems."
1262,,200,Enchanter's Touch,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Making,"You are able to temporarily enchant anything you touch with any enchantments you already
understand while you are in physical or magical contact with it. Whenever you touch a
magical object, you will instinctively understand the enchantments that allow it to function.
Through this you could turn an ordinary broom into a Firebolt while you use it or an ordinary
water basin into a pensive; with time and practice you could learn how to make these
enchantments last longer allowing you to eventually create true magical items merely by
touching their raw materials."
1263,,200,Marauder’s Map,Harry Potter,Making ,"A perfect copy of the Marauders Map. A map with a detailed, dynamic layout of Hogwarts displaying the location of everyone in the grounds as well as various secret passageways. Each jump this will change to another area (up to the size of a vast castle) of your choice."
1264,,200,Pensive,Harry Potter,Making ,"A device that allows the user to keep their memories and peruse them at their leisure. You may also use this to remove, organise and prioritise your sets of memories."
1265,,200,Magical Exposure Threat Level Measurer,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Making ,"A clock that shows how close muggles are to finding out about magic. In future jumps its hands will instead represent different secrets, either of yours or of setting based conspiracies, and it will continue to warn about how close those ignorant are to finding the truth."
1266,,200,Pendant,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Making ,A pendant with a design of your choice. No matter where it is you will always know the direction and distance of the pendant as well as who is currently in possession of it. Comes with instructions to make more.
1267,,200,Jade Bearer ,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"A set of jade armor and weapons, with this, in an ideal and “wild” place, you could fight with the might of ten merfolk warriors - more, if you were to combine it with the Primal amulet, and that increase is not insignificant even for the strong."
1268,,200,Dowsing Dagger ,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"A dagger enchanted with the ability to seek water and untouched lands, the Dagger often leads the path to a place where no person has been before, or barring that, a place that is secret to most eyes - for those who seek to make the most of the Jade of the merfolk, or simply desire a hidden place of their own, that is an invaluable asset. "
1269,,200,laborate Firecannon ,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"The finest weapon ever to rest on a Brazen Coalition boat, this cannon is rather complex - a unique set of clockworks and pulleys readies it for its next barrage. But it’s worth the time taken to wind it up, as when it fires, it deals monumental damage to any inanimate object unfortunate enough to get struck by it - something that is likely to occur considering it is enchanted to give its ammunition a “curving” effect, correcting for minor mistakes in aim. 

The damage dealt by whatever is loaded into the cannon is magnified as if the projectile was much, much stronger - even a normal cannonball could nearly rip a schooner in half, and a grapeshot round could shear a galleon’s masts and sails as if it were a machete to a vine."
1270,,200,Fountain of Ichor,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"A fountain that when placed, is extremely efficient at discovering sources of liquid fuel, or even generating the fuel from biological substances beneath the earth. This fuel acts as crude oil, being flammable, and having the necromantic essence of the corpses or biological matter used in its creation."
1271,,200,Travelling Shipwright ,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"Somehow, being lost at sea has given you a bit more an appreciation for ways to not be lost at all. You are a fair hand at the creation of tools for exploring - compasses, spyglasses, cartography...you’re even a talented shipwright. In addition, the tools to explore such as machetes and “dowsing daggers” - knives that can detect sources of water - are also easily created by your careful hand."
1272,,200,Divine Weapon ,MtG - Amonkhet,Making,"A weapon of your choosing fit to be wielded by god( or you, regardless of how strong you become) against foes of their own caliber. It is sharp and durable enough to be effective in such combat, changes sizes with you, and can use mana as ammunition, if any is required. You may import a weapon into this if you desire. This can be bought multiple times."
1273,,200,Lazotep Supply ,MtG - Amonkhet,Making,"A sarcophagus-sized chunk of pure lazotep, a blue mineral found exclusively on Amonkhet that interacts with black mana in a number ways necromancers find useful. You receive a new one every year, so don’t be afraid to use it somehow."
1274,,200,Witching Well,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making,"Created by a witch in Lochthwain, this fickle sentient well has the abilities of the “Frogify” and “Seasonal Spellcraft” perks. It is also a rather intelligent artifact, but its personality is mischievous and a bit petty...still, its water can act as the cure to any curse cast by “Frogify” and by flattering or cajoling the artifact it may use its power and knowledge to your service."
1275,,200,Spinning Wheel,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making,"A seemingly mundane wheel used for spinning yarn, this wheel has one or two enchantments that cause it to be something more than a mere spinster’s tool - for one, the thread it spins becomes golden. For another, the needle on the wheel puts whoever is pricked by it into a deep slumbering curse...for whatever purposes that would be put to, obviously. "
1276,,200,Giant’s Skewer,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making,"Dinner is often on the minds of the inhabitants of the wilds. As horrific as it sounds, this weapon is meant to solve the issue of “killing” and “cooking” your two-legged meal at the same time. A simple yet hefty spear, it has been enchanted to grill and cook whatever it lances through, heating up and ‘cooking’ whatever pieces of the unfortunate prey it’s used on as they’re being lanced through!"
1277,,200,Seven Dwarves,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making,"Dwarves are renowned for their sense of industry and the care with which all craft they perform is taken - the act of crafting is the highest act in dwarven society, so they are focused around the control of natural mineral resources and the dignity of work. "
1278,,200,Lighthook,MtG - Zendikar,Making,"Modified Kor hooks that use the power of the two small hedrons attached to them in place of rope or chains to produce a rope of light, able to extend and contract at will. Able to actively channel the mana of the user, both to extend and control the rope as well as enhance their striking power, with mere rope you were limited by physicality but with light you're limited only by your will."
1279,,200,Expedition Map,MtG - Zendikar,Making,"There is little point searching out knowledge that will not at the very least further your own pursuits, which makes simply searching aimlessly unappealing. While the Roil might make the minutia of maps rather unreliable, large-enough areas should retain at least some resemblance so long as you work quickly. This expertly-cartographed map details the location of unexplored ruins in relation to the larger landmarks surrounding them. While it may not be astounding, you are sure you could find something of value to your pursuits within. At the beginning of jumps after this, the map will change to show one set of ruins from past civilizations which is relatively intact. What histories you could find, or what relics you could sell? "
1280,,200,Artificer ,MtG - Homelands,Making,"One of the First Master’s main teachings was the creation of artifacts, and especially the construction of a variety of enchanted clockwork creatures. Today a large number of different types of clockwork laborers are found in the Aysen culture, all courtesy of the Wizard’s Isle, and the school itself uses even more of them as menial servants.

You’ve been taught much of these secrets, knowing how to let the mana guide your tools to achieve works of craftsmanship impossible without magic. For now, you’re skilled enough to create clockwork gnomes as a matter of course and with some more effort recreate much of the existing artifacts the wizards have created like clockwork steeds, insect swarms, and even the flying buzzsaw that is the roterothopter. Perusing the designs still held in the libraries of the Wizards' School would of course make that much easier to do."
1281,,200,Builder’s Hands,MtG - Shandalar,Making,"Finely wrought metal filigree, carefully carved stone facades, clockwork machinery of a complexity that defies common understanding... to be an Artificer is to master each of these, and before one can build magical artifacts one must first know how to build. You are a gifted craftsman, engineer and designer, capable of developing new schematics for items as small as jewelry or as big as a Colossus Of Sardia. This skill is as applicable to spellwork and design as it is to ‘real’ objects, and you’ll find it’s likewise easier to combine artifice with other forms of magic."
1282,,200,SIMIC CHARM ,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Simic symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-Grant an ally a significant boost in strength for a short amount of time.
-Prevent any allies from being the target of direct targeting spells for a short amount of time.
-Briefly cause an enemy to falter, stopping any action they were taking.

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1283,,200,SELESNYA CHARM ,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Selesnya symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-Grant an ally a boost in strength and the ability to overwhelm an opponent’s defences for a short amount of time.
-Remove a significantly more powerful individual from a fight entirely for the duration of that fight.
-Summon a regular Selesnya knight to fight by your side for the duration of a battle.

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1284,,200,BOROS CHARM,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Boros symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-Cast a spell which deals a reasonable amount of damage to the leader of your opponents directly.
-Make all of your allies briefly impervious to damage for a short amount of time.
-Fill one of your allies with the strength to attack with twice their normal speed for a short amount of time.

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1285,,200,GRUUL CHARM,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Gruul symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-Cast a curse lowering the defences of all grounded opponents.
-Break all forms of mind control which may be enchanting your allies. 
-Cast a spell which deals a harsh amount of damage to all airborne opponents.

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1286,,200,GOLGARI CHARM ,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Golgari symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-Decrease the strength and durability of everyone opposing you by a small amount.
-Cast a spell which destroys any enchantment or spell someone has placed upon an item or area.
-Prevent fatal damage to an ally, at the cost of removing them from the combat situation they were in entirely, as well as exhausting them.

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1287,,200,RAKDOS CHARM ,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Rakdos symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-Cast a curse on all corpses in the nearby vicinity, making necromancy and any death based magic significantly harder to use.
-Cast a spell which blows any artificial items to smithereens.
-Force an opponent to take damage proportional to the number of allies they have.

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1288,,200,IZZET CHARM ,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Izzet symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-Counter any non-creature-summoning spell an opponent is casting. This can be overcome if the opponent is willing to exert even more force and resources to get past this counter.
-Electrically shock any opponent in the nearby vicinity for a small amount of damage.
-Your thinking and processing speed become significantly faster for a short amount of time, at the cost of some ideas being lost. 

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1289,,200,DIMIR CHARM,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Dimir symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-Negate a spell which an opponent has obviously been preparing to cast
-You may cast a spell which can destroy a regular creature with equal to or below average strength.
-Read the forefront thoughts of an opponent’s mind, and make them briefly forget up to two ideas they may have, disrupting their chain of thought. 

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1290,,200,ORZHOV CHARM,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Orzhov symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-An ally within sight will be warped safely to your side, along with any equipment they have on them.
-You can cast a killing spell at the cost of taking damage proportional to the victim’s strength.
-You may resurrect a low-level subordinate who has just died. 

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1291,,200,AZORIUS CHARM,MtG - Ravnica,Making,"A glowing Azorius symbol which can be forged into a weapon or item of your choice. When pressed, it will activate, and you will be able to choose one of three options:
-All damage dealt by you and your allies will restore your health by a proportionate amount for a short amount of time.
-Your thinking and processing speed becomes quicker for a short amount of time.
-You may slow the actions of an enemy for a short amount of time. 

After the charm has been activated, it takes an hour to recharge before it can be activated again."
1292,,200,Darksteel Ingot,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"An absolutely indestructible (through magical and physical means, though perhaps not by some more obscure and contrived methods) ingot of metal characteristic to the plane of New Phyrexia- though the Phyrexians themselves have yet to fully realize the means to smith it like the Mirrans had- less with the tools shaping the metal, more with high intensity magic shaping the reality around it- making the darksteel ingot into its final result without it being damaged. This a strenuous, time consuming process requiring a lot of mana, but the value of indestructible artifacts cant be denied. This decently sized ingot is good enough for a sword’s blade, or maybe a small shield- and with the purchase comes the knowledge of how to forge with this metal. Purchasable multiple times, and restocks weekly, the number of purchases increasing how much you have avaliable each week."
1293,,200,Surgeon,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"Incisions, amputations, dissections, grafts, brain excisions, xenotransplantation, phyretic implants... You have a steady hand, and a talent for putting together the abominations of flesh and steel your kind is known for. You know how to perform anaesthesia-less surgery without the patient going into shock, and can keep them alive through all of it, or at least quasi-alive, and your “patients” seem to be able to survive the long term effects of the surgery, as long as they survived the surgery itself."
1294,,200,Eater of Virtue,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making,"This is, strictly speaking, not something any reputable Samurai would wish to have, but none can deny its usefulness. The blade is cursed, in a manner that is infuriatingly helpful. Anyone who wields the blade in battle for a day and a night becomes attuned to it, and may begin to draw upon the skills and talents of past wielders. They also suffer from a rather horrible bout of bad luck, such that they will be driven to an early grave. From overconfidence, for example. The blade then feasts upon a fragment of their soul, at which point that particular wielder’s power may be drawn upon. A vicious cycle of empowerment and glory, only for the reaper to come calling. You’d likely be able to make a pretty penny from the Empire ensuring that it remained sealed away and unused… Or an even larger sum of coin wielding it into battle. It’s your choice, really. "
1295,,200,Crafting With Colors,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making,"The mountains of Sokenzan and the clouds of Otawara hide entire cities of builders, men and women of all types who seek to create. With this, you may select something of a speciality depending upon your faction - the artists and blacksmiths that supply the Asari specialize in the bottom line, making their works from scraps and leftovers, utilizing every last metal shaving so that nothing is wasted. The Saiba are constantly pushing, constantly experimenting, always trying to upgrade stable tech into powerful but usually unsafe alternatives. The Order of Jukai, when they use any technology at all, often use fragments of ancient trees such as Boseiju as their material. Meanwhile the Empire is far more concerned with their creationes being steady and reliable, so easy to maintain that a three year old could be expected to run maintenance on them. And the Reckoners will rip anything apart and jury rig it into something else. You have some wiggle room here if you don’t wish for the exact boons described, but it must be fitting for your faction. "
1296,,200,Old Blades And New Blade ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making,"Deep in the Sokenzan mountains lies the primary base of the Uprising, a city of artisans, blacksmiths, and other metalworkers built on top and into a dormant volcano - they use the heat of the lava to light their forges, amusingly enough. You are a native of this city, or perhaps just someone who has lived there for a time, and as such you are now a competent blacksmith, able to forge a simple katana with relative ease. A masterwork blade would likely be beyond you, but you also have an all but magical ability to recycle your failures - if a blade does not meet your expectations, you can melt it down and reforge it with barely any loss of material or efficiency. This goes doubly so for ordinary scraps and leftovers - the ability to make use of every last drop of resource is something most here in Sokenzanshi take pride in. And now, so can you."
1297,,200,A Stain Upon Soul And Skin ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making,"A very real part of being a Reckoner is to be bound to your oaths through the use of an ancient form of magic that revolves around contracts and is focused through ink - or more accurately, tattoos. Ones that you now know how to make yourself. It is these tattoos, ones that force you to accept your punishment for breaking the rules, or simply prevent you from doing that in the first place, that allow the many factions and street gangs that operate under the Reckoners banner to do so with any semblance of order and without any sudden but inevitable betrayals. Coincidentally, you also have the inklings on how to subvert those same bindings, partially through some rather tricky mental gymnastics and partially through sheer understanding of how they work - that’s not to say you could remove them as you are right now, but perhaps with some study and experimenting. "
1298,,200,A Long Forgotten Gohei ,MtG - Kamigawa,Making,"A simple wooden wand of white oak with a pair of zig-zagging streamers of milky white paper. Used in all manner of rituals that cleanse, this Gohei has the special ability to reduce the use of magical energies expended in a spell by a significant amount. In addition, this reinforces beings of spirit in the material realm, allowing them to hit harder and take harder hits."
1299,,200,Armor of the Lost,MtG - Kamigawa,Making,"Armor that shimmers with an aura of ill intent. Power, dark and murky flows off this armor but it seemingly does nothing except being fairly unsettling. If a person dies, or a corpse is dressed, in the armor they are immediately stripped of all but bones and armor and a new suit appears in your warehouse for your use. Skeleton soldiers made this way are undead. With this armor comes a scroll that teaches how to perform the curses needed to produce this kind of effect on other armors."
1300,,200,Calligraphy Kit of Exotic Means ,MtG - Kamigawa,Making,This kit is filled with a series of materials for those who practice calligraphy but in addition to the normal ink- stones and brushes there are a series of bottles that can be filled with special liquids. Once filled with a liquid the bottle will constantly refill with that liquid over the course of an hour. There always seems to be more bottles but it never crowds the kit... somehow.
1301,,200,Mantle of the Wanderer ,MtG - Lorwyn,Making,"While most ash treefolk tend to stay in one place for long periods, Flann the Wanderer was one who wandered the world for her entire life, almost never returning to the grove of her birth. Flann was a wielder of powerful magics, and many sought her for advice. Though a recent forest fire claimed her life, she still managed to pass her mantle of Wanderer onto you. Or perhaps the young ash who would’ve found her otherwise passed the mantle on again, knowing she lacked the wisdom of her predecessor.

Whatever the case, you now find yourself with a weathered bag of magical tools, the title of the Wanderer, and very little additional knowledge. Nevertheless, you’ll find that pilgrims will come to find you, each looking for answers and advice from the Wanderer, knowing the reputation for worldly wisdom that follows the name. Should you decide you are not able to provide the wisdom these pilgrims need, or if you get tired of giving cryptic advice to deflect their questions, you could also pass the mantle on once more for the duration of your stay in a particular world. Gifting the bag of magical tools to someone, with a ceremonial passing on of the title, they would then be known as the new Wanderer and attract their own pilgrims."
1302,,200,Thousand-Year Elixir,MtG - Lorwyn,Making,"A massive jug, of roughly decorated clay filled with a particularly powerful tonic. One sip from this could give an elf the paradoxical energy to actually tilt the jug. Or more usefully, the strength to uproot a tree and other such feats of might. For a giant, it would be quite a bit easier to pick up and take a drink from the jug, but it also acts more like a pick-me-up that revitalizes and energizes them than something that would give them the strength to knock down mountains. Though considering a giant at full strength could wander for weeks without interruption, providing that level of energy with a single sip is still quite something. 
  
While normally this elixir would take a thousand years to brew, this particular jug never seems to run out, always being full for another sip when you need one. Just do remember to also eat and sleep every so often? Running only on this tonic for months on end isn’t all that healthy, though in a pinch it’ll certainly keep you going."
1303,,200,Moonglove,MtG - Lorwyn,Making,"A frighteningly poisonous plant, the source of a poison highly prized and extensively used by the elves. Its poison is deadly even in small amounts, taking down even towering giants. In precisely controlled, highly diluted trace amounts, its necrotizing properties can be used to etch or carve living tissue, such as skin or bark. And though Elves are the only known species on Lorwyn to be largely immune to its effects, raw and undiluted moonglove can still burn even their skin just with its acidity.

Every elf, even Perfects, carried a small supply of the plant's extract somewhere on their persons for emergencies and etching way markers. Your own supply never seems to run out and should you require more for some reason, it would be almost trivial for you to find the distinctive blue-white bells in unoccupied stretches of forest."
1304,,200,Master Crafted Weapon ,MtG - Innistrad,Making,"A blade of the very best steel, carved ornately to your liking. This can be any weapon that could be commonly found in medieval Europe. It will never break if it is a blade and will never dull, though it has no supernatural properties beyond this."
1305,,200,Master Crafted Armour,MtG - Innistrad,Making,"Vampires only settle for the finest of equipment, in their own unique semi-gothic, semi covered in unnecessary spikes style. You have a fully crafted set of armour, that looks horrifically impractical and has far too many spikes, but is easy to move in and able to take a blow from an angel with only minor denting."
1306,,200,Moonsilver Arrows ,MtG - Innistrad,Making,"20 arrows tipped with moonsilver, for when you want to bring the hunt to the werewolves. Along with a quiver that refills every full moon."
1307,,200,Blade of Moonsilver,MtG - Innistrad,Making,"A blessed moonsilver weapon, commonly a sword, used by cathars as a tool in fighting the many horrors of their home."
1308,,200,Silver Dagger ,MtG - Innistrad,Making,"A small silver dagger common in Innistrad, most people have one to defend themselves."
1309,,200,A Stash of Unique Minerals,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Making,"The resources of the multiverse are many. But for all those resources some are more valuable than others. On top of that some are even exclusive to certain planes! You receive a large amount of the following minerals, in hopes you can put them to good use. With this stash you receive one kilogram of Darksteel Metal, five rods of Etherium or five kilograms, ten kilograms of Thrawn metal, twenty kilograms of Mizzium, and enough Lazotep to preserve the skills and achievements of fifty men. You shall receive a new stash every three months. Inside are instructional techniques on how to use the included minerals but not how to produce them. That will be for you to figure out."
1310,,200,Tears of Edgli ,Warbreaker,Making,"Flowers that make the most amazing dyes, each worth a fortune. More to the point for you, it provides a vast source of color that will last a long time and serve you when all other colors are absent. Can be summoned to your hand."
1311,,200,Echo Stone ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making,"An echo stone is an object that allows the user to imprint their personality into it,creating a copy of the individual with all their memories. Once an individual is copied onto the stone, another cannot be imprinted on to it. Normally, imprinting takes 3 nights of sleeping next to the stone for the process to occur. However, yours comes with a copy of your mind already installed, so if you ever want to pick your own brain, or just lend it to someone else so they can consult you, there you are. Also comes with a cradle to recharge the stone’s magic."
1312,,200,Herbalist ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Making,"Aside from their magnificent architecture and notably less conservative attire than other nations, the people of Heliohapt are best known for their outstanding skill at producing remedies and medicines, perhaps owing to their proximity to the strange flora of the Dark Continent. Even if you’re not from this land, though, it seems like you’ve inherited a great deal of their pharmaceutical knowledge. You’re an expert botanist, able to identify most plants with a glance and, more importantly, know their pharmacological properties when crafted into a remedy. Though you may stillneed to study some of the more alien and unusual flora out there, you’re still capable of creating a wide variety of medicines capable of a good many effects, from keeping eyes healthy to relieving fatigue, making you an invaluable healer no matter where you are."
1313,,200,"Arrivederci, Apocalypse",Magi: Alma Torran,Making,"If events play out as they do in canon, this world does not have long left. Enraged by King Solomon’s actions, Al-Thamen will attempt to summon Ill Ilah to Alma Torran to unmake the world. Both they and their god will be sealed away, but not before all life on the world’s surface is eradicated, forcing all survivors to flee to underground cities. Instead of giving up and waiting for death, however, those who remained persevered and, under the leadership of the Ugo, the last Magi, they eventually found a way to evacuate to another world.

Even if you can’t avert Armageddon, you’ve gained a substantial talent for not only surviving in it, but creating functional societies and settlements without any of the usual problems one would associate with a post-apocalypse. Be it putting together a magic tool capable of producing endless streams of water, technological marvels able to produce oxygen from rock, or simply putting together functional rationing systems, you’ll be able to come up with ways to overcome all of the most pressing shortages you’ll be faced with. You need not worry about internal strife, too, for in dire situations, people will naturally flock to your leadership, heeding your words and instructions. Perhaps one day, you’ll even be able to revitalise a dead world or find a way to somewhere life still flourishes."
1314,,200,Bootstrap Paradox ,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Making,"Before we begin, I’ll preface with the encouragement that you import something into this item. Moving on, whatever this is - by default the above sword, or a red cloak/coat thingee - seems to be completely indestructible. Even the Arch Enemy Event Weapons, one of which boasts the power to cut anything, can’t so much as nick these. You see, they’re caught in a bootstrap paradox. They belonged to the Bloodedge, were given to Jubei of the six heroes, who eventually passed them onto a student of his. Who eventually took the name Bloodedge, only to travel back in time and lose his memory. At no point in that story is the weapon forged. It simply exists without a beginning and without an end. Normally this would also prevent you from upgrading it, but that’s not something you’ll have to worry about. Also, while this is technically two items, you only receive one - to balance this, you can buy it multiple times."
1315,,200,Dragon Corpse,Campione,Making,"Also called Angel Remnants and such, Dragon Bones are what's left of Heretic Gods after they are slain. They are greatly sought after and can be used as a power boost or ingredient for advanced alchemy reagents. This is an assortment of such things, gathered during a large period of time. You can keep them and use them or just sell them for a neat profit."
1316,,200,Magical Weapon,Campione,Making,"All Knights are given their own weapons after they reach a certain level, sometimes they are forged and other times these are simply passed down from another knight. While these are usually swords, it's far from the norm and it means little when any adept knight can use magic to change the shape of their weapons. All magic weapons possess a certain amount of magic and one power granted from its enchantments and materials, these effects range from being able to self-repair, lift curses, negate magic, induce sleep or counter spells."
1317,,200,A Mirror Self,Campione,Making,"Sure, you aren’t a fighter here, but that doesn’t mean that you aren’t prepared and armed in case you ever need force to solve your problems. This little gift is a weapon tailored to your fighting style, with the bonus of amplifying a little your magic or authorities when you use it. With time and use, it will grow a little and adapt even better to you, increasing the bonus and becoming more comfortable in your hands."
1318,,200,Install Group,Fate/Extella,Making,"A collection of Install Skills to get you started. These are subroutines able to be planted into a Servant’s data, taking the form of individual Servant Skills that can be added to any being. Suddenly gaining Riding or Magic Resistance if the right Install Skill can be found. You’ve got a range of options here, mostly in the D and C rank range, numbering about twenty in total. There’s also a special gem of a pair of B and A Rank Personal Skills. These generally cover the class skills of the core seven Servant Classes, as well as a handful of more common Personal Skills. While normally, a Servant or being could only contain a very limited amount of Install Skills at once, these work differently. Instead of a start of two and a maximum of six after lengthy training and growth, six install skills from this group can be equipped regardless of the number of slots available or how many are already taken. These Install Skills are Tier Two via the Supplement."
1319,,200,Item Folders,Fate/Extra CCC,Making,"What is a dungeon without loot? A disappointment, that’s what. To avoid such a situation, as a responsible GM you have obtained a few Item Folders, and know how to make more. Taking the form of floating cubes of digital hard light, lit by a strange steady glow from within, you can store any one item in these Item Folders, and leave them floating somewhere for someone to retrieve the loot within. You can also leave them somewhere with nothing at all inside them, if you’re feeling mean. Additionally, you know a few methods to lock the Item Folder behind some restriction, such as needing to obtain a key or fill some kind of condition, as long as it’s not impossible to open. Perhaps you could place these out of the way to hide things you don’t want found."
1320,,200,Mystic Collection,Fate/Extra CCC,Making,"Magecraft may have died, but Mystic Codes have not disappeared, merely changed into what they are now. Utilizing Code Cast programs designed into them instead of enchantments (as little difference as that makes), this large set of Mystic Codes you now own may be quite useful in any battle. From healing, stunning, buffs and debuffs, and maybe even simple damage, there’s quite the variety of useful effects in this roster. It is worth noting that the Mystic Codes can come in two forms: imitating an outfit you already own, or taking the form of some other kind of attire that you want. As long as you wear it and it doesn’t provide any benefits beyond normal clothing and the effect they provide, anything goes."
1321,,200,Dual Blades,Fate/Extra CCC,Making,"Most swords are forged with intent. Whether for violence, glory, or even just for competition, blacksmiths generally have some purpose in mind when crafting swords. That was not the case with these, however. Made on an imperial decree by a depressed blacksmith whose wife sacrificed herself to provide the best possible materials for the forge, the dual swords Kanshou and Bakuya have no purpose forged into their edge. Kanshou is black and possesses red hexagonal patterns on its blade, while Bakuya is white and is so polished that it almost seems like a solid cloud rather than shining metal. They are sturdy and sharp, and are incredibly effective against the monstrous and eldritch. Unfortunately, there are no such things in the Moon Cell, so their advantage against that which stands outside of human comprehension won’t really matter in this world, unless you leave the Moon Cell entirely. Still, they are reliable weapons in skilled hands. Perhaps you could surprise a certain nameless man."
1322,,200,Imperial Blade,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"A twin option, for there are two choices to make here. Two legendary blades of the Roman
Emperors are available for purchase here. The first is that of Aestus Estus- The Original Flame. A
powerful magical blade forged from a meteor’s metal, the blade is both nigh unbreakable, unnaturally sharp and able to alight with the flames of the heart of a volcano, melting most of that
the metal touches and badly scorching anything that comes near or even further given that the
sword can unleash great lashes of flame at your command. The other choice is Crocea Mors, fabled
weapon of Caesar himself. It bestows great luck upon the wielder in battle, both against personal
foes and on a wider strategic scale, as well as often enabling the wielder to instantly attack again
after they make an attack, sometimes even multiple in a row. As far as anyone can figure, it’s a roll
of the dice as to if and how many times it happens for each time you hit a foe. You may import
existing swords into either option. "
1323,,200,Sword or Shield,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"Offense and defense remain ever as important as each other. The common shield bearing spearman
may not be impressive to look at but he remains highly effective, only moreso when he’s a budding
demigod with this sort of magical weaponry. The two options here are bought separately, both at a
discount for this origin. You may import a spear/sword or shield respectively into the options. 

The first is a spear, Durindana. A golden throwing spear that is said to be able to pierce anything. While it’s not quite that impressive, even a Demigod like Heracles could see it cutting through his
nigh-impenetrable skin. Short of extremely potent magic specifically focused on defense, like the
shield to come next, it’s impossible to defend against the weapon. Certainly, anything mundane will
be pierced and cleaved without issue. The spear itself is also able to shorten it’s long staff and
become a simple long or short sword. It’s not looking like much but it’s surprising what being able to
instantly extend the reach of your weapon to that of a long spear can do for you.
 
Rho Aias, a seven layered shield of impenetrable might. The shield itself is as capable as any magical
shield could be asked to be, not invincible but close enough and a handy weapon at the same time.
It’s true power is when a small amount of magical energy is poured into the shield, which will caused
seven enormous bounded fields to be created, appearing like petals of light layered over each other. These petals are an absolute defense against any thrown weapon, negating the attack without
question. Even against attacks that are not thrown, the layers each themselves are as tough as a
mighty fortress and significantly reduce the power of an attack as it breaks through each layer. While
energy must be constantly put into the shield, though the cost is low, to maintain the petals, they
can be summoned at any place and in any orientation that you can see from your current position in
a moment. Not only can you protect yourself from surprise attacks while wearing the shield, you can
potentially extend the petals to cover entire castles in their embrace. "
1324,,200,Apples of Immortality,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"Unlike in similar cases, the divine spirits of this land lack ageless immortality. The Greek Gods must
sustain their lives on the Apples of Immortality, things of such golden beauty that any human that
sees one in front of them is irresistably compelled to pick them up, unless they can resist the magical
temptation. The apples themselves add centuries of life onto the lifespan of anyone that eats one, along with healing all but the most cursed of wounds and bringing the eater to a much healthier
condition overall. Even one bite from an apple is enough, though it loses much of it’s power after
that first bite, and the apples themselves are likely to be the freshest and tastiest you’ll ever find. You’ve got a woven bag containing twenty apples, which refills at the end of each month. "
1325,,200,Witch’s Robes,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"An expanded wardrobe, placed in a home of your choosing, which contains all sorts of outfits perfect
for a young magic user. These cloaks and undergarments are quite heavily enchanted, certainly
superior to the full metal plate men will tote around much later, and have a range of magical abilities
for the one that wears them. It allows for fairly fast flight at your will, is covered in a half-dozen
decent bounded fields that alert you of and ward away danger and damage, can be used as a
somewhat effective weapon and have spells channeled directly through it, which also lets it be much
easier than normal to enchant and improve further with magic. The cloak is also able to store your
spirit should your body be destroyed, letting you live on in the outfit until you can possess physical
form again. Wearing more than one of these outfits won’t do much but you do have over twenty
alternates, from the classic mysterious magus look to something a little more magical girly. You can
import an existing outfit into this. "
1326,,200,Beast’s Fang,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"Some monsters, notably those in humanoid forms, enhance their capabilities in a similar way to
humans- they make use of tools. This weapon is a tool most suited to you, as it is based on an animal
closely associated with you, and magically enhances you in relation to feats connected to that animal. A snake association may result in a similar spiked chain as Medusa owns and significantly enhance
the flexibility, acrobatics and striking speed you have while fighting with the weapon. The weapon
itself is a fairly powerful magical weapon and will have high quality attributes, perhaps even a
moderate magical power of it’s own connected to that chosen animal, such as poison. Whatever the
case, the weapon acts as an extension of your body and you will be naturally masterful at it’s use, even should you have no formal training in it. You can import an existing suitable weapon into this. "
1327,,200,Kibisis,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"A sack? That doesn’t look like much of a heroic treasure. Maybe that’s the trick though. Kibisis is the
legendary sack of Perseus, the one he used to defeat the Gorgon and which now holds it’s severed
head. Not only can the sack you hold be opened to reveal the petrifying gaze of the Medusa, though
it is significantly weaker than when it was alive, it can also be used as a surprisingly capable defence.
It can reflect effects and attacks back at the original sender, by enlargening and swallowing the
target to be protected and inverting a powerful bounded field back at the attacker. It can even work
on you. Somehow, you’ll never accidentally freeze something with the gorgon head in the bag, even
if you hop in it yourself, and the bag can store large amounts of items if need be, without weighing
more than a normal sack. Sufficiently powerful effects might be able to break the bounded field but
short of the Divine Spirits, it’s unlikely to happen."
1328,,200,Grudge Forged,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making ,"Ibaraki-douji created her favoured bone sword by tearing out the bones of many Oni and setting
them into a forge of her own terrible flames for hundreds of days. A way of sword smithing only a
demon could manage, a brutal and unrefined method that results in a brutal and unrefined sword. But that sword is powerful, near unbreakable and holds the furious grudges of the Oni sacrificed to
make it, giving the weapon a deadly cursed aura. This sort of feat is much more applicable to your
skills now, as you find it far easier to turn your own innate abilities to the work of crafting things. A
dragon’s fire improves the quality of things forged in it, rather than just destroying the entire
workshop. Cooling a forged sword in your own Youkai poison will still cool it as if with water but also your creations without compromising them. Better still, you’re very good at focusing what you
create to not harm yourself. Using the bones of hundreds of hate-filled demons to create a cursed
sword would direct those curses at your enemies, not at the original wielder of the sword. No need
to worry about life draining demon blades if you’re at the source of them all. "
1329,,200,Onmyo Supplies,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making,"A woven pack containing a large number of normally expensive supplies needed for proper
Onmyouji craft. A seemingly unlimited amount of high quality paper, ink and scribing tools are within
as a start, the basics needed for most spells in this field. Beyond these, are a large number of pre- made charms and shikigami that can be released from the pack on command. These can serve as
emergency wards, alarms and shields when in a bind. Moderately powerful on their own, they can
hold off a demon or band of men for a few minutes while you escape. The shikigami, numbering a
few dozen in small paper forms, are able to act as capable spies and messengers over long ranges. When combined into one, they turn into a large animal such as a tiger or wyvern, a powerful
combatant that can defend you against even a decently powerful hero for a few minutes before
crumbling. The charms and shikigami replenish a week after being used. "
1330,,200,Providential Gourd,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making ,"From Shuten Douji’s own private collection, graciously donated by demon hunters seeking to cut off
her head. This small gourd of sake contains an unlimited amount of the drink, normally so potent
that even Shuten becomes tipsy and amorous from a few sips. To any humans, it’d be outright
poisonous to take a sip. With a surge of magical energy into the gourd, the drink turns into a terrible
poison that lays Oni low in moments and can even shape the sake into a sharp sword extending from
the mouth of the gourd. Touching the sake sword inflicts a strong poisonous effect as well as instant
drunkenness, making short work of most enemies. Alternatively, someone ‘slain’ by the sake sword
can be imprisoned inside the gourd instead of killed, kept in an eternal drunken stupour while
present. Apparently, it gives the sake extra flavour too. "
1331,,200,Jumpers’ Gae,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making,"The ever present weapon of choice in these lands. The spear stands out as the perfect choice, with
similarly perfect balance between offense, defense and evasion. No wonder all the great heroes
make use of one or more. Now you get the chance to buy your own magical spear as well. Each
purchase of this option allows you to design for yourself a spear of great magical potency. Examples
of the spears you can create would be things such as the legendary Gae Bolg, a cursed spear which
reverses cause and effect to strike it’s target through the heart regardless of their actions or abilities, or the Gae Dearg, a spear that severs all magical energy it touches, even breaking contracts and
mighty artefacts below a certain level. You can’t have a spear that goes beyond the relative power of
these but if you buy one, you can buy extra copies of the spear you have had created for you at
100CP, half the normal price. You can also spend the full price again to create an entirely new
second spear instead of an extra copy.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1332,,200,Surge of a Warrior,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making,"The legendary drink of the Red Branch knights, squirreled away in a barrel for some secret and
against the rules late night partying, as the rowdy knights do. You’ve got one of these barrels of
brilliant red liquid, one that never seems to run out either. Beyond being a drink of exceptional good
taste, and exceptional ability to get all but the hardiest warriors roaring drunk, the Surge also
restores the stamina of anyone who takes so much as a sip to full, even if they’ve been fighting for
days, and can actually heal the physical wounds of those who start to gulp it down. Those who
haven’t trained their bodies, such as ordinary people, can cause serious damage to their bodies
which cannot handle the revitalising process of the drink but any proper knight could down a mug
with ease. "
1333,,200,Rune Suit,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making ,"There’s no reason to not show off as you fight, is there? Your enemies can appreciate a glance or
two at you as you carve your way through them, especially with this suit stretched so tightly over
your body. This bodysuit, made of a tough but terribly comfortable material, and with a few pieces
of thicker armour on it to your liking, may not seem like great armour at first. Certainly, it’ll inflame
the passions of those that look at you but it is only the strange, softly glowing markings that can be
seen when looking closely at the bodysuit that ones finds the real power. This suit is engraved with
countless runes, turning it from a piece of seeming fetish wear into a veritable walking fortress. A
chariot smashing into you would not even be felt whilst even lower end magical spears will shatter
on contact with you. Magical spells from those less than an expert will harmlessly wash over your
body and even the threats of nature itself are largely calmed and left to not affect you, allowing you
to walk through heavy storms without wavering or getting wet. Self-cleaning, self repairing and
strangely, even able to shapeshift itself to fit any particular kind of clothing you’d like without losing
effectiveness. A beach-wear bikini that still protects all the skin that appears to be exposed perhaps. "
1334,,200,Doctor Jekyll’s Potion Lessons,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"Playing with potions isn’t just the purview of the magi. With enough study, even a supposedly
ordinary man of intellect can begin to experiment with alchemical creations. Your experience with
pharmaceutical substances and alchemy is quite extensive, enough to easily produce most medical
substances found in the latter days of the British Empire. Making a profit from drug creation is really
too simple. Your alchemy was more the focus, allowing for the creation of a variety of impressive but
ultimately low level effects, notable more for how easily and cheaply you create them. Draughts that
heal the physical form at visible speed or cleanse even the hardiest sickness away, poisons that rot
the mind or violate the spirit over years, even narcotics that can influence the flow of magical energy
within the subject.

Your experiments, should you leave them unattended and not take simple action to avoid this, also
have a much higher chance of accidents. Not necessarily something to fear, as these accidents
produce much greater results than you’d normally expect or be able to achieve. The Hyde Elixir
created by Doctor Jekyll is one such example. The accidents have potent effects but often come with
some degree of drawback based on how far beyond your talents or materials the effects are. A
supernatural potion of great power could turn the drinker into a raving lunatic at times, while
something slightly beyond your means may merely have a foul taste and cause stomach illness for a
few hours on drinking. These accidental creations can be reproduced with effort by studying the end
results over time and, if desired, are not limited to just your alchemical creations. "
1335,,200,Detective’s Blessings,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making,"Unfair, is it, to make use of magic in solving mundane crimes? Just because you call it a game, that
doesn’t mean you need to follow any rules. A great detective makes use of any tools at his disposal
and if they happened to be useful mystic codes as well, all the better. You’ve got a small armory of
useful tools available to you, each taking the form of a variety of items associated with detectives. A
number of magnifying glasses for instance, which can both reveal hidden objects and channel
burning lasers of light when focused on enemies. Fingerprint dusting kits that can allow
psychometric visions of a few seconds around when the prints were left. A smoking pipe that forcibly
focuses the mind or even walking cane with a few defensive spells prepared. Nothing particularly
potent but even broken or used up, the tools soon return to your stores."
1336,,200,Seafarer’s Guns,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"Either the work of a hired witch of some sort or just stolen from someone that wasn’t nearly as good
at piracy as these weapons implied, you’ve got yourself a magical arsenal. A pair of flintlock pistols, firing bullets formed from very small amounts of magical energy, yet hitting with the force of a large
rifle each time. They can be fired at great speed, several times as second, so long as you pay the
energy and charging the shots to greater strength is entirely feasible. The pair of cutlasses you have
strapped to your side work much the same way, made of enchanted steel with cutting power that
grows as you invest more energy into them, potentially even creating slashes of energy at range. The
final part of this set is a massive musket, able to magnify magical energy used for it to several times the strength of the pistols, while maintaining that force without bleed off even at long range. Blow
away the entire upper body of a rival captain as soon as you see his ship on the horizon, as the
musket is fitted with magical sights to aid long ranged attack."
1337,,200,Conceptual Fertilization,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Making,"The secret art of Conceptual Fertilization is one that may seem a bit strange and even unnatural to
those not as invested as you in the mystic arts but…well, they don’t complain so much when you
show them the results. Conceptual Fertilization refers to a very rare magical ability that allows one
to combine two things during the creation process of one of those things, transferring the qualities
of the second thing onto the first. Combining the blood of a dragon with a infant in the womb to
grant them the magical power of that dragon as they grow up, for instance. With time and further
mastery, it may even be possible to combine more than one thing in this way, though one cannot
begin to think of the sacrifices the failed attempts might cause. Additionally, you find that you are
also able to perform this process on other things in their creation process, not just living beings, allowing you to infuse weapons or other objects in the process of being created with the traits of
other things."
1338,,200,Child Rearing 101,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Making ,"Children are ever so precious, especially when they make such perfect tools to turn against your foes. You have the knowledge of the strange processes used to create homunculi children and, beyond
the norm for this kind of magic, you can do so as long as you have even a single sample from the
body of your target, such as blood or a strand of hair, instead of needing semen. The homunculi can
be carried to term within a artificial womb that has been properly prepared or within a woman, it
makes little difference. The child will be a true descendant of the sample it was made from, possessing similar appearance and many of the same abilities and talents as their parent, though
they are still beginners. Unlike their parent however, they will rapidly reach adulthood in just a year, quickly mastering their born advantages. So long as you created them, you are also able to
effortlessly mould your homunculi into pursuing a purpose of your choice. They may try, through
your mistakes or the influence of others, to take their own path in life but they will find that destiny
agrees with you and be unnaturally forced towards the goal you decided for them. They can break
free but it will be an epic task."
1339,,200,Samples,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Making,"There are many dark works that require special ingredients, the sort not looked well upon by even
those who understand magic and the strange ingredients it can sometimes require. You however, have quite the valuable stock of such things. Boxes of organs from those just at the ripest age, vials
of blood from pure virgins and vile criminals alike, genetic material from a range of fit subjects and
even bundles of human skin and bone for when your own emergency supplies run low. The prize of
the collection however, is a significant genetic sample from a important figure in Britain, even one so
highly placed as Arturia herself. This collection will quickly replenish anything short of the single
sample described at the end, though that sample may be taken anew in each new world. You cannot
import into this."
1340,,200,Black Keys,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Making,"A collection of holy blades used to combat magic and destroy unholy
and demonic creatures such as vampires and demons. It is nearly impossible for such a
being to heal from a wound inflicted by a Black Key. As blades go, they are well forged
but ultimately subpar weaponry, only truly shining when used against spiritual or
supernatural entities, preferably of the unholy or demonic variety. And shine they do, as
even a Servant who is neither unholy nor demonic can be momentarily stunned by a
Black Key. With training in the Church’s Holy Sacraments, they can be used for a variety
of supernatural effects, including blocking spells, and can be made more effective with
magical energy. Due to their nature as a religious Mystery, however, they are most potent
when the wielder and target are both Christians, particularly Catholics, though they
function fine if only one is and don’t absolutely need either to be. As you are a Jumper,
you do not need to be Christian to use yours at their most effective, and they will regard
you as such when you wield them regardless of your actual religious affiliation. Also
comes with a few dozen Ash Locks, which are more common holy weapons, in a number
of forms."
1341,,200,Jeweler’s Special ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Making,"You’ve got a nice deal on Magic Rings...you can choose 5 magic rings you don’t already possess that aren’t purchasable from the “Custom Phantom Table”, you now possess them and can use them with a Wizard Driver or cast them regularly by channeling mana through them.
"
1342,,200,Item of Power ,Generic Magical Girl,Making,"You've got some kind of item which allows you to create short term magical effects like illusions, summoning magical beasts, or gaining skills you normally wouldn't have. You can also lend it to your allies to use, but be careful, it can be stolen or lost, and used against you. Additional simple powers can be added to the item at half price for each power past the first one. 
"
1343,,200,Messenger​ ​Cards​ ​,Sailor Moon,Making,"These are blank cards that imprint vague images on themselves when you hold them and picture the image in your mind. You may plant these cards in places where the recipient can find them, and they won’t question how the card got there. The intended recipient of these cards will always recognize the images on these cards and will know exactly what it means, so if one wishes to give someone a sign to act, or to warn them of someone, they may use these cards.
"
1344,,200,Transmutation ,Stardew Valley,Making,"Magic may be getting slowly crowded out of this world, but that had done nothing to weaken it. Only made it more rare. Still, those who know some of the ancient practices can unlock the secrets this world once knew. Key among them was the art of transmuting lesser materials into rarer ones. Five ingots of copper to make an iron bar and five of iron to make one of gold are just the basest acts you can manage. Gemstones can change or enough coal into diamonds. Even the mystical Iridium not being out of reach for those who find the right formula. And who knows what you can manage with some creativity.
"
1345,,200,Bottle of Demon's Blood ,DC Occult,Making,"A small bottle of demon's blood that replenishes once a week. Demon's blood is a useful ingredient for many potions and rituals, and if someone is giving a transfusion of it, assuming they survive, they will be healed of any existing ailments, their aging process will be retarded, and their strength and stamina will be somewhat augmented."
1346,,200,Infinite Bag​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Making,"Okay, so it’s technically not infinite. It can still hold enough alcohol to make a brewery’s yearly output do a double-take, as well as a fleet of ships. As in you can literally shove a bunch of warships into the bag and carry them around. The bag will not increase in weight at all, no matter what you put into it.
"
1347,,200,Wand and Shield​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Making,"A highly customized high quality wand, designed for use by enchanters (or if you’re incapable of magic, with a clicker), along with a high quality shield charm. Both of them will recharge when not in use.
"
1348,,200,Hellhound Breath​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Making,"Some dimensions aren’t as well... sorted as others. Or perhaps they are, but there’s simply layers in between. For example, Hell lies between the world of mortals, and the world in which Hellhounds reside (which makes their name somewhat inaccurate). This means that even the tiniest amount of Hellhound breath is mind-bogglingly difficult to get your hands on, and thus incredibly expensive. It’s also a highly effective ingredient for necromancy and alchemy, and can break any form of slumber without fail. The fact that you get another bottle full of it every jump is honestly somewhat unfair."
1349,,200,The Eternal Soldier ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Making,"When you were buried alongside your liege, your armour and sword were left on you. It would be needed for the moment you wake up, as you would be required to immediately look to protect your King from any possible dangers. For that sake, those weapons and armour were enchanted in a similar way to your own body, to prevent them from rusting and aging to dust. Your gear is all the same way, sharing in your magic to ensure that it will never age or become damaged from the passing of time. Swords never rust or lose their edge, armour does not gain weaker bonds over time and even food will not spoil when held in your bags."
1350,,200,Rune Carving ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Making,"Necrotects themselves are usually inexperienced in the ways of magic. It’s rarely their duty to cast spells or command rituals, yet they are often called upon to inscribe runes on a vast scale or otherwise prepare things for magical means. You’re very skilled at creating structures or items that can be channelled or used with magic, even whilst lacking it yourself. If you had a mage or wizard on hand, you’d even be able to work in tandem effortlessly, crafting items or structures suited to that person’s magic in particular, working even better for them than anyone else.
"
1351,,200,Counter Magic ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,"You know how to prepare a mud like substance that prevents the use of magic when submerged in it, useful for traps or imprisonment."
1352,,200,Self-Respect ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Making,"All but the poorest of nobles have a few servants to care for their weaponry and armour, even for their horse. The most powerful of nobles often have Knights Errant take care of the task for them, hating the very idea of lowborn peasants touching their equipment. These are the sorts of knights that get a nasty shock once they become Questing Knights, suddenly bereft of all such support. Your father ensured you didn’t grow lax like these oafs, teaching you how to care for each and every piece of equipment you own. The lessons stuck, better than he could have hoped, and now you find yourself able to easily maintain and keep in good condition anything you own that might qualify as equipment. Personal weapons, armour, devices and magical trinkets. If it breaks, you’re not automatically going to know how to repair it, but you always know how to do the best things to prevent it breaking in the course of its normal uses.
"
1353,,200,Magical Sealing Box ,Lyrical Nanoha,Making,"Alright, so maybe you need to store and maintain something a little more...volatile. This is a small box that can contain magical or dangerous items without their energy spreading or ‘leaking’ elsewhere, or otherwise exploding or causing trouble. So long as you can seal it within the box in the first place, this will let you safely transport or store Lost Logia or other volatile objects you can store within it. Opening it back up obviously gets rid of this protection."
1354,,200,Beef Stroganoff!,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Making,"You're a good cook. A really good cook, in fact! In addition to a sizable boost to your cooking skills, for any recipe you have, you can compose a song explaining how to prepare it on the spot. These songs tend to worm into people's brains, helping them get it down quicker."
1355,,200,Large Attendance ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You don’t need to follow any actual inscriptions on any charms – you can write gibberish on your ofuda and they’ll still work just fine. What matters is the intent behind them when you write them, and of course you need to be capable of crafting it normally in the first place for this perk to work. You still may want a way to differentiate between ofuda types even if you can just quickly scribble gibberish on a piece of paper.
"
1356,,200,Sake Bug ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a sake bug, a creature similar to a salamander or catfish, in a large, heavy jug. This one can turn the entire jug’s worth of water into sake – though somewhat unrefined in taste – in only a single night. By taking this, you also are aware of the methods the Oni used to create them in the first place and could easily apply this to make many more sake bugs, perhaps even ones that create higher quality sake or maybe even produce other kinds of alcohol. Alternatively, you could swallow it and never be affected by alcohol again, but why?
"
1357,,200,Golden Hot Springs ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a geothermal hot spring that goes directly down to Hell, where the desires of sinners are purged in hellfire to produce gold that bubbles up to the surface. Unfortunately, it constantly vents sometimes-toxic gases, and gold isn’t the only thing it produces. The desire to live produces mercury, to kill produces arsenic, and antimony and lead are more impurities that riddle the gold. Still, if you have a way to purify the gold you can get enough to make yourself rich, and the other impurities are highly useful for magic.
"
1358,,200,Artwork ,Ib,Making,"You can take a piece of (canon) artwork from the gallery. Whatever you choose, it will have magical qualities. For instance, a painting of a sakura tree might actually shed real flowers outside the picture. Even if the artwork is sapient, it will be considered an item and therefore not count against companion limits in jumps under normal circumstances.
"
1359,,200,Steal Not From the Fae ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"Objects wrongfully taken in Elphame will turn into various, worthless objects – gold coins turning into wooden chips, diamonds turning into pebbles, gourmet meals turning into toadstools, magic rings turning into petals and bugs, etc. You can set spells on your possessions such that in the event someone takes them without permission, they will turn into other items. The items they turn into must be of considerably less value than their original form, and you must determine the preset curse before the items are stolen. You can also add a related geass to items you give away to others, binding the new owners to never tell others where they got the items from or to never show the items to others at all; breaking either condition you set will likewise cause the gifted items to turn into mundane, lesser things like petals or acorns."
1360,,200,Gourmancer ,Wonderland No More,Making,"With all the magic foodstuffs scattered throughout Wonderland, Gourmancers have become experts in bringing out the foods’ full potential through truly magical recipes. While this skill is most often associated with outright cooking, the culinary skills offered in this specialty can be applied to other recipe/ingredient-focused magic like alchemy or potion-making.
"
1361,,200,Haberdasher ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Otherwise known as a “Hatter” – and as with everything else in Wonderland, you’re sure to be quite Mad! Though you can choose to specialize in another kind of clothing as a seamstress, tailor, cobbler, glover, dressmaker, corsetier, quilter, etc., in which case the spells you can learn for your trade focus around your specialty. You could even have a specialty in a non-clothes craft or art, like painting, poetry, or toy-making.
"
1362,,200,Time to Cook ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Wonderland’s sense of time is kind of screwy, and it’s perfectly reasonable for a chef to go out for a midnight quest to a mountain for an egg and get back before the pot boils over. This perk essentially slows down the progression of time from a narrative standpoint as long as you are focusing on making food – that includes everything from acquiring ingredients to preparing the food to setting the table. This does not slow or freeze the movements of those around you, but it basically means that as long as you are focused on cooking, you’ll finish everything on time and nothing will interrupt you. For instance, if you are cooking a special potion to boost your troops in time to stop an invasion, you’ll get the potion ready on time even if the siege was just an hour away. When you stop doing food-related things, time returns to its normal pace. Other ingredient-focused activities such as spell preparations, alchemy, and medicine-making still technically count as “cooking” by Wonderland rules, though.
"
1363,,200,Conjurer ,Wonderland No More,Making,"You can now pull mundane objects out of thin air from within your hat or another clothing of your choice. You can only summon non-magical items, and the strain/drain the spell puts on your magic/energy increases with how expensive said items could normally cost to purchase in a store or such place. Conjured items are temporary and artificial, vanishing after their immediate usefulness is ended. These items have a “fake” nature that perceptive individuals might notice with enough observation, but otherwise they function just as well as their real counterparts would. You can also use this ability to summon an animal of your choice (no larger or stronger than a dire wolf or riding horse). The animal will behave normally but will follow your commands. It will inevitably wander off eventually to “vanish” much in the same way as standard conjured items. The magic cost of an animal summon increases with its size and strength. In addition, you can only summon items and creatures you directly know about – the spell won’t fill in any gaps for you; if unable to meet your request, the summon attempt will either fail or produce something chaotically troublesome.
"
1364,,200,Mystery Bottles ,Wonderland No More,Making,"A half-dozen bottles with no label other than “Drink Me”. Each bottle contains a random Wonderland drink. For example, Spiced Cordial makes one unfailingly polite and proper (with higher charisma but the inability to taunt or intimidate), Moonbeam Juice makes you take on a monstrous form, and Ginger Ale heals fresh wounds (but also makes you drunk and hiccupy). Generally, whatever the effects, they will wear out after a few hours tops. You will be unable to identify the exact kind of drink until you actually drink it. Once emptied, a bottle refills after your next unbirthday, but the contents are again determined randomly. It is exceedingly difficult to determine what’s in each bottle. You might eventually be able to identify a certain kind of drink if you’ve experienced its effects numerous times already (perhaps recognizing its color or the way it swishes), but it’s impossible to identify any new random drink you haven’t tried before.
"
1365,,200,Bottled Curiosity ,Wonderland No More,Making,"A vial with concentrated, pure curiosity. Anyone exposed to the contents will become utterly curious for the next 24 hours, with their insatiable curiosity trumping common sense. Also, as they say, curiosity killed the cat, and any feline (or being with at least some feline traits) will, unless they manage to resist, suffer a critical wound that could very well prove fatal if untreated. An emptied bottle will refill once in a blue moon.
"
1366,,200,Snark Fishing Pole ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Fishing rod that has a bonus fighting against and catching snarks and boojums. Essentially, the power of the pole increases with how little you know about a creature. If you already own a fishing pole, you can give it the same attributes as this purchase instead.
"
1367,,200,The Glove of Sneaky Pinching ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Making,"A deranged Enchanter was on a very drunken bender one night in Nuln. Or were it Tilea. Either way, he had come into the ownership of a set of rags that had once been part of an Arabyan flying carpet. Not wanting to let the fine fabric go to waste, the halfling set about with the stitching and sewing - and created the world’s first and only flying kleptomaniacal glove. Said glove then came into the ownership of one Clegg, master burglar.

Well actually it looks like there’s a pair of gloves now. The other is in your possession - a flying glove made of the finest Arabyan silk, seemingly sapient and hungry to steal shinies and lootables. In particular it seems to enjoy swiping weapons and armaments from a foe’s belt or hands without them even noticing until a smidgeon too late.
"
1368,,200,Lead Bricks ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Making,"Your very own Patriarch paid for his passage at Marienburg with transmuted lead bricks just like this pile of fifteen, and he was already in Altdorf before the enchantment wore off. Perhaps, like these lead bricks you now own, those were more receptive than most lead bricks to enchantment. Whenever you transmute these lead bricks into a more valuable metal, they will not only hold the\ enchantment for longer than normal, but will also truly count as that higher metal even for the purposes of magical rituals and costs. Another set will find its way to you within a week, should you lose, consume, or spend these bricks."
1369,,200,Witch’s Wares ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Making,"“I keep myself busy with my potions, or else I find myself fussing over my granddaughter Irene too much.”

You’ve picked up the ability to produce potions in a similar manner to Hyrule’s resident Witch. With reasonably common ingredients like monster parts and mushrooms, you can create medicine capable of restoring health and magical energy, increasing your attack power or even granting temporary invincibility. With more exotic ingredients, you might even be able to find previously undiscovered potion effects, so get brewing!
"
1370,,200,Tools of the Hero ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Making,"But of course a Knight may find themselves in need of more than just a weapon. A magic rod, boots of speed, a pouch of magical powder, or an enchanted cape. Any number of items might be needed along the way. So, please go ahead and pick any two such items, weapons, or equipment you think you might need. Or, actually, don’t. See, this defaults to the Magical Mirror and the Moon Pearl. However, on a second purchase of this, discounted if it wasn't and discounted again if it was, you may pick any of the items Link himself collected. That said, you may not buy a upgraded equipment, only the base level. Additionally, some items are sold separately and are not available via this option.
"
1371,,200,Notes In The Margin ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Making,"After watching Link in action, it would seem that Zelda and the Sages began to take notes on the various items, tools, and other equipment that he used during his adventure. As a result, they, and you, have learned how to upgrade the various minor magical artifacts that Hyrule like to hide in caves or hand out as rewards for daring deeds. But - not ‘upgrade’ in the sense of turning a Hookshot into a Longshot, but in the sense that the item in question would become easier to use. Perhaps the hook of the Hookshot retracts faster, or the treads on the Pegasus Boots have been touched up, allowing the wearer to turn mid dash. Simple quality of life upgrades, nothing major like a full upgrade. The only real catch is that you have to watch the item in question be used for a while in order to get a feel for it."
1372,,200,Learning From One's Mistakes ,Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets,Making,"While there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for it, a lot of the time when Ganon’s forces come into contact with a Hero, they’re just strong enough to fight them off, acquire a new weapon, and then walk all over them. Luckily for you, you’re surprisingly competent at reacquiring spent resources and minions – that is to say, when empowering a minion or setting a trap, it becomes easier to make a stronger monster by following a pattern. Sure, the Hero defeated this particular monster after the fifth or sixth dungeon they went through. Now, lets make it bigger, stronger, faster, and the boss of the third dungeon. Don’t throw an enemy he actually can fight, throw something better. Please note, this doesn’t actually grant you a method to do these things, just make any you already have much more effective.
"
1373,,200,The Smithy ,Hyrule Warriors,Making,"The Smithy is a structure resembling a standard, though well-funded, workshop for blacksmiths. On first glance, the facilities are impressive but nothing out of the ordinary. 

When you look in the back however, you’ll find an old Hylian man next to an anvil with a hammer in hand. This man is the source of the Smithy’s powers. Not only does he do fine work as a normal blacksmith, but he has the ability to actually fuse weapons of the same type into a new weapon. 

The new weapon can appear as either component weapon and will have the sum of its component’s abilities, such as elemental affinities or variable enchantments. As for type, this only works when fusing similar weapons such as two swords, two hammers and such. 

The Smithy will be attached to your warehouse after leaving this Jump, though you will also gain the option to simply place it in the world at your discretion.
"
1374,,200,Magic Infused Object ,Hyrule Warriors,Making,"There’s placing enchantments on something that exists, and then there are objects with magic woven in throughout their creation. Now you may have an item like this in your hands to defend yourself in the ongoing war. 

On purchase, choose an item, you gain a magical equivalent with properties relating to what it is. A harp could be played to manipulate magic easier than what you could do on your own, allowing the manipulation of multiple elements at one time. 

A branch from the Great Deku Tree could call upon fabricated nature spirits. A magical tome, each page dripping with mysticism, could literally be used to project its pages as deadly weapons. These are just a few examples of the tools and weapons allowed by this option.
"
1375,,200,I Feel Immense Gratitude! ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Making,"A demon is a demon, will always be a demon, and that’s the end of things. Or is it? You see, the people of Skyloft can produce an odd material, a crystal that seems to be the physical form of gratitude. You’d think a demon would have no use of this, but with enough of these crystals you can invert your affinity for darkness and your evil nature. In effect, you could become human, possibly with some small skill at light magic. But, it doesn’t end there. Rage, sorrow, and despair, also have a physical form now, and you can imagine what you could do with those. With that said, it should be noted that only those pure of heart - pure good or pure evil, both will work - can see and interact with these crystals. Finding gratitude crystals as a black hearted demon is not actually a task you can complete yourself, and only barely as a peaceful one."
1376,,200,Deku Baba Seeds ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Making,"Sometimes you need an army to fight off the hero. And sometimes you just need to slow him down a little bit. That’s where these come in. This bag of seeds contains a few fragmented parts of a Deku Baba, and just a touch of dark magic. All you have to do is throw the seeds down - or throw them up, in some cases - and wherever the seed lands, a Deku Baba will spring up in just a few seconds. And the bag will start to refill itself basically as soon as one of the ones you planted dies. Threatening? Only in large quantities. Annoying? Oh so much.
"
1377,,200,A Strong Feeling of Gratitude ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Making,"While the Spirit Tracks may or may not have been forged by the Spirits of Good in conjunction with the power of light inherent to Tetra’s bloodline, they do seem to be compatible with a number of different energy sources. The energy generated by the land in all it’s various flavors, and of course it somehow manages to react positively to emotions as an energy source. Speaking off, you can now turn emotions directed at you into a physical material, and use those materials as a power source. If they’re extremely grateful to you, you probably get a Force Gem! If they’re angry... I wouldn’t try to power the Spirit Tracks off of that.
"
1378,,200,Deku Leaf ,Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker,Making,"A single leaf from the Deku Tree, and the thing that the Korok use to fly, helicopter style. Unlike normal people, who are too big to do anything but hang glide, they can float about more or less indefinitely. Not much for actually controlling where they go though. Additionally, the leaves seem to have an affinity for the wind, as simply swinging it around will create an unusually large burst of air.
"
1379,,200,Restocking the Shelves ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Making,"Part of being a shopkeeper is having things to sell to people. In fact, that might be the most important part; one might even go as far as to call it the point. However, most shopkeepers must also buy things, which ultimately cuts into profits. Instead of cutting into that most precious of things, you’ve cut out the middle-man and learned to make a wide variety of common Hyrulian products yourself. Ranging from arrows to potions, lantern oil to bombs; if it can be bought, it can be sold. Making these things is easy and efficient, and can be done with common items and materials you can find anywhere."
1380,,200,Power Bracelet ,The Legend of Zelda,Making,"An enchanted bracelet, while wearing this you will have the physical strength to push large boulders. Unfortunately, it does not increase your damage with any of the swords, nor does it allow you to fight any more effectively with your bare hands."
1381,,200,Dragon Runes,TES: Dovah,Making,"Have you ever wondered how the highly sought after Dragon
Priest masks were created, beyond their physical forms? The powerful enchantments
on those masks cannot be found anywhere else, all thanks to the Dovah’s unique
enchanting methods. By carving dragon runes into an item, you can permanently imbue
it with a Word of Power, granting it abilities based off of said Word. Imbuing more Words
requires greater skill, but when you’ve got an eternity, you can take your time."
1382,,200,Creator,TES: Dovah,Making,"It may come as a surprise, but the dragons are surprisingly great
craftsmen. They are capable of shaping metals and woods into various shapes through
some unknown method, most likely a specialized use of the Thu'um or another form of
Tonal Magic. Whatever it is, you are a master at it, able to create great works that can
equal and even surpass the greatest creations of mortals. Should you be mortal,
then you are a master craftsman through mundane means, though no less capable."
1383,,200,Eternal Enchanting,TES: Magic,Making,"One of the limiting factors for enchanting is the need to
constantly recharge them. This is especially true for weapons, forcing you to recharge
them multiple times a day. Well no more, for you have discovered the secret to solve
that particular annoyance. Any enchantments you apply will never run out of charge,
being just as effective in a thousand years as it was the day it was made."
1384,,200,Aetherial Magic ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"The Wild Elves had a deep fascination with starlight, even going so far as to contain it within Meteoric Glass in order to harness it's magic. You have been trained in this long lost art, able to create receptacles to store magicka from starlight for a number of purposes. This works best using Meteoric Glass, but I'm sure you can find alternatives."
1385,,200,Rune Master ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Spell runes are for those who want to take a more defensive stance when it comes to combat. Not only can you leave numerous runes as traps, but you can throw them five times farther than you could before."
1386,,200,Azura's Star ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"The Daedric Artifact of Azura, Daedric Prince of Dawn and Dusk, takes the form of a large, intricately designed gemstone with prongs, making it resemble a star. It acts as a reusable soul gem of the highest quality, though it can only contain white souls within it."
1387,,200,Alchemical Apparatus ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"This is what every alchemist needs to truly bring out the best of their craft. This master crafted set of mortar and pestle, calcinator, alembic, and retort allow you to make more substances at a higher quality than you otherwise would have. Alchemical ingredients sold separately."
1388,,200,Enchanting Table ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Being an enchanter isn't much use when you don't have the equipment to do it. Not only does this table allow you to enchant weapons and armor, but any enchantments you do place are stronger than they otherwise would have been. Does not come with soul gems."
1389,,200,Endless Quiver ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"One of the downsides to archery compared to other forms of combat is that you need ammunition. Hopefully this will mitigate that problem, as this quiver creates endless copies of whatever arrow or crossbow bolt is inserted into a slot on the side. Should you decide to not use silver arrows anymore, simply take it out of the slot and have your daedric arrow take its place."
1390,,200,Alchemist’s Assistant ,Genshin Impact,Making,"Alchemy is an ancient art. Entire branches have been created and then lost to the annals of time. But when its secrets are cracked, you will find the ability to shape the world itself at your fingertips. Most simply know it as the art that lets people glue stuff together, but something like that is merely the beginning. With a few key ingredients and a touch of magic, you can do wonders. Albedo, famed alchemist of Mondstadt, is proficient in the art of Khemia, a branch of alchemy focused on the creation of life. His assistant, Sucrose, focuses instead on the modification of existing life. The powerful skeletal dragon Durin, equal to the Anemo Archon, was said to be the product of such life alchemy. You are knowledgeable in a branch of alchemy of your own choosing, whether this be the study of life, or of another discipline."
1391,,200,Mora - Boosted ,Genshin Impact,Making,"For 200 extra CP, however, you can add two zeros on to that number. Now you would be playing in the big leagues, alongside the likes of Childe and Ningguang. The kind of people who could throw around money without caring about expenditure.

(CG Note: Requires base Mora - Genshin Impact first.)"
1392,,200,Adeptal Speed ,Genshin Impact,Making,"Adeptal energy, like elemental energy, can be captured. It can be stored. Within this little vial is a small amount of a specific type of adeptal energy. This particular type of energy is used specifically for creating the structures found within the Adepti pocket realms. Where without it might take hours or even days for the structure to form out of the requisite material, this vial can be used to finish the task almost instantaneously. In future jumps, you will find it has a similar sort of effect when used on other structures being constructed via magical means. You have received half a dozen of these vials, each only usable for one structure. Should you run out, you will receive a new lot within a month."
1393,,250,E.G.O. Unlock(ALEPH),Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"Normally over the course of the jump, weapons and armour can be crafted from the energy collected from the abnormalities. Choose a non-tool Abnormality, you now have a single copy of all the equipment (including gifts) it can provide. Their requirements don’t apply to you or your companions. They can be found in your dorm/warehouse and won't be confused with company property.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1394,,300,Drekkja Jörðinni,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"You will receive a jar carved from yggdrasil itself with a never ending supply of the sacred drink. You could turn this jar and pour out rivers or lakes in a moment or plunge it into and drain the whole ocean away. Through the gift of the world tree you could pour it straight into the minds or cups of those you choose within the places you hold power, blessing them with its gift or curse them with savagery and madness or forced transformation into beasts or monsters like werewolves.

Requires Óðrœrir to purchase."
1395,,300,Atgørvi,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"Everyone has a skill, don't they, something they become known for; this is a single mundane skill of your choice. At 300cp your skills in your chosen area are only limited by your conceptual scope, forging the very idea of a blade out of the sounds of war, manifesting hopes or dreams into a shield. Gather the roots of mountains or the sound of a cat’s foot fall, forging truly indestructible objects immune to even being erased from time or causal loops. A runner able to outrun death and walk through dreams.  
At each purchase level your ability to learn, adapt, and master your talents within that skillset will grow by an order of 3, 9, or 27 with no cap to your abilities’ growth beyond the conceptual limitations of this purchase and with absolutely no end if purchased at 300cp.

May be purchased multiple times. "
1396,,300,Replicate,Worm CYOA v17,Making,"You can replicate matter through physical contact. You may replicate multiple things at once, but you cannot replicate over 200 kilograms of material at a time. The supernatural or magical character of an item or person aren't replicated."
1397,,300,Scepter of Power,Worm CYOA v17,Making,"You can summon a Projection that manifests as a grey wood Staff with a yellow crystal orb on its tip. You can use all your senses through this Staff like how it can use yours. The Staff can fly at a speed of 60mph. The Staff is sapient with its mind, being connected to yours, allowing it to read your intentions and commands to follow your will, though it can act independently. The Staff is highly durable, being able to take a punch from Alexandria before breaking, though you can resummon it later.

By touching something, the Staff can absorb it. The bigger an object than you is, the longer it'll take for it to absorb. If attached to something else, both their sizes will be taken into account; too large of an object won't be absorbed. Non-sapient living beings can't be absorbed, while sapient beings can only be absorbed once given consent. It has 6 Weak slots and 1 Strong slot to store absorbed objects, which you can freely swap between a Weak and Strong slot.

Absorbed objects enter stasis, remaining frozen in time for as long as they're in storage.

The Staff gains weak powers based on the objects inside it. The Strong slot amplifies the power gained greatly by the object. The power expression is random, but you can freely randomize it again. Some powers may need you to be touching the Staff to use. What the object is does not influence the strength of the power, only its expression.

The following are examples of power expressions. By absorbing a spear, the Staff can change its crystal orb into a spear-like shape capable of cutting anything that isn't metal, like a hot knife through butter, on a Weak slot, while the Strong slot would give it the additional capacity to control its length. Absorbing a rock would grant the Staff the capacity to reshape the stone on a Weak slot, whereas a Strong slot would allow for additional capacity to create stones. The stone created by the Staff shall stay locked in whatever place it was made in, even air, though it will rapidly decay if not attached to anything.

Absorbing a Cauldron Vial/Corona Pollentia will create a temporary connection to whatever Shard they're connected to. Endowing the Staff with a random power like any other object. If you're lucky, the power expression could be what their host has.

The Staff is hyperaware of its surroundings and has a perfect memory, allowing you to access and effectively use any knowledge it acquires. The Staff has an awareness of what's inside it, allowing it to, for example, know the contents of a book stored within it or the components of the ink used. It can communicate with you by whispering to your mind.

Touching the Staff grants you the ability to fly, greatly enhancing your thinking speed, and with your consent, it can pilot your body. The Staff will try to protect you from harm, though it won't do so if you consider said harm beneficial. It could protect you by piloting your body to evade an attack or use one of its powers.

The Staff changes based on what is occupying the Strong slot and its power expression. The level of influence the Weak slots have depends on the compatibility of what's inside. A chunk of iron on the Strong slot would make the Staff turn into metal, while a lighter on a Weak slot would make it glow red-hot."
1398,,300,Fal’Cie Fragment,Final Fantasy XIII,Making,"A fragment of a fallen Fal’Cie. It appears...with this in hand, you may crystallize a willing companion – thereby freezing them in a temporal stasis until a time of your choosing. They can’t act, but nothing about them changes during the time they spend in stasis either."
1399,,300,Church Organ,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Making,"An old church organ is now in your possession. Conveniently, it can be shrunk to pocket size for easy transport. When you are playing the organ, it can harm any sort of evil or demonic presence slowly over time, generally irritating them and revealing their presence as they try to escape it before it causes serious harm."
1400,,300,A Big Chest,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Making,"You can choose any one storage item, no bigger than a very large wardrobe, and grant it TARDIS-like storage conditions, allowing it to be much bigger on the inside than on the outside. Just make sure to leave it open if you go inside it, and don’t touch the magical stick that comes along with it. Seriously, don’t do that. While allowing for virtually infinite storage, it can not surpass more than a quarter of what your warehouse/warehouse addons can store and the item has to be able to fit as well (a car can’t be shoved into a chest for instance). In addition, things will basically pile on top of one another, making finding what you want to get harder than one might think if they have a huge collection. You may switch which item has this enchantment, but only one item can have it and you must empty out everything contained in the original item."
1401,,300,Guriguri Banban,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"“This is a joke right?” The shopkeeper shakes his head in denial. “No, a Moogle came in with this, it’s a deadly weapon.” It looks like a toy hammer, with one end stamped with a skull and the other end stamped with a smiley face. The shopkeeper lifts the hammer up easily and smacks a goblin nearby. You hear a childish sound effect. He then flips the hammer to its other face and smacks the goblin again.

The goblin turns into a frog, and the shopkeeper turns to you with a grin on his face. “Works on any living being that doesn’t resist status effects. It seems the magick in the hammer needs to recharge after a use though. Can take a couple minutes, and by then the effect wears off.”

You remind yourself to be careful in Ivalice if you see a toy weapon."
1402,,300,Zodiac Spear,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"A legendary spear tied to the fate of the Espers. The Zodiac spear is the key to unlocking the depths of Henne Mines, getting past the layers upon layers of ancient bindings. It also happens to be wickedly sharp, and has a special property dependent on its wielder.

The physically focused Licenses, Taurus / Leo / Scorpio / Sagittarius / Aquarius / Pisces will find that the spear has a high tendency to destroy magical barriers like Palings and strip magical effects.

The magically and specially focused Licenses, Aries / Gemini /Cancer / Virgo / Libra /Capricorn will find that the spear will cast a spell they know at random, though thankfully it tends to be smart at proper targeting depending on the spell at hand."
1403,,300,Something Should Be Here,Slay the Princess,Making,"You're skeptical of everything around you and insist upon things being there when really, there's not a single thing there. But to indulge your spontaneous flights of random skeptical delirium, let us say that you do find something there and it does pop into reality and act accordingly to whatever you have deluded yourself into believing that it does. Upon learning of such an ability, you now realize that just by willing it into being hard enough, you can basically create objects to help you when you really need them. 

This still does not help us slay the Princess."
1404,,300,Cathedral of Altana,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"This building has stood as a monument to the glory of Altana for generations of Elvaan nobility. The vicasque leads the people with his sermons from atop the balcony, overlooking the Parade Grounds. You now have a small statue of Altana, and receive a new one each jump if it is used. By placing the statue in an open area a new cathedral will form, holy magic cast within the walls of the cathedral is much more effective and those who pray beneath the great statue of Altana within feel a great wellspring of love Eternal from the goddess forming in their hearts. As an alternative you could also have this connect to your warehouse if you wish."
1405,,300,Echad Ring,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"A rather ornate ring made of some unknown metal, those who wear it find that they receive a massive increase to the amount of experience received in battle or through training for as long as they wear it, these rings are so rare they can not be bought anywhere in Vana'diel and only a few adventurers have their own to cherish."
1406,,300,Home Point Crystal ,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"A large blue crystal appears in a small room added onto your warehouse, once per jump when you die you will respawn at this crystal, weakened but otherwise unharmed. Though many have tried, there as yet is no way to recreate this crystal."
1407,,300,Vacation Voucher,Hotel Transylvania,Making,"Just can’t stay away huh? Well with this you can now always find your way back to Hotel Transylvania to enjoy a nice vacation with the works. Don’t question it too deeply, you’re on vacation after all! During your time at the hotel time in the jump is frozen for one week which is when your voucher expires and you have to go back to your jump. You will arrive back right where you left right when you left."
1408,,300,Talisman,The God of High School Jump,Making,"Hanging around your neck is a pretty piece of jewellery. Could be a golden cross, a string of pearls or just a nice little amulet with a picture of someone precious to you. This necklace is able to draw in the life energy that flows through your body, with no upper limit on how much it can store and no level of decay in what is stored within the item. At any time this Talisman is on your body, you may reach into its stores of energy and draw out as much as you want, up to the limit of what you have put in over the time you have had it. Store a little bit every day and you could find yourself with a huge emergency reserve after a few years. Why, you might even be able to crush one of the Gods beneath your feet if you let those years of gathering go in one shot."
1409,,300,Unorthodox Refinement ,Final Fantasy X,Making,"Spira is strange place with strange practices – so can you really blame them if there exists methods here of refining weapons by performing bizarre tasks? It’s definitely not a process that relies on the old hammer and whetstone, but there have been practices that include dodging lightning by a hair and racing birds against the clock, even killing a single enemy repeatedly without rest in order to hone a weapon.

Perhaps there’s some merit to this, but it’s definitely not something you’ll see until you put theory into practice. Unfortunately though, it might be easy at first, but as the item grows stronger, the chosen task will take much longer to complete...in a way, you’re still grinding in a different manner. Maybe it’s not such hard work if you actually enjoy the task?"
1410,,300,An Ominous Hammer,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"Rumor is that this hammer was used by an ancient being – some lord of the underworld? We could be wrong on that one. Or of course...this could be a replica, that’ll be a secret between you and me.

Regardless, its effect is undeniable. The ancient lord used it in synthesis, and its power to merge weapons together has lessened no less. Two weapons combined, regardless of shape and size, will merge to form a new one, with the qualities of both. Unfortunately, once two weapons have been merged together, the hammer cannot affect it again.

Be prepared for awkward combinations, as perhaps some things were never meant to be merged into one..."
1411,,300,Gulug Stone,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"A facsimile of an ancient rock of otherworldly origins. It seems to gather magical energies from the environment around it, and in its immediate area, no magic will function be it passive or active as everything is sapped into the stone.

But for a stone which stores magical energies, it's not quite certain what it actually does with the stored magic - until it breaks. When it breaks, the stone releases all of the magic contained inside, flooding the world it is currently in with the magic stored within. 

Capable of bestowing others with magic - it can only bestow a very low level form dependent on how much energy it has sapped."
1412,,300,Iifa Seed ,Final Fantasy IX,Making,"An ominous seed, which feels wholly artificial from the weird aura that it projects out into the area around it. When planted, it will quickly grow into a sapling, after which growth seems to stagnate.

It seems, that much like the original tree it sprouted from, this seed will not grow unless exposed to souls of some form. When after a copious amount of souls the tree is fully grown, its size still pales in comparison to the actual Iifa Tree.

It does however, have a nasty effect of capturing the souls of the dead in the world that it happens to be planted in, and will retain the souls which it is fed. As it gathers more souls, the tree grows livelier, but as the souls get extracted, a bit of the growth retracts. It is possible, with the use of the Iifa Tree, to capture souls and replant them elsewhere in a bizarre twist of the reincarnation cycle."
1413,,300,Eagle(Liiri),Miraculous Ladybug,Making,"Concept: Freedom

Form: Talon Necklace

Tool: Bullroarer (look up a video of someone using it)

Power: “Liberation” - Fires a golden feather which frees its target from something that is holding them down. This can only free the target from mental/spiritual things such as magical nightmares, personality traits, possession, and stuff like that. These effects are permanent except for personality traits which will reset after 24 hours unless the target (in their unaltered state) would want to stay freed. The effects can also be canceled by uttering the phrase “Cool Down”. This is notably one of the American Miraculous."
1414,,300,Dragon(Longg) ,Miraculous Ladybug,Making,"Concept: Perfection

Form: Choker

Tool: Sword

Power: Allows the user to transform into and control one of 3 elements: Wind, Lightning, or Water. This lasts a few moments each. One element cannot be used more than once. The countdown does not start until all three charges are used. If the user is an adult, all three will continue to be available and using each charge will only be as tiring as 1/3 of a Power."
1415,,300,Elemental Ring ,Fairy Fencer F,Making,This Fairy Ring is blessed with an incredible power. Grants an extraordinary increase to elemental power and control.
1416,,300,Amulet of the Elements,Fairy Fencer F,Making,"Much like the Amulet of Protection, but for Elemental damage. Increases the wearer’s resistance to all elements by a moderate amount."
1417,,300,Nuovo Fabric,Library of Ruina V1.0,Making,"Nuovo fabric is a rare and amazing material usually reserved for the most elite garments. It is soft to the touch, but is somehow more durable than tank armour. If you want to wear a business suit and still have protection that rivals the military, nuovo is your jam. Naturally it is the most sought after and is quite a lucrative business. You will have a crate of nuovo fabric delivered to your warehouse that refills once a week."
1418,,300,Greater Materials,God Of War (2018),Making,"This is a rather simple looking crate that will only be able to open once over three days. Each time you open it you will find that it contains three rare materials from the universe you are in, or one that you have been to. Things like Mithril, Adamantium, Uru, the screams of frost trolls, etc. All of these things can be found, and they will appear in the exact amount that you need. However this crate cannot summon unique materials nor can it summon anything that is sentient or sapient. For example the crate could not summon the Infinity Stones from Marvel, nor could it summon a dragon though it could summon the scales, blood, and other parts of a dragon. Nor could it summon something like, the heart of Ymir the primordial giant. The restrictions on unique materials is lifted post-jump."
1419,,300,Mimisbrunnr,God Of War (2018),Making,"The “magic well” of Mimir, said to contain vast knowledge. But in truth it’s just a well that’s laced with enough magical drugs to make a god see things. This was used by Mimir to trick Odin into thinking that Mimir was valuable to him and worth taking as his advisor, similarly this item is meant to be used to trick others. While it can take the shape of anything that could carry liquid (a well, a flask, a goblet, etc) it will always come in the form of a liquid that is laced with magic drugs. Any being that takes this will be convinced to think higher of both you and your advice, though be warned. If they find out what you did, the results may not be in your favor depending on how useful you prove yourself to be."
1420,,300,Advanced Potion Supplies,God Of War (2018),Making,"A large container (of your choice) of advanced alchemical supplies that can be used to create truly miraculous potions. Potions that can heal beings of conflicting natures to bring balance to their inner conflict, potions that can heal nearly any disease, etc. Like their basic counterpart these supplies can be used to create 100 potions before running out, and the container will automatically restock every seven days if any of the supplies are used."
1421,,300,Improving What is Already Made,God Of War (2018),Making,"The curse of being a craftsman is that you are almost always improving your craft, and can be embarrassed by your earlier works. You no longer have to worry about that, should you find an improvement to your craft you find it relatively easy to apply it to already finished products."
1422,,300,Enchanting,God Of War (2018),Making,"The art of enchanting is vast, nearly infinite in its possibilities. With this perk you now know how the twenty four runes of the Norse Pantheon, to create enchantments of great power. Whether they be enchantments to deal fire damage, enchantments to that increase the protection that armor grants, or some other effect. You also gain a great affinity to runes and other written magics of all kinds, allowing you to learn them at a faster rate than most."
1423,,300,Mystic Gateway Creation,God Of War (2018),Making,"Scattered throughout the lands are mystical gateways, created with rocks and ancient runes, which connect the Realms together using the branches of Yggdrasil to enable those with the proper knowledge to go from one place to another quickly. Now you know how to create these gateways, allowing you to link realms together in a way which allows you to transport yourself from one realm to another with no one noticing. Furthermore you are the only one who can use these gateways unless you give permission for others to use them. The downsides are that gods of significant power such as Thor and Odin could destroy these gateways should they find them and if all of your gateways are destroyed then you will be trapped in the branches of Yggdrasil for potentially years."
1424,,300,Bifrost Craftsman,God Of War (2018),Making,"Well this is an interesting talent you’ve got here, it appears that you have a talent in making Bifrost eyes and other such gateways, allowing those who possess them to make portals to any place, in any realm, in existence with the one requirement being that they have seen the realm before hand. There are ways to block this kind of travel though so it is not the end all be all of traveling."
1425,,300,EGOtistical,Library of Ruina,Making,"Personal EGO, or Psychoment depending on who you ask, is a fascinating phenomenon. Those who find themselves near the point of breaking, at the end of their rope, but hold fast to their ideals (and have a hefty dose of Light), can manifest their own Psyche as a weapon, armor or other, stranger implement. For now, yours is a relatively simple weapon or suit of armor, that can be wielded with no more requisite skill than breathing so long as you maintain the mental focus required to manifest it. It in turn boosts the power of your blows, and can allow you to strike at the mind or soul of a target with a bit of effort. Each EGO is unique however, and yours will have certain useful qualities. Maybe it rejects raw power, forcing a contest of pure skill briefly, or it causes unnaturally deep wounds. Whatever the case, it in some way reflects you and the stance you took to overcome the trials of the City. What’s more, each of the capstones you take will inform the manifestation of your EGO and grant extra functions, from taking on the nature of an area, to becoming a part of your body. This excludes the peaks of the Wing origin, for they are rather removed from the struggles of the City in their Nests, up so high above the struggle, so isolated from the mad desire needed. 

They can still take it, they just won’t get bonuses."
1426,,300,Onion Gear,Final Fantasy IV,Making,"An odd set of gear that seems to remit a resonant aura to whomever dons it. The weapon and armor grow in strength to your own, and the more powerful you become, so too does this equipment."
1427,,300,Custom Sacred Gear(Tier 1),HighSchool DxD,Making,"Time to bring out the big guns. Sacred Gears are also known as ‘God’s Artifacts’ and are part of the Judeo-Christian God’s system to enact miracles on Earth. It’s known that only humans (and rarely human-hybrids) are born with them. Powered by the desires of the user, adapting, and evolving based on their wielder's thoughts, needs, and feelings, gaining abilities or qualities as time passes. This is also how they can enter Balance Breaker, a state also known as the Forbidden Move, which is the strongest manifestation of the SG, and a form that goes beyond the initial plan of its creator.

The effects, abilities and powers they have are incredibly varied. From the relatively common Twice Critical, to the unique ones like Twilight Healing, to the Longinus – a group of powerful Sacred Gears said to be capable of killing a god.

Does the sparse list of options I present to you seem disappointing? Do you want something a little more...unique for a Sacred Gear? Look no further. You may design and create a single Sacred Gear of your choosing with this option. The price will depend on its effects, based on the options below...a simple but useful utility effect or single combat ability will have a base price of 200. Add 100 to that base price (base price is the one discounted if applied) and that will be your price for your personal Sacred Gear."
1428,,300,Excalibur Mimic ,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Why just one kind of sword, though? Why not, say, a katana? Or a zweihander? Or even a blade made entirely out of molten light?! The power of this iteration allows the user to change the blade into any size, shape, or material they desire, even other objects or life-sized replicas of living beings...though, obviously, those won’t really be alive or do anything without the user’s input. However, the more complex the form, the more training and refinement is needed with the sword’s power - you will start with being able to transform it into different sword shapes or even mundane objects, but larger and increasingly exotic forms will take longer to master"
1429,,300,Galatine ,HighSchool DxD,Making,"One of the thirteen swords of the Knights of the Round Table, a band of knights led by the Legendary King, King Arthur of Camelot. It was owned by one of the knights of the Round Table and King Arthur's nephew, Sir Gawain. Considered to be the sister sword to both Excalibur and Arondight, Galatine possesses similar characteristics to both as a holy sword as well as a unique blade that can never be nicked."
1430,,300,Analysis,Adventure Time,Making,"You have the skill and insight to make powerful analytical tools. Such tools are capable of showing you the physical makeup of the things you come across, detect magic and alert you to hidden doorways."
1431,,300,Golden Apple Seeds,Xena - Hercules,Making,"You have a handful of apple seeds from a divine tree. A single bite of one of the apples grown from these will cure any mortal ailment, from disease to disfigurement. Consuming a whole apple will grant the eater immortality, becoming ageless and able to recover from horrendous injuries. From a botanical perspective these are no different from ordinary apple seeds, but they cannot be cultivated by mortal creatures (or mortal creations) nor will they grow in a mortal realm. As it was created by Jump-chan, the cosmic warehouse is a suitable place to plant them, but by itself, being a Jumper does not count as being more than mortal."
1432,,300,The Dreamstone,Hellblazer,Making,"A mystic stone imbued with the powers of dream. You gain the power to force waking dreams on others and, if asleep or in the dreamworld, near omnipotence."
1433,,300,Six Realms Staff,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Making,"This Staff wielded by Buddha himself is a Divine Weapon of considerable Power. As the one who reached Enlightenment Buddha can draw power from the six worlds which mankind can reincarnate into, better known as the six realms, with each one having a form of the Bodhisattava Kannon protecting them. A ability you may share with this tool. The power of those six guardian Buddhas is stored within the Staff and may be tapped into with emotions. These powers are rather vast and it would take a truly powerful God to oppose such an Artifact in the hands of one who knows how to use it. However because it relies on emotion, you are unable to truly decide what form to wield. Your emotions do it for you. Five of its known forms are a long, golden halberd, a giant spiked club capable of dealing massive blunt force, nearly knocking out Zerofuku in a single blow, a golden shortsword, a giant golden shield capable of withstanding Zerofuku's giant axe strike without sustaining any damage and a giant scythe with the head of a lion, which can only be attained through pure hatred."
1434,,300,Anothers Volund ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Making,"If you like you can also purchase a Volund that exists in the Series to be yours. Much like Your Volund they wont come with the Valkyrie in them but will still have their abilities. This could give you Jacks Glove, Adams Knuckleduster, etc.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1435,,300,Caster,Outlaw Star,Making,A gun capable of firing prepackaged Tao Magic Spells. Comes with 10 low level shells. In each world you get 5 extra shells per year.
1436,,300,Lines of Death        ,Hellsing,Making,"These gloves are all quite special. A few sets in whatever style you personally prefer, they’re
comfortable to wear, sturdy, stain resistant and rather stylish. They need to be all that, given their true use. The gloves store almost unlimited amounts of hyper-sharp monofilament wire within them, vastly more than could ever reasonably be stored in what appear to be ordinary gloves. Purchase of this item confers the skill to wield them at the same level as Walter, the Angel of Death. A few twitches of the fingers are all that’s needed to fling out the wires and slice men or vampires to bloody ribbons. With this level of control, the wires can easily be used to bind and move things at range without cutting them or even to form barriers that block bullets and other projectiles. Unless you intend to or an enemy forces the issue, you’ll never accidentally cut yourself into pieces either. Sharp as the wires are, enough to slice a modern office building in half or easily pierce vampiric flesh, they can’t cut everything. A werewolf’s tough hide would receive only minor cuts from your wires, unless you get creative with where you cut. "
1437,,300,"Oh My God, It’s DIIIIIIIIIP! ",Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Making,"You’ve got a big, bad, vat of Dip; the combination of chemicals created by Judge Doom to kill Toons deader than dead. This Dip is a special batch, however; it can stand in for any natural, innate weakness that a being has, affecting them when exposed to it as if they had been exposed to their weakness. However, the more powerful the being, the more exposure is needed to affect them; you’d need to drench Superman in the stuff, rather than splashing some in his face, for example. "
1438,,300,Toon Gun,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Making,"Who needs a hawkeye when your bullets fly after your enemies? Sure, instead of being shot they’ll be clubbed, stabbed, or cut by Toon bullets, but isn’t that better anyways?"
1439,,300,ACME-Catalog,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Making,"A catalog of ACME products, ready for delivery to your Warehouse! New products are added periodically, and while they’re unlikely to be useful in a fight they’re usually useful, and VERY fun. "
1440,,300,Moonstone Opal ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Making,"You gain a copy of the legendary Moonstone Opal. The moonstone has two incantations, the Decay incantation and the Black-Rocks incantation. There may be other uses for the Moonstones power to be discovered.

The Decay incantation drains life and magic energy into the wielder and if uncontrolled will kill all living things in proximity from plant life to living beings. This will also change the wielder's hair black and eyes black with green pupils.

The Black-Rocks incantation allows the wielder to gain complete control over the electrified dark earth of the moon. THis allowed for complete control over the generation and manipulation of the black rocks rather than the previous ability to simply generate basic spikes of black rocks at-wil.

The Moonstones abilities lean towards a more destructive bent than the Sundrop as its powers relate to death, ruin, decay, disintegration, nothingness and destruction. It has enough power to render an entire kingdom uninhabitable and devastated.

The Moonstones power is the embodiment of death-force itself."
1441,,300,Sundrop Flower,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Making,"You gain a copy of the legendary Sundrop Flower. The Sundrop has two incantations, the Healing incantation and the Hope incantation. There may be other uses for the Sundrops power to be discovered.

When you sing the Healing incantation you will be healed and can have the flow of time run backwards, de-aging the singer at a visible rate.

The Hope Incantation is a second spell of pure light and hope of the Sundrop Flower. It allows for the wielding of the burning energy of the sun, this provides levitation and flight, offensive blasts, and its full capabilities remain unknown. Causes the wielders eye to glow with the energy of the sun while wielding its light.

The Sundrops main abilities include Decelerated Aging, Longevity, Resurrection, and healing minor or even fatal wounds.

The Sundrops' power is the embodiment of Light and Life itself."
1442,,300,Soulsword,Marvel Magic,Making,"At some point in your past, you utilized a dangerous ritual to manifest your life force, your very soul, before you. Plunging your hand into the manifestation of your being, you withdrew a weapon. What shape this weapon took is up to you, but regardless of its appearance its abilities will remain the same. First among its traits is that it cannot harm mundane matter, simply passing through it as if it wasn't there and leaving no trace of its passage. However, mystical energies and beings will fall before it. Be it a sorcerer or a god, a curse or an enchantment, the weapon will rend it easily. A magical shield would be dispelled with a single swipe, a normally indestructible golem could be easily shattered. This even applies to things that aren't quite ""magic"" as well; dispelling a psychic's control over someone would be as simple as cutting it out of them. And when you have no need of the weapon, it can be banished back into your soul with a simple effort of will – and recalled to your hand just as easily.

You may import another weapon into this to gain these qualities."
1443,,300,Thunderbolt,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Making,"Really, you too? Apparently they’re just letting anyone handle that thing now. You have in your hands a jagged piece of metal identical to the one Zeus holds as a powerful conduit and amplifier to his divine abilities. It channels his electricity in a way much like Mjolnir conducts Thor’s might, and like that hammer returns to its wielder’s hand when summoned and lets the wielder travel interstellar distances rapidly-a rival to that weapon in many ways save it’s lack of owner loyalty. It would be a perfect tool to rule the heavens with it only it could be trusted."
1444,,300,Maw of Zarathos ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Making,"Just as there are gods and mortals who thrive in resplendent light, so too are there monsters and demons who wander the darkness and shadows. Those who are terrifying not from what they can do to the flesh, but because of insights that look past the physical and the myriad of ways it can be used to harm someone. This blood red mouth mask taking the shape of the lower half of a skull is a testament to their power, letting one 'taste' an entity’s soul to learn secrets about them. It can also be used to consume the negative emotions of others within a city block’s area around you, using it as fuel to alter or augment their powers for concerning results while the negativity of the person is drained away. Whether this means they are an emotionless husk for a period of time or simply left with positive emotions for a similar period is up to you."
1445,,300,Brazier of Bom'Galiath,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Making,"There are many sorcerers who explore the cosmos and delve into studies for the sake of. Then there are those who search because there is no such thing as too much power... not while there is more to be had. This brass-colored brazier is an example of that, the opening burning with a flame that greatly augments a sorcerer’s spells to have a longer duration time and power output, being able to turn a small fireball into a roaring inferno the size of a boulder. On its own, it does nothing. It is meant to be a catalyst to improve the magic you wield, and so long as the flame continues to burn it will be a great boon to its wielder."
1446,,300,Eternal Flame,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Making,"Many things are locked within Odin’s precious vault. Things that could shake worlds, or end them entirely. Things that if unleashed without concern or care, could spell certain doom for those unfortunate enough to be caught by the wrath of its wielder... so that’s why we’re just going to sell one such item with a total disregard for your intentions. This peculiar item is a mystic flame which can never be extinguished, due to being the true essence of the fire giant Surtur. As such, the flame has the power to revive the deceased as undead warriors to do your bidding, and can empower fire abilities to some extent. It also has the bonus of accepting any flame you introduce to it, drinking to add them to its own embers. But be warned... the more you add, the more problematic it could be if someone else found it and used it against you."
1447,,300,Asgardian Armory,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 1,Making,"When you have a collection of rare items, dangerous artifacts, or powerful weapons you want to show off... look no further. Gilded in gold and stone, this Warehouse Attachment has plenty of pedestals to place items of your choice up for display to prove your superiority or power over others. As a bonus, this place will continue to grow more resplendent and better reflect the items you place in here and the power you wielded to get them while holding plaques that give tales of their procurement. For an additional +200CP, items you place in here can be summoned to your person upon mentally commanding it while the Armory itself is protected and maintained by three Destroyer Units that are designed in a manner of your choosing."
1448,,300,Asgardian Construction Gear        ,She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Making,"You're a one-man wrecking crew! You now possess four artifacts enchanted with Asgardian magic. The first is a hard-hat to protect your head from even titanic impacts. Next come the pile-driver guantlets, giving you the striking power to sink in anchors or strike through timbers. Third is a crowbar to serve as a supernatural lever arm. Finally comes the flail, perfect for tearing down the old before building the new. Whether you choose to build or destroy, you'll have a big impact on your surroundings."
1449,,300,Custom Mystic Code,Fate,Making,"A very special item indeed, and one of the most powerful in the modern day. You gain a Mystic Code, something that is either the culmination of your magecraft, or made to enhance it even further. You can even choose to copy a canon Mystic Code, such as the blob of Mercury named Volumen Hydragyrum, or perhaps the Tohsaka version of the Azoth Blade. You cannot choose a Noble Phantasm with this. No, you cannot have the Jewel Sword Zelretch or things like it either. The examples provided are the level you may create. "
1450,,300,Experimental Armour,A Certain Magical Index,Making,"A very, very dangerous suit of armour designed to push your magical abilities close to the absolute limit. By creating a connection with your body, it interferes with the normal route of your life force, creating an illusion of the wearer having a special constitution. With the armour on, you can convert much, much larger amounts of life force into magic and create deadly claws comprised of blackish-purple smoke up to ten metres long that cause internal bleeding and weaken enemies on touch. Careful though, if you lose control, hit your body’s natural limit and exhaust your life force in the process, you will immediately perish. Fortunately for you, this is very, very hard to do."
1451,,300,Knight Armour,A Certain Magical Index,Making,"This official model of armour used by the Knights of England transfers magical power from the wearer into the armour, greatly increasing the wearer’s physical capabilities (particularly mobility). This particular set of armour is of masterwork quality, fit for the highest ranking knights. It can take blows like a champ, is pretty much bulletproof, and can shrug off weaker spells. Of course, it isn’t invincible, but it should be good enough for you. As a bonus, if you weren’t a Knight, you could probably pass for one with this. If you were, expect a promotion soon because of this."
1452,,300,Champion Equipment ,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"At this level, more arcane methods of enhancement are often required for equipment- or else more advanced materials are used in their construction- so that each weapon, each piece of armor is suitable for a true hero. As with the above, you may choose to import a weapon and armor into this option, granting both replenishing ammo and the benefits of master craftsmanship mentioned here."
1453,,300,Coat of Many Colors,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A ragged cloak that positively brims with crystal shards. When the wearer kills an enemy, it causes the entire party to gain a small bonus to accuracy and stress resistance that lasts for the entirety of the battle and until the next is completed. Although it’s not as useful for regular dungeoneering, when fighting hordes the cloak is substantially more useful as it stacks benefits."
1454,,300,Harlequin Mask,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A disturbing rendition of a harlequin’s mask, suited for combat; substantially increases the wearer’s health when worn, and relieves a large amount of stress when striking an enemy- showing the inherent sadism that the mask’s design displays. "
1455,,300,Miller’s Pipe,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A pipe made of fragmented, floating wood stuffed with crystal snuff; when the bearer kills an opponent, they heal a small amount of stress and have a good chance of blighting the entire enemy party."
1456,,300,Satchel of Dirty Tricks,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A satchel stuffed full with bombs, poisons, knives, and marbles; increases accuracy slightly, the bearer’s ability to dodge, their chance of poisoning an enemy, and the stress an enemy might feel from being barraged with such a nasty collection of tricks. "
1457,,300,Iron Sights,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"An iron sight meant to be used with a musket; it has the unusual property of increasing both the accuracy and damage of an aimed shot, especially against a marked target where the blow may be even more lethal- even bypassing the protectors of a guarded enemy. "
1458,,300,Vvulf’s Tassel,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A trophy taken from a notorious bandit leader that still lurks in the area. This tassel increases the damage and accuracy of blows made against marked targets, and increases the chance of an especially damaging blow against large enemies. "
1459,,300,Mirror Shield,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A mirror made of extraterrestrial crystal, polished to the point that it reflects light and enemy attacks alike- returning roughly 1/3 of the damage dealt to an enemy if they manage to strike you. It also makes it much easier to dodge and resist stunning effects, as well. "
1460,,300,Ashen Distillation,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A strange draught, derived from the crystals found at the Farmstead. The noxious fumes it gives off strengthens poisons used by the wielder, and enhances healing done to them when mixed with certain herbs; it also tremendously increases their dodging ability. "
1461,,300,Clasp of the Beast,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"An artfully rendered beast’s head made of metal, used to hold one’s chains together. Grants a decent boost to vitality and sturdiness when worn, and stresses out opponents when fighting in close quarters through some curse laid on the metal. "
1462,,300,Non-Euclidean Hilt ,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A sword hilt overgrown with Crystal Shards. It has several unusual properties; increasing the vitality of its wielder, imbuing their attacks with a mild poison, and increasing the chance for stunning effects to work; it also has a small chance of hitting a random foe instead of its intended target, for better or for worse."
1463,,300,Ancestor’s Candle,Darkest Dungeon,Making,"A relic belonging to the Ancestor. Much like the ring and cloak of the sun from earlier, it grants benefits in the light- so long as the light is half-full or more, it will grant increased speed, dexterity, and strength to an even greater extent than those two trinkets. "
1464,,300,Eternal Testimony,Bayonetta,Making,"Caw, caw! Quoth the... wait, what do you mean it's not specifically a raven? Really? Ugh, fine. This little trinket is a bracer accessory shaped like a bird mask, and will restore a small portion of your magic upon fully expending it, allowing for a last ditch attack or a chance to escape. This effect only occurs once every 24 hours, so choose your next action wisely upon activation."
1465,,300,Legend-to-be weapon,Shovel Knight,Making,"You gain a new weapon or shield, or apply it to a weapon or shield you already own. This set will be very well created and will be associated with you by whoever sees it. It will inspire on the battlefield, and, if you're clever, may be used to send messages."
1466,,300,Smith,Shovel Knight,Making,You know how to create the odd weapons and armor that most people seem to use here. Create a shovel more deadly than a sword!
1467,,300,Prima Materia,Generic Alchemist ,Making,"Also known as Quintessence or Chaos, the prima materia is a substance aligned almost exclusively with the element of aether, taking the form of a clay-like substance that seems to be all colors at once and an almost airy texture as it feels nearly weightless. The Prima Materia is able to act as a substitute for almost any substance used in alchemy as it takes on the properties of the substance necessary, though it can only be used to substitute for a single substance in any particular form of alchemy. This can even substitute for exceptionally rare materials or provide a bit of spiritual presence to what is made with it."
1468,,300,Alchemical Armaments(300),Generic Alchemist ,Making,"Alchemy has been known to awaken supernatural qualities in objects before, and this has been weaponized in many cases. This tool is one such example. Be it a weapon, a piece of armor, or something as mundane as a lantern, this armament has been subject to an alchemical treatment that has brought out some supernatural quality.

For 300cp, the alchemy used is one that allows for constant growth, refinement, and change within the object. It becomes able to absorb anything able to make the armament stronger and develops new abilities with each new feature it acquires from what it drinks in. This is especially useful with alchemical oils, which become permanent when applied to alchemical weapons such as this."
1469,,300,Wit's End,League of Legends,Making,"This curious cobalt-blue scimitar has a strange quality about it. When one strikes with this scimitar, they ""steal"" some of the magic resistance from their target- decreasing their enemy's defense against magical attacks, and increasing the wielder's own."
1470,,300,Rylai's Crystal Scepter,League of Legends,Making,"This enchanted staff was once used by a beautiful maiden in another world to defend an ancient, radiant being. Now, it is charged with potent ice magic, imbuing its wielder's spells with piercing cold that slows its targets. Yes, even fire magic."
1471,,300,Righteous Glory,League of Legends,Making,"This golden, winged helm is a symbol of Demacia's might on the battlefield. Not only is it a protective peice of headwear, it uses the ambient magic of the wearer to restore their wounds, and by shouting a battlecry, the Righteous Glory will imbue its wearer with incredible speed for 3 seconds, so long as they advance towards their enemy. After the 3 seconds is up, the speed granted by the Righteous Glory will instead turn into a shockwave that slows nearby enemies. After that, the helm's magic needs an hour and a half to recharge."
1472,,300,Randuin's Omen,League of Legends,Making,"This massive, towering Demacian shield is infused with a crystal of True Ice taken from the Freljord. When the bearer of this shield blocks an attack, Randuin's Omen sends a shock of icy cold back through the weapon and into the assailant, freezing their joints and making further attacks more difficult. The wearer of this shield can also elect to expend its icy magic all at once, creating a shockwave of cold to slow their opponents. After this, the shield requires a minute to recharge."
1473,,300,Phantom Dancer,League of Legends,Making,"These wickedly sharp knives possess a ghostly quality to them, seeming as if they're from a dream. When used as a pair, these knives lend their ethereal nature to their wielder, allowing them to pass through other living beings just as easily as air. The knives themselves possess no physical edge and instead cut the soul, allowing them to pass through armor entirely."
1474,,300,Ohmwrecker,League of Legends,Making,"This ornate staff is tipped with a gleaming crystal, fashioned from a shattered Nexus. The Ohmwrecker possesses powerful disruptive magic, and can be used to very briefly rend magical enchantments inert. For three seconds, all magical equipment on your opponent will fail, and this can even be used against magical fortifications like Turrets. This effect can requires two minutes to recharge once it's used."
1475,,300,Maw of Malmortimus ,League of Legends,Making,"This serrated blade was used by a hero who fought the creatures of the Void, and after being bathed in the blood of so many Void creatures, the sword has gained antimagic properties. Even just wearing this sword on one's waist will passively increase resistance to hostile magic, and when the user's life is in danger, the sword will summon forth a barrier of anti-magic energy that will block all magical attacks for just a few seconds."
1476,,300,Death's Dance,League of Legends,Making,"This red-and gold scimitar holds a powerful enchantment. When its wielder suffers a wound, the wound does not appear instantaneously. Over the course of a few moments, the wound will slowly appear upon their body, along with all the pain that entails. Originally conceived as a torture instrument, this treasure would be used by Berserkers for many generations to rage through a battle without feeling their wounds until the battle is already over."
1477,,300,Dead Man's Plate ,League of Legends,Making,"This simple shoulder plate used to belong to an unknown bilgewater pirate, before it was pried off his corpse- And surprisingly, it's a potent magical artifact. When the wearer runs in one direction, the Dead Man's Plate will build momentum, empowering its wearer to run faster. Any physical attack executed by the wearer will expend all this momentum, stopping the wearer dead in their tracks in  exchange for transfering the kinetic energy of the wearer into their weapon, oftentimes dealing a blow vicious enough to slice a man in two."
1478,,300,The Bloodthirster,League of Legends,Making,"A serrated blade that thirsts eternally for blood, this dangerous weapon instills its wielder with a similar thirst for carnage. Simply having this weapon on your person will heal your wounds whenever you physically wound another living being. If you have no wounds to heal, then instead a translucent, blood-red shield will coalesce around you that absorbs damage. However, this shield dissapates soon after you leave combat."
1479,,300,Athene's Unholy Grail ,League of Legends,Making,"This gold and silver goblet is blessed with unholy healing magic. When you use your magic to harm your enemies, the Grail will steal some of their lifeforce and slowly fill up with blood. When you use magic to heal an ally, the grail will empty itself of blood and empower your healing with the lifeforce you've taken from your enemies, allowing you to combine offensive and defensive magic to great effect."
1480,,300,Ardent Censer,League of Legends,Making,"This silver incense burner is blessed with powerful healing magic. When you light it, the Ardent Censer will release soothing smoke that empowers your healing magic. Not only is your healing magic stronger, but it empowers those you heal, giving them enhanced strength and speed and imbuing their attacks with trailing white smoke that damages their foes."
1481,,300,Turrets,League of Legends,Making,"Stone fortifications imbued with very powerful magic, Turrets are towering stone statues that can obliterate nearly anything with their powerful magical blasts. Turrets come in two variations- Concentrated magic blasts that increase in power with consecutive uses, or a sustained, armor-piercing beam that shreds the protection of its enemies. These fortifications, once built, require no maintenance or power but their own and will attack anyone you deem an enemy, are resistant to physical and magial attack, and can see invisible foes. However, they cannot be repaired once damaged. In addition, Turrets have a very limited range (Around 10 meters) and cannot reliably target enemies outside of that range, and can only target one foe at a time, creating a vulnerability to swarms of expendable enemies. Turrets will prioritize those who harm you or your friends while you're within their area of influence. You may build up to 11 turrets at once- If you build another turret while you still have 11 operational turrets, then the oldest will drain of power and crumble harmlessly. You must supply the resources for creating the turret yourself (Namely, a large supply of stone to craft the statue, and a large gemstone or crystal to shoot the magic out of)."
1482,,300,Armament ,King Arthur ,Making,"A set of three extremely powerful enchanted weapon. They are all attuned to an element of your choosing, something ranging from the classical elements to sound & gravity, or even something like purification or corruption. Whatever you choose these weapons can all emit and absorb whatever element you’ve chosen, and each has a specialization that may affect how it represents it. Examples would be a sword focused on brute force being capable of destroying castle walls with a single hit, a javelin focused on being thrown that releases a torrent of energy when it strikes, or a dagger being focused on stealth making it possible to hide yourself when in your chosen element. You can import any current weapons you have to be upgraded."
1483,,300,Hades’ Vault Coupon(300),Dresden Files,Making,"The Vault of Hades is quite possibly the greatest treasure trove in existence. And now you have access to it, in the form of a single coupon, which can be exchanged for one or more items from the death god’s collections.

For 300 CP you can claim any ‘minor’ artifact that can reasonably be expected to exist in the Dresden Files universe. Even things seen on-camera might have prototype versions you can get, or unauthorized bootleg copies... how exactly this works is between you and Hades, but you can get anything at the level of, say, the Blackstaff, the Judas Noose, Little Chicago, so on and so forth. Nothing world-changing, but an immensely useful, remarkably powerful artifact.

Both levels come with virtually unlimited access to all kinds of precious metals and stones, because of course they do. This is the Vault of Hades."
1484,,300,No Magic Gloves,Frozen,Making,"A pair of well fitted gloves in a colour of your choice. When worn, these two gloves can conceal your powers and prevent them from activating without you will. They also make the powers much easier to control, a good help if you’re trying to train to one day have control of them even without the gloves. If the gloves fall off, their protection will instantly disappear."
1485,,300,Bird Cages,Dark Souls 2,Making,"“You have been bestowed several cages that appear to be made of bronze. Each cage will scale as if by magic to fit that of the beast they are meant to contain, shortly before said beast is ushered or thrown inside. A thoughtless beast held within will become passive and left content to spend eternity within, requiring no food or drink to lay peacefully between its bars. Those who have the capacity for inspecting their own situation, like a member of humanity, are not nearly as affected however.”"
1486,,300,Scythe of Want,Dark Souls 2,Making,"“A malevolent thing rendered from the darker, more visceral, heavier bits of humanity. It is a construct of avarice and desire most great, and now lays in your hands. Aside from simply being a potent weapon with a sharpened blade and infusion of darkness’s might, all others who hold it will slowly find themselves corrupted by greed and desire for something more. This corruption has no effect on you, allowing you to wield it to its full abilities, and making it more a curse than a gift for any stupid enough to take what rightfully belongs to you.”"
1487,,300,Scorching Iron Scepter,Dark Souls 2,Making,"“A miraculous object like the one once found by the old Iron King when his newly acquired kingdom faced near ruin. Although the handle of this scepter is cool to the touch, the other end is perpetually orange hot and scalding, never calming down. Of unknown origins, this relic has the ability to dispense anigh endless stream of molten iron from nothing. With it, an entire kingdom and its army’s equipment could one day be built entirely from the iron provided, providing someone is around to work it that is. If needed, the stream of molten iron can also be an effective deterrent to would be assailants.”"
1488,,300,Dragon Stones,Dark Souls 2,Making,"“Conjoined stones with the power of dragons coursing through them. Tapping into their power allows you to equip Black Dragon Armor, crafted from the scales of an ancient dragon that once terrorized the old gods. It only takes a moment to put the armor on, and another to remove it. It offers great protection to both physical damage and all manner of elemental and magical energies. The armor will fit no matter what shape or size you are, fitting to your form, as it’s applied through esoteric means.”"
1489,,300,Ring of Whispers ,Dark Souls 2,Making,"“An enchanted ring that translates all to the wearer. While wearing it you may understand others, and they may understand you. Even the growls of beasts and monsters can be understood by their intent, though it usually only amounts to ‘hunger’, ‘kill’ or ‘run’. Your ability to perceive the intentions of a being while wearing this ring is greatly amplified. Just because you can communicate doesn’t mean anyone will listen.”"
1490,,300,Mannequin Cache,Dark Souls 2,Making,"“A box, a chest, a box containing chest pieces. This is an odd box that contains a never ending font of highly specific supplies relating to the creation of mannequins. That is to say, mannequins like the ones that protect the bells. You can find various tools dedicated to wood working and tailoring, and an endless supply of small axes, bucklers and diminutive padded armor. You also have a nigh endless supply of common wood. With the proper skills, an endless army of your mannequin compatriots can be made. Or, you could just leave this in the care of others and supply an army with the materials inside.”"
1491,,300,White Sign Soapstone,Dark Souls 2,Making,"“A strange, glowing crystal used by some to inscribe luminous messages upon the ground or other surfaces. You will likely use it for the same. With this soapstone, you may write messages that may be seen between parallel realities. Those in other worlds may interact with your signs, summoning you, the writer, to their reality for a brief time. Should you successfully aid your summoner in whatever problems they face, you are bestowed a unique object called a Token of Fidelity. These may be used on future excursions to heal summoners. Death in another world does not harm the one summoned through the use of this soapstone. This allows it to be used for the purposes of observation as well as altruism.”"
1492,,300,“Lordvessel”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A large stone basin littered with engravings, script of the gods. Not quite the one extended to chosen undead within the world proper, this is something extra special. The Lordvessel acts as a pit, drawing ‘souls’ and similar things alike down into it from the surroundings area, and is able to contain a nigh limitless amount of such things. Those who possess the Lordvessel are able to transport between bonfires and other raging flame. More importantly however, the Lordvessel can blast open doors, locks and barriers by expending souls in a manner inspired by the item in this world. It matters little whether the obstruction is magical or mundane, but the amount of souls required to blast through scales with the scale, power and complexity of thing you’re trying to push past."
1493,,300,“Crown of the Dark Sun”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"Ceremonial crown of Dark Sun Gwyndolin that covers the upper face as well. Blessings and residue of the Dark Sun causes it to greatly empowers all kinds of spells while worn, wards away curses as well. When I say all kinds of spells, I mean all, Miracles, Pyromancy, Sorcery all benefit from Gwyndolin’s Crown. (Special note: For clarification’s sake, this is improved upon from the canon crown, which offers only a marginal magical boost.)"
1494,,300,“Tin Darkmoon Catalyst”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A powerful catalyst from another world, born from the soul of Gwyndolin after he was slain. Contains properties of his sorcery and divinity alike. Those who wield this tin scepter are able to channel their will and faith to fuel powerful sorceries in place of brilliance as is the norm, just as Gwyndolin’s use of the normally heretical art was his birthright. You’ll still need to put the token effort into learning a spell, but your own soul and general intelligence don’t have to play a factor in how good they are as long as you’re casting them with this."
1495,,300,“Old Witch’s Ring”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"A relic of Lost Izalith, an old ring with strange script written on it. When first worn there are no apparent benefits, making it seem like a useless trinket. In truth, the ring serves as a kind of universal translator, allowing you to understand and speak with even those who speak long lost and dead languages without issue."
1496,,300,“Knight of Thorns”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"Although Kirk is feared as an infamous Darkwraith, he seemed to hold allegiance to the Fair Lady. To come closer to this potential ally, distant they may be, there’s this. You receive the equipment of Kirk, allowing you to fight in his likeness. His shield covered in jagged spikes is used to bash and rend enemies. His spike covered sword used to skewer and shred. Most important of all though is his armor, armor that is also covered from head to toe in barbs. While just passable as armor, it sacrifices defense for offense, as bodily contact with your enemies is truly dangerous for them. Every kick, tackle or swipe lacerating their flesh from the numerous spikes."
1497,,300,“Thorolund Talisman”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"Looking like a normal Thorolund Talisman given to high ranking members of the order, this one carries Allfather Lloyd’s blessings, emphasizing its benefits. This talisman causes Miracles cast with it to be incredibly strong, even if you yourself have no faith in them. In fact, your own faith matters little when it comes to casting Miracles with it."
1498,,300,“Logan’s Catalyst”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"The catalyst of the one and only Big Hat Logan, great sorcerer and seeker of knowledge. Originally just a normal, gnarled staff, it was greatly strengthened over time by being wielded by Logan’s skilled hands. When used by a sorcerer of superior intelligence, spells cast with this catalyst become far more powerful compared to others. So wide reaching is its efficacy, that abyssal sorceries will also benefit."
1499,,300,“Green Titanite Slab” ,Dark Souls 1,Making,"Green Titanite, among the rarest materials in these lands, so rare that most will only ever be able to find shards of the stuff. How fortuitous that you have an entire slab. This is a Green Titanite Slab, material relating to the gods, a slab that rejuvenates over time when broken for pieces, or reappears in your warehouse in a few days when used in its entirety. Green Titanite has mystical properties that enable it to be crafted into or used to improve equipment with a wide variety of elemental or magical inclinations, Magic, Divine and Fire explicitly."
1500,,300,Sakura Droplet ,Bloodborne,Making,"A small pink crystal that forms when the connection between a Divine Heir and an Oathbound is severed. If you have the Dragon’s Heritage, you can use this to increase the amount of resurrective you can hold at once so you can resurrect one more time. You can also instead use this on someone who was bestowed the blood to do the same. This can be purchased multiple times.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1501,,300,Blood Artisan ,Bloodborne,Making,"“When the Healing Church began to espouse the power of their sacred blood, it replaced many things in the hearts, bodies, and minds of the inhabitants. Medicine is a given, but are you aware of how blood can be used for munitions, or crafting material? Yes, you very much are. 

Although only passingly skilled, you can still test blood for its validity to fill curative Blood Vials, mix it with mercury to create lethal Quicksilver Bullets, or construct small Blood Stones that are more resilient than steel for the sake of crafting. Using the principles of blood craftsmanship, you can grow from here."
1502,,300,Blood Artisan(Plus),Bloodborne,Making,"If feeling discontent with your current level, pay twice the price you originally paid for Blood Artisan to upgrade it to ‘Plus.’ This gives greater proficiency in your craft, allowing you to construct larger Blood Stones, and the more supernatural Blood Gems. 

When slotted into objects, they can convey unique effects, such as bathing it in flame, or making it bane to specific beings. No matter how skilled, or what you’re making, the products of your efforts still rely on good blood to make the best products. Shouldn’t be in any short supply here though.”

Requires Blood Artisan(Bloodborne) to Purchase"
1503,,300,Soulbrandt,Demon's Souls,Making,The soul-rending blade passed down by the Boletarian Royal Family. Favored by Old King Allant due to its power increasing the more demonic the user became. Forms a matching set with Demonbrandt.
1504,,300,Demonbrandt,Demon's Souls,Making,The demon-rending blade that has been passed down through Boletaria’s Royal Family for generations. It is particularly effective against demons and forms a matching set with Soulbrandt.
1505,,300,Stone of Ephemeral Eyes,Demon's Souls,Making,Can only be used in Soul form and when used it allows you to regain your body. Outside of this jump it allows you to cheat death once before crumbling away and is lost.
1506,,300,Inverted Statue of Radagon,Elden Ring,Making,"There are all manner of gates, seals, barriers and blockades in this world, and no one key can fit all their locks. But...what if there was? This small object resembles an upside-down depiction of the red-haired champion Radagon. Hold it near any door, any gate, and with an effort of focus you can unlock it without fail. Do note that this effect works only on barriers built primarily by human hands that use artificial locking mechanisms or mortal magic. The barriers created by demigods or natural obstacles such as the Erdtree’s wall of brambles will not yield to its power. Interestingly, when you flip it upside-down the statuette transforms into a depiction of Marika-complete with gold hair. In both cases, the statuette’s face seems fixed in stress, as if labouring under a lifelong solemn burden. Or enduring a gnawing curse from which there is no escape."
1507,,300,Godly Garb ,Elden Ring,Making,"If nothing else the demigods and those close to them know how to dress sharp-and how to complement their formidable prowess with worn enchanted items. With this you have two options: A faithful recreation of the armour worn by one close to the divine or akin to them-be it Blaidd’s sturdy armour or the heavy plate worn by General Radahn, including their headgear. Resized to fit you, if necessary. Alternatively you can purchase a set of clothing that suits and empowers your capabilities and nature from based on options chosen from this jump-including being fitted to you. It will always be commensurate in quality to your own status-and is guaranteed to be both comfortable, and stylish.

This item can be repurchased, in defiance of the normal limitations.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1508,,300,Goblin Made Sword,Harry Potter,Making,An immensely sharp sword. Imbibes that which makes it stronger (Basilisk venom etc.)
1509,,300,Potion Reagents,Harry Potter,Making,A small case with compartments that has a replenishing store of a range of potion reagents. Such reagents replenish once every two weeks and come in reasonable quantities. Does not contain any extremely rare ingredients.
1510,,300,Moste Potente Potions,Harry Potter,Making,"You have an intrinsic grasp of potion making and will find both the technique, the principles and the theory unusually easy to grasp. You are not likely to get any potion wrong regardless of the difficulty involved and you are likely to come up with innovative, better ways to brew potions with new materials."
1511,,300,Wandlore,Harry Potter,Making,You have a great knowledge of wandlore and practical skill at wand making. You can make decent wands out of imperfect woods and unconventional cores. You may use nearly any magical part of magical creatures as cores with varying success. Unconventional wands with powerfully magical cores are potentially powerful but erratic and extremely dangerous.
1512,,300,The Grimhold,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Making,"Artifact shaped like a nesting doll, capable of perfectly containing anything sealed inside of it-provided it can be subdued beforehand, but once locked inside, it is a perfect, inescapable prison. After the first layer is closed, more and more people can be added onto the layers of the nesting doll, each also strengthening the protections on the innermost layer. While one layer might be easily breached by a novice or by accident, the more layers that have to be opened to get to the center, the more and more skilled and powerful the jailbreaker will have to be."
1513,,300,Soul Catcher,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making,"The name says it all, really. This is a device designed by the Necromancers to trap and destroy souls. Only one soul can be trapped per Soul Catcher. Any being trapped within this device cannot escape from the inside, but can be released by someone with access to the Soul Catcher from the outside. If your Soul Catcher is destroyed, another will appear in your Warehouse after a week."
1514,,300,Playing with Dolls,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making,"Ever have the ninja pushed for more tricks and tools to keep them ahead of their foes. It’s only
logical that their desires for a greater advantage over the raw power of the samurai would lead to
such advancements in technology. The Danzou puppet is the culmination of incredible science and
magic coming together as one, creating an artificial lifeform filled with the experiences and skills of
many great ninja, equipped with advanced technology and powerful magic. It’s also something you
have the knowledge to make and more besides. 

You have the training in various disciplines to create advanced puppet bodies like this, as well as the
weaponry and technology that Danzou makes use of in that body, even things like missiles. This
covers both ordinary scientific knowledge and occult magecraft focused towards artificial bodies like
this. It’s quite possible to turn an existing person into one of these puppets, albeit more difficult than
making it from scratch. One of the more impressive parts of this field is the techniques that allow for
the recording and uploading of knowledge or skills that people possess. With a willing or
incapacitated subject, you know how to examine what they know and copy it over to another person. 

Your studies in this field have also helped you realise how to capably combine magic with technology, creating things where the two work together to support and enhance both sides’ effects instead of
interfering. While you can’t alter the basic metaphysics behind things such as mystery, you do know
how to work it to your advantage. "
1515,,300,Magic Weapon,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Making,"Too many to count and certainly too many to spend all this space on. A magic weapon is a
cornerstone of heroic myth, of kingly legends, of holy wars and even in the stories told by the artists. This option provides a customisable method to create your own magical weapon or to take hold of
an existing one. The physical shape of the weapon and it’s appearance can be chosen within reason
for free and all the blades will be sturdier, sharper or more effective than any normal steel weapon. Be it a sword, a lance, a whip, a shield or something as strange as a helmet or pair of boots.

300CP is the realm of royal weapons, those that stories centre around. The holy blade Durandal, said
to be unbreakable and peerless in both cutting and the strength of it’s holy element. Joyeuse, a
weapon that almost matches Durandal in a melee but can also fire terrifyingly powerful beams of
holy power on command. Perhaps even a gigantic robotic armour, covered in magical firearms and
with the strength to slay all manner of giant monsters. You can be sure that purchases here would
be well known as legendary weapons."
1516,,300,Cane of Somaria ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Making,"A simple red cane with a hook at the end, not too dissimilar to a shepherd's crook. When swung and activated with the tiniest amount of magical energy, the cane creates an orange block that is about 3 feet on all sides. It’s decently sturdy, but will pop into nonexistence given a solid whack from you or from a foe. Still, the ability to summon a simple block is surprisingly useful when you’re dealing with Hyrule’s puzzle obsession. In combat it’s not much use beyond being a stalling tactics, but it also comes with a Heart Ring, which grants you a very minor form of regeneration. Good for staying alive, no?"
1517,,300,Homunculus ,Valkyrie Profile,Making,"The Alchemically created body of a half-elf, freshly vat grown and ready for inhabitation by a soul. If you so choose, the Homunculus may resemble an unblemished, healthy version of your current body, a younger version of the same (they do have to grow up, after all), or the nondescript body of an average person of either sex. While it may not seem like much of a boon, the elven blood of the Homunculus is shared with the very gods themselves. A mortal soul inside of half-elf has the agelessness of the Aesir and every bit of potential power as they, with time and training becoming indistinguishable from them in strength. Even the gods (including Valkyries) would benefit from a half-elf body, as the Homunculus' human blood has the potential for limitless growth, breaking their naturally static power and body and allowing them grow beyond them. This property is no doubt beneficial to the uppity mortal as well in their quest to match the gods. It is Odin's most closely guarded secret that he is actually a naturally born half-elf, and was one of the weakest gods before his human side allowed him to grow stronger and surpass all the other Aesir, after all.

You can choose to either receive the Homunculus in its sealed tube, which would allow you to keep it until needed, though you won't necessarily possess the knowledge a soul, yours or another's, into it, or instead start your ten years already inhabiting it. In this case, you would have been placed in this body during your background, which may come with a host of issues if someone else was behind it and if anyone finds out. If you take this along with Prophetess, you may choose to be a born Half-Vanir instead, which essentially functions the same as a Half-Elf. This is your natural body that you start in, no transfer required, but you will have to think of an excuse for why you've suddenly appeared in the current era so long after your mother was decapitated.
"
1518,,300,Shadow Sewing ,Peter Pan,Making,"You are an expert sewer of all things, and even a shadow is but a simple task. If you have a detached shadow in your possession, you can sew it onto whoever you please wit minimal difficulty. You may sew it back on whoever lost it, or perhaps you decided to sew it on someone else – so many possibilities. You could even try sewing it onto a cloth of some sort. Whenever someone's shadow is sewed onto a new person, the new person now owns the shadow both physically and spiritually. Also, you can sew on the shadow extra tight, such that it can only be removed under certain conditions (such as with Shadow Biter); therefore, with that adjustment the attached shadow will always be fully visible and in full-body no matter the position or absence of light, though this may sometimes be a detriment. You can also sew different shadows together (even if they're still attached to people or things); unless said individuals found a way to detach themselves from their shadows, they would therefore be limited in their movements due to how their shadows are linked. You could even physically alter shadows, such as sew pockets into shadows for storing things, or use an iron to make a shadow hard and stiff, or “wash” them. If you also took Mother Knows Best, you may eventually learn to magically apply your wonderful sewing skills to other unlikely things, such as reflections, giggles, and clouds. See Shadow Biter and My Shadow for further uses.
"
1519,,300,Piratical Poisoner ,Peter Pan,Making,"You know how to use all sorts of poisons, how to mix them with different things such as weapons and drink, and how to conceal them from detection by their unsuspecting users. Plus, you can make poison literally spawn from your body’s secretions such as tears without being harmed unless you specifically want the poison to hurt you. This also lets you transfer poison to your tool/weapon hand if you took By Hook or Crook."
1520,,300,Saber of Long John Pepper ,Peter Pan,Making,"The sword of Long John Pepper, notorious as the worst (competently) pirate in all history. The sword has a minor mystical effect, but not one suitable for a pirate: it can make begonias and other flowers sprout when it touches the ground. Moreover, the sword constantly generates a cursed field that inhibits the luck of all pirate/thief-related abilities of those in the area.
"
1521,,300,Sands of Zephrite ,Peter Pan,Making,"A bag full of mystical sands of various colors. By releasing them in different combinations, you can call upon key winds and harness their power. Moreover, the wind can connect itself to other natural phenomena to bring rains, sandstorms, and hail among others. Just be careful not to get too carried away, or the crazed winds might carry you away; Tribal Magic gives you greater control over the weather. If you took Secret of the Land, you can communicate with the weather to learn info from it like you can from the land."
1522,,300,Paint to Life ,Ib,Making,"It's said that spirits dwell in objects into which people put their feelings, and the same applies for artwork. You now have the ability to give life to paintings, statues, and other artworks. Even a crayon sketch of a sun would give off heat and light as if it were real. There are but a couple of catches. First, you can only animate works that you made by your own hands. Second, they cannot be of people who exist in the real world; in the case of inanimate things such as moons and stars, or things that have multiple copies such as a species of snake, they can still be created. Third, to give life to an artwork you must sacrifice a small but vital piece of your own life. It is possible to recover in time, but overdoing things may put you at the edge of death. Although you can create works that have magical powers, to fully use their magic in the real world they would require continual magic support from you. Also, the act of creation does not give you control over the animated works, and they retain independent wills, though they will generally respect their maker.
"
1523,,300,Fairy Bargain ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"You are able to make magic trades with people, offering favors, blessings, and treasure in exchange for taking something precious from them in return. If you offer something incredibly powerful or valuable, you can request something strong in turn, even something abstract like their boredom, success, shadow, charm, or bad luck. The person you are trading with must willingly accept the exchange at the time; however, you need not be forthright about all the details of the arrangement, and you are not required to refund them later if they change their mind. See Fairy Trades section for more details on potential trades you could get others to give away to you.
"
1524,,300,Mystic Charms ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"You can create various magic charms that protect against magic forces/beings to varying degrees. You are also capable of divination rituals to discover hidden secrets, such as the toad bone ritual (you use frog or toad bones to either find what other people are seeking or see the unseen). Or you could try burning a list of names or locations and seeing which one burns brightest or least. There’s also scrying by looking into a pool and seeing an answer to your question or the guilty party in the reflection. In addition, you know a spell to resurrect the dead, but it can only be done twice a year.
"
1525,,300,Ingredients’ True Potential ,Wonderland No More,Making,"There are many magical foods throughout Wonderland, but many of them will not show their full potential unless used by a Gourmancer. You now have a natural knack for detecting potential ingredients (this includes living beings as well) you can use and getting a general idea of both their tastiness and what powers they might offer. If said ingredients have potential uses that wouldn’t be normally available, you have greater luck at unlocking their full potential. This perk applies not just to cooking ingredients but also ingredients for other things like spells and alchemy.
"
1526,,300,Bell-Crafting ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Making,"Bells are important in the ratkin religion of their Horned God, although what importance they are to the Horned Rat is unknown. The fall of Kavzar was heralded with a horned bell, the Screaming Bells are the greatest war-machines to deliver the rat god’s wrath upon the surface world, every seer’s tool of magic bears a tiny bell carefully attached, and the clanging and tinkling of bells seem to be a pleasant tune to skaven ears. So it helps for the Grey Seers, the direct heralds of the verminous deity’s will, to learn how to work such bells quickly.

You have a small pack, with all the tools, a miniature smelter that can reach blazing temperatures from the warpstone core within, molds for formation, and the instructions on how to make a miraculous variety of bells both magical and mundane. Any metal can be used, and the enchanted bells can have a variety of uses: Some may attract rats and vermin to the clanging call, and the bell-ringer may give them simple commands as long as they hold it. Others may deafen the sound within a room so long as the chime echoes, allowing a rat to do their filthy work without worry of being detected. Some may emit an amplified clap that can shatter glass, dent stone, and even rupture the ear-drums of lesser foes. The paints, chisels, and carving tools that come with the kit can be used for any sort of bell-related project - even for the proper enchantment of a Screaming Bell.
"
1527,,300,Siderite Rod ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Making,"Mages have long known of the process of perfecting metals, passing mundane metal into and out of twilight dozens of times until nothing remains but pure platonic metal. While doing so strips away roughly 90% of the original material, what remains is truly perfect. Siderite is the refined form of iron, gleaming a bit more brightly than mundane iron or steel, but it is more ordinary in appearance when compared with other perfected metals. Immensely durable, it can bend and twist and resume its shape without signs of fatigue or distress. It can also be forged to an edge that will never dull and is strong enough to cut steel or even diamond. This 2­-foot long 1­-inch around rod of siderite is an excellent example of this, perfect for use as a mystical tool, bargaining chip, or perhaps be crafted by a skilled Awakened smith into much, MUCH more."
1528,,300,Spray-­on-­magic ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Making,"A unique practice of those who dabble in the matter arcana is the ability to store their magic in physical objects for short­-term use. A rather common application of this involves storing said magic in an easily dispensable if single-­use form such as with a liquid, draught, pill or in this case, a spray. You have a collection of five spray cans, each one mystically attuned to carry a single spell. You may cast any spell you know into the cans and release them at a later date, with the full effect of the spell being delivered upon a single target that was successfully hit by the spray."
1529,,300,A Collection of Magic Rings ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Making,"Well now. Have you been on a collectathon? Bump into Maple the witch and steal a few from her? Growing some Gasha Trees? Because you’ve got quite a pile of rings here. Almost two dozen if I had to eyeball it. That’s going to cost you a pretty rupee to get identified. Unless... You could maybe do it yourself? Nah, that’s ridiculous. Telling what’s cursed and what’s not is something you’re going to need a professional for. Well, anyways, I hope you have fun with these. Some of them are quite useful. Though to be fair, some of them do nothing at all but look pretty.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what.
"
1530,,300,Restoring Legends,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Making ,"As a Picori you bear the blood of the legendary smiths and craftsmen who forged legends like the Picori Blade. Your skill with craftsmanship is innately high and your growth is much faster than it usually would be, but where you truly shine is in the creation and restoration of magical arms and armor. If you were given the shards of the Picori Blade and a place to forge the legend you could restore it with a little time, though it would need to undergo the rites that magically empowered it once more, and this talent for magical craftsmanship extends to all of your abilities. If you have this ability as well as a way to tap into an element, such as a Mage’s Magic, you could craft items that use that in element or combination of elements in unique ways, such as the Gust Jar, and if you somehow had access to the Light Force you may even be able to produce the fabled Light Arrows, which scorch away all evils in their passing and can be invested with energy from the Light Force readily."
1531,,350,Altar of Sacrifice,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making ,"This is a structure about the size of a room, such as a small step pyramid, a large raised altar surrounded by raised stone, or another non-mobile ritual site of your choice. It can be attached to another property you possess, to your warehouse, or appear freestanding in the jump. Regardless of where this structure appears it is a place of power, designed to amplify magical rituals and to offer up sacrifices to the gods. While its effect on magic is noticeable, it’s relatively slight on its own, but if the ritual involves the sacrifice of living creatures - especially humans and other sapients - you will find the power increasing significantly proportionately to the value of the sacrifice; a chicken won’t do much, the chosen princess of a bloodline of power though might give a 2 bit wizard the power to conquer the known world and rule it for generations, and if you can’t find that sort of quality enough quantity might suffice instead. It is also a sacred altar, and can be used to attract the attention of gods and higher powers through blood sacrifice, beseeching them for their favor; the more blood thirsty or violent divinities contacted this way will also be a little more well inclined to you than they otherwise would be, perhaps though it’s best not to contact ones that frown on blood sacrifice however. They may not be so pleased.

If purchased by a jumper they may designate other individuals to be able to tap into this altar’s powers and effects, though if purchased by a companion it will work for them and only them."
1532,,400,Evolutionary Tadpole,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"For 400 CP, you get an astral-touched tadpole that can break the limits of evolution
that is placed upon a person. It basically turns someone into a half-illithid. Transformed person
basically gets a purchase of a 200 CP version of transcendence perk, with all of its benefits.
Transformation is permanent but can be reversed by using this tadpole on the same person
again. If the transformation is reversed back, all of the powers gained from being a half-illithid
along disappears until they choose to transform again. Purchases that was made with TP gained
from transcendence cannot be changed, when you transform again.
For 600 CP, you get a supreme tadpole that is capable of turning a person full illithid
as if they have purchased 400 CP version of transcendence perk. Same rules apply as above for
transformation and reversal of it.
Both versions of this tadpole can only be used to cause ten transformations within a
single jump, reversals and re-transforming people who have transformed before doesn’t count
against this number. Counter resets when you go into a new jump.
You might wonder, why would I pay more for this item instead of getting the perk for a
lesser price. One: you get the option to nope back out of being an illithid. Two: you relax your
budget for perk purchases, while you can pay for this item with an item stipend. Three and the
most important part: multiple people can use this item as many times as they want (within jump
limit of course), effectively giving you a capability to create an illithid fighting force with
enough time."
1533,,400,Soulcage,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"You get a solid circular stone at the size of your palm that has some intricate magical
engravings and runes carved onto it. You can place this magical stone on a flat ground, upon
which the stone melds into the ground and becomes a magical ritual circle that is couple of
meters wide. You can make the circle disappear and retrieve the stone at any time you want,
unless someone is standing in the circle.
You can trap living beings within this circle with a brief ritual that takes about three to
six seconds depending on your skill in magic. To trap the said being in this circle, the target has
to stay within the circle for the whole period of the ritual. Once trapped, all of the target’s
powers become suppressed and they become as weak as a normal young human teenager. Also,
the target is unable to leave the grounds of the circle as they become restrained by magical
hands upon doing so. The circle cannot be broken by anyone inside of it, but if it sustains any
damage from outside, while a being is completely trapped within it, it turns back into its stone
form and reappears in your hand.
You draw out a single natural or supernatural power, or a skill from the trapped target.
There almost limitless possibilities for you to draw upon. You could tap into an aassimar’s
immortality, an archmage’s spellcasting prowess, or a devil’s cunning. The only limit is your
imagination. You gain the ability to use the stolen power as if you have possessed it since your
birth. You display the same level of proficiency as the trapped being, if it’s a technique or ability
that is being tapped into. You can only tap a single power at a time and must give up the previous
power before drawing another."
1534,,400,Auntie's Boon,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"You get a disgusting patch of shriveled greenish skin covered by rough dark green hair.
This is a boon granted by a powerful hag. You don’t need to consume this one though, unlike
the one that is in the game.
You and any person you allow can attune to this boon for a minute get a boost to their
capabilities. Anyone who uses this boon picks a physical or a mental stat, those being: strength,
dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma. This stat is boosted to its maximum
as if the user have made purchase of All 20s perk.
This perk can only be used by each person once in their lifetime and anytime someone
attempts to use this item a second time for themselves, the attunement process fails, and this
item becomes a simple disgusting bodily refuse. This item also has a cooldown of a year
between each usage."
1535,,400,Runepowder,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"What you have before you is a literal recipe for complete destruction. You have the only
intact recipe for infusing regular smokepowder with the right array of arcane enchantments to
create runepowder in the form of a set of blueprints. Its creation process is intricate and tiring,
but if you follow the blueprints perfectly, there is no way you can fail. Your only restraints
become time and resources.
Runepowder is a magical version of the original smokepowder, but its destructive
potency is increased by a manifold. A vial of rune powder has more than double the explosive
power of a barrel of smokepowder. Just imagine what a barrel of this stuff can do.
Speaking of barrels, you get a barrel filled with this powder once a jump. You also get
a weekly supply of a single barrel of smokepowder. Refining a vial of runepowder takes about
a half a barrel of smokepowder and a great investment of magical energy. This energy can either
be provided by you or if you are incapable of providing this magical energy, adding half of a
smokepowder barrel more can be used as compensation for the lack of magic.
Barrels will be delivered either to your campsite or your cosmic warehouse."
1536,,400,Infernal Engineer,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"You’ve ever been to Elturel during the Descent? No? Well, you certainly look like
you’ve spent some time in the hells, forced to work on their infernal machinery and metals. You
are a master blacksmith jumper. Forging flaming weapons that can cut through solid wood like
butter, crafting armors that can take a beating from an ogre’s greatclub... these are all trivial
applications of your work. With a good enough of forge and a decent array of materials, there
is nothing you can’t achieve in the art of smithing.
But all these things are just a single aspect of your talent. Where your genius truly lies
is the knowledge to work with the infamous infernal iron. You know the secret to infuse infernal
essence (basically damned souls) to regular iron to create infernal iron. This also means that
you can make soul coins, which are pieces of metal that can store souls for later use. With
practice, you could forge weapons of untold power and even create helldusk armors sets with
proper enchantments placed on them.
Additionally, this ability also grants you to create and maintain any kind of infernal
machinery. As long as you had a bit of time to study either the blueprint or the machine itself,
you can work on it with as easily as a true fiendish engineer. This includes infernal siege
devices, war machines and engines too. Also, your skill in tinkering and engineering are raised
to match the gnomes of the Ironhand Clan and Gondians too. With all these talents combined,
you become a truly prodigious smith and tinker that is capable of fixing, maintaining and
improving almost anything, when it comes to machinery. Perhaps one day you could even fix a
modified infernal engine repurposed as a heart that isn’t suited for working in the material plane
and will explode, if it has ever been away from the hells for too long... ‘wink wink’."
1537,,400,Alchemist Supreme,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Making,"You are a natural prodigy of all things related to alchemy, while having the work
experience of decades old savant of the craft. You can brew potions, elixirs, poisons and oils of
endless varieties. They could mend the flesh and knit the wound, grant anyone who drinks them
strength of a giant for a time, or even grant the ability to read people’s minds. These are just
few examples of the sheer utility these potions and elixirs provide to you and your allies as they
could have even more exotic effects that can be achieved with the appropriate time and resource
investment. You’ll find that you can brew any potion and elixir that you have the complete
recipe for perfectly each time without any error during the process. Oh, and you are a genius at
creating more recipes and completing unfinished ones too. Few things on top of that: they take
half the resources to craft, half the time required for the brew time, and their potency are
increased by %25.
Your genius in alchemy not only is measured in brews but also you are able to create
various grenades that have high destructive potential and utility as well. Your skill with creating
them makes them perfectly safe during assembly processes. With a proper recipe and materials,
you can even create enchanted bombs like runepowder too. But you at least need a sample to
analyze and some guidelines for starters.
This also makes you an expert on gathering resources for alchemy needs. You can easily
search for resources both in wild and urban environments. You even get luckier too, often
encountering these alchemical supplies on your adventures. Turning these raw resources into
suitable forms for alchemy takes almost no time for you."
1538,,400,Mask of Gnose,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Making,"A powerful and
ancient artifact of undetermined origin, the Mask of Gnose looks to
be a carnival mask at first glance. However, if worn when bearing a
treasured possession of another being, it merges the wearer’s
appearance with theirs. Not only that, but it permits the wearer to
copy about half of that being’s skills as related to the object (so a
sword would add half their combat abilities to your own, while a
paintbrush would steal their art skills), though only to the limit of
matching the original. Removing it requires that the wearer hold that
object while removing the mask, or that the original owner of that
object touch it once more."
1539,,400,Jumper's Extract,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"The Demon’s Extract is a special type of Teigu, created
by extracting the lifeblood of a Danger Beast and formed into a liquid that has the
capacity of granting its power to the one that consumes it. The methods involved in
the creation of such an artifact is possibly even more advanced than the ones used
on the other Teigu, however, you managed to produce enough of a similar extract to
fill a chalice but using your own power instead of another Danger Beast. You can
choose any one of your perks, from your weakest ones until that very overpowered
one I know you’re thinking about, to be contained in this extract that then can be
granted to others that drink at least one glass of it.
Unfortunately, there are certain limitations, as the more expensive the perk is, the
more violent urges, more corruption and more insanity inducing effects the extract
will cause on those who drink it. Perks that cost 300 CP or less can safely be
consumed by most people, while those that cost 800/1000 CP or more would already
require someone with a mind as strong as Esdeath’s to resist its effects. Finally,
perks that cost 2000 CP or more would require the strongest minds and wills to be
safely tamed. Even if someone has some capacity to nullify the insanity/corruption
caused by the extract, if they lack the spiritual/mental strength and willpower needed
to tame it, they’ll find that the power they receive will be greatly or even unusable at
all if the difference is too great.
Lastly, once per decade or jump (whichever comes sooner), the chalice will be
refilled and you’ll have the chance to switch which perk the extract will contain. A last
piece of advice is to safely guard the chalice as anyone that drinks its content can
receive the perk contained on it if they fulfill the requirements."
1540,,400,Egg of the Beast,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"During your journey, you’ve found the giant egg of a
Super Class Danger Beast, of a kind of your choice, that remains hibernating in a
stasis-like state, without requiring any source of sustenance and being unaffected by
aging while as an fragile embryo, waiting for the right conditions to be born, that is,
being completely covered by blood from any source. When the condition is fulfilled
and the egg hatch, it’ll imprint in the first person they see as their parent and will
obey all of their orders, having enough intelligence to even understand mildly
complex commands, as well as quickly maturing in a few hours and becoming a
Danger Beast on par with a living Death Tagool, a beast whose even its reanimated
skeleton already had enough destructive power to change the terrain of a valley with
an single energy shot. This Danger Beast will count as your follower and you’ll
receive a new egg after a decade the previous one hatched."
1541,,400,Danger Beast Doses,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"You receive a small container filled with ten
syringes, each one of them filled with a red, drug-like liquid. This liquid is a serum
created by Dr. Stylish as his second Trump Card to be used when cornered by his
enemies. When one of the syringes is fully injected into someone, it mutates their
body, causing it to begin to grow lumps until turning them into a 20-foot-tall humanoid
Special Class Danger Beast, however, the user will still keep their original human
body glued to the beast's head where they can control them like a “mecha robot”.
Depending on the user’s compatibility, the resulting Danger Beast might be weaker
or stronger, to the point that it might even have the ability to grow stronger and
evolve by devouring, like the case of Dr. Stylish when he used the serum on himself.
The serum will still work if only partially injected, however the result will not only be
inferior in power but also considerably more unstable and dangerous to the user
themself, so a syringe will fully work in just one person. The syringes and their
container are replenished yearly if used, destroyed or lost."
1542,,400,Imperial Metal Supply,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"During the creation of the Teigu, several high
quality materials were gathered by the Empire, including a rare alchemical super
steel called Orichalcum from which many weapon and armor-type Teigu were forged
from. From what is known, Orichalcum is an extremely resistant to the point that
even a regular sword with a blade made of it can effectively match most Teigu when
it comes to durability, as well as being malleable and adaptable enough to be used
on the most varied ways, with this property being the reason of why it was the
perfect material to produce the Teigu as it’s perfectly compatible with the process of
combining it with biological material taken from Danger Beasts. Furthermore, the
weapons forged from it are capable of staying in pristine condition, with blades
staying sharp as if they were new, even after being constantly used for an entire
millennia. You receive your own self-replenishing supply of pure Orichalcum, totaling
about a few tons of the metal in the form of several ingots that you can use for
anything you want to."
1543,,400,Judgement of the Ten Heavenly Kings,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"In order to enhance Seryu’s
combat potential without needing to focus only on her Teigu, Dr. Stylish created a set
of ten powerful weapons, whose power nearly matches that of a Teigu despite being
far more mundane in function and can be easily wielded no matter how comically
large they are, as long as you’re strong enough to hold them. The ten weapons, or
Numbers, how they’re named, are:
● Number 1 - Shinkou's Ball of Justice: A large flail that can take down a
large number of opponents with ease.
● Number 2: Four missile turrets that usually stay attached to the user’s back
and can be used to send out a volley of missiles.
● Number 3 - Sung Dynasty Blade: A large sword with a giant blade attached
directly to its user’s arm.
● Number 4: An unnamed grappling hook gun made to improve the user’s
mobility.
● Number 5 - Enma's Spear of Justice: A large drill-like spear that is capable
of mowing down a large number of opponents. It can be launched to be used
as a long-range attack. It can also explode if necessary.
● Number 6: An unnamed giant armor-reinforced missile that explodes on
impact.
● Number 7 - Taizan's Cannon of Justice: A long-ranged anti-tank rifle with
high destructive power.
● Number 8: A gauntlet with a built-in missile launcher.
● Number 9 - Justice City Detector: The only of the Ten Kings that lacks a
combat utility, being a gauntlet with a sensor system in the form of a radar that
detects living beings in a certain area.
● Final number - Chakravartin Furnace of Five Hells: A last resort in the
event of the user’s defeat, The Final King is an explosive device that serves
as a last resort in the event of the user’s defeat, with destructive power so
intense that it can lay waste to the surrounding environment such as a small
valley. Normally, this device would be implanted inside the user’s head,
however, your version of it will be installed on one of the other nine weapons
of your choice.
You can also use multiple weapons at once, such as Seryu’s Justice Volley Fire
technique that combines the Numbers 2, 7 and 8 for example. Optionally, these ten
weapons may be also connected to the cybernetic limbs in your body you might have
when you’re wielding them, with them being enhanced to the point that these
weapons are no more strenuous to use than regular weapons."
1544,,400,Advanced Drugs,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"After Akame abandoned the Empire and joined Night
Raid, the scientists in charge of developing the Group of Terror’s performance
enhancing drugs were able to successfully create a more advanced and more potent
version of their doping pills, with effects that are a hundred times more powerful than
their original version, capable of enhancing the user’s body to the point that their
physical prowess would temporarily match that of the Elite Seven, as well as making
that the only sure way to kill them would be to do something so extreme as to sever
their head or crush their heart, as any other damage would still be there but any non
fatal amounts won’t stop you functioning. However, despite being far more powerful,
the side effects of these advanced drugs are even worse than their previous
version’s effects and their enhancements just last for a few minutes before wearing
off. However, in a manner similar to Performance Enhancing Drugs, even if you
aren’t related to the Dark Squad, you managed to acquire a small bag containing a
few dozens of pills (or candies) filled with these advanced enhancement drugs that
will be replenished overtime if consumed at a rate of three pills per day, however, if
the bag is lost or destroyed, you’ll receive a new one after a month."
1545,,400,Ritual Pigments,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Making,"A selection of paint pigments in more than a dozen colours, each colour conveniently prepared from precise ingredients and according to very specific methods needed to use paintings as a ritual for conducting sympathetic magic – no need to wait for certain phases of the moon, nor collect certain weeds in a container made of a human skull. Put simply, what you paint in the painting can be imposed onto reality, or what is in reality can be transferred into the painting. There are enough pigments here to do one painting which affects a room-sized area, allowing goods to be conjured, things within the area to be altered or removed, or to turn the painting itself into a room-sized pocket dimension. You could paint a painting of an empty room and add in a pile of silver to the painting, to sympathetically conjure a pile of silver into the real room, or you could paint a picture of the room without its door, which will magically remove the door from the wall of the real room, preventing all access. Unfortunately painting ephemeral things – souls, magic, auras, power – still does not make them appear in reality. You could also use these paints to “move” something out of reality and into the painting, such as valuables or a prisoner, concealing or trapping them inside it. If you should possess Voidheart and Endless Black, you will find the scale of this power magnified – you could create an entire world of phantasy within the painting to enter, or call forth from your canvas a change to affect an entire city."
1546,,400,Coffin of Eternal Sleep,Worm CYOA v17,Making,"You gain a peculiar coffin unlike any other. Its exterior is adorned with intricate carvings of ethereal beings, shimmering with an otherworldly allure. But it's not the craftsmanship that draws attention; it's the eerie aura that emanates from within.

Should an ordinary person be placed inside it, they are swiftly consumed by the necromantic energies that suffuse the coffin's interior. In an instant, life fades away, and after a day of being suffused with necromantic energy, they will rise again as middle-tier undead.

Yet the coffin's malevolent power does not end there. It generates ludicrous amounts of necromantic energy. Should its lid remain open for more than a week, the very earth nearby begins to stir with an unholy fervor. Corpses, once dormant, rise from their eternal slumber, transformed into low-tier undead minions under the sway of the coffin's necromantic influence.

If an undead stays inside the coffin for a long period of time, they will undergo a transformation. Slowly but surely, the undead within the coffin start to grow, both in stature and in power. Their decrepit forms begin to swell with necromantic energy, their bodies bulging with newfound strength as their once-lifeless eyes flicker with a sinister gleam. 

The longer an undead stays inside the coffin, the greater their connection with the coffin becomes, allowing said undead to control the necromantic energy generated by the coffin. Through this, they can gain control over any undead created by the coffin, as long as its of a lower rank than they themselves are."
1547,,400,Apartha: The Living Crystal,Worm CYOA v17,Making,"Born from crystalized potential, unable to be broken, a forever constant of existence. Arpatha bonds itself to the first person to pour their energy into it. Once bound, the binder will find themselves with the capacity to know where Arpatha is in space at all times. No one can wield Arpatha in any form without the binder's permission. Arpatha has an unlimited capacity for energy, which can be retrieved at any time without loss in efficiency. It will forever be the best catalyst for you, replacing any wand, staff, or athame you could hope for. As Arpatha is used more and more, you will find that the crystal’s shape, size, and density grows increasingly malleable. In one instant it could be as light as a feather, the next, as dense as a star. As the bond solidifies, the user will discover the even after Arpatha leaves their grasp it still remains controllable. With time Arpatha will begin to develop itself in ways that will only benefit you. Constantly improving itself through comparison to other weapons, never settling to be less than anything than the best option for you. Bear it with pride."
1548,,400,Shadow Suit,DC Comics,Making,"Espionage among the spacefaring races takes on a whole new dimension, and the arms race
rages just as fiercely up there as it does on Earth. The Xanapiorian Dimensiometer. The
shadow suit. The Colarvian infiltration suit. Whichever model you have, you’ve gained access to
a highly sophisticated piece of technology for moving unseen and conducting covert activities.
You may loosely define it’s capabilities should you wish for a unique system unknown to most
aliens, but whatever its specifics it must be focused around stealth above all."
1549,,400,Bottomless Box,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Making,"The Bottomless Box is a marvelous magical treasure, enchanted to provide a nearly
infinite amount of storage space. However, this particular version is even more special.
At the end of each journey through the Soulsborne worlds, Mikael meticulously gathered
all the weapons, spells, items, and equipment he encountered and tossed them into this
box. As a result, this Bottomless Box contains an unparalleled collection of artifacts from
across the Soulsborne universes. Whether you need a specific weapon, a powerful
spell, or a unique piece of equipment, this box has it all. Its versatile contents ensure
that you have a tool or weapon for nearly every situation."
1550,,400,Endless Hammers,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Making,"The legendary beings who create legends typically possess their own powers, but they
all still need worthy weapons. So obviously there needs to be someone to forge said
weapons. This however, is where you come in. You are a smith as skilled as Andre or
Hewg. You have extensively studied the various forging techniques, enchantments, and
other forging arts developed throughout the lands. Your craftsmanship is so advanced
that you can create wonders, such as a new Godslaying Blade, provided you have
access to the right materials.
Your reputation as a smith is such that even the gods would seek your services, eager
to wield one of your legendary creations. Moreover, you have a unique ability to
transcend your normal skills by dedicating yourself to a creation. Much like how Hewg
created a legendary weapon by sacrificing himself, the more you devote to a weapon or
item, the greater it will become. This process allows you to channel your very essence
into your work, imbuing it with extraordinary power. Should you fully commit to an item,
know that you will slowly regain your sense of self over time, ensuring that your sacrifice
is never in vain."
1551,,400,Item Construction,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Making,"Item Construction is a skill that demonstrates the user’s ability to create. Individuals
possessing this skill, especially high level versions of it, are able to create truly
wonderful items. For example, given that Medea possessed an A-rank version of this
skill she could easily craft relics that would have been rare even in the Age of the Gods.
You too possess this skill letting you build legendary works. With enough time,
materials, and energy there is practically nothing you can’t make."
1552,,400,Normalise Solution MK 2,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"A very special fluid, much advanced from the initial creation that Youka Naze made. The Normalize
Solution MK 2 is a special fluid that can disable the supernatural powers and traits of any being that
takes the substance inside their body for several minutes, no matter how great those powers were. After those minutes are up, the powers will come right back though. You’ve got a special, very tough
injector that can pierce metal with ease along with 5 vials of the Normalise Solution. You’ll get
replacements for any used vials a month after they were used. "
1553,,400,Alien Cells,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"After Hashirama’s death, many different people, like Danzo,
Orochimaru and even Madara, managed to acquire samples of his cells and DNA
and made experiments to try to gain his power. The majority of these experiments
failed and resulted in deaths, but a few ones managed to achieve good results, with
different degrees of success. Madara, for example, created a mindless clone of
Hashirama, capable of producing a substance made of his cells that could heal
injuries and replace lost limbs, as well as usually increasing the user’s chakra
reserves and granting access to some Wood Release abilities, while Victor used his
cells to induce a splinter of the Earth’s God Tree to make it grow an artificial (and
incomplete) tree. All of these features granted by Hashirama’s Senju physiology is
thanks to him being a descendant of an Ōtsutsuki, in this case, Kaguya herself. It’s
logical that the cells from an Ōtsutsuki will have slightly different features, but more
powerful. You get a few samples of Ōtsutsuki’s cells, enough to reproduce it infinitely
with proper equipment. These cells grant the same benefits as the Hashirama’s
cells, but without the risk of rejection due to the Ōtsutsuki physiology being much
more malleable. They also won’t grant Wood Release abilities, but they grant all the
basic nature transformations (including Yin Release and Yang Release) to those that
are implanted with it and may cause their kekkei genkai, if they have any, to evolve
into new forms or even achieve power compared to their kekkei mōra versions. You
receive new samples yearly."
1554,,400,Kohaku no Jōhei,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"This large pot is a powerful sealing tool, filled with a black
liquid. To seal someone, the wielder must call them and, if the target
responds, their voice will be recorded in the pot and they’ll be sealed,
apparently merging with the black liquid. Once someone is sealed within it, no
one is capable of escaping and the only way to be released is if you want
them to be released."
1555,,400,"Kōkinjō, Shichiseiken, and Benihisago",Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"Despite being three separate tools,
I’ll put them together because it’s needed to use all three of this set to their
effect be complete. First of all, Kōkinjō is a rope capable of drawing out the
word soul of anyone that it has come in contact with, except its wielder. The
rope is also capable of generating a yellow aura that takes the shape of
additional ropes. Once the target’s word soul is drawn out by the rope, it
allows the user to sever it using the Shichiseiken, a light blue broad and flat
sword, and, by saying the verbal command “curse”, allowing their soul to be
sucked to the Benihisago. Lastly, the third artifact is a giant brown-coloured
gourd with a red cloth around it. It is able to take a person's word soul hostage
by saying the verbal command ""record"". After the word soul has been drawn
out by the Kōkinjō and then severed from their body by the Shichiseiken, it is
absorbed into the gourd. If the victim utters the word they have said the most
during their life, they will be sucked into and trapped within the Benihisago.
According to Kurama, once something or someone is trapped within it, they
can't come out, no matter what, but your version of it is capable of releasing
whoever is sealed within it if you want."
1556,,400,Collection of Vessels,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"The Kāma, while almost always used on living
beings, can still work on non-living vessels, like corpses for example. You acquired a
unique treasure that uses this feature. This treasure is a set of ten empty humanoid
dolls and each one of them can be used as a vessel for any Ōtsutsuki, being strong
and compatible enough to be proper vessels. As these dolls aren’t living beings, the
process of ōtsutsukification takes a slightly longer time to be fully completed, but,
besides this, there are no other side effects on using them as your vessels. You
receive a new doll yearly, but you won’t receive a new one if you already have ten of
them. Unlike most fiat-backed items, the dolls won’t reappear in your Warehouse if
lost or destroyed.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."
1557,,400,Hammer of Hephaestus,Greek Mythology,Making,"A hammer that is able to forge weapons and items from
metaphysical things such as emotions, and natural elements like light allowing for the powers
of said materials to be used by the weapon and wielder."
1558,,400,Arrows of Apollo and Artemis,Greek Mythology,Making,"The Arrows of Apollo are made from sun rays and have the
powers to heal anyone or cause famine and death to boys and men. The Arrows of Artemis
are crafted from moonlight and have the power to cause madness in anyone or cause death
and disease to girls and women."
1559,,400,Shirt of Nessus,Greek Mythology,Making,"A simple shirt that I... wouldn't recommend you wear yourself. Instead,
give it to another. This shirt has been soaked in the venom of the Lernaean Hydra, so when it is
worn, it will begin to cook the wearer alive, causing unbearable pain. The shirt is also enchanted to
be impossible to remove without your permission. You may have a different poison effect
the shirt, as well as make it so it instead causes the feeling of being cooked alive rather than
actually cooking someone. No judgement from here, of course."
1560,,400,Gleipnir,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"Like the ribbons and chains used to bind Fenrir, you are being given three chains, ribbons, or ropes of binding. These three bindings will accommodate any size you wish and can be used to bind people, objects, things, personified ideas, and cosmic entities, gods, universes, dimensions, and realms, really anything with a ""body"" can be contained. They are composed of literally impossible things and metaphorical ideas, functionally being as light and strong as needed.  Unlike the originals, these bindings can never be broken or undone by that which is bound, in fact, only you can undo these bindings and they are indestructible and impassible in any way. They will completely seal the person from influencing the world in any way if you so desire. They can be as comfortable or as uncomfortable as you desire, short of actual torture, and any time they are used ""in bed"" they will greatly ""enhance"" all involved experiences. You may simply will them to undo themselves so that you can not be trapped by them in any way if you don't want to be."
1561,,400,Iðunn,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"Every moon or 27 days, you will receive an amazingly carved crate of stone or wood, elegantly inlaid and treated (a treasure in its own right)  filled with 9 golden fruits of your choice.  These fruits will wash away the years and return youth to those who eat from them. Each fruit will restore 9 years of youth, not just in body but in mind and spirit. You will retain your knowledge, wisdom, and joy, but it can carry away the pain, sorrows, hatred, and weariness of the age.  These years can be saved up if you do not wish to grow any younger. But the apples can be used to condemn others if you so choose, wiping out all 9 years of memories or any number of memories from within, or forcing a person into youth or unbirth, or condemning a person to a death like sleep for 9 years, with multiple fruits stacking or conditions set as your choice. No matter what though the fruits are the best tasting of their kind that have ever existed even by the standards of gods and can be distilled into heavenly wines, and juices, cakes, and pies each easily able to make or improve such items. A single apple could make a single bottle of wine or pie or 9 or more bottles providing a divisible amount somehow.  If you took the seeds from these (if you want them to have any) you could grow far more normal silver plants of these fruits that hold all the flavor of their divine counterpart growing only where and how you wish them. The cases that you receive could be used to preserve anything that is within, restoring them and maintaining them unaging and unharmed. The cases can hold metaphysical things such as the memories of those you've taken with your fruits, or, like pandora's boxes, the evils of the world, or all the anger to be released as you choose."
1562,,400,Mjölnir,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"Not necessarily the Mjolnir but an indestructible weapon of equivalent power. For comparison, Mjolnir could break or repair anything it contacted, allow the user to freely wield lightning and rain, would always return to its own, consecrate the earth, could be shrunken down to a pendant size, would grow with its wielder both in power and size (not sure how that makes sense, since it supposedly could break anything) and act as a magic catalyst. You may import a weapon into this position."
1563,,400,Medallion,Bleach,Making,"An immensely powerful and secret invention of the Wandenreich army; a medallion resembling the
Quincy cross which is able to steal a Shinigami Captain’s Bankai for their own use. While immensely
powerful, there are a number of limitations as well. First, the wielder of the Medallion must be on
the same general level as the Shinigami they’re attempting to steal from, or risk the power
overwhelming them or even not being captured properly in the first place. Second, the stolen Bankai
interferes with Yhwach’s gifted power, preventing a Quincy using Bankai from also activating
Vollstandig. Third, mastery is not bestowed upon theft, with a Quincy potentially needing to put in
significant time and training in order to use the stolen power as well as the original. Fourth, as the
spiritual power of Hollows is poison to Quincy, the injection of such energy into the Shinigami a
Bankai was stolen from can ‘Hollowify’ the Bankai and cause it to be stolen back. For similar reasons, the releases of Vizard or Arrancar are immune to this effect. The Medallion, with some tinkering, should be able to steal other releases or transformations you might encounter elsewhere, though a
single Medallion can only hold one such power. "
1564,,400,Ugly Miracles,Bleach,Making,"From the dreaded laboratory of Mayuri Kurotsuchi, three drugs are made available for purchase. The
first is the Superhuman Drug; the drug is able to slow down one’s perception of time, potentially
allowing them to read and react to things going on around more easily. Unfortunately, the drug is so
extremely potent that it causes the victim’s senses to speed up potentially trillions of times over, perceiving one second as a hundred years; a single drop needing to be diluted over two hundred and
fifty thousand times over for it to be of any use. The second is the Thought Inhibitor Drug, a type of drug that can radically dull an individual’s
thought processes. Even though it seemingly has potential as a narcotic, in actuality it just radically
disturbs a victim’s motor control and causes their emotions to become frenzied, making them prone
to self-destruction. The third is the Postcognition Drug, which allows an individual to replay a moment multiple times
over in their head. In reality, it’s a combat drug that causes the victim to replay the act of killing their
current enemy, and then resetting every time they do. Additionally, the Postcognition Drug causes
this by targeting the hippocampus, and by putting such stress on it, the victim will become paralyzed
after looping ten times over. You receive a vial for each drug, replenishing once a month each, and
god help anyone that you use a full bottle on. "
1565,,400,Mastercraft,The Witcher Novels,Making,"What separates a Master from an Apprentice? No, not the fact that the current Master married his teacher's only daughter and inherited his position in the guild. A ​True Master of his craft is person whose work is akin to art. Perhaps even the Art snobbish sorcerers like to call their magic, because when someone looks at what was made by your hand they cannot believe it is not magic. When someone thinks about your chosen profession your name is often found to be synonymous to it. Not surprisingly the rich and powerful will easily agree to outrageous prices to own what you make. 
This is what it is to be the Master, but there is more, for you are gifted with talent for organization. Your subordinates always perform to the best of their abilities and always remain very loyal to you. Your businesses don’t suffer from misfortune, working like well-oiled mechanisms as long as their focus is on your craft. They need so little oversight that you can spend your time on other pursuits almost without worry for your business. Eventually every master will take an apprentice, or several, and you can fully teach them what you know about your chosen art, almost regardless of how inept they are. They may not be able to surpass you but your legacy will live on through them and their work, and the work of their students and beyond, forever immortalizing your name. Even if history may not remember your other deeds expect to become a folklore hero in the future. 
"
1566,,400,Dwarven Craft        ,The Lord of the Rings,Making ,"You are a master smith, able to singlehandedly run even a large forge. You can make weapons and armour that stand up to hundreds of years of continuous use, and even know how to mine and forge mystical metals such as Mithril."
1567,,400,New Frontier,Bofuri,Making ,"In addition to granting you access to a variety of powerful or useful recipes, this also allows you to develop at least one new recipe whenever you encounter a new ingredient.

Most of the time these recipes will be okay at best, but with the number of ingredients you’re likely to encounter in the future, you’re sure to stumble on some seriously powerful items that can be made."
1568,,400,The​ ​Black​ ​Throne​ ​Of​ ​Gehinnom​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Making ,"A twenty foot tall black obsidian and siyr throne created by Lucifer himself that once sat at the center of the Black Cathedral. It easily weighs several tons. After being fed a what might feel like an absurd amount of Faith over time, sitting upon this large uncomfortable throne gives the Demon atop it significant power. Any non-supernatural mortal that gazes upon the Throne and the one sitting upon it will become a willing, almost fanatical follower. They will obey any order, even suicidal ones - but only if the order is given while the demon is sitting upon the throne. There is no limit to the number of mortals that can be enthralled, and the Fallen may use any low-torment evocation of the Lore of the Firmament on the mortals in service to the throne. When the demon is out of the chair, the mortals give them respect but not obedience, only following orders if the demon returns to the throne.

Cannot​ ​be​ ​Taken​ ​With​ ​Soul​ ​Taker"
1569,,400,Soul​ ​Taker,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Making ,"This massive broadsword is made of a dull, pitted black metal - siyr. Within its demonic blade houses the essence and soul of dozens of demons and angels both, all driven mad as their minds warred between each other for aeons. They exist only as Legion, a being that desires only to be fed. The sword moves like silk and gossamer, and feels almost weightless despite it’s impressive and seemingly unwieldy size. When the Soul Taker ends the life of a supernatural creature, it’s magical essence or soul is absorbed into the blade. This soul is then added to Legion over time as it is tortured and devoured by the dark entity. A full half of this energy is absorbed by the blade simply to satiate its own dark hunger, but the rest is left in reserve of Faith that can be called upon later while holding the Soul Taker. Killing mere mortals does nothing to fill this reservoir of Faith. Powerful enough beings might be able to resist being absorbed, but those of such strength of will are few and far between. Post-jump, the maddened whispers of Legion can be toggled off so you do not have to listen.

Cannot​ ​be​ ​Taken​ ​With​ ​ The Black​ ​Throne​ ​Of​ ​Gehinnom"
1570,,400,A Barrel of Soulfire,Cradle V1,Making ,"This will make you the envy of all. You gain a barrel of soulfire, that allows you to bathe any item inside and bring it closer to the platonic ideal. (A comb dipped in the stuff can brush the toughest of tangles, a sword will keep the sharpest edge possible for it) It will refill in about a minute. You can choose to absorb it and become a wellspring of the valuable substance."
1571,,400,Parasite Ring,Cradle V1,Making ,This half-silver ring will make your cycling take twice as long but will double the gains from it.
1572,,400,Was Scepter ,Egyptian Mythology,Making ,"The was is a symbol of your might and a pillar which supports your magical power. You can increase its length at will, up to several kilometers if need be, and once set in place it proves impossible for mortal forces to budge. As if pinning your heka to the world, your was may also support your magic on your behalf; maintaining the focus and control of your magic in your place, as though it had a simple focus of its own. Optionally, your was may have a differently shaped head than the common angled form, such as resembling a papyrus branch or combined with the Ankh item."
1573,,400,The Crook and The Flail,Egyptian Mythology,Making ,"Two classical insignia of the King of Egypt; the crook symbolising the protection and nurturing of the Kingdoms’ people, while the flail is a promise of wrath upon the enemies of Egypt and those who disobey your divine edict.

Taking up the crook and performing an act considered as a kindness, generosity or act of fitting justice by your people enhances the effect of ma’at throughout your citizens who benefit from it; your people become less inclined to crime and disruptive activity, neither dodging tariffs nor shirking their duties.

The flail is more direct: taking it up and issuing a decree compels your subjects to obey the command without question, regardless of whether they heard you speak. The effect of the flail is immediate, but the effect of the crook is more subtle, and does not work upon orders made with the flail. Both the crook and the flail are also a potent weapons, each capable of smiting the enemies of your nation like a mighty hammer."
1574,,400,Sunstone/Moonstone,Final Fantasy XII,Making ,"“300 for one stone, 400 and I’ll throw in the other.” The shopkeeper holds two pieces of nethicite in his hands. One has a dull lustre, while the other is glowing brilliantly. The tag tells you this is the Sunstone and the Moonstone, one stone for heat and light, another for cold and dark. The Sunstone speeds up plant growth while the Moonstone will help you heal quicker. They naturally absorb a bit of nearby magick.

If they absorb too much arcane energy however, it needs to be discharged, and each stone does this in the form of an intense beam. If you hit the two stones together in their charged state, you mean induce a massive arcane explosion. You won’t be affected, but those around you won’t be so lucky."
1575,,400,Mask of Negalmurr ,Final Fantasy XII,Making ,"A hideous skull encloses your head. You cannot cast magic or attack while it is present, but in its place you can create a ghoul every two minutes. The ghouls are fairly durable and will swarm enemies accordingly, but have paltry physical attacks and no magick to speak of.

Having the skull on slowly wears down your magick reserves – you’ll have to take it off after an hour or so. We’ve also never seen the ghouls last longer than a day when we were testing this out. Even trying to preserve them didn’t help."
1576,,400,Gilgamesh’s Mark,Final Fantasy XII,Making ,"The legendary mark of Gilgamesh, Master of All Weapons. Your copy of his mark is a good one, but it pales in comparison to the Master himself. When you see a weapon and you know its abilities, you may create a copy of that weapon which will function at a reduced capacity from the original. A weapon may only be copied once. You also get a neat little “FAKE” written on the weapon somewhere."
1577,,400,Vesper Shard ,Final Fantasy XII,Making ,"An amber shard of nethicite, with the capacity to absorb magic just like all other nethicite. When charged however, it stops time entirely for a very small period, perhaps only enough to throw your body out of the way of an incoming blow.

If you have magicite present, or have some sort of stone capable of conducting magic, it is possible to convert them into Vesper Shards. Keep in mind however, that the Shards take quite some time to charge, and the conversion process itself is a lengthy one as well."
1578,,400,Wings of Icarus,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Making ,"What a fancy little contraption you seem to have here, Jumper. Fashioned from Celestial Bronze, this pair of wings seem to be rather encumbering until fitted upon. At that point, however, you’ll find that not only are they incredibly lightweight, but also capable of flight despite the fact that it should not be able to support the user’s weight. While this is used best for gliding, the user can also take off from the ground if they are willing to spend the extra energy to get themselves aloft. Guaranteed not to melt if you fly too close to the sun."
1579,,400,Trefuilngid Branch,Irish Mythology,Making ,"A gift of the giant Trefuilngid Te-ochair, this magic branch bears apples, acorns and hazelnuts that grow back overnight. Who eats of the fruits of the branch while facing North shall find their wounds and illnesses instantly cured. Who faces South while eating shall be restored to the flower of their youth."
1580,,400,Spread,Irish Mythology,Making ,"Spread this blanket on the ground and whatever food or drink you most want will be conjured, creating a lovely picnic, complete with plates, cups and cutlery. When you’re done, just roll it up and any mess vanishes."
1581,,400,Worker of Wonders,Irish Mythology,Making ,"You can work more than mere metal. Jewels, cloth and rare materials. You could string a rainbow, or sharpen a fair maiden’s sigh until it could literally cut to the heart of a man through any armor, weave a cloak from shadows and other miraculous crafts."
1582,,400,Magical Artifact,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Making ,"These ancient and magical civilizations have forged and created objects capable of magical feats though for now these civilization still exist. How many of them are existing is unknown but over time some have appeared like a Necklace which allowed the user to seize control over the Creatures of Grimm, a cloak that displaces light around the wearer, a gauntlet that can fire blasts of energy, a black, bead-shaped artifact that can be used as a bomb repeatedly, an amulet that has the ability to hide it's user from the Grimm and many more. While they are nowhere near the level of the Relics created by the Gods, it can’t be denied that they have interesting usages. One such Artifact possessing one of these or other power wise similar capabilities may be bought by you."
1583,,400,Stamina Up,Dies Irae,Making ,"Often paired with Delimiter, this syringe contains a concoction that allows one to fight on long past the normal point of biological death. These drugs forcibly keep a body going even when it should have gone into shock or outright failed on the person in control. Massive internal damage, having your heart ripped out, losing your limbs or even having all the blood sucked from your body. So long as your body is roughly intact and your brain has not been destroyed, taking this drug will let you keep fighting for at least a half hour after you should have dropped dead. You have a supply of ten syringes, which are replaced weekly when used."
1584,,400,Delimiter,Dies Irae,Making ,"Specially ordered from a foreign land, this syringe contains a special kind of drug that allows a man to go far beyond the limits of what is humanly possible. When injected into a normal man, he’d be able to run as fast as a car, shatter bricks with his hands and find all of his senses boosted to a level only the best animals in the world can match. Normally such an increase would come at the cost of great harm to your body but it seems that this drug, which you receive a weekly replacement after being used, does not harm the user. It removes the limits on your body and boosts you higher, even somehow working comparatively better if you are beyond the level of a normal man. "
1585,,400,Divine Ark,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making ,"This is a golden chest, almost 6 ft in its widest dimension and a good 4 ft in each other. The chest itself is seemingly indestructible, and it has a tendency to be lit from above as it by a spotlight, its surface shining with glory. When closed the interior of the chest seems to be frozen in time, and inaccessible to all outside forces, and the chest cannot be opened by any except those who match parameters that you designate.

An additional value of this chest is that when you leave a jump, you may both leave the chest and its contents behind in the world you are leaving and take them with you, the chest - and its contents - being duplicated.

Note, though, the chest will not close with a Jumper or their Companion inside of it."
1586,,400,Mind Sword,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making ,"A power great enough for a son to kill his father, and which must never fall into the hands of the forces of darkness. This magic sword has a grasping hand for its pommel, a large gem, the Mind Stone, set within it. It is this stone which grants the blade its great powers. The sword comes to your hand when you will it, flying or teleporting to your grasp from wherever it happens to be. This can also be used to make minor course corrections to its movements if thrown, but perhaps most important is its use against projectiles as it seems to be able to move at the speed of thought allowing it to deflect projectiles you are aware of parrying arrows with contemptuous ease and even blocking bullets if it comes to that. This is less effective in hand to hand combat, but its movements responding to your will still allows it to make for super fast parries. Finally the gem is able to produce a bright green glow. Besides being useful as a light, this glow seems to keep away minor creatures of darkness, evil spirits, and help to ward off corrupt energies with its protective shine; don't expect it to hold things back permanently though.

As a magical blade this sword can harm creatures normally only harmed by magical forces and even spiritual entities, though its cutting power against normal targets is not significantly improved (though it will never lose its edge). It is, however, substantially more resilient and harder to damage than a normal sword. If it is destroyed you will be able to summon a new one through a period of meditation and pure force of will."
1587,,400,Rough Power Stones,The God of High School Jump,Making ,"You find a cave connected to either your warehouse or a property of choice. Within this cave is a seemingly endless source of glowing green rocks. These are Rough Power Stones, in unmined form. When properly prepared, in a fashion you receive the instructions to, these stones can draw in any life energy in the air around them, especially the energy released by fighters trained in the use of it. If pressed against the body of a living being, it can either drain their innate life energy, slowly killing them, or transfer the energy already in the stone to that being. The stones each have a maximum amount of energy they can store at once, based on the stones overall size, but when gathered in massed groups, they can be used to accomplish incredible feats of supernatural power or magic."
1588,,400,Walmung,The God of High School Jump,Making ,"A dark silver broadsword with a bird wing shaped hilt, it covers the users’ right arm in plate armour when brought about. This sword is especially strong in how it enhances the user’s attack power, enough to make a man ordinarily able to destroy a house with one blow wipe clean a whole city block with a single slash. It is also able to enter a defensive mode, spreading the plate armour on the user’s right arm to cover their entire body."
1589,,400,Mjolnir        ,The God of High School Jump,Making ,"A super heavy war hammer made for one handed use. The hammer is also able to emit blasts of lightning but it’s most special property is in fact the ability of the wielder to absorb the hammer into their body. This allows the user to charge their physical strikes with much greater force than usual, imbue their body with huge amounts of electrical power to attack foes with and continue to use the usual traits of a National Treasure even with it inside their own body."
1590,,400,Growgurt Parfait,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Making ,"Quite the special dessert and perfect for when you were shrunken down. Eating this Parfait will make the one who eats in grow in size proportionally to how much they eat. Since you buy this with CP you can even make someone shrink by eating this Parfait as well, just in case you eat too much of the growth version."
1591,,400,Alyx’s Dagger         ,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Making ,"This dagger is a perfect replica to the one Alyx once wielded. It is reliable, always sharp and even if an enchantment is placed on it, you will always be able to recognize it and find it again. Though perhaps most interesting of all it is imbued with a wish. The wish to fix what the wielder had broken. Once per Jump it can perform a minor miracle as long as it is in the spirit of making amends or helping someone its wielder wronged. It could be restoring the youth of someone who you betrayed to name one example."
1592,,400,Tools for the Duty,Final Fantasy X,Making ,"Even if you’re a good pugilist, you can still benefit from having the proper tools available on your journey. But being a Guardian isn’t like being a Summoner, you won’t necessarily find people on the Pilgrimage willing to help you out with items and whatnot. The expectation is that you’ll lay down your life for the Summoner after all, why should people give you anything if you’re not expected to return alive in the first place?

It’s a good thing that you know how to prepare your own tools and equipment, because not having to depend on others will make the longer legs of the Pilgrimage much more tolerable. Merchants and tradesmen aren’t everywhere after all...

Level: 1 You can craft basic necessities, as well as general weapons and armour at this level, the quality will be dependent on your own ability.

Level: 2 So long as you possess items with a similar effect, you can enhance an existing item by consuming the “sacrificial items”. This increases the potency of the shared effect, but further enhancement is going to require even more of the sacrificial item to be offered.

Level: 3 Though the result will be somewhat weak, and the required amount of reagents will be quite large, you can add new effects to existing items by enhancing them using a large amount of the same item which possesses the effect you want to pass on.

Level: 4 When you deconstruct an object, it’s likely that you’ll find “Sigil” components with a lingering effect from the original item before it was broken down. You can use these in large groups for enhancement purposes, or you can attach these to items to provide them with a temporary effect.

Level: 5 Items that you create will grow with experience – provided that you use them to defeat an enemy. This isn’t strictly restricted to weapons, though you’ll obviously have to become a bit creative in order to grow other items this way."
1593,,400,Magic armor,Gods of Blood and Powder,Making ,"500 sets of ancient magic full plate armor. They are enchanted by Privileged and blessed by boneeyes. They turn both bullets and magic spells aside, letting you ride through the enemies and cut them down like grass. You can still be pulled to the ground and be stabbed through gaps in the armor or killed by magic breaking objects."
1594,,400,Implement of Fear,Chainsaw Man,Making ,"You have an item that embodies the fear you represent with its relative strength and abilities dependent on said fear. Even if you took the lowest tier of Embodiment of Fear it would surpass any mundane weapon in the setting and with the highest tier it would make you something no other Primal Devil could match. You can control it telekinetically and summon it to your person at any time from a pocket dimension contained in your heart. You can also create a mirrored version of it to dual wield if you please. This option is most effective as a weapon but you can opt to have a suit of armor or even an amulet that increases your powers. Either way its usefulness will be about the same.

Requires Fiend, Hybrid or Devil to Purchase"
1595,,400,THE PAINTING,Inscryption,Making ,"All sorts of goodies can be found behind this. The painting will shift from time to time, depicting a specific arrangement of cards. Recreate that arrangement in battle successfully, and the painting will slide open, revealing something new inside. Upon opening the painting, you may create a single New Creature, New Rare, New Item, or Crossover Cameo, as listed in the Modifications section below, even if you don’t have those purchases. Unlike the restrictions listed in that section, whatever you choose will be applied to whatever campaign or universe you are currently in (including the ‘real world’, where that concept is applicable).

The painting may be activated only once every ten years in any given setting. That is to say, you may activate the painting in Leshy’s Campaign, then immediately activate it again in Grimora’s Campaign, but it would be ten years before you can use it again in either.

If you receive the Transcendence reward, rewards from the Painting only apply to your ‘instance’ of a given campaign. You may choose whether the Painting is included in the ruleset of Inscryption that other people receive, or whether it is only available to you.

Requires Inscryption to Purchase"
1596,,400,THE ITEMS,Inscryption,Making ,"Need an advantage in a pinch? At the start of each round of Inscryption, you may choose to bring up to three items with you. These items may be used up to one time each, directly interfering with the game in ways that would otherwise be impossible. For example, scissors could be used to destroy a card instantly, and pliers could be used to tamper with the scale (though not without some pain). You may only choose items that are either ordinary and mundane, or that were obtained in an Inscryption campaign (see the Campaigns section below).

Requires Inscryption to Purchase"
1597,,400,THE CANDLES,Inscryption,Making ,"Their light protects you from the consequences of your failure. Whenever you lose a round of Inscryption, one of the flames snuffs out. So long as at least one of the flames remains lit after the snuffing, your loss does not translate to a real-world defeat; both you and your adversary move on from the game unaffected by it. If both flames are extinguished, however, you suffer your loss in the usual way.

Against unusually powerful or significant enemies, this protection falters, one light extinguishing itself in advance if both were lit. In exchange, however, success against that enemy will reignite the candles. What’s more, the smoke from the extinguished flame may prove useful in battle, acting as a weakly servant, or a potent sacrifice of both blood and bone.

Requires Inscryption to Purchase"
1598,,400,Object Handling,Inscryption,Making ,"So the data on the disk might be a key of sorts, and it might be a little possessed, but that’s not going to get in your way. When handling supernatural items, you can manipulate, reprogram, and generally alter them as though they were a normal version of that item instead. Your changes might affect its paranormal qualities, but those qualities won’t prevent your changes."
1599,,400,Deck of Fates,Cult of the Lamb,Making ,"It seems you have come into possession of a tarot deck with powers similar to that of Clauneck the Tarot Dealer, though slightly lessened in its scope of power. At the start of each new day, you may draw four cards from the deck. Each card will bestow similar powers to those in Cult of the Lamb. These powers can range from immunity to certain status effects, lessened costs for using magical energy, or bestowing greater vitality. While additional cards may be drawn from the deck, only the first four drawn bestow any power for that day. At the end of each day, the effects of the cards drawn that day fade."
1600,,400,Ancient Dragon Equipment ,Solo Leveling,Making ,"You have come into possession of an item crafted directly from the corpse of the Ancient Dragon Kamish, a magical beast so powerful that even entire groups of S-Ranked Hunters perished before it, only being defeated by the combined might of the National Ranked Hunters. The exact nature of this item depends on your previous choices in this document. A mage could have gotten a staff created using one of the eyes of the mighty beasts, triplicating the potency of their spells. A warrior could get a pair of swords from the dragon’s largest fangs, capable of easily damaging the spirit bodies of Rulers and Monarchs. A tank may have gotten an armor made of the scales of the walking calamity, making him impenetrable to all but the strikes of the Rulers and Monarchs themselves. These items are also able to channel your own mana, meaning that they will grow in power as you do. Can be purchased multiple times. You can import previous items into this."
1601,,400,Celestial Trash: Tools of Calamity,Avesta of Black and White,Making ,"The Forge of Ruin Khvarenah is the source of the most powerful and advanced artifacts under the First Heaven. But the mightiest of Arch-Demons cares little on which side his artifacts end up, he is just content with devouring worlds for materials and then producing artifacts, left for whoever is brave enough to pick them. You have picked up an especially powerful artifact, comparable to Magsariom’s armor capable of regenerating from any wound and giving anyone the power of Ego, Maluk Talus, or Mashyag, which grants the user’s desires by creating duplicates."
1602,,400,Golden Wheel,Fate/Grand Order,Making ,"A shining golden steering wheel, like straight off of an old pirate ship. It seems to be able to easily fit in place of any steering wheel or piloting mechanism on any other vehicle. The wheel can then be used to pilot the vehicle it is properly attached to, granting you immense skill in driving it and the ability to somehow control the entire vehicle just by using the steering wheel and calling out commands. The wheel being attached will also give the vessel a grand blessing of luck, ensuring it easily survives any sort of weather conditions and is far more difficult to sink or damage with active attacks against it. "
1603,,400,Mystic Wardrobes,Fate/Grand Order,Making ,"Chaldea has crafted some terrifically powerful Mystic Codes for use by its agents and has found itself with an awfully large surplus now that most of them are dead. More for you, right? While as a human, if you are one, you likely received a basic Mystic Code outfit for free, this option will ensure you continue to receive one every month for the rest of your life, even in other worlds. These outfits have up to 3 spells encoded into them, each one a pretty powerful piece of magic operating on the Servant level. Spells that greatly increase the attack or defence power of a Servant or fully heal them or even deal a surprising amount of damage to foes on that level are quite commonplace but you may eventually find some stranger effects being encoded. The Mystic Code outfits also happen to look really, really good on you."
1604,,400,Working Unlimited Guns,Fate/Grand Order,Making ,"A complete gun smithing set made out of a strange black metal. There are tools here for every process of creation, from shaping the metal to the fine details of the gun itself. What makes this set special is several qualities. Firstly, any gun it creates will count as a magical creation and the user is able to copy spells or magic that they can use into the gun to transfer those effects onto the weapon itself, though how they manifest may change depending on the gun type. The forge is also able to easily convert other weapons or objects into guns of similar size, retaining all their normal properties but in firearm form. "
1605,,400,Invitations,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making ,"When people go to the Library they can’t just walk there, especially with it being shrouded in a fog right now. So the way that the guests are brought in is by signing invitations, each one has a different selection of 1-3 books that are up for grabs to whoever signs it, then once they do that they are teleported into the Library entrance where they are greeted and directed towards a given floor. Your version is slightly different, you’re in charge of where it sends people as long as it’s onto your property and somewhere safe, as well as what trials they need to go through to get the books listed. But your version doesn’t follow the guidance of the Light to pick recipients instead, it’s about 50-50 on how much influence you directly place on it, and who most desires the books listed on it, so you might be able to force someone to not get it for most situations, but if the book of someone close to them is up for grabs then they will pretty much be the only person who gets invited. The books on the invitation can be either regular books or ones made from the Library’s power/Beaten into a Biography."
1606,,400,Speed Dice,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making ,"Knowing how fast someone is can be a make-or-break factor in deciding a fight, especially since some hold back so they can catch opponents off guard. You thankfully have a countermeasure to that now, with six sets of dice which confusingly work more like a magic 8 ball instead of an actual dice. Each set shows a target’s current speed and maximum potential speed with a satisfying finger snap and dice roll sound. Each set can be set to track a single person, and setting the dice only requires you to clearly see the target and you can detach the dice at will while setting them to track yourself can be done at will. The dice only work when at least two targets are tracked, since the numbers on the dice are relative to each other instead of using any units."
1607,,400,Refine,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making ,"Workshops aren’t just about making their products, any of them worth their license would be eager to upgrade an existing piece of equipment with their specialties and also make it generally better for a premium. Enhancing existing weapons and armor comes easily to you, though it has a greatly reduced effect on anything you’ve made yourself since you could have just made it better the first time right? The upgrades are all linear increases to its function except the first, which can apply a greater version of Meister’s Mark if you also have that perk, as well as any other crafting perks you have, and if you took Workshop Solidarity each upgrade is more potent the larger your workforce is."
1608,,400,Pseudo Cocoon,Bibliomania,Making ,"This is a strange one, it is simply a bed for the most part but it takes the shape of the seal which sealed the beast that started this world's apocalypse, though it has a hatch like top which can open and close from both the outside and inside. Inside the cocoon is a lovely series of aesthetically matching bedding, pillows, quilts and covers made of some advanced silks and various other soft materials that are both firm and soft at the same time. All of which is enchanted to be enhance comfort, soothe aches and pains, boost healing and recovery both for speed and Optimization( could heal a broken wrist in a nights sleep as strong as ever), Steadily clean those that sleep in it, sooth the mind and cure any malidied and sicknesses. Now a great bed is a boon for anyone but this pseudo cocoon is special since you can at will seal the bed for a set time and have it work its magic for that time, for every hour it is sealed while you and/or anyone else is sealed within you will end up in a restful sleep state where you will gain the training of whatever you want to train(as long as it's possible for you to train it on your own) at a rate 25 times the amount of time its sealed, this allows you to rapidly train and master anything and all you need to is have a want to train something and the cocoon with train you as if in the best possible conditions for you to train that and since it optimizes your training you’d gain the best possible results, though you can’t use this to learn something new only master what you have or could teach yourself. It's great for physical skills and supernatural but knowledge based skills would be better to study to expand your knowledge. I should also mention that you can summon and unsummon this bed at any time, it's shockingly tough to the point you’d need anti tank weaponry to damage it and most importantly it can scale up and down to the size of any form you take. You also gain some schematics to make beds as comfortable as this as well as the actual seal this is based off so if your patient you could trap even god like beings."
1609,,400,Vial of Rot,Bibliomania,Making ,This is a small 100 milliliter vial of pure concentrated Rot which is as potent as someone moving from Room 100 to 099. Simply exposing someone to the liquid will rapidly mutate and kill them. This can be used in a list of ways and a smart enough person can find dozens of uses of this beyond just instantly receiving poison. The vial refills when used.
1610,,400,Arcane Scepter,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Making ,"Crafted to fit your custom look, this magical focus would be the envy of any spellcaster. When used to channel magic, this staff increases elemental damage, extends your spells’ durations, and reduces the energy cost of casting offensive magic. Should you already have a magical focus, you may import it and grant it these effects. Every mage needs a stave, and you’ll find few that can perform better."
1611,,400,Dreamweaver’s Vault,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Making ,"What are you doing, Jumper?! This armored capsule contains a small chunk of Jenova’s remains. Currently suspended in a holding base and sealed within the capsule, this biomass is extremely aggressive. You could craft a civilization-killing plague from these cells, or engineer the next breed of super soldiers. Near-limitless control over the biological form is within your reach...behind a foot of containment glass. You could even incorporate it into your own body to gain its properties, but this would be extremely risky. Without the titanic willpower to overcome Jenova herself, you would be a slave to her will and another instrument in her plans. Is it worth the risk?"
1612,,400,Superstar Belt        ,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Making ,"A hero’s quest requires a Girdle of Giant’s Strength! Okay, this isn’t quite that, but this belt will still prove very useful for a fledgling freedom fighter. While the slight boosts to your strength and health are appreciated, the real benefit of this belt is how it allows you to avoid incapacitation. Once per battle, you may resist an effect that would take you out of the fight. Whether you are knocked out by an enemy attack, paralyzed by fear, or weakened by poison, you can instead choose to stand up with enough stamina to finish the job. This won’t protect you if you’re already at death’s door, or if an attack has the power to kill you at peak health. Still, this is great for giving you a second chance in combat, and when you’re a resistance fighter, you need as many second chances as you can get."
1613,,400,Godmetal Ingots,Kurohime,Making ,"A substance otherwise unique to the gods, you have a small crate of pure Godmetal. While you can forge Godmetal easily enough, you must be very careful to get whatever you forge correct the first time you make it, as once it cools, it becomes utterly invulnerable to anything short of attacks that can cut anything, such as the Ultimate Sword. This crate refills once per month."
1614,,400,Three Sacred Tools of Yamato,Kurohime,Making ,"You have a duplicate of the most sacred treasures of the nation of Yamato, which are normally kept close to the island’s general, to be used in defense of the country. A gift from the four Spirit Kings, it comes in three parts, each sealed into a magatama on a necklace.

The first is the Genbu Gauntlet, an impenetrable clawed gauntlet that can stop any attack completely—even a strike from a god wouldn’t budge you if you blocked with this one gauntlet.

The second is Byakko’s Long Sword, which is a top-tier weapon capable of cleaving through almost anything, and is as light as a feather to wield, but strikes as though it weighed tons.

The third is Seiryuu’s Feather Dress, which allows you to fly at great speeds. 

You can only use one at a time, but be warned; although each individual gift came from a different Spirit King, the Tools themselves come from Suzaku, and they have a toll in life force to use. That said, because you’re buying this with your precious points, you will be provided a daily stipend of “extra” life force for the sole purpose of fueling the Three Sacred Tools. You have enough for 30 minutes of active use, before it starts to draw upon your own life energy."
1615,,400,"World’s Strongest Magic Cannon, Houyruu",Kurohime,Making ,"A large revolver-rifle that stores an immense amount of magical energy—so much so that if you had the ability to summon dragons in the first place, you could spend all day casting dragon spells even in a location where magic is unusable, such as the divine domain of a god. What’s more, it has the same type of attack power as Worldwide Unique Gun of Illusions, Senryuu, but is as amplified beyond it as a rifle is beyond an ordinary revolver. Finally, it serves to boost the effect of magic bullets fired through the barrel."
1616,,400,Magic Bullets,Kurohime,Making ,"The basics of using magic in this world is to create a magic circle. Witches, however, have figured out how to weaponize this effect. Instead of directly casting spells, they perform a small ritual to imbue a spell effect into a bullet, which upon impacting a target, transfers the magical effect. This is vastly faster than normal spellcasting, and a skilled witch—like you—can create a magic bullet in only a second.

Through the use of magic bullets, you have a wide variety of spells available to you to quick-cast; fireballs that erupt upon hitting a target, healing spells that convert the bullet into healing energy instead of hurting who they hit, enhancing a target, transformations, curses, summoning a wall, speaking with the dead... but the primary use of Magic Bullets comes down to summoning magic—although truth be told, it’s closer to “creation” magic, as the stuff you summon doesn’t seem to actually be summoned from anywhere. The beings you “summon” are capable of using their own powerful effects and can physically dominate the battlefield, making the clever use of summoned creatures into the most successful combat strategy."
1617,,400,Ultimate Sword,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Making ,"A masterwork sword, which has been magically empowered to outperform mundane equivalents. It has been made specifically for you, and as such comes in a design of your preference. No matter your sword’s size or weight, it will feel light in your hands, and you will never find it unwieldy to use.

Using this sword, you are able to perform a special technique, decided on purchase of this item. This is either a slash or combination of slashes with an added aesthetic effect of your preference. Whatever you decide, the effect is mechanically the same; it is a powerful attack that is likely to be a fight ender against most Fighters. Unfortunately, this technique is also taxing, making it unlikely that you will be able to use it more than once in a fight. Only you will be able to use this technique with this weapon.

Should either the sword or shield be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
1618,,400,Smash Ball,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Making ,"By purchasing this option, you ensure the availability of the Smash Ball in all of your future battles. Sometime during each battle, the Smash Ball will spawn on the battlefield. It will always spawn closer to you than to your opponent(s), though it may not always spawn at your feet. If you have no desire to use the Smash Ball at all for a particular fight, it will not spawn for that particular fight, preventing its use against you. Should the Smash Ball spawn, your opponent does have the opportunity to use it, if they can get to it first.

A Smash Ball is a strange orb displaying the Super Smash Bros. logo. Once it appears, it will float through the air in random directions. If the Smash Ball is allowed to float around for too long, it will despawn – the exact time varies for each ball, but will not exceed a minute. When an individual destroys a Smash Ball, they will be filled with a special energy. This energy will allow the wielder to utilise one of the following effects (of their choosing) one time, before dissipating:

• The wielder can utilise one of their powers or abilities without the usual energy cost it would normally incur. If the power or ability has a duration based on how much energy the wielder can spend (such as a transformation), then it can last up to the length of time that would be possible if the wielder were to put all their energy into it.
• The wielder can utilise one of their powers or abilities that has a time limit between uses, without resetting that timer, and even if it was in a ‘cooldown’ period.
• The wielder can utilise one of their items or equipment without incurring an energy or ammunition cost. If the item or equipment usage has a duration based on how much energy or ammunition the item has available, then it can last up to the length of time that would be possible when using its normal full capacity of energy or ammunition.
• The wielder can utilise one of their items or equipment that has a time limit between uses, without resetting that timer, and even if it was in a ‘cooldown’ period.

Should the current battle end without this special energy being used, it will automatically dissipate.

As this purchase is merely for access to Smash Balls, not the Smash Balls themselves, you may not import any similar item into this option."
1619,,400,Dimensional Cape,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Making ,"You are now the owner of a magical cape. This cape may come in any colour or design of your preference (chosen on purchase). 

At will, you may transform your cape to and revert it from a pair of bat-like wings, which grant you the power of flight.

With a flourish of your cape, you can spin in place rapidly, becoming a mini tornado. As a mini tornado, you can remain in place or move a fair distance in any direction. While you have the cape in wing form, you can use them to rapidly spin as you advance, rushing forward in a manner reminiscent of a drill. In either of these cases, the use of a weapon such as a sword will turn these moves from movement options into dangerous attacks.

With a flourish of your cape, you are able to teleport a short distance in front of you.

Finally, you can temporarily trap others in an empty void of darkness. In order to do so, you must swing your cape at them and connect. Once trapped, you will have enough time to deal a powerful attack against them. Should you choose not to, they will be released from the void. Your cape requires a large cooldown between uses of this ability, even if it misses, making it unlikely you will be able to use it more than once in a fight.

You will only use the cape’s abilities when you mean to, and only the specific abilities you are attempting to use. Should your cape be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
1620,,400,Miracle Box,Miraculous Ladybug,Making ,"This is a container, customized to your personality, with 16 slots on it. These slots are perfect for carrying important items, which fit inside no matter the size. No one but you or someone you trust can open these compartments. While they are in these compartments, they cannot be detected in any way. No omnipresence or divination or teleportation ability will be able to pierce its confines."
1621,,400,Special Kwami Food ,Miraculous Ladybug,Making ,"These treats (in the form of your Kwami’s favorite food) have a special brew baked into them that causes the Kwami to obtain special effects when eaten (by the Miraculous user or the Kwami). The Miraculous user can say the phrase “Power Up” when one of these is locked in and it will transform their suit to have new abilities. The effects are color coded as follows:

Green - Gives a scuba suit allowing for underwater breathing

Blue - Resistance to freezing temperatures and a pair of retractable ice skates

Purple - Gains spacesuit-like plating, a jetpack with retractable wings, and a helmet that provides breathable air

Red - Gives a jetpack with retractable wings and adjusts to pressure, allowing for high atmospheric travel and high wind conditions

Yellow - Specialized material allows for electricity to pass around it harmlessly

Orange - Grants fire resistance, allowing you to walk on lava

Pink - Makes the suit armor-like, able to withstand even gunfire with ease

You get one of each, and they replenish at the start of every week. Can be purchased multiple times (discounts persist) if you have multiple Kwami or if you just want more than one set.

1622,,400,Bee(Pollen),Miraculous Ladybug,Making ,"Concept: Action

Form: Hair Comb

Tool: Spinning Top (as big as a baseball)

Power: “Venom” - Produces a magical attack shaped like the Spinning Top around the user’s hand filled with a paralyzing Venom. This venom is not chemical, so the target doesn’t even necessarily need to have blood or muscles for it to work (a sentient machine or a spirit would be a valid target for example). It freezes the target like a statue, unable to move even via someone else trying to pose them."
1623,,400,Snake(Sass),Miraculous Ladybug,Making ,"Concept: Intuition

Form: Bracelet

Tool: Lyre

Power: “Second Chance” - Marks a point in time by sliding the snake on the Miraculous. If the user slides the snake back into place within 5 minutes, they reset time back to the marked point, only the user retaining their memories. Contrary to the name, time can be looped as many times as they want within that 5 minute time limit. Only once the 5 minutes are up will the cooldown start."
1624,,400,Reinvention,Miraculous Ladybug,Making ,"You are quite the genius when it comes to reinvention. You can repurpose and reconfigure even magical artifacts like the Miraculous given information on how they function (like through the Guardian book) and the required resources/technology to modify them. This will work for other magical artifacts as well. Modifying artifacts this way will always be a trade-off. You can give it new applications (like being more portable, allowing access to Powers without transformation, can transfer Powers wirelessly) but it will come with other problems (no tools, no superhuman physical boost, no built-in Kwami storage requiring external devices). The only exception is aesthetics, which can be modified without any trade-off."
1625,,400,Blade Blacksmith,High School DxD,Making ,"This Sacred Gear is something of an ‘older brother’ to Sword Birth, having an identical effect save for the fact the weapons summoned are Holy Swords, thus making it terrifyingly effective against Devils or other unholy creatures like the Fallen. It’s also notable in that it can potentially develop multiple Balance Breakers, such as summoning knights to wield said Holy Swords or make a gigantic dragon made entirely of said weapons. Who knows? Perhaps that potential can be unlocked in your hands, as well..."
1626,,400,Sword Birth ,High School DxD,Making ,"A fan of swords, are we? Well, if blades are your bones, this Sacred Gear has you covered. This Sacred Gear takes the appearance of any sword you can think of, but its true power is being able to create any number of Demon Swords from any surface a certain distance from the user. These Demon Swords are magical weapons that are astoundingly effective against the ‘holy’, such as the Angels in Heaven. Should you unlock this Gear’s Balance Breaker, you may even create unique Demon Swords with specific abilities made to counter a particular race or type of enemy, or utilize different elements together."
1627,,400,Special Grade Cursed Tool(400),Jujutsu Kaisen,Making ,"By purchasing this option, you receive a cursed tool imbued with one of the abilities from the cursed technique section, allowing you to wield it through this item. The exact form of your cursed tool, as well as how it specifically interacts with the cursed technique it carries, is up to you. Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

The price for such an object is equal to the original cost of the cursed technique.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1628,,400,Black Rope ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making ,"A cursed tool crafted by a clan of African sorcerers over the course of several decades, the Black Rope is exactly what its name implies: a piece of black rope, several metres in length. It’s a rather versatile tool, strong enough to let you swing off of lamp posts, grab objects from afar to fling them, and strike others like a whip. Its real draw, however, is that the rope has the ability to cancel out any cursed technique it comes into contact with. Even a defence on the level of Limitless’ infinity could be easily bypassed by it.
 
That said, it does have a weakness: each time it’s used to interfere with a cursed technique, a part of it burns away. Each individual use only destroys a small amount, but over the course of a fast-paced yet protracted battle, it might not be long until it’s significantly shorter than it was before. Fortunately for you, your version of the Black Rope has the ability to repair itself, slowly regenerating black to its full length over time."
1629,,400,G Warstaff,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making ,"You’re able to summon a cursed tool in the form of a spear with a pen-like head. While nothing special all on its own, your cursed technique only really comes into effect once you draw land a hit on your opponent using it. So long as you manage to draw blood, a manga panel will appear on their chest. This will allow you to see into their near future, their upcoming movements appearing before your very eyes overlaid onto present reality. At first you’ll only be able to be see a second into their future, but with each subsequent your foresight will extend by a further second.

The only real flaw in this technique is that your technique only works based on what you can see. As such, if your opponent’s future self does something outside of your current line of sight, you won’t be able to foresee what they’ll do until you look at them again. As such, if your opponents know about this technique it might be prudent to watch your blind spots."
1630,,400,Corpse Curser,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making ,"The concept of cursed corpses, non-living objects imbued with a curse in order to animate them, has already been mentioned previously. While the exact methods sorcerers use to create them are not known, it seems to be a rather complicated art, as very few sorcerers have been shown to be capable of it. That, or they think it not worth their time. Those believing the latter, however, would be very wrong to. After all, the skill of Masamichi Yaga, the undisputed master of cursed corpse creation, was so great that the leaders of jujutsu society strongly considered declaring him a special grade sorcerer.

Now, you too possess not only the knowledge to create cursed corpses, but a level of skill comparable to Yaga. Be it plush dolls, mechanical automata, or animal corpses, you’re capable of taking anything with an even vaguely animal-like or humanoid form, imbue it with your cursed energy, and turn it into a cursed corpse. These creations follow any commands you give them and, optionally, can be imbued with pre-determined orders as if programming them with your cursed energy. Depending on how much cursed energy you’re willing to invest, your cursed corpses can be anywhere from the strength of a regular human to having special grade levels of output, though naturally the latter would take an extortionate investment. Once the cursed energy imbued in them runs out, or their core is destroyed, they become inert.

Cursed corpses created using the above method can have complex behaviours depending on how you make them, but at the end of the day they lack true intelligence. But you’re capable of more than that – you also know the method to create Abrupt-Mutated Cursed Corpses. That is, cursed corpses that are not only sapient, but are capable of generating their own cursed energy, making them completely self-sufficient. They also possess three cores instead of one, all of which must be destroyed to put them down, thus making them a lot harder to destroy than regular cursed corpses. Naturally, however, such a method is much more difficult and time-consuming than creating regular cursed corpses. Perhaps you won’t be the most powerful of sorcerers personally, but what does that matter when you can just throw an army you built with your own hands at any who’d face you?"
1631,,400,Ribbon,Final Fantasy VII,Making ,"It looks very modest, but believe me when I say this single ribbon (color of your choosing) will be extremely useful in battle. The person who wears this will find themselves completely immune to 'status effects' in battle. Your body can't be poisoned, your mind can't be charmed or taken control of, nor will instant death effects have any impact on your body. In short, things that mess with your mind or body have no sway over you. If your enemy wants you dead, they have to do it the old-fashioned way: Violence. This doesn't apply to positive effects applied to you by yourself or your allies."
1632,,400,Harvesting Gun,Legends of Runeterra,Making ,"The jungle of Ixtal is choke full of natural treasures. It would be a shame to leave them here, but even more of a shame to destroy it recklessly. The Harvesting Gun is... well, a gun, but by pointing it toward a plant or animal the gun will ‘absorb’ it, ready to release it in a second moment. Repeatedly. You can pretty much fill entire green houses and zoos with this. The gun doesn’t work on anything blatantly supernatural, but it grants a pretty much infinite amount of rare plants and animals. Sure, you have to have a place where to put these specimens. Speaking of which..."
1633,,400,Spiritual Jade ,Legends of Runeterra,Making ,"This slab of jade, shaped in any way you wish, is soaked with the power of the Spirit World, hence the name. If you’re attuned to the Spirit World, you can use this jade to reinforce that connection and command the vast power of the spirits. Just be careful, for the jade only works if you’re in harmony with the Spirit World. The moment you cause a strong imbalance between the mortal world and the Spirit one, the jade will lose all powers, only to be recovered in the next Jump. Thread carefully."
1634,,400,Vein of True Ice,Legends of Runeterra,Making ,"True Ice is a magical material only found in Freljord. It’s ice so cold it cannot be melted, but it can be fashioned into weapons, granting them ice-related abilities like creating ice arrows if put on a bow. You now possess a True Ice crystal of notable size that you can use for whatever you like. Just be careful, True Ice is lethal for non-Icerborn and even for them, it’s painful to touch. The True Ice will regrow with time, giving you an infinite reserve of magical ice."
1635,,400,Grand Statue,Legends of Runeterra,Making ,"The first thing you’ll notice in a Demacian City are the large statues that decorate the place, white and gold. Most of them are purely decorative, but others have specific functions. Like this one. This statue can have any shape, but it will always be made of white stone with golden metal for decoration, and it will emit an aura that will bolster morale and generally make things go smoother. The aura can cover a small city."
1636,,400,Legendary Artifact,Legends of Runeterra,Making ,"This is the stuff. Legendary artifacts are not something you can just find laying around. The Blade of the Ruined King, the Staff of Ages, these are artifacts that grant great power to the user. Choose one and take it with you."
1637,,400,Greater Armor,Fairy Fencer F,Making ,This is an exceptional suit of armor with even greater capabilities. Comes with two special resistances and a bonus to ability chosen with purchase. Can be merged with your Unique Outfit.
1638,,400,Belt of Beloth the Wise,Inheritance Cycle,Making ,"Known to some as The Belt of The Twelve Stars, it’s a long black and blue sword belt. Pulling on a tassel at the end of the belt reveals twelve diamonds, four of the stones are black, four are white and the remainder are red, blue, yellow, as well as brown. Together these stones are able to store an almost unlimited amount of magical energy. The belt itself is warded against scrying and cannot be detected by mystical means, no matter how much power may be stored within it."
1639,,400,Sword-wielding Swordsman’s Sword        ,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making ,"A sword for a swordsman, fitting your preferred style. Whatever this is, it is clearly a sword. A six shooter, a surfboard, a magic wand, an actual sword- all are undeniably ‘swords’. Your sword here is a useful one, similar to Billy the Kid’s thunderer as being a fairly potent magical tool. You won’t be shooting down any starships but it’ll serve you well in a fight. Whatever you pick will also always count as a ‘sword’, however that might end up being useful for you. Even if people protest and say it is clearly just a gun. And not even a gunsword. 

An extra 300,000CP, for 400,000 total, gets you a sword that really matters. Short of the legendary Holy Sword itself, you can pick just about anything. A rainbow blade that calls down the fury of a god of war, a fairy made weapon that burns with the fury of the sun, even a shield imbued with the power of an entire nation. We all know that if you can make a sword, you can also make shields. Your ‘sword’ will definitely be one of the strongest weapons around, enough to threaten even powerful Servants. Servant Automobile Federation"
1640,,400,Capable Equipment,Honkai Impact 3rd,Making ,"You have a set of equipment that is capable of upgrading itself to your level of power to enhance it a little further. For example, if you are able to take small arms fire head-on without even getting bruised, then the equipment would make you immune to larger-caliber bullets. Additionally, this set of equipment can be custom-made according to your specifications, and can be important into anything, as long as it is man-portable (though once it is imported into something, it can only be imported into items of the same type)."
1641,,400,Endless Supply of Soulium,Honkai Impact 3rd,Making ,"You have an endless supply of Soulium. You can summon it in liquid form, as an ingot, or in any shape imaginable, but never as outright weapons or anything like that. You can also summon Soulium Tools, and Soulium Casts. Soulium is an extremely Honkai Energy-conductive material, which is capable of repairing itself, and is extremely good for data storage and computation. It is also extremely durable, and has a very high melting point."
1642,,400,Soul of Thamasa,Final Fantasy VI,Making ,"An orb of seemingly simple, unadorned beauty. A deep blue fire burns inside the glass, roiling and swirling from unseen forces. No mere flame, it is the soul of an ancient Magi who trapped himself inside the orb to assist his brethren. Anyone who holds the orb and casts a spell will discover it replicating the same spell. This duplication costs the holder nothing but is otherwise similar to their spell in every way. However, one is not capable of casting any kind of summoning magic while holding the Soul of Thamasa."
1643,,400,Magicite Creation,Final Fantasy VI,Making ,"The secret the entire world wishes to know is where the Gestahlian Empire gets all the Magicite they need for their weapons of war. It is a secret so well hidden that few suspect it lies beneath Vector itself. An entire factory dedicated to the creation of so valuable an asset as Magicite.

Unfortunately, the truth is far darker than a mechanical process simply refining magic. Magicite is the concentrated essence of an Esper that can only be obtained with the being’s death. That’s right. It’s an entire factory dedicated to experimenting on, draining, and then killing Espers on a massive scale. If one knows that the factory has been running for sixteen years, then it becomes easy to imagine how the Gestahlian Empire has risen to become the power it is today.

And now you know both the truth and the method of creating Magicite. Drain an Esper of its magic, then kill it. But, of course, such a dark secret combined with your unique nature can result in… unique opportunities. If one can drain and kill one magical creature in such a way, why not others? Of course, there’s no telling what kind of power one would get out of such an experimental process. Which is part of the fun, isn’t it?"
1644,,400,The Blades of Chaos/The Leviathan Axe,God Of War (2018),Making ,"How in the Nine Realms did you get either of these? Those are the Blades of Chaos, powerful weapons that Kratos once wielded in service to the Greek War God Ares before using them over the years to bring about the downfall of Olympus. They carry in them a fire that can burn even the residents of Helheim, a thing that was thought to be impossible. Best be careful to not let Kratos know you have these, else he will have questions for you that you might not want to answer. And then there is the Leviathan Axe! Ah a mighty weapon indeed, this weapon was infused with the echoing screams of twenty frost trolls giving it great power. It has been inscribed with the runes for ice, allowing it to deal ice damage to its foes, and a rune to recall it to its wielder's hand. Best not to let the Huldra brothers see you using this unless you want to cause a lot of confusion. Both weapons are equivalent to their tier nine version, and they have the space for two Runic Attacks, one light and one heavy, and the pommels are customizable.

1645,,400,"Impossible Things, And Where to Find Them ",God Of War (2018),Making ,"The thing about impossible divine items in mythology is that they typically are made from equally impossible things either to possess or exist, such as a Mountain's Roots, the spirit of Greece, a thunderstorm, or the sound of a cat's footfall. And while these may be possible to obtain in this universe, in other, decidedly more mundane jumps it may truly be impossible. But now you no longer need to fear such things, instead you have the know-how and ability to gather impossible ingredients for your impossible creation no matter where you are. Not only that but you can obtain items that are not typically from mythology, such as the final cry of a dying machine, or the acidic properties of sulfuric acid."
1646,,400,Divine Engineer,God Of War (2018),Making ,"Truly, what you are making is the work of the divine. You now have knowledge of how interdimensional portals such as the Bifrost function, allowing you to craft similar bridges as long as you know the destination. Though keep in mind that they are large things, most of them have been built in the forms of large gates after all."
1647,,400,Pipe of the Five Worldly Senses,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Making ,"Some magical artifacts in this world can be quite powerful. The one you now have in your possession may or may not be one of those. You see, this flute is enchanted, and anyone who hears its music will fall asleep, but only if it’s played with skill. It’s completely indiscriminate, so you’ll have to tell your allies to plug their ears if you don’t want to accidentally put them to sleep during a battle. Thankfully the one playing the flute won’t be affected, letting them keep playing without issue. It’s quite sturdy but is obviously not intended to be used as a weapon, so do be careful, as it’ll only get replaced in a month if you lose it or if it breaks. As a side note, those who know how to play the flute properly will be able to play normally without utilizing its magic, undoubtedly quite useful if it’s the only flute you have."
1648,,400,Royal Seal,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Making ,"You are royalty, but you really should have something to indicate it to the ignorant. Thus, this amulet, engraved gold with an encrusted red jewel. Anyone who sees it on you will immediately know of your social status, although how they react depends on the person. Additionally, it is weirdly functional as a weapon. The more someone disrespects you, your people, or your kingdom, the more damage getting smacked by the amulet seems to do. It won’t be lethal even if someone had spent an entire day mocking you, but it’ll be enough to knock out all but the toughest of mortal men. Additionally, it’s pretty good against evil spirits, repelling them passively and also dealing lethal damage to them if you hit them with the amulet. The amulet will find itself back to you within a week if you lose it, and will be swiftly repaired if it’s broken. Perhaps you could use this as the symbol of your bloodline?"
1649,,400,High-Class Tier Holy Swords,DxD Universe,Making ,"This is where the good shit is, here you will find stuff like Ascalon, Durandal and the Grass Cutter, stuff that could fuck up even a ultimate devil. You can pick a canonical one or make a new one.

You can pick a canonical one or make a new one.

1651,,400,Poison/Antidote,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Making ,"Well, isn’t this interesting? You could use the mysterious contents of this jar as a potent magical reagent, a deadly poison capable of killing Servants, or the antidote to any other poison. While the exact composition of this thing is a mystery, its most fascinating property is that you could inject someone with it as an antidote pre-emptively to any poison being used, granting them effective immunity to the first poison they get exposed to. Or use it after they get poisoned, which will instead cure them instantly and give them a massive boost of energy they can put to good use."
1652,,400,Easily Overlooked Sword ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Making ,"Well, it’s sharp, and pointy, and you can use it to cut and stab things. It doesn’t shoot sword beams or anything like that and appears entirely mundane if well made. Others wouldn’t realise it’s actually capable of hurting a Servant, being just magical enough to count – maybe it’s an unnamed Noble Phantasm? Either way, even your opponents will forget you had this thing if you can get them distracted by using another sword or being flashy with magical beams and landscape-altering attacks, and that might give you just enough time to tip the fight in your favour with this thing. You can even pull it out from behind your back if you don’t want to have it in the sheathe – maybe even you forgot you had it on you until then?"
1653,,400,Harp of the worms sleep ,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making ,With this harp in your hands you shall play songs that put an entire pit of snakes to sleep. Everyone and anything who hears your song shall be calmed and eventually drift into sleep in time. You could calm the murderous rage of many with this.
1654,,400,Potion of memory loss,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making ,"With this potion even great heroes may forget the oaths they swore, the engagements they proclaimed, the love they felt or a grieving widow her sorrow. You can select what specific memory or emotion linked to an event shall be erased with this potion. You will also gain knowledge of how to recreate this potion as well as one that restores lost memory."
1655,,400,The hoard of the Nibelung,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making ,"The Rheingold, the hoard of the kings Nibelung and Schilbung, the most coveted treasure. More than 100 carts full of precious gems and even more full of red gold. People will kill and get killed for this treasure and entire nations will fall because of it. Are you sure you don’t just want to sink it into the Rhine? Your hoard will be safely hidden in a mountain, the exact location of which only you know, guarded by some extremely loyal dwarves. Any of the treasure spent will replenish by the next jump."
1656,,400,Divine Carcass ,Witch on the Holy Night,Making ,"The corpse you found somewhere in the wilderness could either be breathtakingly beautiful, the pinnacle of the human form and then some, or an incomprehensible distortion to reason and logic. No matter, it is what is left of a god. Less than a Divine Spirit, less even than an Elemental, yet unmistakeably steeped in Mystery predating the rise of mankind. It’s blood, it’s spinal fluid, it’s bile-all of them are unspeakably valuable as reagents for rites in the world of magecraft. A certain witch might find a particular use for its abdominal fat. Best of all, not only does the thing not rot but it regenerates it’s parts slowly when left alone-taking perhaps a month to regenerate a major organ.

…

...it’s probably dead, and whether or not that was a wink you saw just now it’s guaranteed not to move or resist unless you attempt to revive it with a greater magecraft ritual or something. It’s anyone’s guess what it would do if it was. The gods are fickle, not least when diminished into something technically less than one."
1657,,400,Sealed Creatrix,Witch on the Holy Night,Making ,"You’re a polymath of all things magical yes, that much should be obvious to anyone who knows of you, and even without any particular knowledge about a given field learning and picking up more comes easier to you than most modern magi. However, there is one area where you really shine: The creation of Mystic Codes-artifacts created by magecraft which supplement magic users and have various properties of their own. From designing your own mystic eyes to implant into others, to creating and patenting a form of broomstick-based flight your genius at innovating on magical principles of all kinds ensures that innovating your magic items is second nature to you. But your most terrifying capability is a gift for reverse engineering other magic items. From the most advanced works of man to the legacy of a long-lost god, with enough study, resources and patience creating simulacrae of wonders long lost to the modern age is well within your reach."
1658,,400,Atelier        ,Library of Ruina,Making ,"Even before touching upon singularities, there is a great deal of fascinating technology available in the City. Tattoos that reinforce your muscles to superhuman degrees, weapons that act as another limb, chainsaw swords that are somehow actually practical, and clothes that will stop attacks that would pierce steel. All this and more are available to you, as someone who’s trained as an armorer, be it for a Wing, Workshop, or some other organization. What’s more, due to the not infrequent desire for quality feedback, many Workshops end up taking to the field to test their devices"
1659,,400,Carnival Phantasm,Library of Ruina,Making ,"Many of the crafts and trades of the City involve human sacrifice, either literal or metaphorical. But perhaps one of the more interesting examples of this is the Carnival’s tailoring business, which makes grand and extremely protective clothes by eating people. Admittedly you don’t need to actually consume them, but the process is much the same, rendering down flesh and blood into fine silks, with efficacy varying based upon the materials you use. A normal human might be merely bullet resistant, while someone with high end augments might provide protections highly sought after throughout the city. In the event your materials possessed exotic powers, the resulting silk will of course incorporate them to further aid in looking dashing while also ensuring the wearer is well protected"
1660,,400,Evil Eye,HighSchool DxD,Making ,"Medusa's Eye, a special eye that previously belonged to one of the Gorgons, who had snakes for hair and the ability to petrify anyone who came into eye contact with her. This eye is a special eye that allows the user to petrify anything or anyone that the user looks at with the eye. It could even petrify the Scale Mail and other beings a couple tiers above your hit level. Unlike the original Medusa, you have control over what is affected by the petrification. Sadly, because it’s a prosthetic eye, you need to replace one of your eyes to fully use it. Likewise, since it originates from a Gorgon, it can be damaged by stuff geared towards snakes."
1661,,400,Unlocked Wristbands,HighSchool DxD,Making ,"See this collection of bracelets? They are similar to the ones made by Azazel, leader of the Grigori, and have several functions added to them. For example, they could help you control a Sacred Gear that’s too powerful to properly wield, like Gasper’s Forbidden Valor View. These could also help you channel and concentrate your own mana, allowing the user to reach new transformations or techniques. Similarly, they can be used to offset any drawbacks when drawing power from an artifact, much like the Balance Breaker of the Boosted Gear before mastery. All in all, a decent set to have, doubly so to help out someone who is still training."
1662,,400,World Arts,HighSchool DxD,Making ,"Sure, the Sacred Gears are pretty broken by themselves, being quite difficult to take out unless one has some soul powers, granting a pretty ability. Though the biggest advantages are the Balance Breakers and Sub-species the users might unlock, those can be pretty broken. To even out things, you have found a way to imitate such a power, now you’re able to push other weapons and artifacts into a ‘Balance Breaker’-like state, as well as letting them develop sub-species eventually. You can affect items at will, which means that you could easily give this to the weapons of all your army, although it’s not ensured they would all end up with the same Balance Breaker, nor with the same skill at using them."
1663,,400,I Send My Sword,HighSchool DxD,Making ,"Something many forget in this age is that it was the hand of God that created the Sacred Gears, and granted them to humans so that they may work miracles on the world. The secrets of this art died with Him, but the impact they leave on the world has echoed throughout time and history. You have gained a shadow of this art, with the ability to forge Holy Blades...not True Holy Blades, but powerful weapons that burn away the infernal and cut deeply against Devils or wicked creatures. More than that, you have a sense of others besides yourself who can shape the course of history if granted such a weapon, or any power you can pass to them, and a very accurate idea of how they will change the world around them for better or worse. All it will take is a mysterious, angelic figure granting them what they need when the moment calls for it. In time, you may be able to forge True Holy Blades after some trial and error, forging kin to legendary weapons such as Durandal and Excalibur."
1664,,400,Hallelujah Overdrive,HighSchool DxD,Making ,"You know, if things proceed as they should, then certain super devil will end up using shards of the Boosted Gear’s Scale Mail and the powers of the Sephirot Graal to create copies of that Longinus; on a similar note, Azazel’s research will also enter a stage where he can produce mid-ranked artificial sacred gears without issue. This process, the reverse-engineering of legendary weapons and artifacts in order to mass produce lesser versions of them, is something you are now well acquainted with. You only need a decent sample of the original to start creating some amazing toys. The possibilities are really only limited by what you can get your hands on."
1665,,400,+2 Weapon,The Voynich Hotel,Making ,"These should not exist in this modern age. They are an artifact of a time when magic was much more common and battles were waged between those with defenses much more potent than mere steel plates. How they came to be on offer is a secret best kept in the dark. The devils would not be happy to learn their armory has been plundered. This pair of prosthetic limbs look exactly like normal flesh and blood versions but are so much more. They are packed to the rafters with blades so sharp you could cut through flesh, muscle, even bone like a hot knife through butter. Now then, the only choice left to you is which two limbs you would like them to replace. Arms or legs or one of each, it’s up to you. Don’t worry, their installation will be tolerably painful. You shouldn’t lose consciousness more than once or twice."
1666,,400,Urn of Olympus,God of War,Making ,"An urn depicting the gods of Olympus, it smells of wine and ozone. By placing a drop of your blood within, you create an inseparable connection between you and the urn, granting you a most potent ability. Your magical energy will rapidly regenerate so quickly that, no matter how large your reserves are, it almost appears as if you have an infinite amount. Very useful for those who prefer to sling spells around instead of blades."
1667,,400,Shield of Helios,God of War,Making ,"The titan of the sun, Helios, sided with the Olympians early on in the Titanomachy, that great war of yore. You now find yourself in possession of his golden shield, as resplendent as the sun itself. Not only is it indestructible, but it can emit a blinding light at will, so brilliant that not even gods can gaze upon it. Additionally, you will find that any magic that impacts this shield will be sent back towards the caster."
1668,,400,Ring of Hephaestus,God of War,Making ,"All works by the god of smiths is a thing of intricate beauty and power, and this ring is no different. While wearing this bronze ring, you will find that anything you create will have both their quality and potency greatly improved beyond what should be possible for you. Additionally, such works will be far more durable and resistant to the passage of time, ensuring your works will last millennia."
1669,,400,Armlet of Hercules,God of War,Making ,"A bronze band with twelve gems embedded into it, each of them representing one of Hercules' twelve mythical labors. While wearing this armlet, which will change in size to best fit the wearer, it will imbue them with the strength of the greatest greek hero, allowing them to throw massive boulders as if they were pebbles. Additionally, they will increase your skills in unarmed fighting, making it so that when you are disarmed, you are never out of options."
1670,,400,Lessons of Daedalus,God of War,Making ,"The creator of the Labyrinth was a brilliant mind almost without peer, creating marvels that boggle the minds of most. But not you, for you are one of the few who could prove to be a match. Not only are you a masterful stonemason and architect, but your engineering skills lend themselves well for puzzles and convoluted traps. Creating a maze capable of shifting itself around on its own would be quite easy for someone like you, so long as you've got the resources and manpower to do so."
1671,,400,Armour of Zeldron,Adventure Time,Making ,"An excellent, enchanted, almost impervious but ridiculous breastplate and helmet."
1672,,400,Curse of the Five Wyrms,Final Fantasy III,Making ,"A large, magical mirror and five statues of wyrms. Not exactly the most portable set up, but a powerful set of artefacts nonetheless. Any you trick into entering the area with the mirror and statues can be sealed within the mirror, unable to be freed unless five people of pure heart arrive with the intention of freeing them. Of course a sufficiently powerful being could resist this curse, and at the end of a jump the mirror dumps out whoever was sealed within."
1673,,400,Not Quite Ultima Weapon,Final Fantasy III,Making ,"A full set of unique, mithril armour and a mithril weapon. They are designed to your specifications and carry powerful enchantments placing them just short of unique class items and the ultima weapon."
1674,,400,Supply of Special Metals ,Final Fantasy III,Making ,"A whole variety of special ores for crafting magical weapons, including a large supply of mithril and enough orichalcum to create a single ultima weapon. All material will replenish when used up except the orichalcum, which will restore at the beginning of every jump."
1675,,400,{CLASS} SERVANT ACTUALIZATION ,Fate/Apocrypha,Making ,"Servants are fundamentally spirits. They’re the highest class of spirits, of course, but they still lack physical bodies even when manifesting. With this purchase, you can change that. What this is is a vessel to house powerful spirits. As a Servant you may choose to incarnate into it directly, or leave it empty for offering to someone else. Being incarnated brings a bunch of benefits, such as not needing a Master to remain in the world and being able to generate magical energy yourself like living beings. It also means you need to sleep and eat, although whether that’s a benefit is arguable. You can freely choose the nature of your incarnation as well. Maybe it’ll simply be your body, maybe you still have the mind of the person whose body you’re inhabiting in the back of your head to witness what you do and provide commentary, or perhaps something more similar to Sieg. Whatever the case, you certainly won’t need to worry about fading away once the war ends as a Servant."
1676,,400,Incomplete Noble Phantasm,Fate/Apocrypha,Making ,"A Noble Phantasm being incomplete is not as much of a downside as you might think. In fact, it could be said to be better than a complete Noble Phantasm, from a certain point of view. That is because when completed, such Noble Phantasms no longer require the Master or the Servant to continue existing. For example, the golem Keter Malkuth, Noble Phantasm of Avicebron, can simply draw mana from the earth below its feet to sustain itself. With this purchase, you have one such Noble Phantasm, in addition to any others you might already have. Or perhaps this is the only Noble Phantasm you possess. It’s your decision. It’ll require plenty of expensive and powerful materials to construct, but it’s definitely not impossible to gather everything you need fast enough to matter in the Great Holy Grail War if you have wealthy backers. Aside from the Noble Phantasm, you also have a talent for making normally temporary powers, such as Noble Phantasms, permanent in a similar way, through sufficient sacrifice of appropriate materials. Obviously, the more powerful you want the end result to be, the more powerful the resources you’ll need. But of course, with sufficient wealth, resources aren’t a big problem, are they?"
1677,,400,Trinkets of Servitude,Hades,Making ,"Objects hold power in this world, each one as unique as their giver and the situation under which they are granted. Some are tokens of obligation given to those who offer unexpected gifts. Others are mementos of friendship, love, or loyalty. These three come from the servants of the house of hades, each one dedicated to their assigned tasks and loyal to the house in their own way.

Harpy Feather Duster: Dusa is a constant presence in theHouse ofHades, usually only seen from a distance or too hard at work to be disturbed. She is a shy soul who throws herself into her cleaning tasks with a fervor that no other canmatch. One would hardly expect a single bodiless gorgon head to be able to keep the entire household spotless, but she manages it without complaint. This feather duster is filled with the same vigor and energy that she spends on a daily basis. Those who carry it with them will discover small wounds occasionally closing of their own accord or bursts of energy refilling their flagging stamina.

Distant Memory: Orpheus usually sits off to one side of Hades’ throne, a patch of dark gloom in the otherwise bright room.His sadness is a result of his own failed attempt to save his beloved muse. Despite his failure and the distance that now separates him from his love, he still hangs onto the faint hope that she will forgive him for his failure. This small jar holds a fraction of that love, faintly glowing, ever hopeful. It allows one to strike more effectively despite long distances, enabling bow and artifice and spell to deal moderately more damage to those they strike at range.

Lucky Tooth: Skelly is an odd creature whose master is unknown to all. EvenHades does not know where the animated skeleton originated from, though he is loath to admit it to any but his most trusted warriors. He chatters recklessly and relentlessly with an energy of one that knows that their death will never be their end even if violence is visited upon him. This silver capped tooth holds a trace of his deathless nature at its core. Once each ten years, when the holder would be struck down, they will instead arise a moment later. Not entirely unharmed but certainly healed of a vast majority of their injuries."
1678,,400,Trinkets of Might,Hades,Making ,"Objects hold power in this world, each one as unique as their giver and the situation under which they are granted. Some are tokens of obligation given to those who offer unexpected gifts. Others are mementos of friendship, love, or loyalty. These three were previously owned by the warriors of the house of hades. Each one driven by honor, willing to put their lives and strength against anything that would dare threaten their Lord Hades.

Myrmidon Bracer: Achilles, ever the stalwart and loyal soldier, serves the House of Hades for reasons known only to the god and himself. A bargain that he refuses to attempt to break or even bend in the slightest. Yet he has helped raise and train Zagreus with a fondness that borders on fatherly care. This steel bracer is a token left over from his life as a warrior, when he brooked no retreat and offered no mercy to his enemies. Those who wear it will discover it is much easier to defend against assaults they meet head-on, but that attacks slipping in from behind will sting slightly more.

Skull Earring: Megaera is the most civilized of the three Fury Sisters and the only one allowed in theHouse ofHades proper. She has been tasked with punishing the worst of the sinners, those who spent their lives befouling the lives of others.Her duty and loyalty is to the House of Hades first and foremost. She vehemently guards its stability against even internal forces that would threaten it. This dark crystal earring houses some of that tenacious nature. Those who wear it will discover their strength growing the closer to death’s door they are.

Pierced Butterfly: Thanatos is one of the few divinities that regularly traverse the boundary between the world of the living and the Underworld. One of the three aspects of death and certainly the busiest. He is devoted to his Chthonic family, primarily his mother Nyx, and his duty but cares little for the other gods. Save Zagreus, who he cares for a great deal. This charm of crystal and silver speaks of a bond that has yet to be revealed. It can be broken into two halves, each identical, that offer some protection from harm against both parties when they fight together for a common goal."
1679,,400,Trinkets of Souls,Hades,Making ,"Objects hold power in this world, each one as unique as their giver and the situation under which they are granted. Some are tokens of obligation given to those who offer unexpected gifts. Others are mementos of friendship, love, or loyalty. These three originate from some of the more famous residents of the Underworld, each as different in meaning as they are in appearance.

Broken Spearpoint: Patroclus is a sad, brooding soul hidden away from the noise and excitement of Elysium.He sips the waters of the Lethe in an attempt to forget the pains of his past to protect himself from the pain of useless hope. This tip of a spear, now blunt and missing its shaft, is infused with this desire to protect the bearer against further pain. When carried, it offers moderate protection against wounds for a few moments after you have been injured.

Evergreen Acorn: Eurydice, fabled muse of cursed Orpheus, can now be found singing among the lava fields that were once the pleasant fields of Asphodel. She continues her song in spite of her fate, enjoying the music for the simple joy it brings her to do so. This acorn, created in the branches of her own hair, lives with all the same vigor that she does and embodies that vigor for life. Those who hold it close will find their bodies filled with that same vitality, flagging less easily when faced with an extended battle,forced march, or other strenuous exercise.

Shattered Shackle: Sisyphus in life was an arrogant, cunning king who became infamous in the Underworld for cheating death not once, but twice. But no mortal can hide from the three sides of death forever. As punishment for defying Hades and the natural order, he was sentenced to an eternity of punishment within Tartarus. But time more than the torment has changed the man. He is now good-humored, polite, and apologetic for his past transgressions. However, these two hunks of twisted metal remember how he used to curse the gods for the punishment bestowed upon him. Those who carry themand refuse to benefit fromthe boons of divine beings willfind themselves endowed with incredible physical strength."
1680,,400,Trinkets of Darkness,Hades,Making ,"Objects hold power in this world, each one as unique as their giver and the situation under which they are granted. Some are tokens of obligation given to those who offer unexpected gifts. Others are mementos of friendship,love, or loyalty. These three have belonged to the most prominent Chthonic entities living and working in the House ofHades.

Black Shawl: Nyx is not just the incarnation of night itself. In many ways, she is the first mother who ever existed. As cool as she is, she loves those in her care as deeply as if they were her own children. This piece of twilight purple silk embodies not her love, but the maternal ire she is capable of bringing upon those who would harm her children. Carrying this tangible piece of darkness increases the strength of blows delivered to enemies who are not expecting the strike.

Chthonic Coin Purse: Hypnos will never be known as the most dependable of the divine beings.His dreamy, wandering state of mind rarely stays on task for very long. Still, there is something infectious about the cheerful way the Lord of Dreams meets every situation that presents itself. This coinpurse of red silk and gold has a morbid design to it, but giving it a small shake will reveal the cheerful jingle of coins that are just as optimistic as their previous owner. Each day this coin purse will contain a few more coins than the day before. Even empty, it will still jingle.

Bone Hourglass: The Stygian Boatman is many things, but he is not one given to conversation. Those who have tried often come away disappointed. His duty keeps him busy and happy. Or, at least, he doesn’t complain. This hourglass is a symbol of his eternal, unflagging dedication to the task he was assigned and continues to carry out. Those who carry it with them will discover the enchantments they cloak themselves in lasting longer than they otherwise would."
1681,,400,Trinkets of Hades,Hades,Making ,"Objects hold power in this world, each one as unique as their giver and the situation under which they are granted. Some are tokens of obligation given to those who offer unexpected gifts. Others are mementos of friendship, love, or loyalty. These three come from the House of Hades and are as different in intent as they could be.

Old Spiked Collar: Having spent untold decades wrapped around the neck of Cerberus, the tattered red leather and faintly rusted spikes embody the loyalty and dedication that the hound has guarded the gates of the Underworld with. When you carry this trinket around with you, you gain a minor protection against harm born of that loyalty. Enough to turn a sword or two at a critical moment.

Sigil of the Dead: Hades is hardly one to keep useless trinkets about his person. But he has dutifully worn this symbol of his household since its founding. It is seeped in that sense of the rigid control he holds himself to. Those who carry this trinket are capable of turning themselves briefly invisible before it needs to recharge itself. Though why the God of the Underworld would have such a talent is a secret from the past few now know.

Pom Blossom: Strange. This crystalized pomegranate flower should not exist in the Underworld for some time yet. One would suggest not openly wearing it in front of Hades. The questions would be awkward, insistent, and angry. This flower symbolizes the nurturing nature of its owner and their desire to help others grow to their fullest potential. The wearer of this flower will discover themselves more receptive to the blessings, enchantments, and spells of others, able to moderately enhance them simply by accepting them."
1682,,400,Supreme Mystic Code,Fate/Strange Fake,Making ,"Also called Formal Wear, these kinds of items come in many shapes, usages and powers. The exact specifics of this tool are dependent on what kind of magecraft you practice, either via ‘A (Future) Path To The Origin’, ‘Bloodsucker’ or the ‘Living Legend’ purchase. Whatever this tool is, it can either be used to greatly support you in combat, even acting on its own pseudo-personality if you desire so, or improve your spell casting capabilities by acting as a powerful focus or source of magical energy even outside of your homeland."
1683,,400,Alchemical Recipes and Supplies,Final Fantasy I,Making ,"They had to come from somewhere, right? This is a book detailing the recipes for Potions that can magically heal wounds when consumed, and Ethers that restore the magical energies of the user. In addition, the book details how to make stronger versions of these, like Hi-Potions and stronger Ethers, though the pages are encoded and need some time to be deciphered. The book comes with some basic tools needed to brew these, which will be restored if broken or lost like the other items. As a bonus, the ingredients always involve easy-enough materials you will find in worlds beyond this one. How convenient is that?"
1684,,400,Sage’s Surplice,Final Fantasy I,Making ,"Colorless robes that have an eerie glow around them. Unlike the basic Mage robes, these provide not only a fair amount of durability against mundane weapons (able to withstand steel instead of parting easily against it), it will slightly increase the intelligence and magical energy capacity of the user, allowing them to use spells more frequently and efficiently."
1685,,400,Hand of Midas        ,Disney’s Aladdin,Making ,"The magical device called the Hand of Midas is in the shape of an open hand made of gold,at the end of a wooden stick. Keep it carefully, as it’s one of the most sought-after items in the world!

Simply by touching it with the Hand,you can turn anything, man, animal, object to solid, completely pure gold.The only thing this doesn’t work on are Air and Water, everything transforms instantly. While the effect isn’t propagating, the entirety of whatever item is touched is turned instantly.

This never affects you or companions. Unless you want it to, for some reason. After this jump,you can choose not to turn something,as well as turn things back."
1686,,400,Magic Cauldron and Ingredients ,The Little Mermaid,Making ,"You can’t be a Sea Witch without a cauldron! Well, you can... if you’re like Morgana. Fortunately, you aren’t Morgana. This cauldron never boils over, stirs automatically, and keeps your potions from exploding in your face. Comes with all the necessary ingredients (which replenish over time when used) and spell books."
1687,,400,Carian Regal Scepter,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making ,"Magic scepter of Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon. The glintstone is known as a Carian Blue, enhancing full moon sorceries. Only those of the highest intelligence may wield this, the finest of all glintstone staves, and will find the potency of all of their sorceries greatly enhanced in all aspects. By channeling magic directly into the glintstone, you can suspend the scepter in mid air and cause it to spin violently. Those it touches will suffer successive magic attacks."
1688,,400,Vampire Hunting Set        ,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making ,"A set of equipment, perfect for any aspiring vampire hunter.

You have a seemingly endless supply of axes, crosses (which can be ‘boomeranged’ back to you), and vials of holy water (which create temporary pillars of fire when thrown at the ground). You will always be able to produce these when needed.

Perhaps most importantly, you have a copy of the aptly-named ‘Vampire Killer’, a whip with an amazing reach. Should it be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear 24 hours later in your Warehouse.

All of these weapons are especially effective when used against vampires, or similar creatures."
1689,,400,Minecraft Item Set,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making ,"A set of items that seem like they have been pulled right out of a videogame.

You have a Crafting Table. This box-like object is a useful surface to craft tools on. It can be immediately summoned to your position with but a moment of concentration. If destroyed, a new one will appear in the same position a few moments later.

You have a set of flint and steel that never wears out. When used, it will create a burst of flame instead of a mere spark, but this flame will disappear quickly, and will not spread. You have a fishing rod, which is sturdy enough to be used to hook and reel in other fighters. You have a piston, which launches foes away from you and combos well with the fishing rod. You have a set of wings, called Elytra, which will allow you to glide for a small period of time, before automatically falling off. If you possess the Mine, Craft, Create perk, they may be automatically put back into your personal inventory, but may not be retrieved again until after you have landed. You have a durable wooden shield in order to help you block attacks. You have a comfortable bed in case you are in need of a rest. You have a set of instructions on how to craft various objects from Minecraft. Most can be crafted on the fly if you have the appropriate resources, though the tools will require the use of your Crafting Table to craft, upgrade and repair them. See the Notes section for the full list of craftable objects these instructions cover. These items can be stored in your personal inventory that comes as part of the Mine, Craft, Create perk. Should any of these items be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours.

You have an endless supply of Magma Blocks, which you can pull out whenever you need them. These cubes of hot magma only cause harm upon direct contact, and do not do so until properly placed, allowing you to safely position them without issue. Only one Magma Block can be out at a time; putting out a new one will cause the exiting one to vanish. If you possess the Mine, Craft, Create perk, you will be able to place your Magma Blocks in the same way as the your created block, with them remaining in place and resisting any force moving them until they are destroyed.

You have an endless supply of Lava Buckets, which you can pull out whenever you need them. These iron buckets are able to safely hold lava, which can be poured out as an attack. This lava will only cause harm upon direct contact, and will disappear quickly after leaving the bucket.

You have an endless supply of firework rockets, which you can pull out whenever you need them. Aside from being a fun distraction, these rockets can be effectively combined with your Elytra, providing you with some initial momentum to begin your glide.

You have an endless supply of wooden fences, which you can pull out whenever you need them. You are limited to only having four of these out at a time, with newer fences being placed causing the oldest fences to disappear. A useful application of these fences is to use them to box in opponents you have pulled in close with your fishing rod.

Lastly, you have a wooden sword, axe, pickaxe and shovel. These items will break fairly easily, and will not be replaced should that occur, so use them wisely.

The following item recipes are given to you via the Minecraft Item Set:
• Anvil: Requires a unit of Iron. Best used to drop on your enemies.
• Minecart: Requires a unit of Iron. Can be used for quick transport, or to dash into enemies, but requires rails to do so.
• Rails: Requires dirt, wood, stone or iron. Must be placed in order to use Minecart effectively.
• Powered Rails: Requires gold and redstone. Accelerates a Minecraft passing through it to further increase its effectiveness.
• TNT: Requires lower grade materials such as sand, dirt, or stone. This block of explosives deals serious damage, and can be used both offensively, but takes a long time to explode. It can be set off faster with physical force, fire, or use of a pressure plate.
• Pressure Plate: Requires lower grade materials such as sand, dirt, or stone. This plate will set off nearby TNT if stepped on.
• Redstone circuit: Requires redstone. This can be used to connect TNT to a faraway pressure plate, enabling the TNT to be used more effectively.
• Tools (Sword, Axe, Pickaxe, Shovel): These tools are crafted as sets, and require different materials depending on the type of material you wish the tool to be. You have recipes for wooden, stone, iron, gold, and diamond tool sets. These tools must be crafted at a Crafting Table. Generally, the better the material, the better the tool, though gold tools work slightly differently. Gold tools are only as strong as wooden tools, and break quickly, but can be swung noticeably faster than the other tools. Your tools can either be used as weapons, or to help you acquire more resources. The tools are not designed for long-term use and will often break, requiring you to craft additional ones. If you possess the Mine, Craft, Create perk, you may store one of each tool (ignoring the material it is made from) within the personal inventory that comes with the perk."
1690,,400,"Mine, Craft, Create",Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making ,"By hitting a non-living surface, you are able to ‘mine’ it for various material resources found in Minecraft, including wood, dirt, stone, iron, gold, diamonds and redstone. You can choose when you are and when you are not ‘mining’ with your hits. When mining, you can choose to deal no lasting damage to the surface; when doing so the surface will display a pixelated, cracked pattern, which will vanish a few moments after you cease mining. By using an appropriate tool for the surface in question, such as a shovel for dirt, an axe for wood, or a pickaxe for stone, you can speed up the rate at which you receive resources. You may decide when mining whether you wish to receive a balanced spread of resources at a standard rate, or whether to have the type of surface you are mining weigh the type of resources in a particular direction. If you are choosing the latter, the speed at which you receive resources will also be influenced by the type of surface you are mining; softer surfaces such as dirt will generate resources faster, and harder surfaces such as metal will generate resources slower. In some locations, dirt will be replaced by sand, ice, or wool, though these will functionally act the same as your dirt resource.

Mined resources will be automatically stored in a personal inventory system. This inventory will allow for a small supply of each type of mined resource, except for gold and diamonds, which you may only store a single unit of. Excess resources will be automatically discarded, and will disappear.

By expending these resources, you will be able to automatically and instantly craft various objects. Learning to do so may prove challenging without pre-existing instructions, but it is not impossible.

Additionally, by expending a small quantity of dirt, wood, stone, or iron, you are able to create a block, approximately a cubic metre in size. This block will remain in the place it is created, and cannot be moved, whether by a person or by effects such as gravity. These blocks can however be destroyed, and will also rapidly degrade and vanish after a few moments. Blocks made of more durable materials are harder to destroy, and will last longer before degrading."
1691,,400,Nab-Sack,Wizarding World,Making ,"Behold the Nab-Sack! The perfect magical tool for anyone seeking to protect magical beasts and creatures everywhere! Simply open the bag and it’ll suck up any beast you might encounter, from mooncalves to hippogriffs and even dragons! And you won’t ever have to worry about running out of space in the bag. You can stuff as many animals as you want inside and you won’t even have to worry about them getting hurt or growing old.

Of course, the Nab-Sack isn’t perfect. You can’t just point it any old creature and expect them to get sucked right in. No, it takes time for that to happen and while you can suck in mooncalves in five or so seconds, that time will only grow longer and longer for the larger the beast grows. Something like a Thestral will already take nearly a minute. Imagine how much longer a dragon will take.

Finally, if you are pursuing a more criminal line of work... well, a never-ending black hole of a bag certainly sounds useful for such things, don’t they?"
1692,,400,Deluminator ,Wizarding World,Making ,"Now just how did you get your hands on this? This little thing, resembling a rather fancy cigarette lighter, is the Deluminator and it is the proud creation of one Albus Dumbledore, quite possibly the greatest wizard of the modern age. Fittingly enough, this device is quite powerful indeed. At the most basic level, the Deluminator can take away and put back light from any source, whether it be technological or magical.

Second, whenever your name is mentioned in a conversation, the Deluminator will play back a snippet of the conversation to you. Activate the Deluminator at this point and you will safely be apparated into location, enough to ensure that you may never be separated from your friends again.

Finally, there is the Deluminator’s most powerful ability. With this, you may transport yourself and others into a mirror dimension of sorts. Within this world, you may battle to your heart’s content, with no risk to the people and the world beyond. Albus Dumbledore truly was a genius if he could make something like this. Why not follow in his footsteps, at least in this regard?"
1693,,400,Time-Turner ,Wizarding World,Making ,"Time is a very complicated subject and there are no shortage of scholars aching to study its depths. To facilitate such research, Time-Turners were created, magical hour-glasses enchanted with an Hour-Reversal Charm. With a single turn of the clock, time is reversed by an hour. Sadly, it is restricted so that you will only be able to travel back five hours, in the interests of keeping the world safe from calamitous disasters of a time-related nature."
1694,,400,Philosopher’s Stone,Wizarding World,Making ,"Throughout history, humanity, both Muggles and wizards alike, have been fascinated by gold. Alchemists, both magical and mundane, have sought ways to create the shining substance. And yet, only one alchemist ever succeeded in doing so. Only the great Nicolas Flamel had ever achieved the skill necessary and created the Philosopher’s Stone. But what is the Philosopher’s Stone? What magic does it hold and what can it do?

For starters, with the Stone, any metal can be transformed into the purest of gold, an impossibility for all others. But most importantly, even beyond the gold, the Philosopher’s Stone is the key to the Elixir of Life, the key to eternal life. And used properly, the Elixir of Life could even be used to create a new body for a disembodied soul.

Do not let anyone know that you have this. There will be many questions for you and there is no shortage of unsavory folk who would be willing to do just about anything to take it away from you."
1695,,400,Horcrux,Wizarding World,Making ,"Throughout all of history, there have been no shortages of dark wizards to be found. From Morgan le Fay to Gellert Grindelwald, there is not one point in time where you could not find a dark witch or wizard lurking in the shadows. But even amongst them, there was magic that was shunned by all but darkest witches and wizards. And there is no magic more infamous than the accursed creation of a Horcrux. To create a Horcrux is to tear at your soul, to split apart the very essence of your being. Only two wizards have ever been known to commit the vile act. You are the third.

A part of your soul has been placed within a small object of your choice and so long as this object remains intact, your soul can never truly leave this mortal plane, even should your body be rendered into nothing more than dust in the wind. Of course, the Horcrux alone cannot reconstitute your shattered form. Fortunately, the part of your soul within the Horcrux is mighty enough that should someone come into contact with your Horcrux, the soul within can take possession of them if their will proves weaker than yours. And should that never occur, the other half of your soul may do the same, as weakened as it is from your form’s destruction.

Still, it would be best for you to hide away or protect this precious piece of your soul. With its enchantments, the Horcrux is nearly indestructible but nearly is a far cry from completely. There are many methods in this world alone to destroy a Horcrux. Who knows how many more you might come across in your travels?"
1696,,400,One of Three,Wizarding World,Making ,"There is a story. A Tale of Three Brothers. A legend told through the ages of three brothers who conquered Death and were each in turn, given a reward. To the brothers, Death gave them three artifacts, artifacts that would soon be known as the Deathly Hallows. Three relics of such magic and might that countless souls have sought them for centuries. And yet, there are others who believe that the Deathly Hallows were not of Death’s design but rather that of the three brothers whose skills were unmatched by any before or since. Until now.

The Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw. The Crown of Mneme. The fabled Deathly Hallows. All these legendary artifacts share one thing in common. They are unique, brought into being by craftsmen who’ve found themselves in a league of their own. Craftsmen much like you. And like them, your creations are greater than those built by the common man. More durable, more effective, better.

But more importantly, by pouring your blood, sweat, tears and magic into your craftsmanship, your creations can become... unique. Much like how the Resurrection Stone could call upon shades of the fallen, the things you can create can bear powers never before seen in this world. Regardless of the form your creations take, rest assured that they shall find a place within legends and myth."
1697,,400,Enchantment,Wizarding World,Making ,"Any two-bit witch or wizard can cast charms on an object. After all, most magical folk learn about them in their very first year of school and sometimes, even before then. It takes a more skilled sorcerer to create an enchanted item. Things like invisibility cloaks, crystal balls, Bludgers, Golden Snitches, and many more. And you shall be that sorcerer.

You see, so long as a magical item is something that isn’t unique or exorbitantly rare, you’ll be able to recreate it. For example, while you wouldn’t be able to recreate anything like the Deathly Hallows, at least not without a mind-boggling amount of both talent and time, but you will be able to create things like Shield Hats, weather-protective cloaks, cursed amulets, and more.

Not only that, but you now have a keen eye for architecture and the use of magic in such things. With an excessive amount of time, you may even be able to create structures like Hogwarts or any of the other Great Wizarding Schools. It may take time but you are more than equipped to take advantage of that fact. For now, you can rest easy in that you could make a mansion out a tent."
1698,,400,A Simple Wand ,Disney’s Cinderella,Making ,"This is a powerful artifact, the wand of a Fairy Godmother. Normally it would be the key to your powers. You would be powerless without it. But, since you’re the Jumper, I thought we’d take a different path. With this you can allow someone else to use your powers without losing access to them completely. It can contain all your powers, or a select few of them. Your choice who can and can’t use it, and any restrictions that might apply. You may revoke your permission at will and the wand will reappear in your hand or your warehouse."
1699,,400,Crystal Egg Prison,Gummi Bears,Making ,"When someone holds this with both hands they are turned into a crystal statue of themselves while the egg gains a small colored statue of the victim within it. To release the victim you have to place or have the egg in their hands and give them a kiss.

Any kiss will do.

You get a Crystal Egg every month and you can stockpile these and they are reusable."
1700,,400,Enchanting,Gummi Bears,Making ,"You're great at enchanting, both people and items. Your enchanted items don’t require “power/charges” and the enchantment doesn’t degrade over time. Your spells on people can be permanent in effect, letting you change someone's species or form, though you do have several hours before the spell settles in fully and they become significantly harder to transform a second time."
1701,,400,A Glass Coffin,Disney’s Snow White,Making ,"A body that lies within this coffin will not perish. A magical blessing allows those within to rest and recover, requiring no food or water, and healing any injuries or diseases. It can bring back the recently dead, but it will take nearly a year of uninterrupted sleep."
1702,,400,Green Ghost Medallion,Invincible,Making ,"A magical blue medallion the size of a human’s palm. Once placed inside the mouth of the user the powers of this medallion activate, giving the wielder the ability to control their own density, fly, turn invisible, phase through solid objects and generate green energy constructs. When the power is activated the wielder looks like a bright green semi-wraithlike silhouette of their normal body."
1703,,400,Moon-Blessed Water,Wizard 101,Making ,"A base liquid thoroughly infused with the shifting power of moonlight. Its myriad uses include: Being a phenomenal potion base, increasing base potion power by a factor of three, increasing the potency of alchemical transfigurations by a similar amount, and finally it can be used in a ritual to create a permanent transformation in a Wizard that shifts with the passing of the full moon. Essentially, it can grant lycanthropy, but with any creature a Wizard can create a strong enough sympathetic link with (Note: Transformations into extremely powerful creatures will be limited to around the power of a usual werewolf). You get one barrel of water a month, refilling every new moon."
1704,,400,Archimedean Magic Ray,Wizard 101,Making ,"Based on similar principles as the original Heat Ray, this car-sized device is capable of turning ordinary spells into full-fledged artillery spells, by gathering vibrant Solar magic from sunlight and focusing it onto a point in from of the device, where the operating Wizard should wave his focus of choice while casting the spell desired. Can turn an ordinary Fire Cat into something that could put a whole in a medieval castle wall."
1705,,400,Reaper’s Ragged Cloak,Wizard 101,Making ,"A pitch black cloak that has been worn away by countless ages and seems to be more holes than fabric by now. Still, what’s left of it will not tear further, and the power of Death clings to it like mildew. Anyone who puts the cloak about their shoulders shall find that the art of raising the dead comes significantly easier, and furthermore anyone using the cloak may drain the lifeforce of anyone they touch, potentially instantly killing them, and storing that energy in the cloak for further use. There is no upper limit on how much lifeforce may be stored in the cloak, and it may be discharged in part or in whole to heal the Wizard wearing it."
1706,,400,The Krokonomicon/Golden Fang of Krokotopia,Wizard 101,Making ,"These artifacts of Balance are too powerful to be held in the same hands. Therefore, you must choose.

The Krokonomicon is the single greatest codex ever put together on the magic of Life, Death, and the Balance between them. In its pages are rituals and spells that can put a civilization to sleep and wake them, that can summon armies of the undead and put them down, that can raise eternal fields of wheat and raze them. It relies on the wisdom of the reader to not misuse it and the fact that such spells require more than the power available to a single Wizard.

The Golden Fang of Krokotopia, in turn, is an artifact of great power that can be used to power such great acts. On its own, it is a powerful focus of Primal magic, the magic of Fire, Ice, and Storm, and was used by the ancient Kroks to sanctify the Pyramid of Fire, the Krokosphinx, and the Tomb of Storms in turn. It was only when studied by the sage mind of the Order of the Fang that the Spiritual aspects of magic made themselves visible, and the Krokonomicon was developed."
1707,,400,Tower Shield Emplacement,Wizard 101,Making ,"A seemingly simple kite shield, that nevertheless seems to be eternally cold to the touch, emblazoned with the symbol of the Spiral on it. When hung upon a wall, as a trophy might be, the building it’s in is enchanted to withstand magical assault equivalent to the Tower Shield perk. Once hung, the shield may only be relocated once a month."
1708,,400,Card Maker,Wizard 101,Making ,"You can convert any of your spells from outside this world and from others into reusable spell cards, fuelled either by their original power source or by pips. Each spell you convert is granted an affinity for the school that most closely resembles. Spells that don’t fit the school system or are totally outside of all the schools are either Balance or Shadow magic, at your choice."
1709,,400,Regular Supplier,The Owl House,Making ,"Magic is fine and great, but every witch worth their salt needs materials sooner or later. A baker can’t make bread without flour, a builder can’t make bricks without clay. To make sure you never run out of ingredients, reagents, and other witchy things, your Benefactor has arranged for regular deliveries to your place of residence or business. Anything that could be purchased at the markets of Bonesborough (or the shadier Night Market) will be delivered to your door every week for one lump-sum fee! Just remember, cash on delivery. This service will follow you into future worlds, delivering you goods and materials that you can only find here. Your potential inventory will expand to include any commonly purchased goods from each world you visit. This might not get you ultra-rare materials or unique items, but you’ll have a steady supply of nearly everything else. Just be nice to the delivery demon, please."
1710,,400,Shrinking Spray Bottle,The Owl House,Making ,"Filled with Obvioso’s magical formula, nearly anyone or anything sprayed by this bottle will shrink until it’s nearly invisible! The average-sized witch would be shrunken down to the size of a fly, while larger magical creatures might appear no larger than a mouse. Should you wish for your victims, erhm... subjects to return to normal size, simply tap your checks twice and they will return to normal. Be wary that this formula only diminishes their physical size, it does not eliminate their innate powers. This spray bottle will refill once a month."
1711,,400,Bloom of Eternal Youth,The Owl House,Making ,"No, this flower doesn’t really make you immortal. But it does imbue you with a gorgeous youthful appearance for as long as you live. Whether you consume it whole or brew a tea from the petals, this beautiful flower will share its gift with you. Should you use this flower or give it away, you will receive a new one at the start of your next jump. In theory you could grow more of these incredibly rare plants, but harvesting the seeds without destroying the natural enchantment would require a master of plant magic, lots of careful study, or both."
1712,,400,Dark Hand,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making ,"An ebony gauntlet crafted under the watchful eye of a Primordial Serpent, one allied with the Dark. While wearing this, you will be able to drain both the vitality and humanity of an enemy through just a strike or touch, restoring your own. It also acts as a decent shield, absorbing more incoming damage than one might think. With mastery, one could sap the humanity of even a replete saint in the blink of an eye."
1713,,400,Demon’s Great Hammer,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making ,"A massive weapon built from the stone Archtrees, wielded by those who would be changed by the Chaos Flame. It is quite good for beating your opponents to a pulp, and will set them aflame due to the chaotic fires burning within. Only those of great strength can wield it effectively, but those that can are often devastating."
1714,,400,Cloak of Skulls,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making ,"The cloak worn by the Gravelord Nito, First of the Dead and imbued with a portion of his power. While wearing this Cloak, made from the brisket dark fur of a deceased Ancient Dragon, it will improve both the range and power of all your necrotic abilities, be they raising the dead or sending forth waves of pure entropy. It also acts to obscure your figure, making it more difficult for your enemies to figure out where exactly to strike at you."
1715,,400,Ring Collection,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making ,"There are many different rings to be found in these lands, long into the future, after the Age of Fire has waned and has started fading. Each of them have their own effects, some more situational or potent than others, but all are useful in their own ways. Should you desire the extra benefits they give to the wearer, then this should satisfy, as you now have in your possession one of each kind of ring found within the Dark Souls series. Alternatively, you could combine them all into a singular gold band, possessing all of their benefits, yet none of the downsides."
1716,,400,Silver Knight Set,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making ,"The weapons and apparel of the Silver Knights who protect Anor Londo. When Lord Gwyn departed to link the Fire, his knights split into two groups, with the Silver Knights remaining in the forsaken capital in service of their goddess. Their weapons are imbued with divine power, being especially effective against the undead and Dark."
1717,,400,Relics of Artorias,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making ,"Relics once used by Artorias the Abysswalker, now having been passed down unto you. Sir Artorias hunted the Darkwraiths, and his titanite sword strikes harder against dark servants, while the shield boasts consistent defense and divine protection against various status effects. Together with the armor of the ancient hero, you are more than equipped to carry on his proud legacy."
1718,,400,Darkmoon Bow ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making ,"A golden shortbow used by the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity who watches over the abandoned city of the Gods, Anor Londo. With the replenishing quiver of Moonlight Arrows that comes with this weapon, it will hit much harder and shoot even farther than it has any right to, all thanks to the magic imbued within."
1719,,400,Lordvessel,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making ,"A large stone bowl engraved with the writings of the gods, meant to hold the souls of Lords and open the way to the Kiln of the First Flame, granted to the Chosen Undead by the Princess of Sunlight, Gwynevere. Not only is it capable of containing an unlimited amount of souls and other forms of energy, but it can expend that energy in order to blast open anything ranging from a simple locked door to an ancient magical barrier erected by divine beings."
1720,,400,Cauldron and Ingredients,Disney’s The Little Mermaid,Making ,"A magic cauldron, suited for a Sea Witch. 

Were one to possess the magic of a Sea Witch, or similar powers, they would find the cauldron to be an excellent medium to scry with, and a wonderful vessel from which to brew potions. Even if one does not, it has another feature. The cauldron is able to interpret your desires, and project images, lights, and smoke, outwards accordingly. A very handy feature that allows you to augment your proposals with style, and gives other parties a clear idea of what they are getting into.

This item also comes with a replenishing supply of all ingredients required to create the potions used by Ursula. You’ll still need to have the appropriate magical ability, but this cuts down on annoying material gathering, and ensures you’ll be able to brew in all sorts of worlds.

Should your cauldron be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours."
1721,,400,Dormain Special,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Making ,"Man, we’re just giving away weapons, aren’t we? Someone talked Walter into hand-crafting a custom firearm for you, on par with the Hellsing Jackal. Alucard’s sidearm is an unrivaled beast, firing 13mm armor piercing, explosive tipped, silver-coated hollow point bullets. Needless to say, it can turn the scariest monsters of this world into marinara sauce, overcoming even the insane healing factors of vampirism with sheer damage. Of course, the weapon was so heavy and cumbersome that only Alucard himself could well and truly wield it.

Your weapon is similarly sculpted to perfectly suit you and your combat style. It boasts the same over-the-top damage as Walter’s last work, and though you do need to reload it, you can strangely fire far more shots than the magazine should realistically hold before running dry. It can fire specialized ammunition, fill a unique role in your fighting style, and even have the absurd aesthetics we’ve all come to expect from Integra’s monster hunters. Give them a proper Hellsing welcome, Jumper."
1722,,400,Heavy Duty Piece,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Making ,"Now you’re packing some serious firepower. This is less of a cannon and more of an artillery piece, on par with the Harkonnen Mk2. You could have shoulder-carried 88mm howitzer or perhaps a pair of automatic 30mm flak cannons. Either way, you’ll have the firepower to perforate an armored zeppelin a hundred times over. Granted, this isn’t going to be man-portable unless you’ve got some supernatural strength to help you out, but nothing can turn the tide of a battle faster than some heavy-duty devastation."
1723,,400,Gunsmith,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Making ,"With such a variety of monstrosities out there, the warriors of the Hellsing Organisation often needed the right tool for the right job. Thankfully, experienced monster hunter Walter Dormain stepped up and began supplying Hellsing operatives with effective (if sometimes outlandish) firearms and other equipment. Now, you too share his proficiency for weaponsmithing. Need a fifty-pound pistol chambered in 13mm high-explosive? You can make that work. Want to turn that fledgling vampire over there into a one-woman anti-air network? It might take some tinkering, but you can throw together a suitable firearm given time and materials. Really demonstrate the mastery of your craft as you reduce your enemies to red sauce."
1724,,400,Endless Bayonets,Hellsing,Making ,"Chosen weapons of Paladin Anderson, these unconventional weapons now lie in your hands too. Apparently stored through a fourth dimensional pocket, an unlimited number of holy bayonets are now at your disposal, appearing from any somewhat concealed place you can place your hands in. Each one has a silvered blade, blessed by holy water, and has the sharpness to pierce bulletproof glass or thick stone even when swung by a normal man. While a direct gunshot could break a blade, they otherwise prove quite sturdy despite their somewhat awkward appearance. Naturally designed for throwing, they can reach both long ranges and incredible speeds, potentially breaking the sound barrier be you strong enough. Additionally, while it takes a few minutes between each use, the bayonets can also be linked with explosive charges from the same storage space, even dozens at a time in a chain to create powerful detonations. "
1725,,400,Arms of Hellsing,Hellsing,Making ,"Over many centuries, humanity has gathered a great deal of knowledge on exactly what most harms the demons that hunt in the night. From the deadly touch of silver to how to create the most unreasonably powerful handgun in existence. Having learned well from this history, few can match your skills as a weaponsmith. With the right tools at your disposal, you’re able to claim yourself a peer to Mr Dornez in what you can create as tools and weapons to fight monsters. Firearms from massive cannons to pistols with power surpassing those cannons, monofilament wire, swords that can thick steel with ease, even special bullets that egregiously harm vampires or other demons. While not quite to the same talents as with weapons, you’re a fine hand at making armor as well, enough to at least let your boys survive a few strikes from ordinary vampire minions. "
1726,,400,Pirate Hunter’s Regalia,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales,Making ,"One who seeks to restore order to the seas should first see to it that their tools are up to the task. These are weapons and clothing of the finest quality, they will never rust or otherwise succumb to the ravages of time. Beyond that, constantly using them in battle has caused them to pick up some more esoteric traits, almost as if you’ve bonded with them spiritually. They will follow you wherever you go, changing state and remaining accessible to you even in death. When you walk through walls, they will pass through just as you do. If you erupt into dust, so will they; and when you reform, so will they. Their strange properties will also allow them to interact with spirits and men simultaneously. Free import for a single outfit and melee weapon."
1727,,400,The Investor’s Tuppence,Marry Poppins Returns,Making ,"Although it may not look like much, this worn copper coin is the closest thing to growing money on trees. By simply placing the coin in a location where it will not be directly observed by any outside force, the tiny copper coin will slowly begin to accumulate wealth. It’s not terribly fast, mind you, doubling its present value at the end of every month, but after a few years, you’ll probably have a tidy fortune hidden away. A word to the wise, however - you’ll only get one coin at the start of a Jump (or at the end of ten years, whichever comes first)and once you unearth a hidden tuppence to gather its accumulated wealth, you can’t employ that same coin again. On the bright side, they do tend to fade away after use, ensuring that you won’t be left burdened with hundreds of powerless copper coins."
1728,,400,Measuring Up         ,Marry Poppins Returns,Making ,"Everyone is different, and sometimes, it’s best to know how they stack up against the crowd. And now, with the help of this handy little tape measure, you can do just that! By measuring any individual from head to toe using this seemingly innocuous (and apparently infinite) roll of measuring tape, you will instead be provided with a short description of their character in place of an actual height. To be perfectly fair, the measuring tape is not exactly the most gracious evaluator of character, and seems to take some sort of twisted delight in providing accurate, if wholly unflattering, descriptions of the subject in question. It will never lie, however, and often gives valuable insight into the strengths and weaknesses of those it measures."
1729,,400,Bermuda Shorts ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Making ,"In this world, Magic does not work in the Bermuda Triangle due to the magnetic current. However, Wizards has created these ugly looking shorts that allow for a Wizard to cast spells within the Bermuda Triangle. In the future jumps, this short allows you to have access to your magic regardless of any outside interference (ie. magnetic currents, enchantments, seals, lack of magoi, etc.). Also it is dry washer friendly."
1730,,400,Potion Reagent,Wizards of Waverly Place,Making ,You are in possession of a box that contains the majority of commonly used potion ingredients (but not highly limited ingredients). The used ingredients replenishes weekly.
1731,,400,Magical Ring,Wizards of Waverly Place,Making ,"You are in possession of a magical item that makes the wearer fearless. The prototype of the ring was prone to make the wearer far more susceptible to danger, however, this ring allows you to be aware of the danger, and act accordingly without fearlessness clouding your judgment."
1732,,400,Wand of Rinaldi ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Making ,"The wand of the Rinaldi family is widely recognized to be the most powerful wand in the Wizarding World. The spells cast with the help of this wand are far more powerful than any other, to the point that a WizTech Drop Out is capable of besting the most powerful Wizard alive. If you possess the Magic of this world, you can be a descendent of Rinaldi himself, allowing only you (and Felix and any other sibling you may have) to use this wand. And if not, you can still use this wand to strengthen the magic you may learn in other jumps, however, you still can’t cast Magic of this world."
1733,,400,A Golden Hammer ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Making ,"A simple looking golden hammer, this is one of the greatest repair tools in the world. With just a tap, you can cause a broken object to snap back together into a single piece. This only repairs the object physically, however. If there were mystical or supernatural properties to the object, you’ll have to expend some internal energy, whether just physical stamina or something more magical, in order to restore those properties. You can also expend energy while striking an unbroken object to cause it to be upgraded and improved. The magnitude of the mystical property or desired upgrade determines how much energy is needed, but it will never be enough to kill or seriously harm you. If you lack the energy needed, the effect will simply fail or only succeed as far as you have energy to sustain."
1734,,400,Power-Up Pies,WRECK-IT RALPH,Making ,"You might not be a main character, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help out. You now have the ability to create ‘power-ups’, items such as food or glowing spheres which can grant those that use them a boost in strength, speed, health, or special abilities, among other things. It takes energy on your part to make the power-up, and you’ll only be able to provide a minor boost to begin with, but over time you could reach the point where you can boost a flagging hero with enough power to faceroll the final boss."
1735,,400,Splatter Paint,Darkwing Duck,Making ,"You have the power to enter paintings, animate them, or even to paint wholly new (and usually surreal-looking) creatures that help you. You do this with a summonable paint covered brush of your choice."
1736,,400,"Boots, Hat and Sword ",Shrek,Making ,"You have the outfit of a roguish swordsman. The boots, hat and sword are of whatever style you like. The hat grants a slight increase to your Charisma, the sword is flawless and being from a fairytale land is accepting of enchantments, finally the boots allow the wearer to travel up to twice as far with each step taken."
1737,,400,Scarab Amulet ,Twisted,Making ,"The two pieces of an amulet which, when put together, creates an illusory image of a beetle which leads the holder to the Cave of Wonders, where the Djinn’s lamp may be found. In future worlds, the amulet will split itself into two pieces again, and once a month can be pieced together to guide you to similarly hidden locations, prioritising those which hold great treasure. This does not take into account the danger of these places, so watch your step."
1738,,400,Glass Coffin,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Making ,"This coffin, made from glass and gold, allows one to peer inside to see its occupant. It is sized appropriately for you to fit inside, with plenty of space so you don’t feel too boxed in.

Should an unconscious person rest inside the coffin with the lid closed, their basic needs will somehow be met. They will not run out of air, require food or drink, or soil themselves. This ensures that even if someone is forced into an eternal sleep, they can be kept safely inside until a treatment is devised. 

Should a deceased person lie inside the coffin with the lid closed, the coffin will perfectly preserve their body, ensuring that those too beautiful to bury remain so for as long as they remain in the coffin.

Of course, you can simply choose to use it is a bed, as it is quite comfortable, and can be easily opened from the inside.

If someone that is not moving between jumps (i.e., they are not a Jumper, a companion, or a follower) is inside when a jump ends, you can choose between two different options. Either you can automatically eject them from the coffin, or you can leave the existing coffin behind and receive a new copy when you arrive in the next world.

Should the coffin (the most recent if you have received multiple) be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours."
1739,,400,Inventors Immortality ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Making ,"You have complete immunity to all negative consequences to any experiment, test, or creation attempt. This will guarantee that you do not come to harm or die from any"
1740,,400,Heroic Gear,Disney’s Hercules,Making ,"What is a Hero, without his shield? His sword? His armor? Dead. The answer is dead. Well, you’re not dead, and you aren’t going to be anytime soon, in all likelihood. This is a full set of hero’s gear, and not the cheap stuff either. A sword, a full set of armor, and a shield, and each and every one of them is divine craftsmanship, directly from the forges of Hephaestus.

It’s all ridiculously high quality work, being some of the toughest and sharpest pieces of the craft in the world. But the real joy comes out when you grow. Because so does it, right with you. The sword is as close to an ideal weapon for you as it gets. It grows sharper, tougher and all around better as your skills and abilities do. It channels any and all energies you command flawlessly, and indeed, amplifies them greatly.

And the shield and armor... well, they’re kind of the same. The armor is always, at the very least, an order of magnitude tougher than your skin, and carries all exotic resistances and immunities at the same ratio. The shield is not just a shield, but an embodiment of your ability to defend yourself, meaning it improves with every improvement in your ability to do the same.

Optionally, you may replace the shield with a second sword."
1741,,400,Creation,Disney’s Hercules,Making ,"All else aside, if there is one thing that can be said to make a god a god, it's the power to create something out of nothing. Fiat Lux, and all that.

You have it now. You can create both living or non-living things out of absolutely nothing, simply by exerting your powers. These can be as complicated as you’re capable of imagining, but this perk itself provides no help regarding that.

While you can create anything you know how to make, the quantities and powers depend on many factors. It’s your power being spent, after all, and that’s what this depends on. A god could create small animals all day without feeling it, but creating a human or bigger animals would take noticeable effort, and a fellow god would be out of the question. Things like souls and magic take dramatically more power, as do spirits. The power you spend in this is as recoverable as it would normally be, but it has to equal all of the power the item or being possesses.

This creation is simply you using the powers and energies you control and turning them into things, so any creation takes you as long as it takes you to shape your power appropriately and will it into existence.

Also, this cannot be used to grant you any CP, or anything you can’t get without CP, in any way, shape or form."
1742,,400,Craftsman,Disney’s Hercules,Making ,"Greek myth sure does love it’s weapons and armors, doesn’t it? You’re great at making both, now. Not only do you have a preternatural skill at putting together weapons, armor and other artefacts of the very highest quality, being able to work legendary items from common tools and materials, but you’re also a whiz at enchanting them.

Simply put, you can imbue just about any and all magic and power you have into items, and have it work as you desire. It also helps you figure out existing examples of craft, and replicating the effects on your own."
1743,,400,Bubbling Cauldron,Disney Villains Victorious,Making ,"Not quite the Horned King’s crown jewel, but a good imitation of such. The liquid of this cauldron will convert whoever drinks or eats it into a zombified servant, at their original strength but with no fear or pain in their hearts...a perfect disposable minion, isn’t it?"
1744,,400,Bottle of Entrapment,Aladdin,Making ,"This old looking bottle or lamp comes with a very Arabic look to it. Though many might overlook it as a piece of junk, you know its real value. With the right incantation smoke will billow out from the opening to trap your target. Not all people or things can be trapped this way, Ghosts, spirits, elementals and genies are the easiest to capture. Gods are just too powerful for this and some other more powerful entities might have their own methods of escape. But once captured you will be able to telepathically commune with whatever has been trapped inside. This item is more containment than enslavement. Though some spirits may be willing to barter for their freedom. The bottle can only hold a single entity and anything inside is freed at the end of the jump."
1745,,400,Magic Carpet        ,Aladdin,Making ,"A magic carpet set in the local style. Besides being able to fly at incredible speeds, its loyal, and it is even smart. Although the level of its intelligence is unknown. It is able to understand complex commands, plot, act on its own to save you from danger and more. As for speeds, in a single night it traveled from the Arabian desert to China and back. The magic of the carpet even protects the riders from the ill effects from its flight. Such things include, but not limited to, windburn, whiplash, and the force of sudden changes in speed."
1746,,400,Bag of Holding,Marvel Britain,Making ,"This special bag is bigger on the inside, how big? As big as you need it to be, able to hold whatever you want inside, all items it contains are held in a sort of beneficial semi-stasis where time stops for those items it benefits such as perishables and rolls forward for those items it helps, such as magical items that recharge with the dawn or over time. This bag may change its form at your will, taking on any appearance you desire."
1747,,400,Enchanted Blade - Excalibur level enchantment,Marvel Britain,Making ,"The enchantment of your sword has been enhanced to the point it is the equal of Excalibur. Unable to be wielded by any other than you and those you allow; the power of your blade has been drastically enhanced. Your sword becomes able to interact with and cut magic itself, it has an aura that will eat through unwanted curses on those near the blade, the amount of damage done by this blade is enhanced several fold allowing those of mortal strength to keep up with those beyond humanity, its edge becomes somehow sharper, it can be banished and summoned by its wielder at will, it allows the wielder to sense magic or enhance those sense if they already have the, and is potent enough to potentially give a true death to powerful entities; gods, immortals, spirits and beyond will die a true death if killed by this blade.

Requires Enchanted Blade to Purchase"
1748,,400,Chalice of Ebrietas,Bloodborne: Covenants,Making ,"A goblet, crafted from some strange organic material, that was brought up from deep within the Chalice Dungeons below Yharnam. From this holy medium, a dark red liquid emerges, the blood of a god. The uses of such a holy artifact are vast, as is the potential for disaster, should one mishandle it. It will never run dry, eternally refilling no matter how much is removed from it. Always remember this though; fear the old blood."
1749,,400,Non-Combat Relic ,Symphogear,Making ,"A non-combat Relic like the Antikythera Gear or the Yantra Sarvaswa. You can pick a canon one or choose a non-canon myth, so long as the power level is the same."
1750,,400,Divine Metals,Marvel Magic,Making ,"You have somehow managed to procure a supply of one of two divine ores. Either you have somehow gained access to 100 gallons of either Uru or Adamantine in a liquid state.

Uru is a magical metal, unique to the world of Nidavellir of the Nine Realms. Incredibly resilient to the point of near-invincibility and with a luster best compared to badly wrought iron. Uru is a favored by the gods of Asgard and the dwarven smiths who ally with them for not only its rugged durability, but also for the fact that it is a supremely effective magical conductor. Though extremely hard to correctly enchant, the magic laid upon it will be powerful and as nigh-unbreakable as the metal itself if you can manage it.

Adamantine is something of a study in contrasts with Uru. Though every bit as durable as its Nordic cousin, the magical metal favored by the gods of Olympus has little else in common with it. Where Uru is dull and rugged, Adamantine is a gleaming gold. And where Uru is a supreme magical conductor, Adamantine is instead effectively immune to mystical effects below those of the greatest gods.

There is one other quality that the two brother metals share, however: the incredible difficulty of forging them, usually requiring either incredibly potent magic or heat comparable to that found in the heart of a star. Combined with the metals requiring incredible skill for even rudimentary working, it is usually nearly impossible for any mortals to utilize these rare metals in their forges.

You receive only one, but receive the other at a discount if you did not already have a discount on the first purchase. You receive an additional 100 gallons of whichever types you have purchased every six months.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1751,,400,Mjolnir,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Making ,"Mjolnir, a powerful enchanted war-hammer forged by the Dwarves. It is an incredibly versatile weapon, yet it also has the ability to help you control and focus any power you have. It will return to you whenever you summon it, and it’s enchanted in such a way that the only ones who can lift it are those you consider worthy of lifting it, which you are free to choose and change at any times what makes someone worthy. You may choose to have the hammer grant anyone who is worthy access to your powers, and may choose what powers they have access to, or if they only have access to the hammer itself, in which case it will help them focus and control their own powers, should they have any. It grants you access to your very own Asgardian armor (of your own design), and has the added ability to resurrect you should you die. Yours is also indestructible, unlike the Original Mjolnir."
1752,,400,The Ten Rings,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Making ,"A set of ten rings of unknown ancient origin, these provide the user a series of mystical powers, granting them enhanced strength, durability, speed, agility, stamina, reflexes, and semi- immortality, as well as being able to fire them as projectiles, make them emit concussive energy blasts, control and manipulate a magic energy field emitted by the Ten Rings, and telepathically control them, usually guided with the users body, making them incredible tools for a martial artist. You receive the physical enhancement of one ring in every part of your body, even when you don’t wear the rings, but the enhanced strength granted by the rings is proportional to how many rings the user is wearing at once. You also receive the semi-immortality even if you don’t wear the rings. You are able to remotely control the Rings when you are not wearing them without having to guide them with you body, merely your mind. The rings demonstrate new abilities when used in conjunction with the abilities granted by the Great Protector. Uniquely, you are able to share the semi-immortality and physical enhancements with up to 9 others, though they won’t have access to the rings themselves unless you give them the ability. You are free to choose the color and appearance of the energy and aura of the rings."
1753,,400,Black Mirror,Marvel Primal,Making ,"A hand mirror that allows the user to peer into, and travel between, other times, realities and dimensions, from chaos spheres to nightmare realms, the Dark Dimension, and more."
1754,,400,Heart-Shaped Herb,Marvel Primal,Making ,A field of the same herbs that empowered the first Panther chief. Great for empowering others.
1755,,400,Crimson Gem of Cyttorak,Ultimate Marvel,Making ,"""Whosoever touches this gem shall possess the power of the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become ... forevermore ... a human juggernaut!"". Your strength and durability are enhanced greatly. A regular human can become a Thor-class threat with this alone."
1756,,400,Souls Weapon ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Making ,When Illyana was trapped in Limbo as a small seven-year-old child she used magic and her soul to create her soul sword and now you know the same technique. As this is a magical weapon it disrupts spirits and can be used to channel spells and power. In the beginning it will start very simple but as time goes on and you use it more it grows in power and becomes as unique as yourself.
1757,,400,Staff of One,Marvel Midnight Suns,Making ,"The Staff of One is an artefact imbued with the Entity called – you guessed it – the One and has been passed down the Minoru family for generations; you must have a duplicate because there are now two in this world. It acts as a magical focus and can cast simple sentence spells and intent. The item is infused into your body and appears at your will and follows the latter deal struck into the comics. Instead of exchanging blood for magic, every spell will allow one drop of the One into the user, allowing him to hear the outside world and have a small voice. The artefact won’t betray you in any way. This item gives Nico’s Outfits for free as it counts for her power."
1758,,400,Scarab of Ammit,Moon Knight,Making ,"All one needs sometimes is a Route to success. This Scarab is something you can, once per Jump, calibrate on any one specific thing, location or item. This can be say the grave of an important figure, an item of great power or even a path to a Goddess. This Scarab will lead you the way to your goal so just follow it."
1759,,400,Red Sarcophagus ,Moon Knight,Making ,"Ever had a real bad aspect of yourself you just want to seal away? A desire for blood or a murderous personality? Well this just so happens to be the perfect size for them. While this Sarcophagus exists you can put anything about you that you wish to seal away inside, whether that is a power, a personality or a fault. They wont be able to escape and only you can open the lid with a thought and regain what was lost."
1760,,400,Relic of Power,Marvel: What If...?,Making ,"Not all magic emanates from sorcerers. Some effects are generated by ancient relics, from the Casket of Winter’s ability to conjure ice to the Cloak of Levitation’s gift of flight. This purchase has secured you your own magical artifact, whether it be a previously-seen relic or an entirely new creation. You could even commission a Nidavellir creation if you prefer the Asgardian flavor of magic. This relic’s power may range from the humble to the mighty, scaling from the Vaulting Boots of Valtorr all the way up to the legendary Mjolnir. However, there are a few limitations. Firstly, be sure not to let your ambition destroy you. Just because you can purchase a copy of Mjolnir doesn’t mean you can survive its power. Second, no relic you create may be more powerful than Thor’s hammer. If you wish for the power of the Infinity Stones, look elsewhere. Beyond these restrictions, the universe is the limit. Employ the mystic arts responsibly, Jumper."
1761,,400,Spider Totem,Marvel Noir,Making ,"This is a small totemic representation of a tribal spider god. It doesn’t possess the ability to give you spider-powers like the Blessing of the Spider God, if it ever could do that it already has expended that power. However it does help link you with the spider deity it represents. It can serve as a magical focus for magical arts related to spiders, however, and might could help mend a tear in magical webs of fate or destiny, though its main purpose is once per jump (or 10 years whichever comes first) if you die, say because your life essence was sucked out while in another universe entirely, the spider god will revive you, causing you to appear, reborn and remade anew in a cocoon of black webbing."
1762,,400,The Shield,Heroes Reborn,Making ,"A circular shield made of a nigh-indestructible alloy, and perfectly balanced for throwing, even able to ricochet and bounce with precision if you were skilled enough, and the shield helps a bit with that skill. Of course the important part is how it works as a shield. While something powerful enough, or a conceptual attack, might be able to break the shield - might - any blow blocked by this shield is blocked. Block a fireball with it and you won’t feel the heat through the shield, or be singed; block a bolt of thunder called down by a god while sheltering a child, and the child won’t be singed. Some attacks might be too large to completely block with this shield, striking from all directions or some such, but if you can block it with the shield it will not harm you through it. Even if the attack is sufficient to destroy the shield, no part of it will get past the shield, so feel free to block that world-busting blow. If the shield is somehow destroyed it will be repaired and good as new again within a year."
1763,,400,The Bow ,Heroes Reborn,Making ,"Well it’s called that, but besides being a high quality bow with just the right draw weight for you, the bow isn’t that special, though if you’re strong enough being able to work for you is something worth noting. It’s the arrows that are the real story here. See like Hawkeye’s bow, you’ve got a collection of trick arrows. Bludgeon arrows for knocking people out, arrows that release nets as they get close to targets, electrified arrows for short circuiting electronics, arrows that contain water for short circuiting electronics, ultrasound arrows, epoxy goo arrows; you name it. You get a quiver with 20 trick arrows, and it’s unclear which sort of arrows they are until you pull it out. The quiver restocks itself with 1 arrow every hour. And if you or a companion could cheaply and efficiently make more variety of trick arrows they’ll be included in the options; nothing one of a kind or requiring resources that would be hard to acquire, but it’ll still save you a lot of work and effort.

If you’d prefer another type of projectile launching weapon, you may have it instead of a bow, with the 20 trick arrows replaced with 20 trick bullets/sling stones/crossbow bolts/etc, in this case the trick ammunition won’t be decided until it is loaded; so get good at loading your six shooter fast in combat.

For an additional 200 CP (undiscounted) you will find your arrows include some imbued with Asgardian sorcery. These will result in somewhat more powerful arrows, including some that hit with a force enough to completely vaporize a normal human."
1764,,400,Torture Device        ,Helltaker,Making ,"It’s one of those tridents you always see demons using in cartoon depictions of Hell, except this one can transform into any tool you might need, even custom ones; this includes tools used for torture. Fiat-backed to cause pain to anyone you use them on, even when they aren’t able to cause actual damage."
1765,,400,Soul Sword,Marvel Comics - Exiles,Making ,"The nature of the soul sword in these comics is a bit less clear than usual, but its functions are mostly the same. It is sharp enough to shave pieces off of a berserk Ben Grimm, can deflect energy beams, and as a soul sword can cut magic, and intangible entities. You are able to summon this sword to your hand with a few moments of concentration."
1766,,400,Alchemical Wires,Fate/Zero,Making ,"A large spool of wire has come into your possession, a particularly adaptable mystic code based on the alchemy used by the Einzbern family. This wire, so long as it is touching your skin in some way, responds to your thoughts to control it. It is impressively fast, such that no ordinary human would be able to react to its speed and it can adjust its sharpness freely. At one end it is dull but capable of lifting and throwing a small car with all the wire but at the other end it can slice through stone and metal with barely any resistance. It’s even possible to turn the wires into physical bodies, such as birds, swords or shields. You have a few hundred meters of wire at first and know how to recreate this wire, though the skill level required may take time to reach, and you can only handle so many wires at once without improving the limit of your mind.This can be imported into. "
1767,,400,Moon Pearl ,Bayonetta,Making ,"This softly glowing, basketball sized pearl is easily worth a fortune from its size and appearance alone... but it's more than just a trinket. By using one of these, its magics will flow into you and permanently increase the amount of magical energy you can store within yourself by a significant amount. It can only be used once, however, but I assure you the ability to use more magic is well worth it."
1768,,400,Tools of the Trade,Bayonetta,Making ,"You can't just make a weapon out of your bare hands, can you? Bullshit you can't! With these mystical gauntlets, you can smash, hit, and pound away at pieces of metal until a weapon is created. You need all the parts if you want to make something magical, but with this, you no longer need massive contraptions... just your fists! On the plus side, this also lowers the amount of time needed to craft a weapon considerably."
1769,,400,Unorthodox Parts,Bayonetta,Making ,"Most people think of metal carved with tools to create a weapon. You laugh at such simple notions, for you have learned to create weapons out of spiritual entities. Demonic forces make for good parts surprisingly, and can impart unique abilities upon the weapon during its creation. If you study a creature or entity long enough, you just may know how to create a weapon out of their parts too. Naturally the more powerful the creature, the better quality the item."
1770,,400,Imprisonment,Ragna Crimson,Making ,"This magic allows the user to instantly form cages of various sizes around any targeted area within the user’s sight. These cages may remain static in place if the user so wishes, and it is not possible to escape them without first destroying them, even if they seem to have a consistent shape that would allow some to slip between its bars.

Once something it’s trapped inside your cages, you may also teleport them in a large area as you please."
1771,,400,Potion Maker,Trinity Wonder ,Making ,"Different worlds have different plants and creatures. Different ingredients means different potions. It could end up being impossible to replicate even the most basic potions in a different world simply because the most common, integral ingredient does not exist. Luckily you have a rather special ability, shared by the likes of Pink Papa. You can use pure ki or mana in order to supplement ingredients in elixir making. The stronger and more complex the elixir, the more energy and harder it is for you to substitute in ingredients. A simple potion may not take much effort to recreate. A moderate one like Youthful Virtue may take a reasonable degree of control over your ki, and a good deal of power. Of course, this would be useless without the basic knowledge on how to make elixirs. Knowledge you now have. You could make quite a comfortable living just by selling your services as a potion maker."
1772,,400,Rod of Ages,League of Legends,Making ,"A companion for all time, The Rod of Ages is an extremely potent magical artifact that is sought after by wizards around the world. A white wooden pole topped with the spines of some void creature and a purple crystal, The Rod of Ages will boost the potency of its wielder's magic, ward off disease and mental illness, and make the wielder tougher in general. While this effect is only moderate for the first year of ownership, the longer you keep the Rod of Ages on your person, the greater its effect grows. Although its power seems to grow indefinitely, it seems to plateau and develop slower after ten years, and will reset every time you enter a new jump."
1773,,400,Rabadon's Deathcap,League of Legends,Making ,"This violet witch cap seems to glow with a malevolent power. When worn, this hat lives up to its name by bolstering its wearer's magic power immensely. Any offensive or destructive magic used by the wielder benefits from a 150% increase in power, turning fireball spells into deadly conflagrations that consume entire armies, or ice spells into swirling storms that freeze men solid before they shatter into nothing. It's almost worth enduring the evil thoughts it whispers into the user's mind…"
1774,,400,Chemtechnician,Arcane,Making ,"Though Piltover has been remade into the hextech City of Progress, Zaun has been left behind. Without the same access to the expensive hexcrystals which make the innovations of Jayce Talis possible, the undercity has had to continue relying on older chemtech, with all its associated volatility and, often, toxicity. Still, chemtech is hardly a worthless line of research, capable of everything from creating powerful fuels for engines and industry, to brewing all kinds of near-magical drugs, potions and concoctions.

You are well-trained as a practitioner of chemtech, able to produce all the common chemicals used in the economy of Zaun, as well as to modify them or innovate new ones given time and space to work in. You know the recipe for Shimmer, and are quite a proficient doctor, able to keep your patients alive (though not necessarily unchanged) far past the point at which mundane medicine would have given up. As well as being able to perform the chemical side of things, you’re also capable of building machines that take advantage of the weird brews and concoctions you can make, like engines which run on artificial fuels, prosthetic arms powered by Shimmer, or suits designed to supplement Shimmer’s body-enhancing properties."
1775,,400,Mind-Altering Substance,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"The knowledge of how best to harm your opponents has become revealed to you. You are capable of infusing the Magic Break, Life Break, and Power Break status effects into your smoke-bombs, as well as the Insanity, Disease, and Knock Out status effects."
1776,,400,Blood and Bone,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"You know just what it takes to get a little more out of the monster. You can pick through the parts of monsters and gods, and easily graft on their attributes to equipment - allowing you to use their signature abilities or have some of their strongest traits enhanced while using the gear."
1777,,400,Next Form ,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"Your armor now is capable of enhancing the powers of your other Job abilities and can have an additional two status effects, along with new effects you can use: Spell Reflect, Levitate, and Stealth. In addition, your Rider Machine can now ride along walls and has a “jump jet” for additional speed. You are capable of easily integrating the Rider Machine as part of your martial arts

Requires Cavalier Armor(Super Dragon Sword), Armed Mode(Super Dragon Sword), and Rider Machine(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
1778,,400,Master of the Dungeon,Super Dragon Sword,Making ,"The dungeons of Old have something in common with the camps you know how to build: they were built to last, and impossible for all but the grandest of heroes to breach. You have the knowledge of how to build powerful fortifications, filled with deadly traps that can out-devil those who aren’t brilliant or paranoid. Similarly, you have the knowledge necessary to traverse the dungeons of yesteryear that are less dangerous than the ones you are capable of creating."
1779,,400,Bloody Dagger,Dresden Files,Making ,"The Fae courts have the Stone Tablet, and you have, well, this. This is a tool of your choosing, through which you can increase the personal powers of yourself and your supporters. Just as blood spilled on the stone tablet passes the power of the Sacrifice to the court owning it at the time, any blood spilled using this Dagger passes the powers of the being killed to you, to keep or redistribute as you please. Of course, it’s not quite that simple. Just like the Tablet, this thing doesn’t just work any time you want. In fact, it only works two days out of the year. One is Halloween, when all immortals are… not. The other is a day of your choosing, like Midsummer or Midwinter for the Courts. You can select any day of the year, but can’t change it once set until the next jump."
1780,,400,Mordite ,The Dresden Files,Making ,"Don't touch. Seriously, just don't. This little cloud of inky smoke actually contains a solid rock from somewhere outside of reality, and trust me, it's not from a good neighborhood. Also called Deathstone, it's pure, concentrated antilife. Even being near it drains the life out of anything else around it, and one touch will kill anything from this reality dead, and probably do a number on anything from outside of it as well. It inherently responds to willpower, meaning you can mentally push it around if you'd like, but that also means other things can push it around as well. If you're a God of the Underworld, or completely insane, you might be able to make a scary as hell floating crown out of it. Otherwise, handle with care, and make sure not to let someone with a stronger will get ahold of it."
1781,,400,"""Infusion"" ",Dark Souls 3,Making ,"There are things lurking, waiting no matter where you go in this place, steeped in madness, hostile, waiting to take it out on whatever shows itself to them. If you want to defend yourself, you'll need more than your bare hands. With this perk, you've acquired the skills of a wizened blacksmith, able to forge, repair and even improve upon armor, weaponry and other basic equipment with the proper resources and a good hammer. More than that, you know the secrets of ""Infusion"". This allows you to use special gems native to this world to infuse your equipment with various properties, such as the dark power of Hollows or the power of the gods, Lightning. Those who purchase ""Sorcery"" along with this perk gain something extra though. Those people are granted the ability to seed the ground with fragments of crystal that rapidly grow after the first few days until slowing to a stop, producing the Gems required for Infusion. Knowledge of how to cultivate just the Gems you're looking for comes with this ability."
1782,,400,King’s Mirror,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“With but a simple purchase you may acquire the likeness of one of old King Vendrick’s greatest knights. One who stands as a shining vanguard, still protecting the same passage he was set to protect so long ago. Acquire the armor and shield of the Looking Glass Knight. The armor is heavy, beautiful, exceptionally well made, but otherwise simply armor. The shield however is thick, its face having a surface like a polished mirror framed artistically. This shield is not only resilient as its size would suggest, but possessing of several magical powers. The surface will never become foggy or dirty. When blocking correctly, spells whether sorcerous or miraculous may be reflected back where they came from. Most terrifying is that it captures the visage of those the wielder slays. Phantoms resembling those slain may be summoned inside the reflective surface of the shield, and then pushed out to fight on your side for a short time, eventually fading away as quickly as they were brought into existence.” "
1783,,400,Pharros Skeleton Stone,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“Pharros created numerous puzzles and doors scattered about the kingdoms. The eccentric architect hid all manner of traps, tricks, secret passageways and supplies of mundane and mystical equipment seemingly at random. The only way to access or activate these doors was the use of a Pharros Lockstone. Square, bulky, but magical. One use each as the door would be unrelenting with keeping its key. Perhaps they’re meant to tempt travelers into eventually walking into a trap, or maybe it was madness. You have in your possession what appears to be a normal lockstone. Whenever used however, a duplicate appears in your possession the moment you look for it. This magical stone does more than complete the magical doors of Pharros however. When pressed into any mechanism or lock missing a single component or key, the lockstone will take the form of the missing piece that denies you access. You will always be able to tell where the lockstone was used in this way, as the pure white surface betrays it.”"
1784,,400,Clockwork Kingdom,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“Yeah working with souls and other special materials is great and all but you don’t have that. You’ve got men, iron and a little bit of the old razzle dazzle. You know what? That’s enough to fucking build up an entire kingdom and you can show that off. Near mythological abilities as an engineer. With a basic knowledge of sorcery and excessive skill with clockwork machinations you could create automatons that can follow simple commands, traps that reset and resupply themselves and self-maintaining machines. Although the things you make are marvelous in function, the most spectacular aspect of this perk is their sheer endurance. Despite the moving parts and small components, even when exposed to the elements and left unmaintained, unless deliberately broken they seemingly just keep working forever.”"
1785,,400,Unlocking the Soul ,Dark Souls 2,Making ,"“Perhaps you have more ambition than just bestowing the mundane with mystical power. You aim for higher, you aim to transmute the power of souls into tools to be manipulated by your hand. Was I correct? Then look no further. You have been bestowed skills and abilities that allow you to transform souls and spiritual power into a variety of ways. The most basic is using weaker souls, and crystallizing them into Lifegems, objects that can mend and repair flesh when broken in hand. The basic is just an example however, but a good one. Crystallizing souls, making their essence physical and widening the potential to interact with them. With such abilities, powerful souls can be transformed into weapons and trinkets, or golems powered by batteries made of souls.”"
1786,,400,“Mystic Ember Smith”,Dark Souls 1,Making ,"In these legendary yet dying lands, one can still hear the clinking of hammer on metal in otherwise quiet places. Legendary blacksmiths command the power of supernatural flames found in these lands to aid in their craft On purchase, you gain great skill with basic blacksmithing with an emphasis on repair, able to repair most normal weapons, armor and trinkets with the right materials and a bit of time, providing they actually can be salvaged. Secondly, Mystic Ember Smith bestows the power to work with supernatural embers and flames that aid in smithing, allowing you to repair, enhance, forge and transform weapons with unique natures and qualities depending on the techniques and flame used in the process. While working with some form of supernatural flame, a Mystic Ember Smith stokes the fire by burning ‘souls’ or spiritual energy in sufficient amounts. The hardier the material they’re working with, the hotter the fire they’ll need, the more ‘souls’ or energy they’ll need to burn. Mystic Ember Smith is also able to transform sufficiently durable and well-made equipment into an entirely new form using ‘Boss Souls’ as a catalyst, imparting the power and nature of the soul onto the piece of equipment."
1787,,400,Shinobi Prosthetic,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making ,"A wooden prosthetic fitted with all manners of tools from grappling hooks to shuriken to axes to poisoned blades to unbreakable umbrellas to even fans that can spirit people away. This arm is a veritable multi-tool perfect for any and all combat situations. The throwables seem to be produced infinitely. It can even store additional items (up to 5) in order to quickly pull them up for use. For an additional 200 CP (or 100 if discounted), all these tools will be upgraded to their maximum potential and effectiveness as well as their variations such as fire and azurite, and it can now store up to 10 additional items. If you don’t want this item to replace your arm, you can instead turn it into a forearm-bound gauntlet.

This can be bought more than once for any additional arms that you have. The first and subsequent purchases are all discounted for the related origin.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1788,,400,Workshop Artisan ,Bloodborne,Making ,"“Before the days that hunters openly stalked the streets as an acknowledged branch of the Healing Church, there was the Workshop. Tucked away in one of Yharnam’s corner, these self-sufficient hunters designed, built, and maintained their tools all on their own. 

Wherever your prowess came from, you would rival some of these old hunters, at least when it comes to the creation of trick weapons and hunter’s tools. Trick Weapons are simply that, weapons with some inbuilt trick that provides the Hunter with options, such as a transformation, or built in guns. 

Hunter’s Tools can be any number of things, from the arcane to the mechanical, whose activation is keyed to the intent in one’s blood. In addition to being able to skillfully design great Trick Weapons that can function well despite their complex designs and moving parts, you can also create Hunter’s Tools. 

Essentially, you can key objects to draw power from blood, activating based on the intent within it. The more powerful the tool, the more blood required, though stored blood is applicable for activation.”"
1789,,400,Theoretical Recreation,Bloodborne,Making ,"“Great Ones, existences impossible to fully understand in their entirety, at least by the undeveloped human mind. But even for an unenlightened one, a Great One can be studied, researched, understood to some extent. Curious that you seem more apt than most at this. 

When it comes to studying the anatomy of the eldritch, the divine, and the otherworldly, you would have few peers even amongst Byrgenwerth’s storied scholars. You have the capacity to study such things, derive more information than most, with less mental deterioration, and push humanity’s limits. 

What’s more, the greater you understand the inner workings of such lifeforms, the easier it becomes to replicate notable properties of such things in more familiar, mundane beings. Still, it could take years to begin figuring out how to bring man to the level of Great Ones, if starting from scratch anyways.”"
1790,,400,Ring of Avarice,Demon's Souls,Making ,​This ring is a symbol of wealth and debauchery. Fitted with a large jewel it allows the user to obtain more souls when slaying enemies.
1791,,400,Rite of Kindling ,Elden Ring,Making ,"Madness is like any other problem, often easier to bear once shared. So why not do just that for the blind sheep around you? You may not be one of the Three Fingers, but enough of the Frenzied Flame has soaked into your soul and flesh that you can transmit it to others by various means. Lay a hand on someone, and you can brand their flesh-granting them instinctive use of the Flame’s Incantations; this takes a great toll on one of mortal constitution, but nothing a quick breather can’t recover from. Sacrifice part of your body-an eyeball for example, or a finger-and not only would they continue to develop new powers pertaining to the Flame or imbue existing ones with it but inspiration for how to incinerate everything will fill them-compelling them to support you if your goals are similarly destructive. Even your blood is a sort of toxic spread both madness-and with great quantities ingested, spontaneous combustion. And all methods described above can also be used to imbue the Flame into weapons and armor to various effects-or if you like, convert your severed body parts into talismans affiliated with the Flame. As the old adage goes: Give a man a fire and he’s warm for a day, but set a man on fire and he’s warm for the rest of his life."
1792,,400,Fundamentalist Scholastics ,Elden Ring,Making ,"In pursuit of whatever it would take to make him whole, Radagon blurred the line between prophet and sorcerer. You too have discovered an intrinsic connection between faith and intellect that many of your peers in both sorcery and theology deny, and have made good use of it. Henceforth abilities of all kinds enhanced by greater intellect will also be enhanced by a powerful faith-be it directed at a higher power, or yourself-and abilities enhanced by great faith will also benefit from greater intellect. Apart from making you both greatly gifted in and experienced with both sorceries and Incantations from this world, this also lets you reverse engineer artifacts and effects from normally incompatible magic systems. Such effects are generally equal in overall power and resource cost, but depending on how different the systems or forces involved are may result in artifacts or spells of radically different character.

Just as Radagon’s Golden Order Greatsword is in truth a bastardisation of the sorcerous greatsword gifted to him by Rennala, with time, study and the right materials you could create a demonic blade every bit the equal of the holy one you based it off though elementally opposed to it-or convert miracles normally bestowed by higher beings into magics that any sorcerer of sufficient skill could conjure. With a tremendous effort it might even be possible to take this principle of unification to its logical conclusion-and metaphysically merge yourself with a god, or similar entity."
1793,,400,Invisibility Cloak,Harry Potter,Making ,A perfect invisibility cloak much like Harry’s. Strangely it seems to fit you and two others regardless of your size. Perhaps Ignotus Peverell made two.
1794,,400,Case,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Making ,A briefcase that is far bigger on the inside and has numerous sections with different habitats for various beasts. The habitats magically adapt to best suit any beasts inside. Comes with a free Muggle Worthy Switch.
1795,,400,Real-Time Hex Indicator Map,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Making ,A map of your current continent that lights up whenever magic is used. With some tinkering you can cause it to only light up when specific sorts of magic are used.
1796,,400,Spitfire Bastion ,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"A volcanic fortress built into an active flow of firey lava and mana from deep beneath the earth, this military installation has a number of pirates ready to man it and defend it - and what’s more, it is more than ready on its own to perform the task. The Bastion is capable of coalescing and firing solid bursts of firey mana sourced from the earthly flow beneath it, each of its volley of 10 cannons firing off powerful and fast magical shots comparable to a lightning bolt in their speed and ferocity, making it highly defensible against invading ships.This very same flow can be tapped into as if it were a mountainous region for mana."
1797,,400,Merchant Scroll ,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"A rare item prized by the Coalition’s traders, this scroll is capable of converting precious metals, jewels, other forms of treasure as well as trade goods directly into the desired currency of choice. Even on a mundane level, it’s useful for instantly converting currency, but it can be a fantastic way to liquidate assets in a pinch. However, its other use is equally valuable - it can convert that same currency or treasure into basic survival goods, such as crates of fruit, bottles of water, or rope. 

Unfortunately, the prices fluctuate near constantly, as can be seen by the scroll’s text shifting, and most of the goods “sold” by it boil down to the kind of things you’d see on the register for any good expedition: mundane tools, salt, jerky, and filtered water. But at the very least, with it, you won’t starve while clinging to a treasure chest of gold if you don’t want to. Though some are stingy enough to do just that. "
1798,,400,Endless Atlas ,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"An enchanted atlas that when opened, shows magical projections, accurate to the landscape you're ""looking up"" with it - it updates with new pages and effects as you enter new lands, making it highly valuable for travellers. The Atlas itself has been made difficult to tear, and will regenerate torn pages - though the pages are sadly inert once they’ve been torn from the atlas. "
1799,,400,Jadecraft Artisan ,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"You are able to create the jade artifacts and weaponry that the River Heralds favor, granting your magic additional power, becoming much stronger and defending against both physical and magical effects - though Jade is most effective when surrounded by true natural landscapes, the more primal the more effective the Jade's blessing."
1800,,400,Mace Of The Valiant,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making,"Eldraine’s weapons are often infused with the same kind of honor as its knights, with this Mace acting as an example of what simply carrying the light of hope during your battles. This mace wreathes itself in the flame of the Circle of Loyalty, the silver fire’s strength becoming greater the more of your allies are alongside you, at a maximum of 25 allies. When you reach the pinnacle of this weapon’s might, even being able to see the blazing beacon of its might brings succor to the innocent and fear as well as pain to the wicked."
1801,,400,Architect's Kit,MtG - Zendikar,Making,"The people of Zendikar do not trust long term shelter; the Roil makes remaining in one place an exercise in foolhardiness, but over the years some shelters have been built. Those that came before you made these notes on the construction from simple materials of a structure that could survive the rigors of the Roil, along with the tools need to work stone and wood. With these notes and tools, and a little creativity, you might build structures akin to the ruins of the lost civilization's temples, which last the test of time and even being uprooted from the ground to roam the sky and crash down again, not to mention weather the fiercest storms and earthquakes. Or you could simply build a hut that you don’t need to rebuild every 3 months."
1802,,400,A Devoted Dagger,MtG - Zendikar,Making,"All across the land non beleivers strike down the emmisaries of the gods but even in death the servitors grant the faithful some measure of the gods favour catved from the bones of one such slain drone was this dagger. When used in a sacrificial ritual, this sinuous dagger performs a pale imitation of the gods own feasting converting the life of the slain to raw colourless mana."
1803,,400,Hedron Arms Cache,MtG - Zendikar,Making,"While it is possible to harm the Eldrazi with conventional arms, it is orders of magnitude more difficult than using the re-purposed herdrons. This cache of arms contains 100 re-purposed hedrons, fused to stone and cast as arms and armor by the greatest stoneforgers of the modern age. The cache consists of five swords, five spears, two sets of full plate able to be worn in their entirety or as individual pieces, three bows and fifty arrows. This cache restocks weekly with new equipment, allowing you to accumulate weaponry to supply your allies and the weapons found inside bypass the reality altering effects protecting the greater Eldrazi and other similar beings. "
1804,,400,Network Notes,MtG - Zendikar,Making,"A truly massive collection of pages worn with age. Scattered and in no discernible order is a combination of diagrams showing the flow of mana, various theoretical notes on the intersection between lithomancy, some form of life magic, various esoteric colourless magics, various pieces of Eldrazi biology and theories regarding their greater bodies and feeding habits. These yellowed pages hold the secrets to the Hedron Network - the system used to bind the titans to the plane, and with it you could reseal them or with some little adaption bind similar entities to physical realms through their avatars or simply in their entirety."
1805,,400,Untainted Artisan ,MtG - Shandalar,Making,"A possible problem with creating self-contained artifacts to wield magical abilities is that they are often universally usable - even by your foes. Some might infuse it with organic parasites that channel life-force to heal them from damage you inflict, others might seek to take control of them to turn your creations against you, and there are countless other dangers involving others seeking to twist your creations against their purpose. You have studied these effects in great detail, and you have resolved to never allow your works to be corrupted so. You gain insights into the fundamental workings of anything you build or design, allowing you to modify their schematics or function in such a way they will resist any outside influence. Controlling magics and other enchantments slide off their workings like water off a stone, corrupting or parasitic entities will find no purchase, and while this does not prevent your creations from being damaged (or destroyed outright), even such damage will not introduce vulnerabilities like one might otherwise expect."
1806,,400,Sword of Fire and Ice,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"A sword with an elaborate twisting pommel and decorative guard, it's split blade glowing with a cold, humming blue and with roaring red flames. Strikes against a foe have the hungry flame leap to nearby enemies, and just holding the blade fills your mind with a cold focus, allowing you to think clearly in the heat of battle. It's power only seems to grow when opposing impulsive forces and those who rely most on their magic."
1807,,400,Sword of Feast and Famine,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"A iron-colored, though definitely not mundane sword with spikes on the guard. It's blade glows with black and green energy, each blow sapping at the will and focus of the enemy and regenerating any pools of power you may have, granting you renewed strength to strike them down. It seems to be even more effective when used against beasts and the undead, eating away at their corrupted flesh."
1808,,400,Sword of War and Peace,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"A sword of black steel, with a perfectly round guard and two blades- one shining with divine light, the other burning with pure flame. Each attack with this sword invigorates you, closing wounds and mending flesh- and burning your enemies, the flames growing more vicious when fighting those who would be lords and hedonists."
1809,,400,"And from scraps, perfection",MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"Some say that there is a point where things become useless, where they can only be discarded-but you know better than that. It is the purpose of the great furnaces to take the cast off metals and slag of New Phyrexia and forge them anew, but imperfect materials lead to imperfect products-and yet, you have learned to remove these imperfections, how to wash away the impurities of flesh and rusted steel, and refine them into the greatest steel and finest ceramics. No matter how bad the materials, you are able to work with them to create things just as good as if using ones in good condition.

All shall be a part of the Great Work, Jumper."
1810,,400,The Corpse Of Tradition,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making,"The Kami of this world are simultaneously its greatest resource, and its greatest weakness. Through a number of dubious means, you have managed to acquire a level of control over numerous lesser Kami. A Kami of Spring Cleaning, of Taco Tuesdays, of Insurance Fraud, of Children Who Jump In Mud, so on and so forth. Weak and pathetic all, though they could potentially be useful in the right circumstances. And, if you don’t intend to put up a front that you want them for their powers or connections, you can shove them into the provided experimental containment tubes, where they can safely be stored without any hope of rescue or escape until you’re ready to either sell them off or dissect them to see how they tick."
1811,,400,The Way Of The Forge,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making,"Artificers are not Samurai. They have no unique trick like Bushido to utilize in battle, for most of their power is tied up in the creation of their artifacts. A superb artificer however, can be expected to make the same things with less power, less materials, and less effort than their peers. Something you can now do as well. Creating artifacts, constructs, equipment and their ilk costs you less - less magic is needed to power and activate them, less resources are needed to create or repair them, and less effort is needed to maintain or duplicate them. The amount of “less” is not particularly great, but is more than enough to turn the tide of battle in your favor or leave you a solid step above other craftsmen."
1812,,400,Stone of Torments ,MtG - Kamigawa,Making,Stone of torture that keeps folks from dying way past their time. The stone will not keep death away from the mortally wounded but it will always take the longest possible amount of time for expiration to happen. Around this stone even the unconventional beings like the most strange Kami feel pain as a mortal would. Whilst this may not make them as fragile as a mundane being they will surely feel the sting of your blade in this stone’s presence.
1813,,400,Crystal Blades of Zo-Zu,MtG - Kamigawa,Making,"This pair of weapons, odd short Naginatas, are formed from clear gemstone and bear a powerful property. These weapons can deflect any magic they block away from the wielder if the wielder is good enough to get the blades in the way of such attacks. The weapons themselves are incredibly sharp of blade and hard of haft, to the point of being nigh unbreakable. You may import one or two weapons of your choice to gain the aesthetics and/or powers of this on weapons you already possess."
1814,,400,Innovation,MtG - Lorwyn,Making,"Beyond the thoughtweft and their community spirit, kithkin have other quirks. They are innovative builders and alchemists, using both craftsmanship and magic to construct melee weapons, armor of leather and bronze, bows, slings, traps, farming equipment, furniture, potions, powder-bombs, barrier rings, flight auras, and balloon-driven air vehicles. 

Whether it be an ingeniously designed bow that could double as a flying device or a more obvious balloon, a gleaming suit of armor or a robe stuffed to the gills with trinkets and devices, you are a master at designing and creating all of these.

But it’s when you try to mix this simpler artifice and magic seamlessly together into a complete whole, with perhaps a bit of alchemy as well, that your innovative genius truly shines and allows you to design and craft things unheard of before.

Your creations will be worth more than the sum of their parts."
1815,,400,Stitcher/Ghoulcaller,MtG - Innistrad,Making,"It is a dark thing to deny a soul their eternal rest after a pious life. But with this you may do so, and blaspheme terribly against the Church as a necromancer. In this world there are two kinds that raise the dead. Those like Gisa who raise them from their graves en masse, in whatever form they might remain after their burial. And madmen in laboratories like the stitcher Geralf that loot graveyard for parts, to create Skaabs, abominations, hulking creatures the composite of many victims, and even animals, should they desire. Combined with dread purpose. I have seen winged, tentacled monstrosities thrice the size of a man, and hulking multithreaded goliaths in my days as a cathar. Horrible to fight, worse to bury, since you can't even tell who they might once have been. Choose stitcher or ghoulcaller you may purchase the other at a discount discounts stack."
1816,,400,Mystical Armament,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Making,"Many Planeswalkers use spells to win battles, but many more favor a weapon unique to them. Not being satisfied with even masterly crafted weapon, this is a potent artifact specifically designed to boost your combat prowess. This artifact will have abilities in one of three possible categories. The first option is that it can be an extremely offensively powerful artifact like the Blackblade used by Gideon or Godsend used by Elspeth Tirel, objects with the power to bring low deities and elder dragons. The second option would be like that of the Chain Veil or a weapon like those wielded by the Gods of Theros such as the Bident of Thessa, artifacts with potent effects that enhance magic. Or lastly, it can be something like the Arkbow wielded by Vivien, or Kaya’s Needles, weapons that specialize in manipulating or fighting a very particular type of creature. This can be purchased multiple times, you can import items into this."
1817,,400,Magic Suppression Cuffs,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making,"Basically what it says on the tin. Handcuffs that, when placed on a target, temporarily nullifies their magic, rendering it unusable. While these cuffs nullify magic, they won’t stop abilities that don’t originate from magic or are just physical characteristics. The cuffs you possess have the unique ability to change shape depending on who you are restraining. If they are somehow broken or destroyed (though that will take a LOT of damage), you will have another set waiting in your Warehouse in 24 hours."
1818,,400,Grousing Gadgeteer ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making,"Like Ghastly Bespoke, Kenspeckle Grouse, and Doctor Rote all rolled into one, you have immense talent when it comes to the creation of all varieties of enchanted or magical items. Whether it’s Ghastly’s protective clothing, woven razor Cleaver scythes, a magical prison like the Cube, Kenspeckle Grouse’s life-annihilating Desolation Engine, sentient magical machines like the Engineer, or even the magic-boosting Accelerator itself, you have the skills needed to create them. More powerful creations like the Cube and the Accelerator will certainly take more time, resources, and experimentation to fully develop, of course."
1819,,400,Divine Staff ,Magi: Alma Torran,Making,"The Divine Staffs are a set of 72 metal staves, exceptional in craftsmanship, granted to humanity by Ill Ilah. Though nowadays they are primarily used to supply energy to the Gunuds, the Divine Staffs’ true ability is to allow their wielders to draw far greater quantities of Magoi from God, effectively empowering their spellcasting to heights many tens of times greater than that of a Magician without one. With one of these Staffs, a Magician usually capable of shooting only small lightning bolts could instead conjure blasts which could rip through rows of heavily-armoured, flying fortresses. There is a catch, though – since a Magician’s Third Eye isn’t really made to handle such great quantities of Magoi, continually casting such powerful magic for more than a few minutes at a time can be dangerous to the user’s health, potentially causing serious bodily harm or death if used for too long.

Aside from this primary benefit, a Divine Staff has a number of other, more minor benefits, too. Firstly, anyone who wields one will be able to wield magic using it as if they were an actual Magician, even if that person wouldn’t normally have the slightest capability to cast spells, though if they do so they’ll be limited to a single type of magic (one of heat, water, light, lightning, wind, sound, strength, or life, chosen when you make this purchase). Secondly, a Divine Staff is capable of emitting an Isolation Barrier in a wide area around itself – that is, a field where it is impossible for magic to be used. Naturally, though, you would be unable to use the staff’s other abilities while this is in effect.

The staff you receive by purchasing this option is completely unbreakable and, unlike normal variants, will continue functioning as normal without a godly source to channel Magoi from, allowing it to work in worlds without Ill Ilah or a similar being."
1820,,400,Arch Enemy Event Weapon,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Making,"Or if for some reason you don’t want to create your own, you can simply take one that already exists. The second was a sword that controlled and created ice. The third was a gun that fired bullets that pierced space. The fourth and sixth were an automaton and a sword that negated magic formula. The fifth was a sword that could cut through anything. The six was a staff that enhanced alchemy by creating and destroying matter. The eighth was an infinitely long chain that damaged the mind of the target. The ninth was an overly large nail that completely nullified magic, and could destroy the others. The first, and most powerful, was what amounted to a killsat, firing lasers large enough to wipe a city off the map."
1821,,400,Scroll of the False Prophet,Campione,Making,"Not really a scroll, to be honest with you, although it can take that form if you so desire. What I present to you here is a lesser copy of the Holy Grail, one that can mimic a particular function, if ever so altered. I’m talking about the Divine Ancestor creation ritual, which leads into turning things and beings into dragons. As you can guess, it has been modified, so it can turn even a normal human into the equivalent of a divine beast in power. While it has its uses as is, you can always apply yourself to understand better the ritual and modify it further."
1822,,400,Eion,Campione,Making,"Also called the Grimoire-Maker, this little carved stone works by stealing a great deal of divinity from its victim, sealing the power inside itself. Depending on who the divinity was stolen from, it may change its size and shape. You can later use it by breaking it and released a divine beast around or make a giant explosion. You could always learn to harness the power stolen in other ways, but it would certainly take some time to do so. It could be used in other beings outside Gods, with similar effects."
1823,,400,Mystic Armory,Fate/Extella,Making,"A range of mystic codes, already unlocked and well fitted to you. Around a dozen in total, with four linked code casts to each outfit. While it is difficult to wear more than one at a time, the code casts linked to this have no cooldowns like personal use ones do. Instead, they can only be used a certain number of times per engagement, needing a short rest to recharge their uses. These Mystic Codes contain mostly middle to high level effects. Powerful buffs to all of a Servant’s statistics, immediately healing all wounds they’ve taken, reflective shields, teleporting in new allies and even instantly allowing a free use of their Noble Phantasm without the normal energy requirements. "
1824,,400,Origin Regalia,Fate/Extra CCC,Making,"What a powerful Mystic Code you possess now. An outfit attuned to the Origin itself, this regalia can bring out the potential of any who wear it. An average Servant would be able to match high ranking ones, and an already powerful Servant would become an incredibly dangerous opponent even to peers. Perhaps if a Master wears it, they might be able to fight against weak Servants? It does shift in appearance depending on who wears it, although it always seems to be oddly skimpy for some reason, but to bring out this outfit’s true power, you must awaken the Origin of whoever wears it. Dive into the deepest recesses of the soul of the wearer, defeat the incredibly powerful guardian within, and the outfit will gain even greater attunement to the power of the wearer, letting them fight on equal terms with the Moon Cell itself. You don’t need to worry about how to use this, as the outfit will guide you should you wish. Well, theoretically at least. See, Servants with this level of potential aren’t very common, but even without the possibility of awakening the Origin, a normal Servant would benefit quite a lot from this Mystic Code. How did you even come to obtain it?"
1825,,400,Opponent Customizer,Fate/Extra CCC,Making,"Having a bunch of mobs is all well and good, but sometimes you have to put a personal touch in your little killing machines. You have come in the possession of a certain tool that lets you create and customize Enemy Programs of your own making. They require energy to make, of course, but by stealing some data from the Moon Cell you’d be unlikely to have much issue with this. You have a wide variety of choices in what you can make, and could even design an Enemy Program to be a counter to some specific Servant or other enemy you have in mind. And, well, you’re not actually restricted in how powerful you can make them, although the resource requirement to create these rises incredibly quickly, not quite exponentially but close.

From enemy programs that can challenge the average Servant, to terrifying bosses that could serve as worthy opponents to a high ranking Servant, the only limit is how much energy you can dump into the design. Do be careful with what you make, however. After they are destroyed, it would take some time for the enemy program to reboot to become usable again. Something that could go toe to toe against an average Servant would take weeks to recover, and a boss able to give a high ranking Servant a good fight would need months. Perhaps if you make a powerful enough enemy program it would require years or decades to return from destruction, should their data not have been deleted outright. By default their aesthetics will be those of the Moon Cell’s enemy programs, but you are free to give them some other form of appearance."
1826,,400,Healing Fountain,Fate/Extra,Making ,"A small fountain will be added to your Warehouse. Drinking from this fountain will fully restore your health and all sources of energy, but the fountain's energy will need an hour or so to recharge before it can restore you once again. Drinking during this time will just give you a mouthful of clean water."
1827,,400,Tools That Make The Man,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"Every hero in these lands isn’t just known for their own feats, they’re also known for what they used
to do those things. It’s with their tools of legend, their divine treasures in many cases, that they
crafted their legends. You find yourself far more fortunate than most heroes when it comes to
getting your hands on magical items or other powerful artefacts where you are. Even not searching
for them and living an easy life, it’s likely you’d find at least a few minor but useful tools each year, maybe even something moderately powerful like an enchanted blade. Should you be actively
questing and fighting dangerous monsters, you’ll actually find that you almost trip over small magic
tools and could have half a dozen powerful magical items in your arsenal in just a year’s time. You
very quickly master the use of them, especially any unique properties they have, and can even find
that they prove much more hardy and useful in your hands than in others, showing twice or even
thrice the normal effectiveness."
1828,,400,Goddess of War,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"A red sash, stolen from the amazons, that is imbued with an immense amount of magical power, particularly that of the divine. By wearing it and focusing on the sash, a user can channel it into their
body, their weapons or their magic. The energy of the sash can greatly enhance the strength and
speed of these things, along with making them much tougher and any inherent magic significantly
stronger. The sash also has the property of greatly enhancing divine abilities and power of the
wearer. The sash must be worn to gain the benefits but is exceptionally tough and resistant to
damage."
1829,,400,Swordsmith,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making,"What else shows the spirit of the Japanese but the famed katana blade? Such a central part of their
mythos as to have the most famous craftsmen become like heroes themselves. No matter how great, they do not remember the makers of armor or shields like they do artisans of the blade. On the level
of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an
ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split
magical steel and blades that don’t shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have
magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much
greater distance than just the physical blade.

Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to
create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single
slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally
craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps. 

With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is
effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be
able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword."
1830,,400,Ame no Sakahoko,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making,"The Heavenly Retracing Spear used in the creation of Japan by Izanagi and Izanami in ages past. While it is unclear as to the authenticity of the spear, it’s power is undeniable. A divine weapon of
enormous power, a strike from the spear can badly wound even the greatest demon found in these
lands and most Divine Spirits will find it just as grievous an injury. But such brutish destruction is only
a side effect of the incredible power contained in the spear. 

As it was used to raise the archipelago, so too can it be used on reality now. The spear can churn
reality itself, taking space and time with all it’s matter, meaning and fates to their original form. All
creation is reduced to primordial chaos, a shining black fluid from which existence came about. Even
something such as a heroic spirit would find their Spirit Origin negated and cut from space-time. The
churning requires the steady swirling of the spear in contact with the target, though powerful beings
can expand this into a growing area around the spears’ point. Once this chaos has been generated, raising the spear will allow the wielder to create anew from the fluid, making land and life from the
most basic building material of existence. This requires power and intense mental calculation, as
opposed to the simple reduction of turning already existing things to their original state. 

A normal human would be unlikely to affect more than what they could physically churn with the
spear nor make anything beyond mundane dirt and vegetation. A powerful youkai, onymouji or hero
of some sort could like churn dozens of meters of reality around themselves at a time and bring
about most mundane existences through the primordial runoff. It would take a powerful deity to
churn and create on the scale of Japan itself however, even Izanagi taking time and care to raise the
archipelago from the chaotic sea. Intelligent beings must generally be directly struck with the spear
to begin reduction, unless they are greatly inferior to the wielder."
1831,,400,Motherhood,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making,"All things in this world come from a mother, be it an animal mother or mother Earth. With your long
and storied history with motherhood, you thought to take things to a bit more of an exceptional
level. You have the ability to create life and nature, so long as you have taken in the right
information to do so. By taking a living being or part of nature within you, through consumption of a
part of it or some other method of receiving genetic information from a living being within your
body, you’re able to imprint that information inside you and create new life based on it. Taking a
human in this way would allow you to create humans, as infants or fully grown adults, with a small
expenditure of mana, enough for even a normal person to make two or three adults this way. Take
in a dog’s information as well and you could even mix the two, creating dog-men. You can even pass
down information you know and wish into them, moulding their personalities, skills and memories. Enough energy and you could birth entire armies. Not that you need to literally give birth to them. It
is possible for you to simply create this new life in front of you from your energy. And as mentioned
before, this also applies to any part of the natural world. Sip from a river and with enough mana
spent, you could create an entirely new river."
1832,,400,Fangs of the Beast,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making,"The greatest of warriors only become such with the greatest of tools, which themselves must be
made from the greatest of materials. What greater materials could there be than those legendary
finds at the end of quests, the mythical beasts that heroes slay or even the bodies of the hero
himself? You are a master at the creation of all kinds of magical weapons, armour and items, capable
of crafting even things like some of the magical spears wielded by the Knights of the Red Branch. Your proper talents come to the fore when making items from the body parts of slain monsters or
magical beings, allowing you to not only create results of far higher quality than normal but also to
retain some or all of the magical powers inherent to the being you are using as materials. "
1833,,400,Fragarach,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Making,"The sword of retrograde, a divine weapon that can counter only the greatest of attacks. Fragarach is
the weapon of Lugh, the War God, who has gifted it to the bloodline he most favours, which would
happen to be your own. Now flowing through your blood, you have the ability to create Fragarach
with a short ritual, taking the form of simple orbs after you have poured your blood onto a sphere
made of a hard material, from metal to lead. These orbs allow you to use the full power of Fragarach. Ordinarily, they will simply produce short blades and fly around at immense speeds at your mental
command, like lasers that attack your enemy from afar. There is no limit to how many you can
control this way at once, save your mental coordination. The true power of the blade is only shown
when an enemy utilises their strongest attack, as this allows you to activate the main ability of one
of your orbs. Should an enemy use their strongest attack and you have the time to call the name of
Fragarach in return, along with access to at least one orb near you, time will be rewritten. Fragarach
will tear through time and space to unleash an immensely powerful laser blast directly into the heart
of the enemy, before they used their ultimate attack. This blast could leave a hole the size of a
pebble or obliterate someone’s entire torso, either way it leaves few survivors and prevents the
enemy from using their attack. Those who can survive such wounds will be unaffected however. It is
possible with more training that you could unlock more powerful or unique usages of this weapon
but only time would tell what those are. This cannot be imported into."
1834,,400,A Bard’s Tale,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making,"Why lead an army to conquer the world when you can change it to your liking without ever needing
to leave your own study? The power of a story is not always so grand but it has only become more
influential as the barbaric days of the past are left behind and communication becomes ever easier. Your skill as a wordsmith, playwright and orator is one of very few peers, outside the rare exception
like the Bard himself. Be it novels, plays, poems or all at once, your gift is sure to earn widespread
acclaim and wealth if you publish your works. Not to mention how well the upper class and even
royalty tend to receive you when you write a story casting them in a favourable light. Most of your creative endeavours tend to only become more popular and influential as time goes on, easily
cementing your place in literature and theatrical history, as well as an easy path to influence the
world of the future through your writing.

But this is merely the mundane side of the entertaining word, you’ve reached beyond the ordinary
world already. Through both writing and oration, you can Enchant the world around you. With vivid
descriptions and praise, you can reinforce, enhance and even awaken magical powers in objects, people and even entire locations. A common longsword might gain unnatural sharpness as you
weave a tale of the battles it has seen it’s wielders through. The greater the existing history and
mystery of your target, the less limited you are in your Enchantments, though they require more and
more investment from you too. A common blade might be made supernatural but it will never
match truly legendary swords. On the other hand, with many days of inspired fabrication, the
unnamed but personal sword of a noted hero could indeed grow to match the likes of Ascalon and
Excalibur. As they are but stories, these Enchants do fade in time, though using the enchanted object

A final and more costly ability discovered by you is to give form to your words and creations through
the use of magical energy. While it can be quite costly to create complex and large scale
obfuscations, it is entirely possible for you to scare away robbers with demonic phantasms or force
enemies to face illusions of old traumas and foes. Surely, your skill in writing characters will be
helpful in directing these phantasmal actors."
1835,,400,Green Man,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making,"Nothing more than a flicker in the leaves is seen before a hail of death rains down on your enemies. The legacy of the Green Man is yours to inherit now, a place under the title of Robin Hood if desired. Talent for stealth, enough to easily evade an army of knights and magi for months on end before
being caught despite constant raids on them, and skill for a bow, shooting an arrow through a
knight’s helmet visor from a thousand paces is hardly even a challenge, are the bread and butter of
this role. You’re even greater at both when in a dense forest, the trees and shrubbery never holding
you back and only enhancing your lethality. 

Guerrilla warfare is your calling and even as a single man, you’re enough to cripple whole armies or
small kingdoms. Traps, sabotage, poison and turning the terrain against them, you’re skilled at all
manner of small or large scale attacks in these ways. Long term effort could see two thirds of whole
armies as casualties or corpses. Your druidic knowledge aids in these efforts, allowing you to create
magical poisons or notably potent weapons from nature, as well as giving a friendship with fairies
and other creatures of the wild. Animals rarely attack you, if not helping you of their free will, and
the capricious fae act more as mischievous friends to you than malicious devils.

If the role of Robin Hood isn’t to your liking, you can also inspire a legend of your own with some
effort. Like the Green Man of fables, you can create a character without a name based on your
exploits, who will draw those with similar outlooks and abilities to take up that role when you are
unable. All will share the same title, becoming nameless figures to play out the role you’ve created. A mysterious outlaw fighting for the common folk, a black knight who punishes the dishonorable o"
1836,,400,Flesh Doctor,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Making ,"To trespass on the realm of the gods, is there any higher realm that science can aspire to? Creating
life itself, a thinking homunculi made not from magic but electricity and biology. A triumph of
humanity’s progress and monument to their arrogance. Frankenstein’s legendary accomplishment
was too much for his mind to handle, feeble and unworthy of his own creation, but nothing prevents
you from stepping up to the plate. You have the same mastery of biological and electrical sciences as
Doctor Frankenstein, able to create the required machines to manipulate lightning and life itself. With the right resources, you can recreate or even improve on his artificial lifeform. This knowledge
can of course be used for other means, creating tools to harm or manipulate life as easily as it can
create new life.

The skills to create are easily turned to repair, applicable to both your own creations and other
forms of artificial life, finding yourself with a talent for easily putting back together in functional
form these beings. Unlike the fool doctor, you are also gifted with understanding of the new life you
make, an almost empathetic connection to help you realise their desires and emotions.
 
With enough work, you can also extend the practice of creating life to any other science or
intellectual discipline you know. A rudimentary artificial intelligence made from steam powered
machines, a living spell crafted by the hands of a magi or even more bizarre creations, thoughtforms
given true life through the practices of a psychologist. "
1837,,400,A Tale of Reality,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Making,"There is a certain kind of magic in stories, a magic that comes to life when you tell a tale. As you
recite a story to the air or write it down or actively communicate it in some way, you are able to
bring the stories from fiction into reality. Simply by expending magical energy, creatures appear in
the real world just by you describing them or writing about them. Even drawing a creature might see
it lift itself off the page. And you are far from just being limited to making monsters. Objects, magical
items, buildings, entire locations or even describing events or conditions and applying them to
someone in the real world. The greater the power and scale of the fiction to be made real, the more
energy it will take from you to create. The energy must be maintained to a lesser level once the
target is created, though more powerful and larger fictions will take more maintenance, failing to
supply the energy results in your creations fading away. 

Some things may be too much for you but your power offers a way to circumvent this. The more
famous, well known and well regarded a particular story is on the world you are presently located, the easier it will be to manifest things from that story into reality. While you can always make up a
story to achieve any effect you wish, such would come with ruinous energy costs. By relying on the
many famous tales that already exist, you can achieve feats far beyond what your level of magical
power indicates possible for you."
1838,,400,Doctor of Death,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Making,"The techniques of the Hashashin leaders are sourced through the modification of their own beings. The body and even the mind or spirit becomes subject to all kinds of gruesome experiments in their
pursuit of power and the ability to deal death on a higher level. Beyond just knowing one of their techniques, you are aware of the methods to create such techniques, though your studies have
taught you the general tools and processes rather than the specific methods to the powers of the
Hashashin. You have the skill and ability to mould the bodies, minds and spirits of other beings in
order to grant special abilities. This can be as simple as grafting the limbs of demons to human
bodies and having them work to as complex as separating out the alternate personalities within a
madman’s head to allow him to summon them as separate beings in reality.

Your skills with the alteration of the form also extend to other uses, such as practical healing and
medicine, brainwashing or therapy, even creating your own monsters instead of altering the bodies
of existing beasts. Most bodies however, have a limit on what you can do with them. As impressive
as what you can do is, a human body can rarely take more than one or two major alterations before
it ceases to function properly. Perhaps in time you could discover how to extend those mortal
limitations."
1839,,400,Holy Order,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Making,"Once a man has pledged his life and lineage to you, a sword or a spell taken for your service seems
terribly minor. Those that consider themselves your loyal servants and genuinely pledge themselves
to you in someway, such as a loyal knight to their lord or a husband that seeks to serve their wife, you find yourself able to borrow from them in time of need. Their equipment can be summoned to
your service with a thought, a spiritual replica that performs as well as the original and is even able
to move through the air as if wielded by the original owner. While there is technically no limit to how
many things you may call on at once, beyond it only working on what your servants consider their
primary equipment, anything beyond thirteen items at once will begin to steadily drain your energy
at greater levels. Additionally, not only can consumables like potions not be replicated this way, it
requires you to expend magical energy or equivalents to activate things that need it."
1840,,400,Ring of Power,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Making,"Magical rings are a classic of heroic fables, both as tools for the hero and as objects of destruction. You’ve managed to come upon one of quite some power, though the exact specifics are up to you to
decide. An example would be the Angelica Cathay, last held by the paladin Bradamante. It granted
moderate protection against magic to her and the ability to remove curses and magical
transformations done to others with a touch, provided they were not of immense power. A twist of
the ring will turn the user invisible to the mundane and magical eyes, while a pulse of magical power
will grant an extreme increase in defence to the user and their allies for a few seconds, turning an
ordinary man’s skin to steel. Lastly, the ring could be used to significantly empower weapons held in
the same hand it was worn, granting them half again their normal offense. You can choose to take
Angelica Cathay or create your own ring, taking a range of minor to moderate powers or perhaps
one or two more significant ones. Extra purchases are allowed and will discount this option again."
1841,,400,Dark Benefactors ,Kara no Kyokai,Making,"A mix of good fortune and experience in the dark side of the city have left you with quite the web of contacts. A wide range of criminal connections make obtaining illegal work of a high paying nature or access to black markets very easy, all across the country. You’ve even got some that consider your trusted friend or contractor, willing to help out with a few favours if you need a new identity, somemuscle for a job or a hefty loan. But your allies extend beyond the mundane world. You’ve done work for a number of powerful supernatural benefactors in the past, not very pleasant ones either. But they like you, or at least think you’re far too useful to kill off, and they’ll supply work that’s dangerous, entertaining and highly rewarding all at once. Often, rather than just money, they’ll payin favours or magical rewards, like Mystic Codes or using their powers to aid another task of yours. You’ll always have this web of criminal and darker supernatural contacts in future worlds, usually your starting country. Extending the network once you have it, here or elsewhere, seems quite bit easier too. Your own suppliers, contacts and employers often recommend you to new allies if you do good work. "
1842,,400,A Crate of Ingredients ,Cultist Simulator,Making,"This 3m x 1m x 1m wooden shipping crate can contain any assortment of ingredients that could be useful for your occult rituals or other activities. They don’t need to be magical in nature. This includes, but is not limited to: powders, poisons, tinctures, extracts, plants, body parts, ores, or even gemstones. You could even find an entire corpse inside it, provided it fits. To claim them, simply think of the materials you need and open the crate. The crate will be neatly organized and filled to the brim with everything you asked for inside it. This crate will restock exactly 1 week after being emptied.
"
1843,,400,Lantern Maker ,Sonny,Making,"With all these mystical artifacts going around, someone had to be making them. You’re a drab hand with decent skill in multiple forms of craftsmanship, from blacksmithing to weaving, but where this perk really shines is a special property you can imbue your creations with. Just about everything you make can enhance people in some way shape or form, be it increasing strength, increasing their endurance, and if you’re skilled with magic you could also find a way to imbue elemental properties into equipment. There are even ways for you to boost your own mana capacity or elemental affinities, though that will take some time.
"
1844,,400,Time​ ​Key​ ​,Sailor Moon,Making,"You have a weaker version of the time key. While this time key cannot let you travel back in time, it will help you be more precise about the moment you wish to arrive if you do any sort of time travelling. It also can help stabilize any huge sized time-space distortions.
"
1845,,400,Totems ,Stardew Valley,Making,"Carving wood and imbuing it with magic is an mystical art as old as time. They were used to ward away evil, protect homes from disease, and even entreat the spirits for more favorable weather. Few, if any, practice this craft anymore now that the nature spirits who once taught it have withdrawn. While there is more to the art than simple weather forecasting, that is where your knowledge begins. With an investment of power, a few rare components, and a little skill at woodcarving, you can create totems that seek to alter the weather of the next day. Never into anything out of season, asking for snow in summer is simply impossible, and turning a predicted hurricane into sunny skies might be asking a bit much. But toning it down to a thunderstorm instead or making clear skies cloud over is within your reach. You might, with experimentation, find more interesting uses for such devices of stored magic.
"
1846,,400,Eyes on the World ,Kara no Kyokai,Making,"Mystic Eyes are the term given to the unique powers and appearances found at times in the eyes of Magi and magical creatures. So many types exist, and such a reputation has built around them, that their possession has become both a status symbol and a sort of culture in itself. From the most simple and base Mystic Eyes of Charm to the almost sacred and miraculous Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, they are deeply desired and feared across the world. But they are ultimately just tools, that is what you have found. And tools can be broken, altered, even made new. Again, it is more than a field of study in magecraft. What you have is a universal gift relating to eyes and the magics they hold. You’re already well studied on the many kinds of Mystic Eyes and their effects, with your immense talent regarding them allowing you to start to create tools to affect them or even make Mystic Eyes themselves. Glasses that seal their effects or enhance them, surgical tools to safely extract and transplant the eyes, contacts that focus their effects towards specific uses, eyedrops that reverse their powers for a time. New Eyes often involve binding some magecraft or power you are knowledgeable on into the eyes you know how to grow, then inserting and connecting them to the user. It’s even possible to combine and stack eyes with each other, since your skills extend to biological alteration of ocular organs. Two Mystic Eyes of the same sort placed within each other could form an un-ending mirror, trapping their targets in a spell for eternity. Effectively, you have incredible skill in most medicine and magecraft relating directly to Mystic Eyes and immense talent in furthering that, both in this world and in regards to any other eyes you might encounter.
"
1847,,400,Philosopher's Stone ,DC Occult,Making,"A perfect replica of the Philosopher's Stone, one of the Four Wonders of Alchemy. Legendary even outside of occult circles and widely sought after, the Philosopher's Stone is the ultimate goal of every alchemist to ever live. The small stone possesses the ability to alter the molecular structure of inorganic matter into other elements.
"
1848,,400,Thrifty Thaumaturge ,Young Justice,Making,"Sometimes, you need to take shortcuts when performing magic. Luckily for you, you’ve turned what other magic users might call laziness into an art form. You can substitute similar regents for each other when performing rituals, casting spells, or when creating magical items. Recipe calls for bottled chi? How about some mana instead? Need soul gems? I’m sure you’ll find these diamonds will suffice. Need the blood of a dragon? I’m sure that lizard’s will do. This can’t be used to substitute ingredients that are integral to what you’re trying to do; for example, if you were trying to make a potion to copy someone’s appearance, and said potion required their hair or DNA or whatever, you’d still need to have that for the potion to work, and if a ritual calls for a specific item you’ll still need to have it.
"
1849,,400,Alchemy ,Valkyrie Profile,Making,"At its most basic, alchemy is simply the creation of magic concoctions and items with a range of effects, from the mundane, such as healing items and exploding liquids, to the horrifying and illegal, such as the much feared Ghoul Powder that turns the living into mindless demons. From there, many alchemists learn the difficult and resource intensive formula for altering one material into another, and that's where their knowledge ends. But the true potential of alchemy is that it holds the ability to manipulate life, much like necromancy manipulates the dead. With the right knowledge, an alchemist can experiment and create horrible monsters and abominations, even imbuing them with magic and other mystical abilities, or even create a perfect simulacra of a human. The one thing outside of Alchemy's power is the creation of souls, so their creations may be alive or even think, but they don't truly feel the way a natural creature would. There's nothing preventing an alchemist with knowledge of other disciplines from transferring a soul into an empty vessel, however. On the other hand, there is much more to alchemy that nobody has yet uncovered, and further research can uncover further uses of alchemy.
"
1850,,400,Dimensional Inventory ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Making,"Do you want to keep your precious things close to you?​ You may store physical items within a time-frozen pocket dimension. This manifests one of two ways - either you can access items freely from your Warehouse, or you may store it within a bottomless dimensional pocket. However, if the latter contains any items you didn’t buy with CP or move to store into the actual Warehouse, the items are lost on the next jump - you will need to restock.
"
1851,,400,Jewel Magecraft ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,"Jewel Magecraft is a thaumaturgy involving transferring magical energy into jewels to act as single use Mystic Codes. Once magical energy is transferred into a jewel it will be tinted by the mystical properties of the gem; meaning that gems have properties that make specific gems more efficient with certain spells. For example a topaz is a gem that has anti-spirit properties and is useful for spells against spirits. It is possible to modify the properties of a jewel for different use at the cost of their efficiency. The flaw with this magical style is that the jewels break after use meaning they must be replaced constantly leading to this magical style being a very expensive practise.
"
1852,,400,Mana Constructs ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Making,"You know how to solidify mana into solid constructs. Things like shields are simple to create and with good enough timing you can create constructs around opponents that work as constraints. The shape is up to you when creating but complex mechanisms are unlikely to work well. The more mana you put in the stronger and/or larger the construct can be as well as longer lasting. With only twenty circuits this can be used to create shields the equivalent volume of a soccer ball and the durability of wood. Having a larger amount of magical energy will increase this. With a bit of training this can be extended to other forms of internal energy you possess.
"
1853,,400,Spirit Jar ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Making,"One of the most popular items in Banparasu,* this ornate urn with sea shells lining the base can absorb and contain all kinds of magic, even the magic from songs. However, the jar has a limited storage capacity; if magic is continually funneled inside without being emptied, the jar begins to expand like an overloaded water balloon until it explodes.
"
1854,,400,Go-shintai ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a go-shintai, almost a second body of your own, which contains some of your power. You may customise the general appearance and traits of the go-shintai, anything from a small object like a weapon or decorative item to an entire mountain. You may project any of your powers and abilities across your go-shintai, affecting anyone who uses it or touches it.
"
1855,,400,Oni Treasures ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have in your possession the four treasures of the Oni. The first is the Ibuki Gourd, a stylish large purple gourd with a stopper that has been soaked in the extract of a Sake Bug. Even a little bit of water in here somehow multiplies into a vast quantity of sake, though it never produces more than the gourd can hold at a time. With this treasure, you could easily ensure you never spend another moment of your life sober.

The second is Douju’s Jar, a large waist-high pot full of an endless amount of edible oil with no unusual properties beyond tasting smooth and nice. Perhaps you might want to establish a deep-frying business?

The third is the Hoshiguma Dish, a simple red sake dish that has the miraculous ability to raise the quality of any sake poured into it, making it taste much better and be far easier to drink. Note that the sake does not need to remain in the dish to benefit from the increased quality; pouring it into the dish and then pouring it out into another container is a perfectly valid way to amass a lot of high-quality sake. However, sake can only benefit from its blessing once.

The fourth, and most potent, is the Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines, a decorated sake box that can hold two litres of liquid at a time. Should a healthy person drink alcohol from the sake box, it temporarily grants them the strength of an Oni for a day at the price of shifting their personality to be like an Oni’s (read: crude, brash, coarse, loud and belligerent) until it wears off. If a sick, injured or otherwise unhealthy person drinks from it, however, it cures all of their ailments barring incurable mutilation from powerful magical relics at the small cost of permanently transforming their body into that of an Oni – though some might say this is simply another bonus. If a lot of people were to drink from this box, you can be assured it would cause incredible amounts of chaos.
"
1856,,400,Mini-Hakkero ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"You have a mystical, magical furnace shaped like an octagon and made of hihi’irokane. Each corner is emblazoned with a different trigram with different powers, such as generating a lot of heat, producing a cool breeze for hot days, and the ability to amplify magic through it to blast a Master Spark – enough to reduce a mountain to ashes. As such a potent magical item, it’s very handy for magical research too.
"
1857,,400,Devil's Bracelet ,Peter Pan,Making,"An evil charm that resembles a twisted cross between a worm and a snake. When the bracelet is put on a person's arm, it possesses the victim with the spirit of a (minor) devil, bringing evil thoughts to the surface. The bracelet's lock on the subject can be broken if exposed to soap bubbles.
"
1858,,400,Mystic Talisman ,Dragon Ball Super,Making,"A series of shining blue crystals, somewhat impressive magical artefacts that you have attained ownership of and skill in the use of. These talismans, when used together, can create a wide variety of magical effects. Up to 129 different kinds of illusions, such as phantom fireballs or changing the surrounding terrain to look different, and 76 different kinds of attacks, such as shadow binding spells or basic elemental attacks. While the attacks are not amazingly powerful, at least not by the standards of the fighters common around here, the sheer versatility the talismans offer can’t be underestimated. If broken, a talisman will restore itself a few hours later."
1859,,400,Sand and Bog Crafter ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"John and Wendy alike have become quite capable mages in their own ways, especially with their artificial creations: John has his sand golems, while Wendy has her bog bodies and moss gallants. You are now incredibly gifted at constructing and commanding animated guardians from various materials, whether moss, sand, or something else like ice or milk. The more magic you pour into their creation, and the more of a boost they’ll get when fulfilling whatever you define as their key prerogatives (guarding an area, carrying out knightly duties of chivalry and propriety, etc.). You can even place smaller golems inside larger golems – essentially two enemies in one.
"
1860,,400,Belly the Butcher’s Knife ,Neverland: The RPG,Making,"A magical knife from a pirate cook that perfectly skins animals every time you use it; this attribute might also come in handy in combat.
"
1861,,400,Mystery Cakes ,Wonderland No More,Making,"A half-dozen cakes with the words “Eat Me” on each of them. Like the Mystery Bottles, the cakes have random effects that you will not know until you taste them. For instance, an Angel Cake gives you a halo and increases your belief/faith (thus letting you use healing magic even if you have no magic potential or training), a Snow Cake literally makes you frosty and immune to cold, and a Christmas Cake contains a small, non-magical item as a prize. Generally, effects wear off after a few hours. Once a cake is eaten, a new, random cake will replace it following your next unbirthday. You might eventually be able to eventually identify a certain kind of cake if you’ve experienced its effects numerous times already (perhaps recognizing its decorations or its scent), but it’s impossible to identify any new random cake you haven’t tried before)."
1862,,400,Luck of the Indomitable ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Making,"When you look at the legend of Clegg the Indomitable, one in particular notes the amount of loot he has acquired both by sheer luck and burglary. His trusty swag bag, the lockpicks of Dimminu, the great sword-axes of Ostland, the Golden Rooster of Luccini, among many. Many others. His luck in both opportunity and operation is certainly the major chunk of his story. 

Now the same goes for you. You have absurd luck, when it comes to two things: Finding treasures both magical and mundane, and acquiring those treasures by whatever means you concoct; Particular favor being shown to methods that entail stealth and subterfuge. This luck is, in fact, so absurd that it almost resembles a blessing from Ranald himself, the trickster-god of thieves and gamblers.
"
1863,,400,Hunger Pains ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Making,"Your link with your hungry God grows ever stronger. The hunger within you is no longer content to simply allow you to do all the work, now it seeks to speed up that process. You have an innate understanding of how to cook anything edible to yourself or another guest of your kitchen. Just on sight, you know which tools to use, what pieces to cut off and what methods to utilise to cook something to perfection. You are even able to intuit what effects any particular piece may have when used in conjunction with the Lore of the Great Maw or other magics that make use of such parts.
"
1864,,400,The True Elements ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Making,"Mundane alchemists still believe in the Four Elements of Existence, but the highest Gold Wizards know better. Ninety True Elements, and sixteen compounds formed from True Elements and Aethyric elements. Knowledge of these, the simplest substances which all matter and gas can be broken down to, has aided your craft immensely. The Gold Order is known for making enchanted items for the Empire’s armies, and it is through these elements and compounds that you may now do the same. Swords that slice through enemy armor, chest plates that withstand direct hits from cannonballs, and even rods that sap the Aethyr from a wizard’s enemies are just examples of what you may now make with the right Materials.
"
1865,,400,Stross’ Formula ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Making,"Some time ago, Benedict Stross, a wizard of your Order, lost his hand for a rival wizard’s folly. Apologies were made, but Stross soon enough went mad, seeking to create a replacement from pure gold. It took his rival’s blood and a whole month to complete, but when the gauntlet was found by other Gold Magisters, neither Stross nor his rival were to be seen. You, however, have come upon this recipe one way or another - a formula for living gold. Not only that, your studies of it so far have refined the process enough to remove the unfortunate blood requirement. While right now you could make functional limb prosthetics of living gold, perhaps you might take this further, expanding to other metals both precious and base, and perhaps even metals beyond those known in this world. Perhaps you might instead seek to make entire bodies from living metal, though to what end I shudder to imagine...
"
1866,,400,Enchantment Mastery ,Generic Minecraft,Making,"Normally, enchanting is an...abstract practice at the best of times and completely up to the whims of fate at the worst here. However with this knowledge you have been granted and this Perk, you’re able to streamline the process, removing ambiguity and chance from the equation so you’re able to choose exactly what you wish to enchant. Also you’re unlimited on how much you can enhance a given object with enchanting...as long as you can pay the price in Magic or lifeforce, or whatever you’re using to enchant the item.
"
1867,,400,Minecraft ,Generic Minecraft,Making,"I mean, this is a rather obvious pun isn’t it. Purchasing this Perk grants you the ability to Mine and Craft much, much better. As in you can gather resources at twice the speed, quantity and quality of resource gathered and craft with twice the item’s quality and speed. This Perk also applies to any operations you oversee to do the above and is also the Capstone Booster for this Jump.
"
1868,,400,Magic Swag Bag ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Making,"The origin of Clegg the Indomitable’s magic sack is ambiguous and mysterious, a question wrapped in a riddle. It probably wasn’t very legal, in any case. But Clegg’s “swag bag” as he terms it is a potent magical rucksack - which happens to now have a brother in your own magicked sack - that improves the expert cat burglar’s thieving techniques.

The bag works by its holder - you or Clegg in this situation - staring at a person with highly valuable, and magical, artifacts on their person. While staring at them, you just reach into the swag bag, and mysteriously one of the items that person was carrying is gone. Instead it’s now in your hand, ready to be used as you see fit. The item stolen is, unfortunately, rather random at best - you might be wanting to swipe their enchanted sword, but instead get a person’s magical belt of strength enhancement.
"
1869,,400,Magical Clock ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Making,"This item is an era before it's time, designed here and now but never successfully built. What you have now it the framework of a clockwork watch, one with quite a few pieces missing. Oddly enough, it seems to keep perfect time, its gears spinning despite the lack of connections between them. Whenever you slay a foe or defeat an enemy, you'll find one of its many gears in their possession. Quite odd, but not unrealistic. Simply touch the missing pieces to it and it will repair itself, and after sixty such repairs it will be complete. At that point, if you slide the dial to 'XII', time in a short radius around you, about 50 feet, will freeze. Unfortunately, after sixty seconds time will resume and the watch will explode, its many cogs and gears mysteriously vanishing. If you wish to use it again, gather them up once more.
"
1870,,400,Bounty of the Wild ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Making,"Never underestimate the power of a hearty meal. The bounty of Hyrule is such that even an expertly cooked apple dessert could take a man from death’s door to fighting shape. Now, you can benefit from this even beyond the bounds of Hyrule. When you personally cook a meal, it will take on a nearly mystical dimension to it depending on both the quality and ingredients involved. The food and the ingredients have to be notably fresh, too, though pickled and salted ingredients would still work for this - but whatever magic is in these dishes doesn’t work if you don’t cook it yourself. Spicy or bold foods could give you a warm sensation that would let you comfortably run half naked in the frosty mountains, while an especially hearty or nutritious meal could even let you survive mortal wounds far beyond normal! Some days, all a traveler needs is a warm stew, right?
"
1871,,400,Fire and Ice ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Making,"The mark of a true journeyman of the trade, you have learned how to infuse elemental properties into the weapons you’ve forged, as well as create the entirely elemental weapons known as “Rods.” Though both of these require some ‘infused’ mystical energy to make, once forged anyone can wield them. In addition, if you have “Hammer and Anvil” and “Gimmick and Trick”, your crafting expertise is now such that you could create weapons worthy of the Royalty of Hyrule itself, granted to their guardians or rewarded to those who have shown great skill as a hero - yet nothing quite unique. Not yet.
"
1872,,400,Divide and Conquer ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Making,"But even with the mind to bypass the puzzles and a body to match, some things simply can’t be done in any reasonable timeframe or without an unacceptable resource expenditure. That’s why you’ve learned just enough magic to mimic the legendary Four Swords power, the ability to split yourself in four. Oh, the sword has a whole host of other abilities, but for now those don’t matter. It will take a toll on your magic and your body, but you can now divide yourself into up to four separate bodies. Specifically, each of these bodies contains 1/4th your full potential, and should they die, you will lose access to that power for weeks before it returns to you. Alternately, for a trivial amount of energy you can purposefully create a copy of you that is more akin to a shadow than actually solid - you’ll still lose access to your potential, but you probably won’t even notice losing such a small fragment."
1873,,400,The Hero’s Tools ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Making,"The tools by which legends are made don’t come from thin air - The Megaton Hammer had to have been forged once upon a time, and the potions that the hero uses to continue the fight were brewed by a crone at one point. It is the place of the wise to arm the strong and worthy - a place that you are well suited for. You’ve acquired a good sense for infusing magic and spells into objects or creating new objects with some knowhow of tinkering. Be it the water-breathing Zora tunic, the Hookshot or a potion to restore magic power, that which you make by your hands will surely be valued. While this alone doesn’t give you knowledge of a trade, it does allow you to augment what you do know with enchantments and magic - even being able to create magical sweets if all you knew to do was bake bread.
"
1874,,400,Forsaken Fortress ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Making,"While you understand the need to protect certain things from interlopers similarly to the arts of the wise, you rely on more...pragmatic means of doing so. You have an eye for constructing elaborate, dangerous and trap filled dungeons with esoteric and unclear security measures - the less intelligent would regard them as puzzles and riddles, if they had to describe them. While you could do this normally, you can also speed up the process or even bypass mundane bricklaying altogether via magic.The larger and more elaborate you make these dungeons, the more time and energy-consuming it is for you - however it’ll often be much faster than if you were to do so by hand."
1875,,400,The Great Forest ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Making,"The plantlife of the Kokiri forest is something to behold - from the industrious plant people known as the deku scrubs to the vicious power of the deku baba, as well as the useful properties of both the wood and nuts of the forest’s trees...Wouldn’t being able to grow such things be a great boon? With the wisdom of the Great Deku Tree now passed down to you growing and nurturing plants such as that which grows in the Kokiri Forest only requires a bit of magical energy from within imbued in a few seeds and perhaps a song played over the planting of said seeds - after that, it only takes water and sunlight like any other plant.
"
1876,,400,Take This Harp I Made ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Making,"Which came first. The oracle to wield the Harp of Ages, or the harp to help empower the Oracle of Ages? Questions on the nature of time travel aside, let's assume that the oracle made the harp. With that in mind, you can now create magical instruments of a similar kind to the Harp of Ages. The process is actually relatively simple: find an instrument and use it in tandem with whatever magica power you wish to empower it with. In other words, when singing songs of time travel, play your harp along with them and soon you’ll have a harp of time travel. Or a wand of winds, whatever you want.
"
1877,,400,A Shadow of Yourself ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Making,"While Ghirahim’s sensory abilities were weaker than Fi’s own, he compensated by being much more combat oriented, something that his arms were an indication of. Specifically, he has them, whereas Fi does not. Anyways, as a result of your more weaponized construction, you share Ghirahim’s ability to summon weaker copies of your blade, such a miniature you’s in the form of daggers, or even larger ones in the form of a broadsword. If you were willing to devote a great deal of energy into the process, or had a powerful enough wielder or patron deity, you could summon enough metal to create a whole body for yourself, allowing you to walk and talk and masquerade as a normalish person made out of metal and not a sentient sword. There’s no real limit to how many blades you can summon at once, just on how much energy you have.
"
1878,,400,The Witch’s Brew ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Making,"Medicine is vital in a dangerous land - Hyrule’s years of chaos ensured that anyone who worked with salves and potions had plenty of practice putting their skills to work. You have the arts and skills to create healing potions such as “The Water of Life.” 

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Wise Man’s Teachings - Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link first.)

And if you had “The Wise Man’s Teachings” could even craft artifacts that grant the power of “Heart Containers” to ensure that survival is a possibility in such a harsh place.
"
1879,,400,Eight Masks,TES: Dovah,Making,"These eight masks were gifted to eight Dragon Priests who lived on
the mainland of Skyrim. Henvoraak grants its wearer an exceptionally strong vitality,
rendering them immune to all diseases and poisons. Krosis improves the wearer’s skill
with archery, alchemy, and lockpicking. Morokei gives its wearer a monstrously high rate
of magicka regeneration. Nahkriin boosts the wearer’s magicka pool, while increasing
their skill with destruction and restoration magic. Otar gives a high resistance to all three
destructive elements. Rahgot grants unlimited stamina and removes their need for
sleep. Vokun improves the wearer's skill with alteration, conjuration, and illusion magic.
Finally, Volsung allows the wearer to breathe underwater and improves their charisma."
1880,,400,Treasure Hunter ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"You seem to be a magnet for all kinds of useful and powerful artifacts. A quick jaunt through a bandit camp could reward you with a decently enchanted helmet, while going through a long and arduous tomb filled with all kinds of enemies and traps will hold within a blade worthy of songs and legends."
1881,,400,Alchemist ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Alchemy is the act of mixing, boiling, and distilling various substances to obtain their chemo-magical properties and create potions and poisons. You are a master of this craft, able to make powerful potions and poisons with fewer ingredients than you would normally require, and can discover alchemical properties in ingredients even in worlds without magic."
1882,,400,Aetherium Forge ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"Most forges are only vaguely remembered for the items of legends they helped create, so it is rare that a forge has legends of its own. Stocked with every tool necessary for the creation of powerful artifacts, the geothermal power it utilizes not only contains heat, but the divine essence of Nirn's creator, Lorkhan. Each item created or improved within this forge receives a bit of that essence, greatly enhancing the properties. It also contains a replenishing stock of aetherium, a blue luminescent crystal that possesses immense magical qualities. Even a shoddily built dagger made of aetherium would be a powerful addition to any arsenal."
1883,,400,White Phial ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"A legendary bottle, forged in the days when Skyrim was just starting its turn to ice, it is made of the magically-imbued snow that first fell on the Throat of the World. Each day it will refill itself with one kind of liquid you place within it, be it water, a healing potion, or even human blood. You can change what liquid is inside of it every ten years."
1884,,400,Monster Chef ,Undertale,Making,"Monster food isn't the same thing as Human food. In fact, most monsters have never even tasted human food- And that's because Monster food is so much more efficient! Being made of magic, Monster food digests instantly to energize the consumer, never spoils, and creates no waste (As a result, most monsters don't even know what a bathroom is). Monster food can also be created with just about anything edible, though the better it tastes, the more energy it gives to the consumer. Creating it takes a bit more energy, but it's definitely worth the work!"
1885,,400,Magical Coagulation ,Genshin Impact,Making,"You will find that areas of abundant elemental power will start to spontaneously create elemental lifeforms in this world. Most often this will take the form of some kind of elemental slime, though can take other forms such as small crystal butterflies or the towering Hypostasis cubes. When hunted down and harvested, these creatures will often leave behind crystallised fragments of the very magic that formed them. Hilichurls like to use the slimes for many purposes in their day to day lives, from crafting shields out of Dendro slimes to keeping food cold with Cryo slimes. As you go to other worlds, that little aspect of Teyvat will follow you. In areas of high energy density near you, if you so choose, the magic in the air may start to coalesce into magical lifeforms."
1886,,400,Divine Artifact ,Genshin Impact,Making,"The gods of this world might not have relied on artifacts but that does not mean they did not have them. Whether it be from your own godly making or from finding it in one of the hidden resting places for a fallen god, you have acquired your own artifact. The Goddess of Salt had a chalice of never ending salt and a ruler that could summon forth a tide of salt from the ground. The God of Anemo had a lyre filled with great amounts of Anemo power. You have something of this ilk. By itself it wouldn’t change the world, yet it is still the artifact of a god and as such has power beyond most mortal ken."
1887,,400,Ley Line Sapling ,Genshin Impact,Making,"The Irminsul is a rare species of special silver-white tree. The roots of these trees form the very leylines that encompass the world. It is said that the truly ancient specimens of this species can grow miles high. Through the roots of these trees flows elemental power and the memories of the past. These roots can then form Ley Line Blossoms on the surface in response to a person’s powerful desires. If the roots are revitalised, the blossoms can then produce items from the solidified memories within themselves that in some way fulfil the want of the one who restored them. You have received one such tree, to place in the world, and future worlds, where you see fit. While small for now, it may grow to great heights in the future."
1888,,400,Great Garden​ ,Persona 4,Making,"It's your own garden, and things that grow in it have quite the unusual effects. Daikon that can teleport you home, Tomatoes that can restore your magical energy, Lettuce that can cure all ailments, Wheat that can be used to open any physical lock, Paprika that can resist your resistance to an Element for a period of time, Corn that can repel a single physical or magical attack, an Eggplant that can take an instant death attack for you, and a Melon that can completely restore a person’s Health and Magical Energy. These examples are all valid, but who knows what else you can come up with. This is a part of your warehouse, but you can expand it and place it anywhere you want at any time."
1889,,400,Enchanting ,World Seed,Making,"Enchanting is a skill probably best described as the enhancement of an object’s Aura. At first, one would need to find out which enhancement fits an object best, though skilled enchanters obviously do not need to care about that, and then lay down a basic enchantment that increases a stat, like wisdom and strength, or attack and defence. Like normal magic, there are two forms of enchanting, arcane and runic, though enchanting is by no means a magic, but rather a skill like sewing or tailoring. The former requires you to know the right school of magic related to your enchantments, like magic that increases toughness for a durability enchantment, but is more powerful because of that, while the latter simply requires you to know the right runes and how to use them.

Although normally people would specialize in one of these forms of enchanting, you’re skilled in both of them, enough that you’ll soon be able to easily start using more advanced form of enchanting, such as giving objects elemental enchantments or even very specific abilities, though for the latter you need to be at least somewhat familiar with them yourself. With some experimentation, you’ll also be able to learn techniques that will increase the power of your enchantments by dozens of times, like material enchanting, where you enchant an object at every stage of its creation, such as enchanting the steel a sword will be forged from, the fire that will be used to melt it, and the water used to cool it, and finally the finished sword one last time after its completion.

Another trick to enchanting is that natural objects like wood or animal parts can fit up to two or three times more enchantments than man-made ones. After a creature dies, and its soul dissipates, the aura is left withered, a shadow of its former self. But because of that hollowness, that emptiness, those items have far more room for improvement in their aura, allowing for the creation of staffs that can match up to any plasma weapons, or bows that will never miss their mark.

You excel at finding similar loopholes and techniques to advance your skills, whether they are enchanting or not, and even if you were ever stuck, with seemingly no way to advance your skills to the next level, as long as you continued to research and experiment, you’d be able to either innovate or learn something that will allow them to continue on growing. This works even when it absolutely shouldn’t. Rest assured, there will be no barriers to bar you from growing ever more competent. Work at it for a few years, and even enchantments on the level of the Seeds would not be beyond you.

Considering your skill at enchanting, that will become useful far sooner than you might’ve thought, as you’re starting off at a level others would need years to reach. You can probe the Aura of anything with a mere glance, knowing at a moment’s notice what enchantments would fit best, and the speed at which you work your magic might make other people think you’re doing it with just a wave of your hand. And you’ll continue to be able to work at that speed no matter how complex the work you’re attempting to do is. Who knows, you might even become the first combat enchanter with that kind of skill."
1890,,500,Elven Enchantment,The Lord of the Rings,Making,"You can enchant objects, if you pour energy into them as they are created. Some of your enchantments are useful in battle, such as swords that never dull and bows that always strike true, but most are simply to ease the life of the wearer, such as cloaks that weigh nothing and aid in hiding and water-flasks that never leak. You may also perform great workings, such as the creation of hidden doorways, given time."
1891,,500,The Mirror,Slay the Princess,Making,"There is no mirror, and if there were a mirror, it probably wouldn't be very useful for anything at all. But seeing as how you have a tendency towards making a nuisance of yourself otherwise, let us assume for but a moment that there is a mirror - if this mirror has anything worth offering then we can suppose - purely hypothetically speaking of course - that it acts as a point of reference between you and the inexhaustible and eternal force of stasis and ordered stability that suffuses existence as we know it. Imagine if you could look into that void and mold yourself based on the visage presented to you, the vision of perfection that would encompass and shape you in its glory. Again, all purely hypothetical of course. But we are playing a game of imagination here, and that mirror shall be our canvas. It is a means of bearing witness to a quiet divinity and recognizing within it yourself, a means of casting aside lies and falsehood and understanding truth in its purest state."
1892,,500,A Flask of Primeval Brew ,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"A curious drink, brewed of primeval herbs by ancient gods long forgotten. It is said that one who imbibes it will converge with the primordial forces of nature. Drinking the potion within this flask will allow you to reach heights high enough to challenge even the greatest threats to this world all alone with naught but your weapons and the power within you, able to part seas and crush mountains, for all of about ten minutes. After this time the power will leave you as you were before you drank of the brew, though maybe ten minutes is enough for your purposes... You will receive one flask per jump."
1893,,500,Key of Magog,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making ,"This is a small rod, about long enough to wrap both hands around it one above the other. Each end is capped by a small, crystal sphere, held in place by some ornamentation. This magical rod is a powerful weapon, able to shoot destructive  bolts of green energy strong enough to penetrate straight through two people, killing both by blows to their stomach - seemingly allowing some of the energy to discharge through their body causing internal damage and/or deadly levels of shock. This is the least of its powers, though, as it is also able to create telekinetic force, strong enough to roll rounded boulders larger than men, or able to create powerful winds strong enough to send people tumbling and fill an entire clothing store before shattering its windows outwards while leaving you yourself untouched and you capable of directing the energies somewhat intensifying the effect in one direction or reducing it in another, which while less lethal than the energy rays provides it with uses against large groups of enemies even if they happen to surround you. It gets its name, however, from the fact that its magical energies can be used to power other magical devices that lack their own power source, able to channel its energies into other devices; potentially a sorcerer could learn to tap its energies directly to fuel their magic without need for an external device to channel them into.

The key can run out of power, especially if you make heavy use of its more large scale powers or powering things like dimensional portals, but yours will recharge over the course of each month."
1894,,500,Excessively Shiny Shield ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making ,"Well maybe it’s not truly excessive given it does seem to serve a purpose. This round shield is made of some metal golden in color, but extremely reflective, enough that it can take even relatively dim light like the flickering of torches scattered in a large cave and focus it - or really amplify it - into a spotlight like beam that shines and illuminates brighter than a high powered flashlight, and if focused on a face is bright enough to blind the target momentarily; the intensity of this light reflection and amplification seems to ebb and flow with your desires, growing brighter when you need it to illuminate something and dimming to merely shiny metal when you don’t. This reflective nature even allows it to reflect back lasers, beams of energy, magical bolts, and such things as a gorgon’s gaze turning such powers back on the one who would launch them at you; though you do need to block them with the shield for that.

But this is not just a mirror shield. Like the Shield of Mordor, it is able to be used to destroy as well. By focusing your will on the task while someone - or something - looks into their reflection in the shield you can produce a powerful force that can destroy a normal human utterly leaving no trace. This blast will take time and exposure to intense and direct light to charge up again, so use it with care.

Finally as a shield it is highly resilient and sturdy, resisting damage. The strange golden metal it is made from is strong enough to stop even high powered bullets or small explosives without being scratched, and can even block Significant Swords without a single mark of harm; it may in fact be indestructible to direct physical harm. It is also highly resistant to magical effects upon it, enough to withstand the will of a god, at least such that you might meet in these worlds."
1895,,500,Goat(Ziggy),Miraculous Ladybug,Making ,"Concept: Passion

Form: Hair Clips

Tool: (Large) Paint Brush

Power: “Genesis” - Creates any object/collection of objects that the user wants by painting the general shape of them in the air (usually only requiring a couple strokes). The user can make multiple objects with one use of the Power by making them in a group, such as creating a box full of certain items. These objects can be produced farther away to make them bigger due to perspective. The technology in these items cannot exceed normal Earth (ie not Miraculous Ladybug’s Earth) standards unless the user personally knows how the technology would work. Created objects are technically made of magic and so magic disrupting/absorbing/detecting effects will work on the constructs. For this reason I wouldn’t suggest only eating food created by Genesis for too long, or a lot of the cells in your body could be erased by antimagic. The only other limit on these objects is that they cannot be magical/supernatural in nature (so no creating chaos emeralds or infinity stones) outside of the fact that they are technically made of magic."
1896,,500,Monkey(Xuppu),Miraculous Ladybug,Making ,"Concept: Derision

Form: Head Circlet

Tool: Ruyi Jingu Bang (a staff)

Power: “Uproar” - Summons a toy-like object of some form which when thrown at someone using superhuman/supernatural abilities, will disrupt their powers. It won’t make their powers stop working necessarily, just become so wacky and unpredictable as to be useless, as if turned into a gag power (for example, littering predictions with hallucinations, turning destructive beams into party-hat summoning beams, etc)."
1897,,500,Custom Sacred Gear(Tier 2),HighSchool DxD,Making ,"Time to bring out the big guns. Sacred Gears are also known as ‘God’s Artifacts’ and are part of the Judeo-Christian God’s system to enact miracles on Earth. It’s known that only humans (and rarely human-hybrids) are born with them. Powered by the desires of the user, adapting, and evolving based on their wielder's thoughts, needs, and feelings, gaining abilities or qualities as time passes. This is also how they can enter Balance Breaker, a state also known as the Forbidden Move, which is the strongest manifestation of the SG, and a form that goes beyond the initial plan of its creator.

The effects, abilities and powers they have are incredibly varied. From the relatively common Twice Critical, to the unique ones like Twilight Healing, to the Longinus – a group of powerful Sacred Gears said to be capable of killing a god.

Does the sparse list of options I present to you seem disappointing? Do you want something a little more...unique for a Sacred Gear? Look no further. You may design and create a single Sacred Gear of your choosing with this option. The price will depend on its effects, based on the options below...a simple but useful utility effect or single combat ability will have a base price of 200, a Sacred Gear capable of manipulating others or natural forces or creating permanent items from thin air would be around 400. Add 100 to that base price (base price is the one discounted if applied) and that will be your price for your personal Sacred Gear."
1898,,500,Arondight,HighSchool DxD,Making ,"One of the thirteen swords of the Knights of the Round Table, a band of knights led by the Legendary Arthur. It was wielded by the strongest knight of the Round Table, Sir Lancelot du Lac. Considered to be the sister sword to both Excalibur and Galatine, Arondight possesses similar characteristics to the two as a holy sword as well as their overwhelming power. However, Lancelot's madness later on in his life, due to his failure to prevent Camelot's downfall, cursed the sword and caused it to become a Demon Sword in the process. Now is one of the few legendary swords with a dual Holy-Demonic nature, mirroring its original wielder's descent to madness."
1899,,500,Trident,Disney Princess,Making ,"King Triton's magical golden trident, it lets you control the seas and cause storms or sunny weather within 3 kilometers. With this, you are officially Atlantica royalty. Good luck explaining that without being a mermaid."
1900,,500,Worthier Sliver        ,Pet Avengers,Making ,"This is a small piece of uru metal broken off of a worthy weapon. When struck against the ground it becomes a hammer sized for you to wield, and you find your form shifted into something somewhat humanoid, able to stand on its hind legs, and with prehensile hands as well as possessing a throat capable of human speech. This weapon also is an excellent channel of your other powers, able to withstand the full force of your blows - unless you use it to channel them above their normal limits - and even amplifying your powers slightly. Also, much like Mjolnir, you can call this weapon back to your hand with your will, leading it to smash through impediments in its path. It does not have Mjolnir’s other powers.

Err... so it’s not a small fraction after all. Those who wield your worthy get your powers at something over 50% their full capabilities.

Requires Worthy Sliver to Purchase"
1901,,500,Eye of Agamotto,Marvel 2099,Making,"Vox had one, as Sorcerer Supreme Jeannie Strange should have another, and this would account for the 3rd, or maybe a 4th? Of course each eye is supposed to have different powers, but we don’t know which Dr. Strange has (probably Truth) or what the specific powers of the others are.

It possesses many powers and abilities: it is able to release light which can weaken evil mystic creatures such as demons and dark extra dimensional beings; can project an ‘all-revealing’ light which reveals all illusions and disguises (this has been blocked before); can reveal past events; can facilitate mental scanning or communication; follows you in astral form; and acts as a very powerful external source of magical energy to empower your magic and facilitate certain greater spells and rituals. It is one of the most powerful magical tools in this world, and it now belongs to you. Normally the eye might object to working for evil beings - though this has been overcome on several occasions - but yours will always recognize you as a rightful user."
1902,,500,Philosopher's Stone,Generic Alchemist ,Making,"The magnum opus, the final pursuit of alchemy, the dream of alchemists everywhere is now in your hands. The philosopher’s stone is a red, gem-like substance that has a single, incredibly potent ability; it is able to manipulate any and all alchemical processes to the will of its holder for a considerable distance around the user. This can be used to cause changes in material, shaping the environment, healing the holder or others, elevating the minds of animals, or purifying materials in the same way as Material Refinement.

It is also a perfect receptacle for any and all forms of supernatural power, can process one power to another at will, is able to generate its own power with a fairly quick rate of generation and can spend any form of energy stored within it to generate a wide array of materials that can then be put through various transmutation processes to simply conjure substances or objects seemingly out of nothing. The rarer and more powerful the substances produced, the more energy is necessary to create it."
1903,,500,Crown of Nobility,League of Legends,Making,"This gleaming, golden crown is a symbol of your nobility and leadership. This crown imparts its wearer with incredible charisma. The wearer will find incredible ease in assembling like-minded followers from all walks of life, to the point where if you really wanted to, you could become the monarch of a whole new nation with the people's support behind you."
1904,,500,Shuriman Talisman,League of Legends,Making,"An ancient amulet from the Shuriman desert, this talisman is a powerful magical artifact intended for Ascended - But somehow, you can use it just as well. With this, you can shoot blasts of energy, teleport short distances, or manifest a magical bow to shoot a magical shockwave that will travel over incredible distances. Fits neatly around your arm as a bracer."
1905,,500,Fountain,League of Legends,Making,"A large, round stone dais surrounded by running fresh water, the Fountain initially looks to be a normal, albeit well-crafted, piece of architecture, but the Fountain is a powerful magical item that is of great importance in League of Legends matches. Carved into the fountain's stone surface is five tombstones, and when a tombstone is engraved with the name of an individual, that individual enjoys a number of benefits when standing upon the Fountain. Their wounds are rapidly healed, magic flows into their body and replenishes any magical energy reserves, and they are relaxed and rested as if they had a good night's sleep. In addition, when paired with a Turret, the Turret gains immense power, incinerating anyone who dares step into the fountain without their name first being carved upon the dais. This fantastic piece of architecture is truly unique, in that you may only construct one at a time- Building another will cause the previous Fountain to dry up and become useless. Like turrets, you must supply the resources to create a Fountain yourself (A large, solid slab of stone at least 7.5 meters square and 1 meter thick to enchant, as well as two dozen liters of purified water)."
1906,,500,“Small Doll” ,Dark Souls 3,Making,"""In the legendary old city of Irithyll situated in the Boreal Valley, Pontiff Sulyvahn gave this doll to valued subjects, so that they might use it to cross the barrier when they return home. Listen carefully, and you can hear it say, ‘Wherever you go, the moon still sets in Irithyll. Wherever you may be, Irithyll is your home.’” This is a small silverwork doll depicting a young squire, and it’s also a powerful key while on your person that bestows special privileges. As long as you have it on you, you may pass through fortification type barriers unimpeded. Walls, gates, prisons, forcefields, any other large scale barriers meant to halt progress can’t stop yours. Magical shields, wards and other personal barriers cannot be bypassed using this “Gate Key” effect of the Small Doll. Does not disrupt barriers, allowing you to avoid triggering security, traps or alerts set to go off in such a case."
1907,,500,"""Treasure Mimic""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"A large wooden “chest” divided into three compartments. The left compartment contains twenty pieces of Twinkling Titanite, the right compartment contains twenty Titanite Scales and the middle compartment contains an assorted shards and chunks of normal Titanite. Titanite is a good, strong metal good for weapons and armor among other things, as well as reinforcing equipment. Twinkling Titanite is handy for the reinforcement of equipment steeped in strength, baring unique abilities, without diminishing those properties, though it's somewhat poor for crafting. Titanite Scales are left behind by Crystal Lizards that grow to immense sizes after devouring souls, and are the ideal material for reinforcing equipment made through Soul Transposition. All three being handy materials for a blacksmith though. Titanite originating from the chest will slowly replenish over time once used for something. The assorted normal Titanite will replenish one piece every hour or so, while the special varieties usually take a couple days per piece. In reality, the chest is a loyal mimic that guards these resources and whatever else you put inside. If need be, it can even reveal itself to fight a would-be thief or carry out simple instructions. When walking about, two long arms and a huge tongue protrude from the inside, teeth grow along the edges of the lid and a long, lanky, deceptively powerful body stretches out of the bottom."
1908,,500,Time Turner,Harry Potter,Making,A device that allows the user to go back in time by up to five hours. Must not let your past-self see you.
1909,,500,Wand Of Elder,Harry Potter,Making,A wand made of Elder with a Thestral hair core. It is simply more powerful than most wands and all your magic will work better with it. While you can still be outclassed it will give you a significant edge in a duel. Unusually loyal.
1910,,500,Philosopher’s Stone,Harry Potter,Making,A stone that allows you to turn any metal into pure gold and produce the Elixir of Life which grants indefinite lifespan to those who drink it regularly.
1911,,550,Saber’s Sabre,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"The weapons wielded by Sabers become, or already were, the stuff of legends. Unique to each Saber, these mighty tools represent their power and stories. You couldn’t be a Saber without a Sabre of your own, a weapon to wield in your battles. The below section will act as a customisation table to help you design one such Sabre. 

Access to the Saber Shop grants one free Sabre. This Sabre only has the free options and traits below, it does not gain any points. Instead, you may convert CP into SSP at a rate of 1:2. 100,000CP

1912,,600,Noblestalk,Baldur's Gate 3,Making,"Noblestalk mushrooms are one of a kind medicinal fungus that can cure all ailments
know to mortalkind. Usually, they are quite a bother to harvest, but you seem to have some in
your possession already. Nature of the ailment it cures doesn’t matter. Disease, poison,
infections, amnesia, confusion, depression or even things like spiritual corruption will be
purged upon consuming this mushroom. To summarize, it can cure all things that are classified
as a status condition and then some. It’s not able to cure your tadpole infection within this jump
though, until the netherese magic modifying it is undone at least.
Also, consuming even a single stalk gives you a permanent resistance to normal diseases
and poisons. Consuming more stalks over time could make you immune to all poisons and
diseases (magical or common) eventually (usually takes three to five per person).

If you are a skilled enough alchemist, you can distill potions of status effect immunity
that its effects could last for days from a single stalk of this mushroom.
You get ten stalks initially and get ten more each time you go to a new jump. They are
placed in a perfect magical stasis that only breaks just before consumption or usage. They are
magically sterile and cannot be reproduced."
1913,,600,Zaith'isk,Baldur's Gate 3,Making,"This is an incredibly alien machinery that does look too strange even compared to usual
githyanki inventions. It has a seat and multiple claw and pincer like appendages that can be
used to restrain whoever sits on it. Most githyanki know this device’s purpose as cleansing the
infections caused by the filthy ghaik. The truth couldn’t be more hideous. This device does kill
the placed tadpole, but it also kills its host and extracts their memories and knowledge to get
more insight for combating illithids. Luckily for you, this device seems heavily modified.
You can use this device the cleanse any kind of diseases and parasitic infections that are
biological in nature, while not being harmed during the process. It can even cleanse any psychic
influences from the body. It doesn’t do anything against magically modified tadpoles though.
If you want to, original purpose of this device can be used by you too. You can peruse
and extract knowledge and memories from any being you strap on to this machine. Whether
they are harmed during the process or not is up to your choice. Githyanki slates inserted into
this device (which it comes with) can act as storage devices for those data.
Finally, the original device had some unintended but nonetheless positive side effects
on psychic powers. Any mental or psychic abilities and powers you have at your disposal will
be magnified, if you expose yourself to this device. They require half the effort to use, drain
half the resources they normally consume, and you can activate them twice as faster. Just make
sure this doesn’t get into ghaik hands.
This device either follows you magically throughout this jump or is placed in your
warehouse."
1914,,600,Astral Prism,Baldur's Gate 3,Making,"What you have in your hands is a strange looking spiked, black iron icosahedron
inscribed with glyphs of the gith language. This is a githyanki weapon that is capable of
imprisoning any being within it. Usually the original one holds Orpheus, the Prince of Comet
within itself but this one is empty.
By invoking the powers of this device, you can imprison any being who is unable to
resist the pull of this device’s arcane enchantment. Imprisonment chances increases, when its
target is weakened (essentially working like a glorified pokéball). Inside of the prism is a pocket
plane that is inaccessible save for the holder of this object. Imprisoned beings are chained with
specially crafted infernal iron chains and all of their powers will be suppressed as they are
totally incapacitated. Only known way to break these bindings is by the use of Orphic Hammer
or by your own personal command.
You can go in and out of this prism’s pocket plane anytime you want by opening a portal
to inside of it. You can also communicate telepathically with all beings that are inside the pocket
plane. This pocket plane can act as a resting point or a refuge for you too.
Finally, this device has one more purpose. It is capable of navigating the Astral Plane.
While you are holding this object, you can innately navigate the endless void and automatically
know which direction to follow or avoid, never becoming lost in the starry landscape ever again.
Post-jump these navigation capabilities extends to all space-like expanses of void too."
1915,,600,Crystal Crafter,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Making,"The
world is not one made for your kind.
Artifacts are forged for wizards and
warriors, and few for you. That will
not stop you, however. By taking a
gemstone, you can imbue it with
potential, cutting and polishing and
changing it until it amplifies the
psychic abilities of the one who
bears it, making the powers of the
mind easier to call upon and
stronger when used."
1916,,600,Legendary Material Supply,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"A millennia ago, to create the Teigu, the First
Emperor ordained his forces to gather legendary materials, mainly the body parts of
the most dangerous Special and Super Class Danger Beasts. However, currently, if
someone wanted to create their own Teigu-like weapons or for some other similar
purpose, it’ll be considerably harder for them to gather materials of the same quality,
as most Super Class beasts already went extinct with a few rare creatures still free in
the wild. However, this isn’t a problem for you, as, by taking this item, you’ll acquire a
stable source of materials taken from dangerous beasts and other several different
species with useful traits from all over the world as well as from any other future
world you visit. Such materials include, but aren’t limited to, their fur, leather, special
organs, bones or even their entire preserved corpses in the case of weaker beasts,
as rarer and more powerful beasts will have fewer and smaller materials taken from
them.
In the Lobotomy Corporation world, expect to see a lot of materials taken from lower
classes Abnormalities and Distortions while just a few organs and limbs taken from
the Aleph Class Abnormalities and potentially even less from the higher ranked ones
like Apocalypse Bird and WhiteNight. In the SCP world, you can still receive several
materials from anomalies like the SCP-682 but don’t expect to receive more than a
small piece of flesh taken from Yaldabaoth. There are just some examples of the
materials you’ll receive in future worlds.
Of course, the materials are limited, but they’re replenished at the beginning of every
jump or after a decade, whichever comes sooner. Lastly, by the default, these
materials will be preserved and contained inside a special room that will become an
attachment to your Warehouse."
1917,,600,Philosopher's Stone,Akame ga Kill!,Making,"The Philosopher’s Stone can be described to lay
people as an ultimate, super item of sorts, capable of manipulating all sorts of
unprotected physical materials including the Teigu themselves, being incredibly
valuable as there are only two in existence, yours and Dorothea’s. By Implanting the
Philosopher’s Stone into a person, it would also make them immune or near immune
to the active effects of a Teigu and other harmful substances, as it’ll passively
sacrifice something in order to recover the host’s body, so you may have to have
something else implanted in them to serve as sacrifice to save them from otherwise
lethal strikes, such as sacrificing excess biomass in order to survive Murasame’s
curse for example. Alternatively, by implanting the stone into a tool or weapon, you
can more precisely and directly wield its material manipulation, allowing you to alter
the shape of the terrain, objects or even the bodies of your enemies if you directly
touch them, making it also useful as a weapon in battle. Additionally, due to the
artifact’s property, it’s extremely useful when it comes to modifying living beings due
to its capacity to alter biological material manipulation and also to enhance your own
abilities related to alchemy, including those from other worlds. If lost or destroyed,
you’ll receive a new Philosopher’s Stone after a year."
1918,,600,The Map,A Mage of Sorothustra,Making,"This is a special, particularly clever item that is an animated map. Every few
days, at least a few times a month, the contents of the map will change and whenever they do
and you follow them you will arrive at a place where you can choose to embark on an
adventure. This item will never stop providing you with the opportunity to embark on assorted
adventures that will always culminate with you growing stronger in some respect and one way
or another you will be properly compensated for your troubles. You can also embark on
concurrent adventures, if you have some way to be in multiple places at once."
1919,,600,Sa'angreal,The Wheel of Time Jump,Making,"What you have here is a sa'angreal equal to the Sakarnen, that works for
Saidar and Saidin. It can take any shape you want it to take, chosen on purchase or
you can import any item you own. It has a buffer that prevents the user
from burning out, and won’t be destroyed from too much use. Not only
that, but you have bonded this Sa’angreal to yourself, making it so that
channeling the One Power through it against you in a harmful way will
cause it to burn the channeler from the Pattern."
1920,,600,Style Book,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"Now this is something unique. Styles are a power used through language but so far, it has only been
through spoken words or, rarely, non-verbal but still bodily communication. The book you hold in
your hands can change all of that. This Style Book allows the use of Styles and other powers or
actions through the written word. By focusing on a Style that you know and writing out what you
would normally say, you are now able to use it on any who read those words. You can even do this
with other powers you have or other actions. By writing in the single power you would use or short
action you would take, and expending any energy or other costs you’d need to normally expend, you
can seal in that particular power use or action for later activation. Then so long as you can see the
page, you’re able to activate it at will with a word and unleash what was stored. A spell to create
several flying blades could unleash that metal torrent from its pages from a distance or a sealed in
punch could send a phantom fist flying into the face of the one holding the page. You can remove
pages from the book and it will never run out of pages either nor weigh more because of it."
1921,,600,Flask Plan Data,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"The jewel of Hakoniwa Academy or at least what they hope will one day be that jewel. This USB
contains all the data so far accumulated by the Flask Plan and a fair bit more on top. A project
created in order to one day turn Normals into Abnormals, these are the starting steps towards
successfully completing that plan. Given the creators of the plan’s true origins, there’d be no hope of
succeeding at all without having this in hand and yet even with it, you’re still in for an arduous road
of study, experimentation and a lot of expended resources. But when you’ve managed to bottle the
essence of Gods, it’ll all be worth it."
1922,,600,A God's Corpse,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"After cheating death by resurrecting repeated times
through the Kāma and devouring countless Chakra Fruits in the course of thousands
of cycles, eventually, all the cumulative evolutions, lead an Ōtsutsuki to evolve into
an actual godlike existence, led them to become a higher existence and achieve
some degree of godhood. Once this stage is reached, they reach the conclusion that
having a physical body limits them and thus willingly decide to discard it to fully
ascend to a higher plane of existence. The only example of this case we’re currently
aware of is the legendary Shibai Ōtsutsuki. Somehow, you managed to locate and
acquire the corpse of one of these ascended Ōtsutsuki. With this corpse, you’ll be
able to harvest its DNA that contains the information of every evolution and ability
they developed before their ascension. Merely splicing its genes into someone can
be enough to result in them awakening one or more of its abilities if the subject is
compatible. You can also absorb its remains to get its abilities if you have the means
to do it, but fully incorporating all the genetic information and power in it probably will
take a long time (like a few years at best). Unfortunately, its cells aren’t in a good
condition like the ones granted by the Alien Cells item, making them unable to be
reproduced many times and way less malleable leading to a considerably higher risk
of rejection, and the corpse contains just a small portion of the Ōtsutsuki’s power, but
still enough to match the power of a pretty low quality Chakra Fruit, like one born in
an already dead world. You’ll receive a new corpse at the start of each future jump.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."
1923,,600,Life Log,Greek Mythology,Making,"Like the hero Meleager, you can tie someone to this log (yes, even
yourself). As long as the log remains safe, the one bound to it will live indefinitely. However, the opposite is
also true, should the log be destroyed, the bound person will perish."
1924,,600,Óðrœrir,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Making,"The mead of poetry. Raw divine inspiration in liquid form. It tastes of perfection, the ideal beer or mead to fill those who partake of its splendor. The pinnacle of drink and drug, it can be better than alcohol, pcp, heroine, nzt, molly, acid, felix felicis, super soldier serum, Kick, and pure happiness, creativity, and luck rolled into one and tripled in strength without any of the drawbacks if you like. Anyone who is under its effects is a hamrammr. You may determine what benefits within this context it provides as you pour it. You will receive one well made and to your tastes jar every 27 days, enough for 9 people to drink to their heart's content for 9 hours. As this is equally a metaphor you could receive the benefits from just a sip, or poured over someone, if you're a god of weather or simply tall enough, just add it to the rain. It may not even be a liquid or could just be water with a few drops of...."
1925,,600,Alchemy ,With This Ring,Making,"Alchemy, strictly speaking, is the art of using knowledge and
preparation to shape the arcane without using your own magic. This is useful for several
reasons. Firstly, effects achieved by alchemy are replicable by others: any potion or formula you
make can be replicated by anyone else. Secondly, any price for magic is either extracted from
the ingredients directly or paid for by the recipient of your work. Thirdly, as it is not limited by a
mortal caster’s power: the effects of alchemy can potentially reach godly levels of power. The
Garrick Superspeed Formula and its derivatives, the Danner Super-Strength Formula (which has
been confirmed to work on all terrestrial mammals and can grant a human strength comparable
to the Superman), Lazarus Pits, and more would eventually be within your grasp with this perk.
If taken with the perk “Bandwidth and Wavelength” this would allow you to combine
aspects of different magical traditions or sources of power to create more powerful effects,
such as combining biomancy, chaos magic, and flesh taken from Starro the Conqueror to create
an incredibly powerful mind control system. As an aside, creating a replicable, universally
effective alchemical formula without side effects that grants powers on the level of the Garrick
Formula would take a B-list DC genius 10 years of research, while finding a way for multiple
alchemical formulas to work together simultaneously would take 10(n)^2 years of research by the
same, where n is the number of formulas you wish to make work together."
1926,,600,Biomatrix,DC Comics,Making,"This complex piece of technology duplicates a lifeform after a few minutes of scanning,
producing a perfect cellular replica with all their abilities and memories but with their mind
altered to your own desires. At first, the tube and motherboard making up this piece of
technology creates flawed copies of unknown lifeforms and needs to have their bio-data first to
take them into account-but with further research and improvement, it’s possible to make better
clones or even ones with additional superpowers added in. The degradation process varies as
much as alien biology, and can include creating a mutated berserker, the clone melting into a
pile of goo, and the flesh crystalizing into a Bizarro clone. Nonetheless, considering how difficult
cloning a Kryptonian is in the first place this is a significant advantage to be had-and it comes
with a stack of notes from many of Earth’s supervillains that could potentially let you vastly
improve the process."
1927,,600,The God Killer,DC Comics,Making,"Well, that’s...interesting. Until recently this blade was presumed one of Diana’s many falsified
memories-that is, until it was found gathering dust in the room the Ares of the Rebirth era was
imprisoned in. Either way, it’s elaborate golden sheen and jagged edge belie a potent but simple
power: The strength to kill a god. It’s edge alone saps the vitality and cuts deeper than it should
into the flesh of the divine-able to kill their physical emanations to the point of slaying the
concept throughout the world until another deity takes up their role. But to accommodate it’s
wielder’s fighting style, the weapon can shapeshift-becoming twin blades, a staff or even a cat o’
nine tails among other shapes. An eldritch energy crackles along it’s length, strengthening the
user in battle and guiding their blows as well as battering foes with powerful shockwaves. The
blade can absorb and redirect any mundane force unleashed upon it-even that which is
delivered by a Kryptonian of the New 52 era, magically return to it’s owner’s outstretched hand,
repair itself when broken and reveal the memories of the deities it cuts. Whether or not it really
was created by Hephaestus to fulfil a certain promise, it could give even a mortal a way to stand
against the Titans themselves."
1928,,600,The (Artifact) of (Concept),DC Comics,Making,"Interesting. It seems someone’s at least as favoured as the Amazons were by their gods at one
point, because you own an enchanted artifact with the unmistakeable touch of the divine. Not
only forged of 8th Metal, but touched with unique blessings aligning it to a certain concept rather
like the Lasso of Truth. Physically almost unbreakable, the lasso could alter it’s length to suit the
user’s needs-and could restore lost memories, dispel illusions, ward off magical attacks and
even reset metaphysical alterations in the hands of a skilled user. More powers from such an
artifact were discovered over the years, from creating a telepathic rapport and
language/memory/empathy-sharing bond between those encircled by it, as well as breaking
even gods and heroes by viciously exposing the truth of who they were at their core. So fierce
was the truth worked into Wonder Woman’s signature weapon that certain demons burst on
contact with it, and even the true form of a god could be restrained from attempting to possess a
planetary populace.
Of course, nothing prevents you from say-owning a Lasso of Submission instead, which can
compel love and obedience just as well."
1929,,600,Promethium,DC Comics,Making,"Not every superpower-worthy invention’s the product of some mad scientist or hyperadvance
alien out there. You’ve got a few crates of one such example, as well as the recipe to make
more: Promethium, an artificial alloy created by Steve Dayton with extremely powerful
properties. Nearly indestructible, it was once built with the noble goal of creating indestructible
road vehicles to mitigate traffic accidents-and has the odd effect of regenerating damaged or
depleted biological tissue. But by rendering it volatile, promethium has the potential for
channeling, amplifying, perpetuating and containing near-limitless amounts of energy-as well as
mutating living beings or triggering any latent mutations they have. It’s no exaggeration to say
this substance could build an arsenal powerful enough to demolish planets and potentially spell
disaster for the universe. On the other hand, using depleted promethium alloyed with titanium
can create components similar to those used in the Post-Crisis iteration of Cyborg as well as
Arsenal of the Justice League’s body suit."
1930,,600,Cosmic Staff,DC Comics,Making,"You’d be surprised how well some branches of science can compete with the mystic arts and
divine powers. Take this golden rod of metal, and it’s arsenal of powers. It can absorb and
modify most mundane energies, and release blasts hot enough to melt steel and modular
enough to target a Kryptonian’s weakness while dazzling most foes. It lets the user fly fast
enough to keep track with many of the metahumans of Earth, attract or repel living things as
well as inanimate objects with magnetic fields and creates defensive forcefields to prevent
atmospheric damage. Finally it lets the user create rifts between dimensions at will, and by
attuning to you it becomes very hard for others to use and can receive mental commands from
far away. It’s no wonder that with this device alone, Stargirl’s gone on to make quite a
successful career as a superhero like her predecessors Jack and Ted Knight.

Optionally, with this item you may choose to be well acquinted with the Knights to explain how
you got this gadget."
1931,,600,Ancient Prison,Bleach,Making,"Ikomikidomoe, an ancient hollow of the Adjuchas class, yet with power transcending even Arrancar
born from Vasto Lords. This was a monster that was able to defeat old Yamamoto and nearly devour
the Soul King some millennia ago, until it was stopped. By Ichibe Hyosube’s power, its name was
erased, and it was sealed within a sword to contain his power. The wielder of this sword would be
able to use it like a Zanpaktou, calling Ikomikidomoe’s power in various forms, but risked the sealed
Hollow’s ire, and hunger. If a moment of vulnerability were to appear, the wielder could be
devoured in an instant. You now find yourself in the possession of a similar weapon, one of your own
design, that contains an immensely powerful Hollow whose powers can be borrowed through the
calling of its name. It shall possess some unique ability like all Hollows, and its final release may be
used to temporarily join its power with your own. Beware abuse of the weapon however, as its host
can be irritable."
1932,,600,Still Silver,Bleach,Making,"Auswahlen, a ghastly power of Yhwach allowing to steal and redistribute the power of Quincy he
deems unnecessary to those he deems necessary. This is ultimately lethal to those he steals from, not that he really cares. However, while the source of much of his power, this technique is also the
source of his greatest weakness. Formed in the hearts of Auswahlen’s victims is a form of silver
called “Still Silver.” If Yhwach’s blood comes into contact with this silver, he will temporarily lose all
his powers, from Auswahlen to The Almighty. You receive an arrowhead made entirely of Still Silver, though yours has a much wider use case. It will work on anyone it manages to pierce, shattering in
the process and depriving that individual of all supernatural powers or special abilities for a short
time. Due to its immense power, it is replaced only once each year after use."
1933,,600,Charged Blade,Bleach,Making,"An immensely powerful construct resembling a sword. Developed by Urahara in a year’s time under
normal circumstances, this sword houses an immense amount of spiritual energy contributed by the
captains of the Gotei 13, among other Shinigami. However, despite the form it takes, and the
incredible power it houses, this is not a weapon. This is tool used to bestow the power of a Shinigami
to a human, originally used to completely restore a once crippled Ichigo’s powers. A human who was
never a Shinigami would not obtain Shikai or Bankai, but would have immense power as a Shinigami
bestowed upon them. Someone who was once a Shinigami, but lost their powers, would instantly be
returned to their full power and then some. Simply stab the sword in your target of choice, and the
sword will break apart and bestow its power unto them. You will obtain a new “Charged Blade” each
Jump, and in future worlds it will obtain the additional functionality of being able to restore any kind
of lost power that the stabbed individual once had."
1934,,600,The​ ​Test​ ​Of​ ​Time​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Making,"Whether it was your job to place a single type of gem within the soil, to create a certain mineral, or to carve mountains that reach the sky, your works were never meant to deplete. Change form, perhaps, but never lessen from what they were. You remember the secrets of creation you once wielded long ago. When you create something from raw materials with your own hands and infuse it with your Faith, it becomes something far more than what it is. Though a sword will bend, it will never shatter. Though it may burn white with heat, it will never melt. What is that sword-shaped thing in that black hole? Your work of art, of course! As long as there is no automation or outside assembly, anything you create becomes infused with divine might and will never wear or break. A leather jacket you made an animal’s hide might be able to catch a sabot round, but that does not mean it won’t splatter the person wearing it."
1935,,600,A Sage’s Weapon,Cradle V1,Making,"You have gained an item once used by a sage. It will always be usable at your level of cultivation, and will always be one level higher than you, no matter what height you reach. It will be compatible with any path you fallow, and you can learn any path that sage practiced by studying it."
1936,,600,A Silver Earring,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Making,"An old, silver earring is now in your possession. If you wear it, you will ironically find that it significantly boosts your luck in most things in life, except in battle where it acts as a very minor unlucky charm. With that said, so long as you’re wearing it, you can’t be killed by some mysterious OP power either. It might harm you, but it will fail to kill you. In order to qualify for this protection, it has to be a power you are unaware of and must also be among the top tier of powers that the world you’re in can offer."
1937,,600,Ma’at’s Feather ,Egyptian Mythology,Making,"A symbol of the perfection of balance and order, and the right way of life and living. This feather can be spent to create a balancing force to an inequality or injustice. Ma’at’s Feather may neutralize an act of evil with and act of good, lawbreaking with punishment, injustice with justice, but does not counter an abundance of goodness with evil or an abundance of law with lawlessness.

It can be spent to reveal the perpetrator of a crime or ensure that a wicked person gains ‘their just deserts’ through the actions of fate or random chance, creating a karmic reaction to their acts. It does not hold to the letter of law, but rather enforces a more ‘natural’ justice. It cannot be used to pervert what is true or moral.

In this way, it can be spent to guide a judgement made against anyone toward ‘natural’ justice, rather than towards a judgement that upholds the letter of the law but not its spirit.

The feather may also be used by a wronged party to forgive or pardon a being other than the holder and spare them of retribution, vengeance, or punishment handed out by a judge or any third party; when used in this way, the judge or jury will recognize the inherent justice in the mercy being shown, regardless of what the letter of the law demands.

The feather itself may be more literally consumed in order to bring balance to one’s spiritual parts, or their soul, or heart and mind. This action provides a balance to the personality of the one who consumes it, and an overwhelming desire to put right any wrongs, and live, in the Egyptian sense, more ‘rightly’.

Ma’at’s Feather appears in the possession of its owner at the start of each jump and does not reappear until the next."
1938,,600,The Double Crown,Egyptian Mythology,Making,"Representing the unification of the Two Kingdoms beneath the rule of one King, the Double Crown is unsurprisingly a combination of the crowns of the Upper and Lower Kingdoms. In its quest for unification, it absorbs and incorporates into itself any other crowns which you might have, accumulating their grandeur and adornments as well as any unique powers they possess.

Likewise, the Double Crown also permits the accumulation of any nations or kingdoms under your rule, making them provinces to one contiguous empire where possible.

If such kingdoms do not accompany you through your chain (for example, acquiring a kingdom strictly through in-jump methods), then instead those realms become vassal states, and the taxes and tributes of wealth and goods from that kingdom will simply “arrive” in your present capitol (Jump- chan taking care of the logical inconsistencies of time-stopped nations making deliveries to the other dimensions you find yourself in)."
1939,,600,Scarab of Godly Meket ,Egyptian Mythology,Making,"A gold and lapis lazuli scarab of extraordinary beauty, like all scarab amulets it bears a space on the back for the name of a god – which is blank.

By carving the name of a god into the back, you request their divine protection. In matters related to the god’s sphere of influence, you appear to have quite extraordinary luck in any aspect that carries chance and risk: an engraving to the goddess Neith would see almost every hunt plentiful with game, and almost every arrow strike home, except the most foolish or lazy of attempts. An engraving to Tefnut would see your wells always brimming with sweet, clean water, and plentiful rains fall on your crops, but never unexpectedly from the heavens above your head. 

If you are in mortal peril, the amulet calls up the deity to intercede directly to defend you, by any means up to and including appearing incarnate, towering above your foes and smiting them with rays of fiery sunlight, mountainous floods and waves, earthquakes, sandstorms, living tides of scorpions or whatever methods their nature prefers.

In the face of such naked power, however, the amulet cracks, useless, and will only be restored at the start of the next jump, and you may carve a new god’s name into the back."
1940,,600,The Funeral Texts,Egyptian Mythology,Making,"A collection of lengthy papyrus scrolls which include passages from the major funerary works: The Chapters of Coming Forth By Day (“The Book of The Dead”), the Book of The Two Ways, and the so-called Coffin Texts.

Carrying these scrolls allows one to journey into the afterlife of whatever world they find themselves in without fear of their soul being molested or interfered with by spirits, demons and other native entities – provided their wrath is not provoked – and allows passage through any of the closed gates one may find there.

The powerful spells inscribed within provide the foundation for learning the secret words and the ways in which the gods are addressed and the doors of Duat opened, and so this text may be used to teach the beings of other worlds the means through which heka is worked, at a basic level.

If you have the Egyptian Soul perk, you may also use this text to grant or divide another’s spiritual nature into the various parts described in the Egyptian Soul perk, granting them a ba, ka, ib and shut."
1941,,600,Jumper’s Godly Attributes,Egyptian Mythology,Making,"Praise be to Jumper, for your many godly attributes are plain and visible to see. You may choose to manifest your powers as physical objects: a single set of regalia composed of symbolic equipment and adornments which house your might and emphasise all the things which come under your rule. This regalia contains up to one of each of any type of clothing, jewellery or accessory; but no more than a single person could reasonably wear or hold at once.

Each item represents a single power with its own link to your might: Your control over the wind might manifest as a palm-leaf fan with your ability to create mighty storms with a wave; your power to summon a mighty and terrifying beast might be a helmet with its face, through which its strength or shape can be borrowed; your ability to fly might be shown in a feathered, wing-like cloak fixed on your back.

By focusing the matching power through one of these attributes at a time, the item lends extra might and finesse, and prevents others from exerting their own magical control over that power while you are currently channelling through it – the wind made by the fan would not obey the magic of another sorcerer, but it would not stop the sorcerer from raising a wall to block it, or your hypnotic power might be resisted by will but not dispelled by magic.

As items created by your majesty, they may be loaned or gifted to others for them to use as you do; though you still keep your original power for yourself. Your Godly Attributes may be summoned or banished at will, and recalled to your hand with but a thought."
1942,,600,Mjölnir,Marvel Zombies,Making,"“Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.” Thor himself won’t be needing it anymore. He’s not worthy anymore. And as such, the Hammer of the Gods has passed from his hands to yours. And Thor’s powers are mighty indeed. The Hammer is forged from Uru, the strongest metal in the Nine Realms, and is almost indestructible. It was forged in the heart of a star, and it can be thrown straight through black holes and the cores of planets without a scratch. The hammer itself, as stated, gives you the power of Thor. In effect, it makes you the Asgardian god of Thunder, for that’s who it belonged to. Thor is not just the god of Thunder - he is also the god of strength, and the power gives you the same might - enough to level mountains and cities, the toughness to match, and can be used to fly at incredible speeds by holding onto the strap. Let’s say it caps at Mach 32. Moreover, the Hammer gives its wielder the same great control over the skies themselves that Thor would wield, empowering you to call forth thunderstorms, bolts of lighting, gale-force winds, blizzards, and more, or gentler, more benign versions of those. In accepting you as its new wielder, the Hammer has bonded to you on some level. After it leaves your hand, it may be summoned back. All in all, this is a mighty weapon. What better way is there to cave undead skulls in? You would do well to remember, though, that the wielder’s strength of character must be as mighty as the Hammer itself if they wish to be worthy."
1943,,600,The Quantum Bands,Marvel Zombies,Making,"These are the vestments of those appointed to be the Protector of the Universe. They’d ordinarily fuse to the wrists, but you can take them off whenever you want. The bands draw energy from the Quantum Zone, a dimension where all the universe’s potential energy is housed, and grant the wielder great powers over energy. First and foremost, you control existing energy, so long as it’s linked to the electromagnetic spectrum in some way. You could cause a solar flare, create illusions, and more. If you don’t have energy to work with, you can draw out nigh-unlimited amounts of energy from the Quantum Zone, enabling feats such as firing blasts well over the greatest nuclear weapons, and making energy constructs powerful enough to withstand these blasts. These constructs are able to affect that which would be normally intangible. However, the connection can be cut off, though the bands have a “battery” of sorts you can work with. Even if you’re almost out, you can drain energy better than Captain Marvel could (unlike her, you don’t have to come into contact with the energy). You could siphon away all the energy in one of those energy-based superhumans, weaken the infinity gems to an extent, and energy blasts are laughable to you. Some sources may resist your attempts to take energy from them, however. Aside from energy, you can also use the bands to fly at relativistic speeds, to create wormholes, and augment your physical attributes."
1944,,600,Cyttorak ,Marvel Zombies,Making,"That’s the name of your new patron. Cyttorak the Destroyer, an immensely powerful entity from a dimension called the Crimson Cosmos. In his infinite magnanimity, he has deigned to grant you a gem... which makes you really strong and tough. You can lift hundreds of thousands of tons, cause earthquakes with your blows, and generally throw down with the likes of Thor, at least in terms of strength. You’re just as tough. On top of that, your body is surrounded by a magically-generated force field, further adding to your formidable defense. When you really get moving, you become nigh-unstoppable. Virtually nothing will halt your course, though you can still be slowed. You are immortal and unaging. Even when injured, you can regenerate almost instantly - and to match this vitality, you have an infinite reservoir of stamina, and no longer require sustenance or air to breathe. However, you do have weaknesses. You have no special protection against psychic or mental attacks, and are just as susceptible to them as a regular person would be."
1945,,600,Glossair Rings,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"You can conjure glossair rings. Holding onto the glossair ring and cycling magick through it allows you to fly, though if you let go, you will immediately start falling. You can also attach these rings to any object and allow it to float in the air. Conjuring a glossair ring requires a substantial amount of magick and resources, but they last until they break."
1946,,600,Mistant’s Sword,Final Fantasy XII,Making,"A blade of the Gods, wrested from the hands of a towering beast. The sword is always four times as you are tall – though it does not seem to hinder your ability to wield it. Cleaves through the air and earth effortlessly, but its massive shape may make it difficult to see. It factors based off of your current height rather than your base height.

Though the sword will disappear once the last enemy has fallen, it does have a quirk in that it remembers any modifications you had made to it while it was materialized."
1947,,600,Divine Implement,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Making,"While every Demigod needs a trusty weapon, this goes beyond such things. Being of the quality that even a God would consider worthy for wielding, it is a completely indestructible weapon of your choice (or armor, if you prefer). In addition, it has an enchantment of your choose that would be appropriate for a weapon of such strength, such as raining down lightning on your foes or summoning storms with a wave. If you choose you may also use this option to instead obtain a copy of a currently existing Divine Implement, although there is sure to be confusion if it is witnessed in use."
1948,,600,Dagda’s Cauldron,Irish Mythology,Making,"One of the Four Treasures the Tuatha de Danann brought over from their four shining cities. The cauldron cooks an endless stew, brews an endless potion, and otherwise makes what you make in it without end. If you need to dump it out, you can, but if you’re ladling out, it will never run dry."
1949,,600,Goibnu ,Irish Mythology,Making,"The greatest of the Tuatha smiths, Goibnu could create a spearhead with three strikes of his hammer, and it would be so sharp the man it cut would surely bleed to death. Like this legendary smith, you can forge or assemble anything you’ve the materials for, no matter how complex or intricate, in moments and whatever you forge shall be of mythic quality, whether armor lighter than cloth and harder than a mountain or plows that can turn over ten acres with one pass. Truly you are worthy to be called the smith of the gods."
1950,,600,Grimoire Creation,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"The source of a scholars power is their grimoire, it contains the secrets of light or dark magic as well as the secrets of military history from ages long past. These books allow a scholar to cast powerful spells from either school of black or white magic by using the book as a conduit to cast spell diagrams within it needing only to supply it with their mana instead of requiring the scholar to devote themselves exclusively to one path. Thanks to your long studies you have learned how to create your own magical tomes, transferring and inscribing your knowledge into them. With this you can do many things firstly you can store accumulated knowledge into the tome, imparting experiences of your past or things you have learned into the pages. Secondly you can engrave any spells you know into the pages allowing whoever owns the book to cast the spells within as if they were a native caster, and finally the tomes you create can have requirements added to them in order to open and use the knowledge stored within, requirements such as ""being a good person"" or even ""being a certain age"" or ""being female"" or any number of other requirements are valid. Tomes created in this way are extremely durable, being able to survive punishment far in excess of what they naturally should be able to survive."
1951,,600,Utsutsemi?,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"Ninjas possess and odd form of magic called ninja magic that allows them to quickly cast premade spells using special tools, among these spells are ones to poison enemies, create shadow doppelgangers, and cast elemental damage at a foe. This skill is expanded in you though, you know the secret of creating entirely new ninja magics allowing you to turn other magic or spell like effects into ninja tools which can then be used by anyone with training. These tools are single use however and though many of them can have multiple effects at one time (such as poisoning your enemy and setting them on fire while also giving them a weakness to fire) the tool will automatically disintegrate after its use."
1952,,600,Rangers Fangs,Final Fantasy XI,Making,"For the hunter, the fangs are not just a tool vital for existence, but also a witness to its death. If the fanged one loses its fangs, it can no longer live. Yet when the fanged one dies, only its fangs remain.To hunt like the fanged one, you must live by the fang and die leaving only the fang behind, and you have the ability to do just that, every arrow, bullet, or projectile you fire will find an identical type of ammunition taking its place within your pouch or quiver, this ability only works on hand held ranged weapons however its power should not be underestimated."
1953,,600,Wewelsburg Longinus        ,Dies Irae,Making,"One of the mightiest artefacts in this world, yet it is still nothing but a pale imitation of the real weapon. The Wewelsburg Longinus is a shape and size changing weapon, built in the image of the Lance of Longinus and yet far from it. It has settled on you as its true master, though Tubal Cain retains the original copy. Wielding this blade will not curse you and you can freely change its size and shape from something that is two or three times your own size to something as small as a single human finger. The blade devours the special powers of those it kills, absorbing them and allowing the wielder of the blade to utilise them. Only one person’s powers may be used at a time, though multiple powers can be gained from a single person to be used at once. The false lance also shares all the basic traits of an Ahnenerbe, such as striking the soul and making regeneration difficult. "
1954,,600,Relic of the Past,Dies Irae,Making,"Spells and enhancement are just the basic steps, you say. They’re impressive enough but unique to each person. To create a relic, the thing that can one day become an Ahnenerbe, that’s the impressive stuff. You’ve gained the ability to craft powerful relics without danger to yourself, even to the level of something like the Fake Longinus blade, though you must acquire the materials for such undertakings. You personally excel at replicating other artefacts, even ones not normally usable to you, in more easily wielded forms. Those of enough power like the Longinus itself might need to be made in a weakened form but even then, it’d still be an incredible artefact."
1955,,600,Sword of Might ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making,"One of the 3 powers of creation, a sword that exists between the worlds of the living and the spirits, guarded over by the spirit of its previous wielder, and destined to be guarded over by the spirit of its current wielder in the future. The sword is a powerful, anti-magic tool as it possesses the ability to prevent magic from entering into an area around it, able to shield at least a force of several dozen mounted warriors, and perhaps an entire army. This barrier does require an act of conscious will to erect, and its size will be somewhat reliant on your own will. Still even the most powerful sorcerer will find that their magic is shattered at the edge of this barrier. It also interferes with magic being cast within this area, it’s less effective than the barrier itself, but it will still make even the greatest sorcerers of these lands struggle to work magic even at a fraction of their normal power. It may be possible to use this anti-magic property on magic already in the area when the barrier is erected, or which the barrier passes over, though it will be less effective for the task. Similarly with time and a strong enough mind you may be able to selectively allow some magic to be cast freely within its barrier.

In addition to this barrier, the sword is able to absorb a portion of the magic that it negates, building up a charge of energy. It cannot hold it for long, eventually the energy will bleed out harmlessly, but it can channel this energy back outwards as a blast of magical force; the more energy it has absorbed the more powerful this blast will become. And of course the sword is a sword, and while it is not as sharp or powerful as a Significant Sword, it is eternally sharp, and will always be strong enough for you to wield it as an effective weapon. Its real power is against supernatural and mystical creatures against which it inflicts disproportionately grievous wounds which prevent supernatural means of healing; even spiritual beings can be laid low by these wounds, and despite not being necessarily good, its nature as a force of creation makes it harm beings that are harmed by holy weapons as if it was one. 

The sword itself is indestructible to the powers of this world."
1956,,600,Potion Brewer,80s Sword and Sorcery,Making,"Yours is not the art of spellcasting directly. Instead you are a brewer of potions. While this is a much more time and resource consuming task, it is not without its rewards. For one these potions can in theory duplicate any of the forms of magic available through Low Magic or High Magic, and possibly even combine fields. These duplications will generally not be quite a match to what a specialist could achieve in the field, and you will generally need to get the target to drink the potion or apply it as a balm, but there is a value to versatility, and while some potions do require a spell cast after they are applied, and it takes more time and (magical) energy to make the potion, they tend to be quicker and less magically draining to use than casting the spell on the spot. If you possess the relevant Low Magic or High Magic you will also find your potions in the related field being substantially stronger, able to surpass what you could do with a simple on the spot casting of a spell. It will also be easier to imbue magic of the related field into non-fluid objects, storing a single use of a spell inside of them so that another could activate it (or you could with less time and effort in the moment) by throwing the object; acorns tend to be pretty good to store spells within."
1957,,600,Pacho Fan,The God of High School Jump,Making,"A large, green Gunbai, a Japanese war fan. This is the famed weapon of King Uma, one of the 9 Kings of the Sage Realm and is a powerful weapon. Your copy can only be utilised by yourself, being nothing more than a tough fan when in the hands of another. It has immense powers of air manipulation and even a half-hearted swing can destroy an entire castle as well as slice through a city, splitting it into two halves. When swung with great force, it creates a tornado large and fast enough to tear whole cities apart, whilst creating a complete vacuum of air within the tornado. You are under no protection from the lack of air so be careful how you use this legendary weapon."
1958,,600,Monkey King’s Blood,The God of High School Jump,Making,"You’ve discovered a small vial of a mysterious red substance. This vial contains the blood of the Monkey King’s clone and can grant the powers, in a limited fashion, to those who drink or are injected with it. This sample has been perfected as compared to the flawed model used by the Americans in the God of High school Tournament’s second last stage. The blood grants greatly increased size and physical abilities, especially strength and speed, such that you could make a small island shake with just the force of your punches. It also grants a limited capacity to clone yourself. These clones possess all your abilities, weapons and armour, but not any items and the further they get from a close area to you, the weaker they become. You are only able to create one clone at first but in time you might slowly extend this to a few handfuls more. You will gain a new vial of Monkey King’s Blood each year, though using it on the same person twice will have no new effects."
1959,,600,Three Imperial Regalia,The God of High School Jump,Making,"A set of three legendary artefacts from Japan. The Kusanagi Sword, Yata’s Mirror and the Yasakani no Magatama. The Kusanagi Sword is a powerful magical blade that is able to summon gigantic snakes from any wound it creates in another being, which will proceed to attack them. Yata’s Mirror summons a gigantic mirror like shield which will provide absolute protection from all but the strongest attacks before breaking and quickly reform in a few minutes whenever it breaks. The Magatama, a necklace of small objects, are able to work as powerful elemental explosives, unleashing a storm of whatever element the colour of the Magatama represents and they slowly replenish over the course of a day."
1960,,600,Holy Grail,The God of High School Jump,Making,"The legendary cup that contained the blood of Christ. This simple purple glass cup is overflowing with red liquid. It is able to heal humans around it of almost any wound, no matter how severe, so long as they still remain alive. Its true purpose however, is the ability to seal the powers of heretical beings and tear them to shreds. While it requires a lengthy incantation, once complete, a golden light will shine from the cup in all directions and any God or Demon that is touched by it will be torn apart. Only the strongest heretical creatures will be able to resist death from this light and even they will find themselves badly harmed. However, this light may only be summoned three times per year."
1961,,600,Let there be Light,The Games We Play,Making,"And so there is. This is a replenishing supply of neutral
Sephirot components of all ten kinds, for all of your soul crafting needs without the
horribly unethical gathering process and terrible guilt.
You get 1000 people’s worth of pure, high quality Sephirot, the stuff souls are made
of. It’s so quality that it’s worth a hundred of your average souls, if not more. Don’t
worry about losing any unused stuff either, because it builds up as time goes on.
Sephirot is some of the most valuable stuff in the world here, and that’s for a reason.
In this world, the ratio of Sephirot within your soul determines its structure, the
power of your Semblance and other such things. In future worlds, it could be entirely
different, luckily enough, you get the local stuff no matter where you go, allowing you
keep up your tinkering. And again, don’t worry about losing access to any of the past
stuff. Each setting’s soul stuff will continue to produce itself separately from a
separate setting.
What use does it have in the future? Depends on where you go and how it all works
there, but you’ll have to figure that yourself for the most part. Maybe you can eat it."
1962,,600,Imagination Forge,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"Active imagination isn’t enough to describe what you are now, you’re just straight out crazy. Your
delusions aren’t things you really need to think on to have them stick around and now, neither are
the things you imagine into existence. Your imagination creations are no longer so dependent on
your constant concentration to exist, though you do still need to think about them every few days to
keep them from disappearing. You’ll also find that what you make is proof against the influence of
any other minds, as your outright madness rebuffs any attempt to change its mind. 

Requires Imagination Creation to purchase."
1963,,600,Imagination Creation,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Making,"Children do indeed have the most active of imaginations. Yours has far surpassed what any child
shrink would think was reasonable though, becoming so superhumanly strong that you can manifest
your imagination into reality. You can imagine a devilish blade to kill monsters into existence in your
hands or think up a gigantic, terrifying beast from hell to attack your enemies. Almost anything can
be done so long as you obey the limits of imagination. The strength, size and quantity of what you
create is limited by your willpower, too much and you’ll strain yourself to unconsciousness. The
second limitation is that your creations remain dependent on your imagination. You must constantly
focus on your creations to maintain them, as a stray thought can alter or outright destroy them. The
last is that your creations will also be influenced by the imaginations of those around you who, while
their wills are reduced in comparison to your own towards affecting your creations, can still
influence it if they have great enough wills or a large enough number of people to counter your own
willpower. "
1964,,600,Fell Masks,The Games We Play,Making,"Huh. O...kay, not sure where you got this, but okay. So this is a collection of masks.
Masks that are, specifically, modeled around certain types of Grimm. That is, these
are designed to be, mind, not just look, but be like what can be called ‘boss’ Grimm.
Created during the War that made this world what it is, these masks were originally
designed to convert normal people into Grimm, and exemplary ones at that. There’s
one of these for each type of Grimm in the world, and each of them have some very
impressive powers.
The Nevermore mask Lenore, for example, makes you much more difficult to
perceive, the next best thing to invisible, being more a shadow than real. And in the
same vein, you can do things like pass through walls, or even hover, if not fly outright.
The only force that would affect a wearer is gravity, though it’s all rather more
complicated than that.
Each mask also makes you capable of seeing in the dark, as well as perceiving Aura
and similar things.

Originally, of course, these masks had a number of negative effects, but thankfully
your versions are updated to provide all the good and none of the bad. You receive
three masks with every purchase. As very few masks are seen in the story, you are free
to design just what the other masks do, so long as they’re somewhere in the same
ballpark, ‘tier’ wise, as Lenore."
1965,,600,Tree Branch,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Making,The Tree is not death... its is mending. It is rebirth. It helps you be what you want to be. Everyone who returns to the Tree takes the form of a Tree Branch in the shape of their body so they may come out when they are ready. You now have one such Branch. Once per Jump in the event of your death you may find yourself being transported into this Branch. While in here you will have a chance to talk with the Blacksmith and eventually you can reemerge. Will it be as yourself?
1966,,600,Forward into the Future,Final Fantasy X,Making,"You’ve had plenty of time to contemplate dress spheres, and you’ve reached a breakthrough. By condensing enough of your spirit, and provided you possess enough souls – be it pyreflies, living souls, dead spirits – you can focus magical abilities into a dress sphere which can be applied to a piece of clothing. Anyone wearing that piece of clothing can use those abilities. 

While the piece of clothing itself doesn’t affect the abilities of the sphere, you’ll note that whatever article of clothing you’ve chosen as the foundation for the dress sphere is oddly indestructible, regardless of how much damage it takes. That’s for as long as you’re actually using the sphere of course."
1967,,600,Dress of Heaven,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"Made from the body of an Einzbern Homunculus, this is a replica of the last remaining artefact of the Third Magic that that family has in their possession. It'd be a good idea to not flaunt that you have this if you're not a part of that family. While it cannot truly replicate the Third Magic, this dress still allows it's wielder to transfer souls between containers. With this one could transfer one person into the body of another or into an artificial body of their own creation, quickly and painlessly. It could even allow one to store a person's soul in an inanimate object for period of time. It also has the effect of turning any human who touches the dress into gold quite quickly. Thankfully, this restriction has been lifted for you alone, if you are human. Perhaps it'll make for a good defence?"
1968,,600,Shard of Evil,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"A single blackened shard of what used to be a golden cup. This shard is just one of the many used in the process to create a Black Grail. In particular, there are two notable uses for this, though other ways to use a shard of a powerful magic artefact imbued with pure evil are certain to exist. It can be used to empower a spell or ritual, unleashing a vast amount of mana to be used for that casting or be used to unleash an immense blast of Black Mud that will disappear after a few minutes but in the meantime can be controlled by you. Either of these uses will restore the shard within a month. But it can also be used to make Lesser Black Grails. By implanting this shard into a person, they can gain weakened versions of the abilities described in the Black Grail perk, though they do not gain any protection against going mad from the power or evil within them. If you also possess the Black Grail perk, you can command these Lesser Grails freely, until they expire. Use of the perk in this way causes the shard to respawn a year after its use."
1969,,600,Severance Package,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"Gathered over a long and illustrious, but unknown to almost all, career. You took what you had gathered with you when you left for the war. This is a particularly vast armoury hidden in a location of your choice, containing thousands of firearms, countless close range weapons, large amounts of explosives, assorted and exotic poisons, dozens of suits of tactical armour and so on. Easily enough to supply an assassin with anything they could need for a few decades of very active work, this can also be used to outfit a military force several hundred men strong in an emergency."
1970,,600,Bonds of Fate,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"Finally revealed, the secrets and knowledge to the Einzbern's Homunculi creation methods. It's all yours. From the way to turn natural children into basic Homunculi to creating flawless versions of the super Homunculi such as Ilyasviel herself, you've gained not only the knowledge but also the expertise in medicine, surgery and Alchemy focusing on life creation to actually carry out the process entirely on your own. Beyond mere skill, your creations, when they be living beings, seem to be better than those of any other peer on a fundamental level. Life you bring into being with your magics and sciences, from this world or any other, is stronger, faster, and smarter and so on then it would normally be. You could possibly focus this into one area or spread it out even more generally with some work. Taking The Family Art in Alchemy on top of this would push your Homunculi beyond even what the Einzbern family achieved. 

Boosted: Bonds of Fate has now given you the ability to create dual natured beings. Specifically, these are living beings that can turn into items and vice versa. By crafting an item at the same time as creating a life form, artificial or not, you may combine them and allow that being to transform into the item at will, as well as to retain their aware minds whilst they are in item form. Unlike the case of Leysritt, there is no need to have the living being be of sufficient power to equal the item but you are limited to one being to one item in these fusions. 

Boost Requires Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant to Activate"
1971,,600,Relic of the Gods,RWBY,Making,"When the God of Light send Ozma on his quest, he left behind 4 Relics of great power. When combined they would call back the Brothers upon which Judgement day would come. To ensure no one would call them here for them to destroy Remnant when they see the state its in they were hidden in Vaults beneath the Huntsman Academies. Alas a copy of one of these Relics can be given to you for the price of CP. The Crown of Choice grants its user visions of the future. These visions are random and cannot be controlled The Lamp of Knowledge houses the being known as Jinn, who can answer any three questions per century except pertaining to the future. For you these three questions will instead refill every Jump. It can change its size for transportation and when used stops time for everyone but the summoner and Jinn. The Staff of Creation houses Ambrosius who is capable of creating anything, but requires details to do so. He can only be used for one task at a time, causing the previous Creation to disappear when a new one is made and he is forbidden to resurrect. Much like with Jinn it can change size and stops time when used. The details regarding the Sword of Destruction are unknown so far."
1972,,600,Silhouette Supplies,Knight’s and Magic,Making,"You have a chest full of Silhouette Knight supplies and materials enough to build a dozen average Silhouette Knight from scratch every week and something that would rival the Ikaruga every three months. It doesn’t prevent you from stockpiling your supplies and materials as you still receive more supplies and materials even if you don’t use it. You also receive materials and supplies from monster corpse from this world Duel-Class every week and Legion-Class every three months. In the future jumps, you also receive materials and supplies from monsters equivalent to the classes in this world."
1973,,600,Fleece of Power ,Cult of the Lamb,Making,"A selection of one of four powerful fleeces that exist in the world, granting terrible power at a cost. Fragile Fortitude, which grants threefold durability and fortitude, making the wearer significantly harder to kill at the cost of nullifying any healing, natural or arcane, while worn. Glass Cannon, which doubles the power and halves the cost of any magic cast while halving the wearer’s physical strength and fortitude. Diseased Heart, which causes any who inflict harm upon the wearer to feel the harm they inflict just as strongly. However, wearing this fleece saps the strength and stamina of the user as long as they wear it at a rate which increases over time. One minute might not show any noticeable difference, where ten may leave the user feeling as though they had done hard physical labor all day. Finally, the Golden Fleece. Those who wear it will feel themselves become stronger for every enemy they slay, compounding until even a normal person could crumble rock or crush steel. Should the user be harmed even a single time while wearing this fleece however, this benefit will be reset back to zero and the wearer will have to build back up again. Additionally, any harm done to the user will be compounded twofold. This item can be purchased up to four times, granting one of each fleece.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1974,,600,Crafter of Relics,Cult of the Lamb,Making,"Perhaps you share some kinship with mad Chemach, visitor. You now hold the ability to create relics, items of power containing the faded essence of powerful beings. A relic can be crafted from anything, so long as it holds some link to a being of great power. A favored weapon, a well-loved keepsake, or a piece of flesh, all can be made into relics, usable by anyone to channel the dregs of power held within. Be wary, though a being need not still live for a relic to be crafted of them, those who do still live may be unenthused at the idea of their powers being used by another."
1975,,600,Magician's Rod,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Making,"It’s said to have been made from the wood of the Ancient Tree of Enlightenment, in the same style as the infamous rod that the Dark Magician uses. This magician’s rod amplifies LIGHT and DARK magic by a great degree, turning a basic attack into one capable of taking out a worthy foe. It does the same benefit for all non- elementally attuned magic, as well."
1976,,600,Creepy Bird Dick,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Making,"Really? You fucked your way to the top? Not an uncommon strategy, just not one people usually go for first, and especially not ones with as much potential as you. Anyways, you did that. Instead of being chased by an angry super-powerful Demon Bird, he seems to have grown some creepy ass obsession over you. You get one powerful artifact that has to do with demons, hell, or things that have been called the work of the devil to do with as you wish. You can pull this artifact out of your ass [not literally jackass, unless it is] anytime you want. I guess that time humiliating his wife clicked some sort of crazy button in that guy's head, cause you have to deal with some creepy-ass sexts and phone calls, along with helping with whatever that creepy fuck wants from time to time. But hey, it's a nice tradeoff for such a powerful item, right?"
1977,,600,Cup of Reincarnation,Solo Leveling,Making,"The Absolute was responsible for the creation of everything in the universe, and while he made mighty beings that could even challenge him, he did not grant them every one of his powers. Contained in this artifact that you have now gained is a replica of his mightiest item. The Cup of Reincarnation allows its user to rewind time in their current universe. Additionally, it can carry with its user anything that did not exist in the chosen time. The user and those who travel with him will retain their memories from the future they leave.

When it was first stolen by the seven angels who would then be known as the Rulers, the cup of reincarnation would allow them to reset the timeline many times, but now after being used many times in order to try to prevent the destruction that is their war with the Monarchs in Earth will inevitably bring, only a single use remains in it. Luckily for you, the current power of your version of the Cup of Reincarnation will regenerate so it can be used again once per jump, or once per ten years and a day, whichever comes sooner.

Keep in mind that the Cup of Reincarnation cannot affect the memories of higher beings like the Rulers and Monarchs, but it can undo their deaths."
1978,,600,“I Am The Architect”,Solo Leveling,Making,"It would be an understatement to call you a genius, Jumper. Your mind is one that only has a single peer in the universe when it comes to your technological and magical knowledge.

You have mastered the magics of the Monarchs and Rulers, allowing you to create pocket worlds of your own, opening portals to them, existing into another dimensional space and puppeteering powerful avatars, replicating abilities such as the Ruler’s Authority with your own magic, as well as the creation of such powerful puppets, capable of dealing evenly with S-Ranked dungeon bosses.

Finally, your ability would allow you to replicate the feats of The Architect, creating a System for any ability of yours or others, either obtained willingly or forcibly, to train others into. As the Administrator of this System, however, you could also, at any point, seal or take the powers that you have granted access to at any point. You can combine your previous talents to create ‘Quests’ and ‘items’ that would help those ‘Players’ to level up and get better at using their abilities. You can only have a maximum of eight active ‘Players’ of this system, but you can permanently separate them from The System once they have matured enough with their powers without them losing their powers."
1979,,600,Overtechnology: Cosmic Workshop,Avesta of Black and White,Making,"Like the Workshop of Annihilation, you have a particular talent when it comes to creation of extraordinary tools. Unlike him, you are not limited to just producing tools that will be used as weapons or to bring forth destruction, but you also don’t have his entire galaxies worth of resources, at least not just with this.

Still, the wonders that you create are nothing to scoff at. These tools are capable of violating the very laws of reality, bringing forth effects that even Commandments and the Power of Ego struggle to replicate. A small coffin where time doesn’t move on, an armor that feeds on emotions to regenerate the user and itself from any kind of wound, or even more sinister and stranger creations are in your reach. The only things needed to bring them forth are your dedication and the precise resources for such wonder.

Finally, the technology that you create always works based on the principles that you use to make it, regardless of what the local laws of reality are, and it works flawlessly to fulfill its mission."
1980,,600,Eleventh Ring,Fate/Grand Order,Making,"In the legend of King Solomon, the King of Magic was granted ten rings by God Himself. These magical rings gave guidance and power to the good king and upon his deathbed, he was instructed to send one of those rings away. This task would have far reaching consequences but now, with you here, an eleventh ring has been manufactured and placed in your hand. Not connected to the original set, and thus unable to perform certain functions, it still shares some of their powers, the ring allows you to exert a large amount of influence on the magic of any other being. Whilst wearing the ring, you are able to weaken the magic of any enemy, the greater the difference between you and them the larger the debuff you are able to apply to them. Whilst noticeable even against an equal or greater opponent, if you are strong enough in comparison to your enemies you may even be able to control or outright destroy their magic. As long as you wear the ring."
1981,,600,Crown of the Planet,Fate/Grand Order,Making,"A magnificent crown fit for a king. More true a statement than one may realise, as those who wear the crown lead lives fit for the legendary kings of the past. By wearing this crown regularly, never losing it for more than once a day, the wearer will become a vital figure in the stories of the world that they are in. They become a focal point for events that will change the world and be given the chance to have a great deal of influence over that story and those around them. The wearer must be ready for the challenges they’ll face as the crown makes no judgements on whether you are going to be ready for the story you thrust yourself into but it is likely that, as the hero of the story, you’ll find allies and other forms of help along the way if you can survive. The crown will resize to fit your head and can be in a style of your choosing, though it must be at least a little fancy."
1982,,600,Magnum Opus,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"Most Workshops find a level of quality and quantity they’re comfortable with or that is in demand then stick to it for optimal profits, though an occasionally forgotten tradition among Meisters is to put all their skill and effort into a single work. This piece serves as both a demonstration of what they are truly capable of and more importantly where your skills are best focused. You’ve gone through this test, and now have an item of your creation, all crafting perks, skill, and effects are applied either twice or with doubled power, with the same capabilities as any other item bought with CP, and if you have Refine then it can be used on this item at full power. The Magnum Opus is also perfectly designed for your use, so regardless of its form and your skill, you will use it as if you’ve practiced with it every day. The item is unable to be absorbed or consumed by anything while you are alive, though it can be imported as other items, and has the same properties as something that was bought with CP directly."
1983,,600,Colorful Arsenal,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"The weapon(s) of a Color is usually one of the most distinctive things about them to the average City dweller. All of them are extremely powerful and deadly in their own right, from a giant burning cross, a scythe that vibrates at resonant frequencies, or even a prototype EGO weapon, considering what Colors are sent to do it only makes sense that they have the best of the best for their equipment. Regardless of if you aim to become a Color or not, your gear suits it or maybe you got a copy of what a specific Color has. Either get an existing Color’s weapon Import or gain a new weapon and give it the power suiting the pinnacle of Fixers by making it 50% stronger at slashing, blunt strikes, or piercing, as well as making it either a prototype EGO weapon/armor or a massively amplified version of a Workshop’s effects(check Notes, Color’s weapons are also there).

Alternatively, import something that’s not normally a weapon and give it the ability to directly access your warehouse like a portal or instead carry nine other sets of weapons that can be pulled out of them at any time."
1984,,600,Beaten into a Biography,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"When the few people manage to escape from the Library, they come back with stories of their comrades being killed but unlike the rest of the City, the Library has them turned into books, which are then used by the Librarians to attract and kill stronger guests in a cycle of death in service to their director’s goals. So now you can take the abilities and equipment of those you kill, regardless of if they are in the Library or not, via turning them into books which can be equipped if you have Book Smarts. If you don’t have that perk, don’t worry, since you can still just read the book normally which contains all the information that person knows as well their autobiography. And if you want to, it's possible to revert them from being a book or burn it to forcefully extract usable fragments of their memories and abilities at the cost of permanently destroying the book, these fragments can be used on anyone regardless of if they have Book Smarts or not."
1985,,600,Field Mods,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Making,"Having all your equipment, manpower, and supplies when working on a project is one thing, but sometimes you need to fix problems in more dire situations, like being in a Library where your life's on the line. Don’t worry though, making tune-ups, alterations, or even fully breaking down and reconstructing your equipment on the fly isn’t that hard with your capabilities. Even when directly under attack you can reconfigure your gear to better counter the exact opponent you are facing, individual pieces of equipment can be set to be altered with specific conditions so they automatically adapt to situations you encounter often. And every time you update your equipment you may activate a lesser version of Refine if you have the perk, though anything made by you is affected even less than normal."
1986,,600,Mindless Book of 666 Souls,Bibliomania,Making,"This is a book similar to Serpent only it’s brain dead and effectively just a prison for souls already full to capacity. It contains 666 blank souls which can be used however you desire, whether you use them for magic, for forging or even just food if you have the means. All these souls are slightly above average but have no mind or independence and due to the properties of the book are perfectly receptive for any form of use being twice as effective than a normal soul for any situation a soul might be used for. Once empty it's just a plain silver and copper colored book but once a year it seemingly refills itself instantly with more blank souls even if you only used 1 soul in the year. It will only refill to 666 souls though and when it's full the book becomes a more radiant silver with gold and turquoise colorations and will steadily fade to the silver and copper color with less souls retained."
1987,,600,Materia Collection,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Making,"Though many use the crystalline magic known as materia, SOLDIERS are best known for augmenting their arsenal with the stuff. You receive a sturdy briefcase containing a wide array of these small spheres of mako. You can use blue materia to imbue your attacks with elemental effects and increase the range of your magic. Or perhaps you’d prefer to use purple and green materia to enhance your attributes or grant you new spells to use in combat? Yellow Materia can be used to augment your own powers and grant new combat abilities. Most powerful of all, you could use rare red materia to summon powerful creatures to fight at your side. Your equipment can only hold a few materia at a time, and not every materia is suited to every situation, but you have a wide enough assortment that you could equip an entire fighting party and still have versatility to spare.

Boosted: Rare Stock

With this upgrade comes both power and variety. Not only do you have triple the materia at your disposal, but the individual quality of each crystal has increased dramatically. Purple materia that once doubled your health will now triple it. Red materia that once called on Ifrit and Shiva for help now summon the mighty Leviathan and Bahamut. Alone, this effect would be impressive. However, you also receive a second benefit.

Now included in your carrying case is a device SOLDIERs used to fuse materia together. By melding two kinds of materia together, you can create synergistic combos, power boosts, and even brand new effects. Combine two Cure materia to double the healing effect. Fuse a Poison and Power Attack materia to create a unique Poison Slice ability. Post-jump, you may use this device to fuse other kinds of magical artifacts together. So long as a magical effect is contained in a physical vessel, such as a scroll or potion, you can mix it with other magics to create complementary combinations.

1988,,600,Yamato Dragon Blade ,Kurohime,Making,"Forged in the heart of the sun by Princess Yamato, a.k.a. Suzaku, the Spirit Queen of Fire, this is a blade designed to absorb the essences of the Spirit Kings to create the Ultimate Sword. That said, this is a manga about guns, so you can also attach the blade to any sort of gun you possess to create a gunblade, or even absorb the blade into the gun to hide its presence, or remove the blade to attach it to a different gun. On its own, it is merely an extremely hard and sharp blade. 

However, if you pay another -100 BP each, you can add the powers of the Spirit Kings to it to provide additional effects.

If you add in the power of Genbu, the Spirit King of Water, then you can summon armor made of ice to protect your body, and you can temporarily upgrade your gun into a cannon-like appearance to drastically increase its firepower. If you have Mists of Genbu, then you become capable of freezing the mist in parts to create “ice illusions”, which appear to be you but are actually constructs made of ice— flimsy, but sharp enough to hurt and with their details obscured enough by fog that a person could be deceived into thinking they were you.

If you add in the power of Byakko, the Spirit King of Earth, then you can transform your gun into the form of a gatling gun, and can rapidly replicate the effects of magical bullets you fire to create a storm of spells from only a single bullet. If you possess the perk Byakko’s Earth Purification, you can project that perk’s aura against corruption from wherever your bullets land, regardless of if they have been enchanted or not.

If you add in the power of Seiryuu, the Spirit King of Air, then your gun can take the appearance of a bazooka-sized sniper rifle, allowing you to cast spells at long range (which would normally be very hard to do). If you possess Like Seiryuu’s Gullet, you can imbue this power into the gun to allow you to send people back in time by shooting them—or even allow other people to shoot themselves or other people back in time, simply by whoever uses the gun willing it to happen.

If you add in the power of Suzaku, the Spirit Queen of Fire, then the Yamato Dragon Blade’s edge can be made to burn white-hot, allowing it to cut through almost any substance short of God Metal, including cutting through spells. If you have Suzaku’s Resurrection, then so long as you wield this gun, you can benefit from the effects of that perk yourself, but can still only resurrect yourself once per jump or once every 10 years."
1989,,600,Kokushinbaku/Black Divine Tree,Kurohime,Making,"An accursed form of the Hakushinbaku used by the God Clan, this artificial divine wood merges into your body, and cannot be noticed until you call it forth. When you do, you can feed it your magical energy to make the wood grow and reshape itself. You could form branches to grab things, reshape the wood into a perfect facsimile of yourself (complete with normal color and texture), or mold it into the shape of a sword.

And don’t think that it’s as frail as regular wood; the Black Divine Tree is not only harder than steel, but it completely absorbs all magic it touches when you let it out of your body, taking in the magic to make you more powerful; this can even absorb the divine power of gods.

But if that isn’t power enough for you, the Black Divine Tree can also absorb the souls of the dead. By killing people, or just being close enough to their deaths with the tree extruded, it will absorb the nearby souls of the dead—but not only their souls, but their hatred and grudges too, and will turn all of this into more power for you. But be wary... in the process of absorbing them into the Kokushinbaku, the spirits of the dead are able to lash out, and will attack and ravage your body. But with the power you can get, surely pain and the possibility of death is worth the risk...?

Should you ever come across resurrection magic, it would be possible to use it on the absorbed souls, weakening you but returning those whose souls you captured to life.

If you so desire, you can instead have the Hakushinbaku, the White Divine Tree, which is functionally identical except it cannot draw upon the power of the dead. Instead, you can absorb the life force of the planet, which is a much slower process, but also much safer. To you, at least."
1990,,600,Damate Hako,Kurohime,Making,"The great treasure of the undersea Dragon Palace, this looks like a box. But whenever you open it, it will give you the greatest treasure you desire—be it a person, a treasure, or anything else you desire. That said... it’s only an illusion. Its actual power is to shape and form coral into what the user wants, then layer an image of falsity over it.

That said... do you really want your heart’s desire? If you pay an additional undiscounted 500 BP, then you can instead have a box that will, once per decade (or once per jump, whichever comes first), grant a single person whatever their heart desires. “Whatever”, in this case, meaning something that could be obtainable within the jump setting and that doesn’t cost BP to purchase. But a person, someone’s love, youth, more power, more money... all sorts of things are possible with this box."
1991,,600,Ancient Arts,Miraculous Ladybug,Making,"You have all the training of an initiate member of the Order of the Guardians. This training comes with a variety of skills relating to the Miraculous and their Kwami. You know how to heal Kwami when they fall ill, how to repair damaged Miraculous, how to perform anti-akuma meditations, and are well-versed in the lore pertaining to their creation. Within a few years of study, you could even make your own types of Special Kwami Food if you have the ingredients. Given time and practice, you may even be able to create Miraculous of your own, though such feats will remain out of reach until this Jump is complete. These Miraculous can be used to entrap (willingly or otherwise) spirits in future Jumps, though they must be in a weakened state if you wanted to link them forcibly. Alternatively, you can link them to a concept to create a Kwami of that concept native to the Jump you are in. These Kwami will be confused and young so you may want to talk to them a bit so they don’t start blowing shit up by accident."
1992,,600,Dante Lament,High School DxD,Making,"Many years ago, during the Great War, one idea of Sacred Gears that was experimented with was sealing entities into items of power. One Fallen Angel had the neat idea of sealing two sworn enemies, an Angel and a Devil, into a Sacred Gear for both science and amusement. The result? This suit of armor. Colored a dark gray, the wearer of this armor enjoys both considerable durability and has access to a multitude of magical weapons - spears, swords, and so forth...any weapon made in the medieval era or sooner is valid. All of these weapons can take the form of Holy or Demonic weapons respectively, making them effective against both Angels and Demons. The Angel and the Devil are both still active and sentient, and while they argue and bicker like an old married couple (which you may suspect they are, after a while) and deny ever wanting to work together, they’ll cooperate for your sake, and can also give you pointers on both Demonic and Angelic magic and how to fight in conflicts like the Great War if you ask them."
1993,,600,Down Fall Dragon Spear,High School DxD,Making,"How did you get your hands on this? You’re most certainly going to confuse a certain Fallen Angel. This is a unique artificial Sacred Gear made through a pact with the dragon Fafnir, an incredibly powerful spear whose full powers have yet to be revealed. It does come with a pre-awakened Balance Breaker form, however, forming a draconic armor around the user that greatly protects them from both physical attacks and magical attacks. This duplicate of the spear also doesn’t need said pact to keep its powers, and Fafnir and Azazel are both unaware of you even having it...for now."
1994,,600,Night Reflection,High School DxD,Making,"Manifesting as shadows that dance and move to the user’s will, this Sacred Gear can form bladed weapons and spears from said shadows to use as weapons against the enemy, as well as shaping them to entangle and bind foes. In addition, this darkness can ‘consume’ attacks and redirect them anywhere within the user’s field of influence. The Balance Breaker allows the user of this Sacred Gear to become like the shadows they control, becoming intangible and completely unharmed by physical attacks, though energy-based attacks can still harm them."
1995,,600,Special Grade Cursed Tool(600),Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"By purchasing this option, you receive a cursed tool imbued with one of the abilities from the cursed technique section, allowing you to wield it through this item. The exact form of your cursed tool, as well as how it specifically interacts with the cursed technique it carries, is up to you. Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

The price for such an object is equal to the original cost of the cursed technique.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1996,,600,Finger of Jumper,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"In the coming months, many ancient sorcerers have used cursed objects to incarnate into the modern day. Now, it seems, you’re following their trend. You have a cursed object made of your own flesh and cursed energy, taking the form of a mummified finger of yours. Rest assured though, unlike other sorcerers you didn’t actually have to give anything up to gain it. Conveniently, this object of yours is completely indestructible to even the greatest of this world’s techniques.

What the finger does, though, is give you another chance at life. Should you happen to die, your cursed energy and mind will leave your body to inhabit the finger. Then, if someone happens to swallow it for any reason, you’ll be able to take over their body, overwriting their mind and soul with your own. In this new body, you’ll not only have all of the abilities you had in life, but you’ll also gain some things from your ‘vessel’ too – specifically, any memories they had as well as any special abilities innate to their person, such as their cursed technique. It’s possible for some individuals to resist this takeover, such as if their will vastly overpowers yours, though by and large this will be an incredibly rare occurrence even if your own willpower is rather average.

Of course, if you’re not happy with your new body you can always force it to transform, changing back to the form you had in your previous life over the course of a few seconds. Though this transformation is irreversible and as such can only be used once, it’s actually a rather potent tactic in combat, for in the process your body will also be fully healed of any injuries it might have sustained.

If you wish, you may opt to have not just one finger from this item, but many – up to the number of digits your original form possesses. Though you’ll still only be able to return from death once this way, having multiple fingers out there could be a valuable insurance policy. That said, your total power will be evenly divided between them, so to return to full strength you’ll need to track down and consume them all.

If your finger is used, it’ll return to you at the beginning of your next Jump. If you choose to have multiple fingers, you’ll also regain your full strength, even if you didn’t manage to recover all of them."
1997,,600,Playful Cloud,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"As a rule, all special grade cursed tools are imbued with a cursed technique. Playful Cloud is the exception that proves it. A three-section staff consisting of red staves connected by short metal chains, it’s a weapon that forgoes any special ability for something simple: acting as a force multiplier for the user, allowing them to hit with far more force than they could usually exert. A sorcerer with slightly superhuman strength, for instance, would be able to hit a special grade cursed spirit and send them flying through the air despite their attempts to resist. 

Given this effect, the naturally stronger the user is, the better this weapon will be in their hands, potentially making it effective no matter how powerful one gets."
1998,,600,Construction,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"You’re able to create objects out of nothing. Unlike with some other techniques, though, whatever you make using this is not just a manifestation of your cursed energy that’ll disappear once you release the technique, but truly real. So long as you understand its properties, you can construct almost anything, from bullets to liquid metal you can control using your cursed energy and shape into armour based on the abilities of various insects, such as flight and extraordinary strength. With the right knowledge almost anything is possible, though something like a powerful cursed tool might need a rather costly binding vow to achieve.

There is one major limitation to Construction: it eats up a huge amount of cursed energy, with larger and more complex objects using up more. A weak sorcerer might only be able to make a single bullet per day, but even those with a lot of cursed energy could run out of cursed energy if they use their technique too freely. With a focus on making more efficient constructs, however, it’s more than possible to offset this."
1999,,600,Curse Forge,Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"The creation method of cursed tools is well-known and simple – by frequently imbuing one’s cursed energy into a mundane object for a long enough period of time, it will eventually become one by itself. Yet, these are only the weakest form of cursed tools, possessing little more than the ability to injure curses and slightly enhanced properties. The method of making higher quality cursed tools, ones that could make even a weak sorcerer a notable threat, is much more obscure.

Fortunately, you are one of the very few privy to the methods of forging more powerful cursed tools. You’re capable of making far stronger ‘basic’ cursed tools than normal. Where a weapon created using the constant imbuement method described above might create a katana that could cut a bit better, you’d be able to create a weapon that vastly increases the power of blows made using it, enough that an average sorcerer might be able to wound a special grade curse.

This is a minor benefit, though, compared to the true draw: the ability to create cursed tools with a cursed technique of their own, that any wielder can make use of. Weapons that gather kinetic energy before propelling it out of the back to greatly increase the speed of its swings, grow or shrink at a moment’s notice, ignore physical durability to cut the soul directly, and more are all possible creations. It’s not just weapons you could make either: anything from glasses that let normal people see cursed spirits to cubes that are capable of sealing even the most powerful of beings in this world, given the right conditions are met first, are also possible.

It's not exactly clear how such items are made, but it will certainly take a lot of time and effort, with stronger tools taking much more investment to create. Likewise, making weapons imbued with cursed techniques you don’t possess yourself will be a lot more difficult. It’ll take a lot of analysis to figure out the technique’s exact details and the minutiae or its functions before you can make tools with it. Or, like a certain fleshsmith, perhaps you could take a shortcut by using the corpse of someone who possessed that technique, or maybe an imprisoned cursed spirit, instead."
2000,,600,Sterile Sample        ,Final Fantasy VII,Making,"I'm sure you've noticed by now, but an awful lot of problems and benefits have come from the corpse of the monster known as Jenova, principle of which is Shinra's SOLDIER program and those created from it. Those injected with Jenova cells are given greatly enhanced abilities, ones that could go well beyond the simple version of Passed Basic into making things like Sephiroth or mutate into strange and fantastical forms. The problem is that the 'will' of Jenova is alive and well even if the creature isn't, often making these creations insane or in some way single-minded.

By some cosmic miracle, you've acquired about twelve vials of Jenova cells that have been completely sterilized of the creature's influence, not only making them safe to use as physical enhancements but ensuring experiments are only at the mercy of your own expertise instead of her will. You can make a quick injection of these to give someone the benefits of Passed Basic, but additional experimentation may create something new entirely...perhaps even your own answer to Sephiroth. What will you do with this, I wonder? Each vial is restocked the following month after being used."
2001,,600,Elixir Bundle,Final Fantasy VII,Making,"Forget all those meager little potions, THIS is what you want to chug down when you're in a pinch. It's three Elixirs that will fully restore the health and energies of the one who consumes it, making them good as new so long as they're still among the living. You will receive a new bottle to replace a previous one each month until you're back up to three. If you spend an undiscounted additional 200 points, you also receive three Megalixirs which will have the same effect on up to three individuals of your choosing at the same time, which will restock at the same rate."
2002,,600,Wisdom of the Ancients,Final Fantasy VII,Making,"Materia. The marble-like gems that contain the solidified power of Mako, enabling those who use them to become stronger or cast various spells and special abilities. For most ordinary humans in this world, this is the only real way to use magic left in the world. Materia is created in a process that normally takes hundreds of years, occurring naturally within Lifestream deposits. Through some luck or unique gift from the Planet, you have learned to shorten this process down to a single afternoon. By drawing a small amount of life energy from the Planet, you are able to shape Mako into a brand new Materia of your own design within a few hours. That said, this process starting out is extremely draining for an ordinary person, often needing you to take a bed rest afterwards and you only start out able to make very basic Magic Materia of the elements. However, as you refine this process, not only will it become more efficient over time but you will eventually learn to recreate the other Materia types, even the extremely powerful Summon Materia of this world after a long process of trial and error.

Once you have mastered this creation process, you can eventually turn your own personal spells and special abilities into Materia that others can equip and use, anything from your own personal 'stat boosts' to even making Summon Materia for creatures that voluntarily choose to become your allies, letting you temporarily call on them to unleash devastating attacks or lay waste to your enemies. Like regular Materia, these creations of yours will gradually grow in power until reaching a personal maximum that may be well and above what they started out as. Expect to be in high demand and at the top of Shinra's kidnapping list if somebody finds out you can do this."
2003,,600,Like A Sandwich,Final Fantasy VII,Making,"Materia Fusion is a unique art that was originally utilized by higher-ranking members of SOLDIER as a way to boost their prowess without having to rely on the sometimes extensive timetables for Materia growth. Whether someone taught you this or you found it out for yourself, you are able to fuse together two pieces of Materia (and optionally, a physical item). The resulting new Materia will contain greater power and passive boosts depending on the ingredient components. For example, combining a Fire Materia that increases your magical ability with another will increase that magical boost. There is no limit to the number of times you can combine Materia to make them stronger, though it is more exhausting on your personal energies the greater they become. As an added bonus, you may combine similarly magical items that in some way enhance your natural abilities with others to create new combinations and effects.

If you have Passed Basic or One-Winged Angel, this perk comes with an internal Mako pool that grows within your body as you slay enemies, letting you fuel Material Fusion or the Digital Mind Wave (if you have it) without needing to spend any of your personal magical energies in its place."
2004,,600,World Runes,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"Are you sure about this? These are the World Runes. They contain (or tap, it’s not really clear) the true magic of Runeterra. Sure, Celestial magic is as if not more powerful, but the World Runes can literally shape the land in a way that no normal magic can. So... are you really sure? The price is that low for a reason. The Runes want to be used, and it will require immense willpower to resist their call. I cannot tell you precisely what they do, but the last time they were used they almost broke the planet. Just look at their names! Shard of Violence, Shard of Madness, Shard or Betrayal... yeah, there are also the Shard of Hope and the Shard or Reverence, but honestly, the Runes are kind of bad news. They grant more power than practically any other artifact in the world, but… 

I see you’re sure. Very well. Just be careful with them. Nobody wants another Rune War."
2005,,600,Mist Weaponry,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"Most of the undead that are created by the Black Mist possess weapons of some sort, but those are more recreation of the weapons they had in life. You instead possess something different: a weapon infused with the Mist. What Mist? Well, ordinarily, it would be the Black Mist, but if you control other types of mist, you can make them using that. The Mist weapons can be any kind of melee weapon you want, it appears to be made of ghostly metal, it’s almost indestructible and even if someone manages to destroy it, you can just reform it at will. Its main power is to concentrate to an absurd degree the power of the Mist. The Black Mist corrupts and captures souls, but it usually takes time or a fresh corpse. A single graze from your Mist Weapon can instantly capture souls and turn it into an undead. If you possess the Sacred Mist, each strike will free the souls trapped by the Black Mist, and so on."
2006,,600,The List ,Legends of Runeterra,Making,"Oh boy, you managed to find something quite troublesome. This long parchment is filled with names... or will be. The original List continuously added names and it wasn’t clear who actually put them in. This List instead lets you write down the names you want. Once the name is on the list, while trying to hunt down the person, you’ll be empowered by a strange magic that will make you a perfect assassin. Your steps will cause no sound, you’ll be able to walk through obstacles, and your strikes will pierce the defenses of the target like they aren’t there and inflict grievous, non healing wounds. Just don’t be overconfident, you can still be overpowered should you not land a sufficiently lethal strike. In future Jumps, the List can take a more appropriate form, like a file in your phone."
2007,,600,Faith Drop,Fairy Fencer F,Making,"What are you doing with this? Wait, there’s two!? You have no idea just how important this miraculous relic actually is, do you? This is a fragment of the Goddess’ power undiluted by time or circumstance. With this you hold the key to either salvation or the world’s destruction. It’s a crystalline fragment that shines with an inner radiance capable of granting great power to the holder. Even capable of tipping luck in your favor like the greatest Luck Blessing. Be careful, Jumper. Everyone will be after you if they discover you have this."
2008,,600,Return Wing,Fairy Fencer F,Making,"You’re in danger, Jumper! You’re out of supplies, low of health, and badly outnumbered! Good thing your trusty Return Wing protects you! Once invoked this artifact immediately whisks you away to safety to a predetermined point."
2009,,600,Dimensional Clock ,Fairy Fencer F,Making,Playing with time now Jumper? Fair enough. With this unusual clock you can reverse time for yourself and your friends by 1 hour. What will you do with such an artifact? Maybe rig it up to the snooze button for more sleep?
2010,,600,Dusty Gate of Babylonia,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"A filthy mongrel must have stolen this from the Emperor’s own palace. One of Cosmo King Gil’s spare vault key’s lies in your hands now, a golden artefact that unlocks access and use to one of Babylonia’s many treasure vaults. It looks like the one you have is pretty old and dusty though, only holding treasures from the modern age and earlier of the previous Universe. Not that the great golden king’s treasures are useless but you may need to swab down anything you bring out to get rid of the cobwebs. He’s long since moved onto the treasures of the Servant Universe. Just make sure he and his agents never see you use this, he’s no less possessive than he was when he first became king. "
2011,,600,Sapphire Scientist,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Making,"In the same way that artificial humans can be constructed through magecraft, some have mastered the path to making a living Servant from nothing. A Homunculus type Servant, even. The secret technologies and methods of a certain dark clan were revealed to you, teaching you the arts of Saint Graph Construction. While it relies on advanced tools and significant resources, you have the extreme skill to create all kinds of Servants by constructing Spirit Origins manually. 

Your skills and tools are just as applicable to modification of existing Servants as well, allowing you to customise Skills, upgrade Noble Phantasms and even create entirely new Servant Containers to apply to existing Saint Graphs, such as the fearsome Anti-Servants made to slay certain other Servants. Manipulation of the furthest ends of the Servant System, those grand heights and beastly depths, is yet beyond you. But with enough time, perhaps..."
2012,,600,Core Of The Jumper ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Making,"You’ve gotten your hands on the core of a Herrscher... But you’re not compatible with it. Instead, you may study it, and with a decade of study, you’re guaranteed to figure out a way to create a perpetual motion machine. The first perpetual motion machine will incorporate the core in its use and will only create pseudo-Honkai Energy, but subsequent models can be improved to allow them to produce other energies, and not require the Core in their creation.

If you’re particularly insane, you could implant it into someone else to see what Herrscher they’ll become, but I make no guarantee that they’ll remain sane; you’re putting it in them, after all. If you use it up in that way then you’ll get it back the following Jump."
2013,,600,Ruina's Author,Library of Ruina V1.0,Making,"Not just a book collector, you are now an author, editor and publisher. While you might always have been capable of writing books based on your own knowledge and imagination, now you can bless your books to grant their readers abilities and tools as if they were using the Book Learning perk. You can also easily assemble and disassemble books, inserting pages from one to another and allowing the information to seamlessly integrate for mixed skillsets. The strength of the books you write depends on how factual the information contained within it is. For example, if you were to write a book about rayguns when you have no clue how one would operate could still provide a raygun, but it would be of notably inferior quality, IF it fired at all. Copies not directly produced by you do not copy the Book Learning ability."
2014,,600,Kagenui,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"This short sword glitters like a crystal that has never before tasted blood. Legends speak of the blade holding mastery over time that was stolen from a particularly powerful Magi during the war. This is a dramatic overestimation of the blade’s power, but it hints at the truth. The sword is imbued with a subtle touch of time magic that occasionally stops those struck by it in their tracks for several moments. This allows a skilled assassin to turn the barest of cuts into a lethal stab by acting while their opponent is frozen."
2015,,600,Stardust Rod,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"Crafted with the head of a meteorite and a handle of lightning struck wood, this magic wand isn’t just a focusing device for spells. Its past users have each inlaid an enchantment to strengthen the vitality and endurance of those who use it. Now, those who hold it could shrug off fatigue and light wounds with ease. Very useful for any Magi who finds themselves on the battlefield. Strangely, this rod has a special resonance with the Meteor spell, halving the magical strain of casting the spell by any who holds the rod."
2016,,600,Angel Brush ,Final Fantasy VI,Making,"An odd paintbrush with only a single feather at its tip. The feather is still capable of lapping up paint and makes for an absolutely astounding painting tool. It comes perfectly clean with only a little splash of water and is dry again within seconds. Miraculous as that all is, it is not the only ability of the paintbrush. It is also capable of boosting the magic cast by those who hold it, especially any magic centered around painting or other artistic endeavors."
2017,,600,A Weapon fit for a God,God Of War (2018),Making,"Truly this is a weapon fit for a god! What you wield now is a weapon that is comparable to Mjolnir, a weapon that could be called a weapon of mass destruction in its own right. Choose an element be it fire, lightning, or something else this weapon can now be used to create and manipulate that element to the point where it could slay gods and if that element matches your own domain then you would find the power you could wield magnified several fold."
2018,,600,Wisdom of The Dwarves,God Of War (2018),Making,"You can now craft things that would truly impress the gods themselves, if your craft is in stoneworking then you could craft a wall that the gods themselves would not be able to topple, and should your craft be in weapon making then you would be able to create the equivalent of a divine WMD like Mjolnir. Furthermore, at the beginning of each jump you will be able to pick one craft that you would have divine skill in, though that doesn’t mean that you can’t refine the skill further."
2019,,600,Questionable Methods ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Making,"While virtue is generally encouraged, there are still those with magical powers and little moral scruples. This is something that results from such things, a love potion essentially. Those who imbibe it will fall helplessly in love with some specific person that is decided during the brewing of it, done by dropping a piece of hair or other minor body part into the mix. However, there’s ways to use it beyond just making someone drink it, such as infusing it into a picture, which will confer said picture the same effect as the potion, making those who look at it fall in love with whoever it is the potion is attuned to.

This potion is quite nasty, as its effects linger even after death if they are not dispelled, resulting in lingering ghosts relentlessly trying to charm whoever they were made to fall for. You also get a recipe for this potion, as you only have enough for one person from the start. If you make enough, you could distribute enchanted pictures to the kings of various nations, and effectively conquer vast swathes of land without a single drop of blood. Do be careful, however, as the potion does not change the victim’s approach to romance and marriage. If you get too many monogamous suitors, it might turn into quite the bloody mess."
2020,,600,Longinus Tier Holy Swords,DxD Universe,Making,"Here is where the stuff that could hurt even Sirzechs are, stuff like Caliburn, Ex-Durandal or even the original Excalibur. You can pick a canon one or make a new one.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
2021,,600,Longinus Tier Sacred Gears,DxD Universe,Making,"Here is where you Find the Longinus like Boosted Gear, you can also pick one of the new ones like Nereid Kyrie, these sacred gears have amazing power and can even make a normal human the same level as a god. You can either pick a canonical one or make yourself a new one, if you do make a new one you can choose if it's considered an old Longinus or a new one. If you pick the old option then your Longinus will be well known across the world because of its past users.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
2022,,600,Red,DxD Universe,Making,"That stupid Red Dragon Emperor thinking he is so cool just because he can double his power, well worry no more because you're now equal to Euclid Lucifuge in the creation of items be them demonic swords or sacred gears, you could with some souls of dead dragons recreate the Boosted Gear for example, the only person who knows how to mess with this stuff better than you is God, but surpassing him may still be in your reach, because this also give a boost to learning how to make things better, it would be a massive flex to make a Boosted Gear that triples your power instead of doubling, and you can do that... Eventually."
2023,,600,The Rhinegold ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Making,"Either there was a lot left over once the Greater Grail was made, or you’ve somehow got a copy of a certain cursed set of golden crystals that would make excellent materials for a variety of powerful magical artefacts, or sell for a king’s ransom. Fortunately for you, the curse is guaranteed to not affect yourself, allies and those you specifically omit from the effect, though it’s guaranteed to bring misfortune to anyone you haven’t extended this protection to that seeks to claim or use it. We’re talking Lancer levels of bad luck, that could kill heroes or ruin nations. Dragon not included."
2024,,600,TALISMAN,CthulhuTech,Making,"Pick one. Can be an imported item. This enchantment renews itself.
• Drinker of Blood - A magical weapon that penetrates armor and scales its damage.
• Shroud of Shadow - A cloak that invisibly hides its wearer.
• Axin's Pass - Pick or keycard enchanted to open any lock it fits.
• Crystal of Mizrahar - Makes 20 minute long 3D recordings.
• Distant Whisper - Trinket that allows soundless communication. You have as many as you want tuned to the same party line.
• Oculus of Revelation - Glasses that see the invisible, auras, wellness, and mystical influences."
2025,,600,The Ring,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making,"Alberich's/Andvari's ring, the ring Andvaranaut, Andvari’s loom. This ring, forged by great hands out of the purest gold, possibly while sacrificing their ability to love or be loved, will lead to your wealth constantly increasing. You will find hidden gold and treasures and fate itself will twist and turn leading you to become ever richer. Even those around you will feel an ever growing compulsion to help you grow richer all while increasing their willingness to “be bought”. Should this ring be taken from you or held by someone who isn’t you it will lead every consecutive owner to be completely consumed by their own greed. They will be driven insane, constantly worrying about the safety of the ring and ultimately die a violent death, most often caused by others coveting the ring. Not even the gods would be safe from this curse"
2026,,600,Tarnkappe,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making,"The cloaking hat, the invisibility cloak. This cap, helmet or cloak makes you truly invisible and adds the strength of 12 men to yours. You may get a helmet that gives you the ability to change your shape, size and form instead or a terror-helm which inspires great fear in your opponents.

For another -200 cp you may get all separately or a combination of them."
2027,,600,Master Smith,The Song of the Nibelungs,Making,"Even among the dwarves you are an exceptional smith and craftsman. You might not be a genius like Eitri and Brokk, but you are very close. You can repair and even improve on weapons and items gifted by gods, but you can also create wonders of your own. You could create things like incredibly sharp and strong swords, rings that accumulate wealth, feather cloaks that give you the ability to fly, helmets that make the wearer invisible and as strong as a dozen men, change form or fill those around with mortal dread etc. You may also imbue other magic you are able to wield into objects. The more time and effort you put into your work the more powerful the objects will become, but also the starting material, ranging from common ores to esoteric things like love itself, and your own character while crafting items will have a big influence on the power and exact nature of the object. For objects of ultimate power you will have to make great sacrifices."
2028,,600,Divine Reconstruction,Witch on the Holy Night,Making,"The crowning masterwork of Touko Aozaki’s Rune collection are three replicas of Primeval Runes: Divine Magic Crests created by Odin himself. Indestructible by modern magecraft, their function is as simple as it is terrifying: To amplify the curses of other runes by tens of millions of times. Somehow, you’ve found or wrought an artifact of similar calibre: A magecraft-reconstructed replica embodying a concept from the Age of the Gods, resembling a lesser version of a storied treasure from myth. Whether you’ve somehow found a means to partially replicate a legendary Reality Marble or swing a fleeting phantasm of a certain golden sword, do remember one thing about your terrifying power: It is ultimately still magecraft-a partial copy of something greater, and will ultimately lose a shootout to greater Mysteries such as True Magic."
2029,,600,Trump Cards,Witch on the Holy Night,Making,"This is the magecraft equivalent of a missile arsenal, passed down to you from some illustrious ancestors. Be they bizarre familiars like the Ploy Kickshaws belonging to Alice that are protected by a form of fairytale logic preventing them from taking harm that does not abide some sort of rule or more solid Mystic Codes, even the least among them has some unique advantage in the world of Magecraft. Among those, one is a puny but sentimental thing that has little to offer you other than loyalty. The majority run the gamut from offence to utility; think of each as a powerful magecraft spell with loose rules incarnated into a physical vessel that can repeatedly cast itself whether you want to trap a person inside a tiny bottle, lower local conditions of reality to empower fantasy-based effects, distort space or monitor a whole city at once. Finally, three of them are catastrophically powerful or life-changingly miraculous constructs on par with the Great Three Ploys Flat Snark, Wandersnatch and Thames Troll. Even if their Mystery is strictly speaking inferior to that of a truly ancient Phantasmal, each operates on a scope resembling more a mythological miracle than anything conceived of by modern civilisation. Only the safest hands can be trusted with such power. And only the most foolish would try to pry them from you, their rightful wielder."
2030,,600,Holy Armament,Witch on the Holy Night,Making,"In this world, just like men and beasts certain weapons that boast a long enough history acquire a degree of Mystery and get imbued with a certain concept powerful enough to contend against Phantasmal Beasts even when magecraft fails. This melee weapon of your choice is one such example. Shining with the light of faith and sharpened by prayers, it cuts through magecraft of all kinds like cobwebs and scorches the flesh of supernatural beings with holy golden flame. Even against mundane materials, it’s sharpness cuts like a hot knife through butter-and it’s blunt edges are almost impervious to mundane force and inertia. Not quite one of the legendary Scriptures nor from the common ranks of priestly armaments, this weapon has one final gift: It is uniquely loyal to you, and can never be used to hurt you without extreme amounts of corruption or reforging. Attempting to strike you with it finds the weapon simply bounce off like it was made of foam."
2031,,600,Golden Gauntlet,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Made of what seems like solid gold with six dashing jewels incrusted on it. Each of those jewels holds a different power. Extremely strong hypnosis and mind control, teleportation, great affinity and insight on magic, limited control over the natural forces around the user, capacity to interfere with souls to some degree, and weak control over time. Each of these starts off weak and must be mastered to the utmost limit before the gauntlet itself can show its true power. No one has ever managed to do so, but many have theorized it will be very near the level of a Longinus, if not there already."
2032,,600,DNA^2,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Truth is, most of the current line up in the Hero Faction are a result of either cloning shenanigans, inheritors of the old heroes, or some mix rather than true descendants of those legendary individuals. Well, it works well enough. I’ll give you a rather large collection of DNA samples collected from across the history of mankind, enough material to make clones of them if you got the adequate facilities. Great warriors, poets, magicians, researchers and such lie here. Will update in other worlds you visit, adding more human DNA of important characters."
2033,,600,Multiply & Conquer,HighSchool DxD,Making,"It’s a bit troublesome how easily Devils can replenish their numbers like flies while the rest of the supernatural world has to do with the old methods for increasing their numbers. Let’s even the playing field a bit, shall we? I’ll grant you a ‘blank’ copy of the evil pieces system, albeit modified to fit your current race, and with a different ‘theme’ of your choice so instead of chess you can have them themed after the tarot, casino tokens, or whatever - the only limited to a maximum of 18 per ‘set’. Alongside this, comes a manual with instructions on how to make more sets. You can make some minor modifications on how they work precisely, given their role."
2034,,600,Sinlaire Excite,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Hohohoho, the pride and glory of Azazel. His collection of blueprints of all the Sacred Gears he has researched over hundreds of years, as well as the artificial ones he would end up creating. Don’t be mistaken, this is what amounts to a creation kit for sacred gears alongside lots of examples to draw from. However, while an utter moron could eventually make a low tier artificial SG with this, someone with an intelligence rivalling Azazel or that goes even further, could finally crack all the secrets of this system."
2035,,600,Malebranche,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Twelve statues, the sealed relics of an old age, were made during the age of the original satans as a response to the sacred gears... It was a partial success. The Malebranche are artifacts that hold each an immensely powerful being, capable of swapping between their normal and weapon forms and capable of granting strength, abilities, and raw power to their users, even a fraction of their influence in a random devil was enough to have Sirzechs go all out. Even with their current allies and strong individuals, Hell has them sealed, afraid of the consequences of letting them roam free, especially the leader. Now they’re yours. Have fun."
2036,,600,Last Origin,HighSchool DxD,Making,"The Throne of God, the Judeo-Christian one, to be more precise. It gives you access and control over the various systems he implemented during his run, including the Sacred Gears stuff, the defenses on Heaven, and so on. Right now, is being watched over by Michael, who is a very powerful seraphim, but no God. He will be a bit baffled if you start messing with it better than him, which would be funny. To sweeten the deal a bit more, I’ll throw in this instruction manual on how to get this thing going on. With it you could make so non-humans can be born with Sacred Gears... or instantly rip them off from all the Reincarnated Devils with them. Your choice."
2037,,600,God’s Mistake,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Sacred Gears aren’t the only artifacts of power in this world. Godly items used by deities like the hammer of Thor, or the spear of Odin abound in this place. Even the weapons of late heroes also lie around waiting for someone worthy of wielding them once again. You... have neither of those. What you have, however, is an invaluable collection of fakes. Copies of Mjolnir, Gungnir, Gram, Durandal, and more. One copy of each magical artifact or weapon of renown. While they are obviously a couple tiers behind the originals, the sheer number of them makes up for it. They won’t be able to win a fight with the originals, but the effects are maintained and the sheer amount of these is enough to give anyone an edge in battle, or to power up an army."
2038,,600,The Maker,HighSchool DxD,Making,"You might not be the rumored God that spawned the Three Factions, but you do have some stuff in common with him. Namely, that you’re also a creator deity. As such, you have a pretty high rank in your affiliated Pantheon, and possess an innate knowledge about how most things here work, from souls, to magic, to animals, artifacts and so on. Thus, you’re capable of effortlessly messing with stuff like the Sacred Gear system, make similar creations (under the right circumstances) and even create your own species to serve you, much like that other God created the angels. Whether they have or not free will is up to you."
2039,,600,Pandora’s Box ,God of War,Making,"A massive gold and brass box, created by Hephaestus, by order of Zeus, to contain the Evils that were created by the Titanomachy. Though this is not the same box, its purpose is similar. This is the ultimate prison, capable of holding even a primordial for all of eternity, with no chance for escape. It is protected by a blazing azure inferno that only you can bypass, incinerating even gods to such a degree that not even ash is left behind."
2040,,600,Shield of Zeus,God of War,Making,"A golden shield depicting an eagle amongst a storm, this is one of the personal artifacts of the king of the gods, Zeus himself, though he rarely uses it nowadays. It is completely indestructible, and can retract as well, taking the form of a resplendent gauntlet when not in use, though it can turn back in the blink of an eye. Any who would strike this shield will find themselves electrocuted, as though one of Zeus' own lightning bolts struck them. Additionally, it will greatly improve all lightning and air abilities you may possess, allowing you to properly unleash the wrath of the heavens."
2041,,600,Helm of Hades,God of War,Making,"A horned helm made from stygian iron, it was worn by the one who receives many guests, the lord of the dead. Wearing this helm will see a portion of his power flow into you, greatly increasing your durability as well as allowing you to become completely imperceivable at will, such that not even the gods would be able to tell where you were. Additionally, it will vastly improve all death-related abilities you may possess, allowing you to teach all to fear the dead."
2042,,600,Armor of Ares,God of War,Making,"Crafted for Ares by his brother, this black and red armor set is one that befits a true god of war. Not only is this armor nigh-indestructible, it will reduce all damage you receive by half, all the while tripling all damage you deal to an enemy. Additionally, it will vastly improve all combat-related skills and abilities you may possess, making you a true terror on the battlefield."
2043,,600,Craft of Hephaestus,God of War,Making,"Though many look down on the Smith God for his unfortunate appearance, none can deny that his works are the best in all of the Greek world. And now, through either innate talent or skill cultivated by the god himself, you are now one of the few who could potentially match him. You are a peerless craftsman, making magical weapons with the same contemptuous ease as armor or children's toys, all easily fit for the gods themselves. Additionally, your skills are so great that you can break down and enhance seemingly indestructible objects, so long as you actually intend to improve them that is."
2044,,600,Circlet        ,Adventure Time,Making,A magic circlet that completely blocks any attempts of mind control while worn. Comes in a design of your choice.
2045,,600,Billy’s Gauntlet,Adventure Time,Making,A seven fingered magic gauntlet. Extremely powerful energy projection from the palm that can damage even the most dangerous of enemies.
2046,,600,Class Card,Final Fantasy III,Making,"An artefact like this is not something to be taken lightly. This relic allows you to choose a single class you have access to and immediately acquire abilities equivalent to a level 99 member of that class, and gifts you with the class’s unique item. Each class has their own unique item, either a piece of gear or a weapon that provides the greatest boosts imaginable short of an ultima weapon. This is a one use item."
2047,,600,Out of Their League,Final Fantasy III,Making,"You have ascended to the rank of legendary blacksmith, and are capable of forging equipment beyond that of an ordinary smith. What you make can only be called legendary, producing varied effects and multiple boons. Most importantly you know to to smith magical metals such as mithril or orichalcum, and can quickly adapt to the mystical metals from other worlds. If you could get ahold of some orichalcum you would be capable of forging ultima weapons."
2048,,600,Summoning,Fate/Apocrypha,Making,"Summoning a Servant is a rather streamlined process thanks to the Holy Grail, but you can still try to influence the summoning with proper resources. That is, you can increase your chances of summoning a specific Servant by using a catalyst related to them. For example, summoning Siegfried by using the bloodied leaf that blocked a spot on his back as he bathed in Fafnir’s blood. Now you don’t need to worry about getting your hands on such things the hard way, as you may simply purchase one here. Of course, the price of the catalyst will be determined by the quality of the Servants it lets you summon. For 200cp, you may have a catalyst connected to a Servant of the first tier of purchase, such as Frankenstein’s monster, or Astolfo, or Avicebron, and so on.

For 400cp, you may gain a catalyst connected to greater heroes, such as Karna and Siegfried. You can also gain a catalyst connected to a group of heroes instead of a specific Servant, such as a piece of the Round Table of Camelot, to summon one of the Knights of the Round Table commanded by King Arthur. Additionally, the 400cp catalyst may have powerful effects on its own, such as Chiron’s cloth of arachne which grants poison resistance to those who wear it. And of course, you may pay 600cp for not only a catalyst which can summon a globally famous hero like King Arthur, but one which also has incredible powers of its own, maybe even a Noble Phantasm outright, such as Avalon, sheath of Excalibur which grants immense regeneration to those who possess it. Now that you have the catalyst, all you need is the summoning ritual. Or perhaps you’ll modify that even further?"
2049,,600,Respect-Time Pocket-watch,Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"An antique pocket watch can be easily retrieved from your pocket. It looks and acts like a regular pocket-watch, but has a secret switch that toggles its real ability. It doesn't grant you the ability to manipulate time, rather, it prevents those who would attempt to in your presence. Should someone try to speed up or rewind time while it is active and within a certain distance of you, the attempt is thwarted and both you and the perpetrator will be alerted to the fact in the form of an ancient bell. If you have the know-how, you may find a way to get the watch to outright punish those who dare try."
2050,,600,E.G.O. Manufacturing,Lobotomy Corporation,Making,"PE-Boxes gathered from your energy can be used to create weapons and armour based on your abilities. The more powerful the gear, the more PE-Boxes required for manufacturing. Also, while normally abnormalities provide one weapon type and one suit taking their most prominent features, you can decide their forms and abilities on a per item basis."
2051,,600,Dual Gloves ,Final Fantasy I,Making,"Odd, these shouldn’t really exist in this world...oh, well. These a pair of black gloves with runes painted along them. Upon wearing them, you will be able to channel a single spell into one hand, and then channel a different spell into another. Combining two destructive spells together will combine their properties and let them be used together as one, combining two healing spells will heal even more effectively...and mixing-and-matching works as well. Just try not to combine spells that have blatantly opposite properties, like combining a destructive spell with a healing one - they’ll just cancel each other out."
2052,,600,"Faith, Trust, and a little bit of pixie dust ",Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Making,"You are able to create a magical dust that temporarily grants others any powers or abilities you have. You can control the duration of access to the power you selected however once the dust has been created you cannot change what it gives or how long it lasts.

Boosted: Pixie Miracles

Your innate connection to your magical energy allows you to create orbs of energy that can store any copies of any type of power you have including perks. These Orbs are set to their default state and will initially be at their weakest, requiring time and training on the part of the one you give it in order for them to successfully integrate it into themself.

Boosted: Pixe-mabobs 

You can bestow items with any perks or powers you possess and create an innate connection between them and you. From this connection you will always know where the item is and can selectively grant access to people making it so that the item will only work if you allow it to.

Pixie Miracles Boost Requires Even Miracles Take a Little Time to Activate

Pixe-mabobs Boost Requires You want Thingamabobs to Activate"
2053,,600,Primeval Staves ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Making,"Staff of the primeval glintstone sorcerers Azur and Lusat. Only those who have glimpsed what lies beyond the wisdom of stone may wield it. Those who use this to cast sorceries will find the casting time reduced to a mere fraction of what they would have been, as well as channeling the energies of the Primeval Current with greater ease."
2054,,600,Stone of the Gods,The Road to El Dorado,Making,"In this and future Jumps, there now exists a giant stone with your likeness upon it, as well as any companions you may have. When you get close to it, the face will change to show a grand prophecy involving you that can best help you accomplish a goal you have. Following this prophecy will lead you on a grand adventure sure to bring you wealth and glory. Once you have involved yourself in the prophecy, the stone’s face will be fixed and can act as a focus for any faith based abilities you may have, or any prayers directed to you."
2055,,600,Legendary Weapon Set,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Making,"A legendary weapon of some kind. It has been designed for you specifically, and is one of a kind.

You may choose what type of weapon it is. It may be a melee weapon, such as a sword, axe, spear, or hammer. It may be a ranged weapon, such as a bow or a gun. You may even choose something more esoteric that is still considered a weapon, such as a staff or a wand (though doing so would not actually grant the weapon any magical power from this alone). If you choose a ranged weapon, it will come with an infinite supply of standard, mundane ammunition, which you will always find on hand when you need it.

No matter your weapon’s size or weight, it will feel light in your hands, and you will never find it unwieldy to use. It has been magically empowered, in order to outperform any similar but otherwise mundane weapon in terms of damage output.

To make it a truly unique weapon, it may have an additional quality. These qualities may be useful to you, but never game-changing. It may be a passive enchantment, such as a sword with a ‘bane’ effect which allows it to deal more damage to a certain type of foe (the broader the category you choose for this, the less of an effect it would have), or a staff that allows you to channel your energy into it, allowing you to shape your energy into various attacks. It may be something which is not always active, such as a sword with a temporary mode it can enter into which can improve some of your raw abilities at the cost of others, or a bow which can be ‘overdrawn’ to instead shoot out a powerful beam of light. It could even be a mechanical enhancement to the weapon, such as a sword which can be extended out as a whip for attacks or to grab ledges, or a hammer that has had a rocket built into it, allowing for massively powerful swings.

As these items are designed specifically for you, they fail to utilise their full potential in the hands of others, simply acting as mundane weapons with any additional qualities disabled. If you wish, you can grant temporary ‘permission’ for another to use these items as you could. This requires you to remain nearby, and you are free to revoke this permission at any time.

Should any of the weapons, or the shield, be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse 24 hours later."
2056,,600,Elder Wand ,Wizarding World,Making,"Of the three fabled Deathly Hallows, it is the Elder Wand that has made the most prominent mark in history. Known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, and many others, the Elder Wand is a greater than any other, a wand truly worthy of one who has conquered Death. And over the centuries, the wand has found itself in embroiled in the bloodiest of battles as wizards and witches all over the world sought out its unimaginable power.

While the wand in your hands may not be the original, it is nonetheless a perfect copy. So long as it lies in your hands, your magic shall be far greater than before. A shield charm that would’ve broken underneath a single wizard’s assault could now find itself standing against over a dozen wizards striking it all at once. And not only is your magic mightier in terms of force, you will even find it capable of performing what was once thought to be impossible, such as repairing broken wands and who knows what else.

And while I did say that this is perfect copy of the original, that isn’t exactly true. You see, your Elder Wand has one big difference. Unlike the one you can find in this world, your Elder Wand is well and truly loyal to you. Oh, it still respects strength above all else but anyone who seeks to use this wand against you shall find it backfiring on them very swiftly and neither shall its allegiance ever change."
2057,,600,True Time Turner,Wizarding World,Making,"Time is a very complicated subject and there are no shortage of scholars aching to study its depths. To facilitate such research, Time-Turners were created, magical hour-glasses enchanted with an Hour-Reversal Charm. With a single turn of the clock, time is reversed by an hour. Sadly, it is restricted so that you will only be able to travel back five hours, in the interests of keeping the world safe from calamitous disasters of a time-related nature.

But if you are willing to pay a steeper price, there is one other available. Gleaming a brilliant silver and gold, this time-turner is one most true. With it, you can travel back years or even decades into the past. And unlike a normal time-turner, you can return to the present without waiting. Simply turn it in reverse and you’ll be back in your own time. Be careful. While possession of either of the Time-Turners protects you from the consequences of time travel, it does not protect the rest of the world. Always remember that lest you come back to a world you hardly even recognize."
2058,,600,Wand,Gummi Bears,Making,"This magic wand seems to make spells mostly silent with each one going off with a crackle. With a wave you can cast spells just by thinking of the effects you want to happen, basically turning you into a magic-based reality warper. The magic comes from the user though, so it’s dependent on your magic reserves.

You get two wands and the instructions on how to make more (it is however complex and expensive to make)."
2059,,600,Wishing Emerald,Gummi Bears,Making,"This giant glowing emerald grants a single wish to anyone who touches it and speaks aloud their wish. These wishes are limited in power and scope. These are limited to the effects of a DnD 3.5e Wish spell cast by a typical level 18 wizard with no prohibited schools.

This one is fait-backed to work outside of this jump and each person who touches this one gets one wish every ten years or once every jump, whichever comes first.

Word your wish carefully as this thing tends to grant wishes literally with a slight monkey-paw twist by default."
2060,,600,Horn of Winter Wind ,Gummi Bears,Making,This giant horn controls a powerful winter wind. It can cause winter to continually stay in an area several miles in diameter. It also provides a user with cryokinesis allowing them to generate ice or snow objects or control existing ice/snow.
2061,,600,Artifact        ,The Owl House,Making,"Fueled by savage magic, this powerful construct emits an incredible magical effect independent of any witch or demon. This could be similar to the Greenthumb Gauntlet, said to be able to grow anything you can imagine. It may be the Oracle Sphere, capable of looking into your future with near perfect clarity. Perhaps you want the Mirror Charm that Coven Leader Graye wore, allowing him to see through all illusions. You may select one object that corresponds with any one of the nine major covens, provided that the artifact’s effect remains relevant to that coven’s purview. Of course, there is a trade-off to wielding these relics. These items bear no allegiance, and will function for whichever wielder that currently possesses them. Make sure you keep yours safe!"
2062,,600,Training Wand        ,The Owl House,Making,"This cutting edge tool is perfect for witches-in-training. The ergonomic design and internal energy supply of this wand allows even magicless humans to cast spells! This wand has equal power to the models the Blight family uses to train, letting a user incinerate trees with a measly 5% of its battery. Though this implement is pre-programed with shield enchantments and fire blasts, it can form any spell the user understands, so long as the wand has sufficient energy remaining. If the energy in this wand is expended, it will recharge after a full day of no use. The more skilled a user becomes and the deeper their understanding of the spells they attempt, the more efficient the wand will become. Even still, this wand is a great aid for witches who currently lack the skill or power to attempt new spells.

As an added bonus, this wand will attune to the powers of your future destinations. Should a world you visit have an established system of magic, the wand will allow you to replicate this spellcraft in a similar fashion. This can allow even the most untrained of hands to cast the magics of their world with minimal instruction. It’s a crutch, but a powerful one."
2063,,600,Manus Catalyst,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"The chosen weapon of a pygmy lord, one whose humanity would go wild, necessitating him to be sealed away. This sorcery catalyst is quite sturdy, and its design means that it is quite effective if wielded in a similar way to an axe, but that is not its intended purpose. This staff’s real value comes through channeling dark-based abilities through it, seeing a vast increase in their potency and longevity, while lowering their cost to a fraction of what it once was."
2064,,600,Izalith Catalyst        ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"The chosen tool of the Witch of Izalith, wrought from the wood of an Archtree and imbued with the warmth of the First Flame. Though it can be used to strike enemies with great effect, often setting them alight, the staff’s real use comes through channeling fire-based abilities through it, such as pyromancy or flame sorceries. This will see a vast increase in their potency and longevity, while lowering the price it would have taken to perform such feats to a fraction. With such a weapon in your hand, you could burn the world to ash, or imbue it with the warmth of life."
2065,,600,Great Lord Set,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"The armor and chosen weapon Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight, and what he took with him to battle the Everlasting Dragons. Wearing these will certainly make you feel like a Lord, as the armor will increase your physicality, the crown giving you an unmistakable air of authority, while the greatsword is imbued with holy flames, capable of unleashing a wave of divine flames when swung. With such armaments, is it any wonder why he was considered the mightiest Lord of them all?"
2066,,600,Mysteries of the Soul       ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"Those who would eventually come to dominate the world started off as mindless, hollow beings, fit only for consumption by the Everlasting Dragons. Yet when given souls of their own by Fire, they gained the strength to tear down the eternal. The nature of these souls is fascinating, one that you have researched in depth, being a master when it comes to manipulating them for all manner of purposes. Most prominently is the ability to bind them to stone automatons, creating golems capable of independent movement and reacting to outside stimuli. These families of life are certainly impressive, but is that all?

Boosted: No longer are souls an unknown to you, some nebulous thing wasted to simply make one stronger. You have learned all you can from them, a Lord unmatched in this realm of knowledge, and now have the ability to create your very own, as well as lifeforms to house them, as complex as most sapient beings or as simple as an insect. You can even imbue them with certain concepts, such as fire or ice, light or dark in order to grant them new abilities and natures.

Boost Requires Soul of a Lord to Activate"
2067,,600,First Scholar,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Making,"Magic is an energy, one bound to the soul as the soul is bound to the body and mind. As such, one must ask, if it can be bound to a being, could magic not be bound to an object? Your studies in the avenue of enchantment are especially noteworthy, binding magical effects to everything from rings to armor to entire structures, granting them supernatural abilities when used or activated. Any would be lucky to possess one of your creations, as useful as they are powerful.

Boosted: Rings? Single buildings? Such thinking is too small for a Lord such as yourself, one who can change the very nature of the world itself. You are capable of placing enchantments upon cities and even entire kingdoms, their effects being felt by all within. Imbuing those living there with greater strength, or manifesting a powerful shield to protect them from harm, the only limiting factor is how much time you’re willing to put into it.

Boost Requires Soul of a Lord to Activate"
2068,,600,Magic Trident,Disney’s The Little Mermaid,Making,"A copy of Triton’s Trident, a magic item reserved for the ruler of the seas. Just as powerful as the original, your trident can be used to fire magical bolts of energy – which can also be used to write, somehow. It can create storms, manipulate water to create whirlpools or simply allow a merperson to rise high out of the water’s surface. It can generate ice, as well as create small rainbows. It can even be used to turn a merperson into a human, or vice versa. When in the hands of someone with existing powerful magic talent, the trident is capable of greater feats still. Growing to an enormous size, or forcing others to bow before you are but examples of what you could achieve. Should your trident be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
2069,,600,Matthew,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Making,"What’s that? You’ve got a nail with some savior juice on it? This genuine nail from the Cross comes from the Vatican’s Don’t Fuck With This armory. Should any crusader find their strength lacking, they need only drive this relic into their own heart to become a conduit of God’s own will and an unrivaled force against evil. Once implanted, the nail imbues the crusader’s body with the greatest of divine auras, fortifying their attacks with holy flame that will incinerate the flesh and constructs of vampires, demons, and any other sinful or unholy creature. The crusader’s defenses will be equally bolstered as divine magics heal and regenerate any wounds present. While strengthened in this way, the crusader cannot be killed by physical damage alone. Even the great Alucard was helpless before the power this relic granted, and only barely escaped destruction when he managed to remove the nail from his foe. You and any who use this relic suffer a similar weakness, and must prevent the nail from being extracted to maintain your divine enhancements. That said, few could hope to touch you, let alone threaten you, while you shine with God’s light.

If you permanently implant this relic into a creature, or heaven forbid, it is destroyed, you will receive a new Nail after an extended period of time, equal to either a full decade, or the start of your next Jump, whichever comes later. Alternatively, instead of securing Helena’s Nail, you could instead have another holy artifact recovered by the Church. Buy the Arc of the Covenant, the Dead Sea Scrolls, or the literal body of Christ! Though admittedly, I’m not sure why you’d want that last one."
2070,,600,Sword of Jumpchon,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales,Making,"Legends speak of a sword with dominion over the wind, which can make a captain’s own ship turn against him... The Sword of Triton, one of the many weapons in the late Blackbeard’s arsenal. The sword in question isn’t the one offered here, but this is a convincing replica in any case. With it, you may call upon any ship you own from afar, bringing it closer and activating its equipment remotely. Said effect weakens with distance from your vessel, but its use does not end there. By slashing or stabbing the affected target, this ancient edge may dispel any active supernatural effects you or anyone you’ve killed with the blade have placed. Free melee weapon import."
2071,,600,Merlin’s Hat ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Making,"One of the most powerful magical artifacts in the Wizarding World. It allows anyone, even a non-Wizard to perform magic on par with the strongest Wizards in the world (this world) for a whole day, and the spellcasting does not require any prior knowledge, only simple intent is needed. In case of the Hat being destroyed, all the spells cast with it are undone. Normally, the hat can only be used one day and lose all its magical properties, but since you are using CP to get the hat, its powers reset at the start of each jump or 10 years, depending on whichever comes first."
2072,,600,Stone of Dreams,Wizards of Waverly Place,Making,"""It can do anything. Reverse any spell. Show you the future. But you only get one chance at it."" You are in possession of the most powerful magical artifact in the Wizarding World. A stone that was sealed away in fear of Wizards that may misuse it. This stone can grant a Wizard any wish, but only a single wish. It is capable of anything, with the exceptions of effecting chain rules or cheesing out of drawbacks. Since you bought the Stone with CP, it allows you, and only you to use it, and you can make a wish once per jump."
2073,,600,The Bottomless Bag of Wonders ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Making,"Jack Horner has acquired numerous legendary treasures including Excalibur, the Phoenix, the Talking Cricket, and dozens of other wonders. Somehow you managed to get your hands on Jack’s bag containing all of his mythical items. The only treasure not stored within is the map to the Wishing Star. In addition, this bag also is truly bottomless allowing you to store an infinite amount of trinkets inside. The bag will also expand allowing items to freely be pushed into the bag and pulled out of it. Lastly, post jump this bag will expand providing you with a similar collection of legendary relics and beings stored within."
2074,,600,Great Lord Set,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"The armor and chosen weapon Gwyn, Lord of Cinder, who linked the First Flame. Lord Gwyn, bearer of the ultimate soul, divided that power among his clan before linking the flame. When he departed, he left only with his greatsword, his garb, and the crown, possessing an ember of the great power they once held. The armor will greatly increase your physicality, while the greatsword is imbued with holy flames, capable of unleashing a wave of divine flames when swung. They can also be used to summon fellow members of the Warriors of Sunlight to your side, so engrossed are they with you that they have agreed to become your followers."
2075,,600,Moonlight Set,Dark Souls: Covenants,Making,"The clothes and catalyst used by the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity who watches over the abandoned city of the Gods, Anor Londo. Gwyndolin is Gwyn's lastborn and a legitimate god, but he is also a Moon sorcerer, and this wand will empower your spells the stronger your will and faith is, as well as being able to summon other members of the Blades of the Darkmoon to your side in order to aid you in combat, many of whom have agreed to become your followers, eager to hunt down the sinners of any future worlds you visit. Wearing his clothes and crown will also see your magic empowered, as well as granting you a strong resistance towards poison, though it barely grants any physical defense."
2076,,600,Flying Carpet ,Twisted,Making,"A true wonder of this world. This enchanted carpet is capable of soaring through the sky at incredible speeds, although it feels as though it’s not moving at all when you’re on it. It understands intuitively where you want it to go, and can appear from nowhere at a moment’s notice when needed, often saving you from sudden danger. You may choose (and change your choice at will) if it appears as an actual flying carpet, or if it takes the appearance of a regular carpet being dragged by people making woosh noises. This choice does not affect its capabilities."
2077,,600,Acme’s Art,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Making,"You’ve learned the secrets to creating Toon props! Things like portable holes, disappearing-reappearing ink, and more can be created by your hand. Eventually, you may learn to breathe life into your creations- creating Toons in their own right."
2078,,600,“Mend the Bond” Tapestry,Brave,Making,"A well-made tapestry, depicting you and some of your family and/or closest friends. Should one of you be cursed, or otherwise come under an unwanted magical effect, the tapestry will damage itself in some way to reflect this. Repairing this damage will undo this curse or magical effect. Deliberately damaging or destroying the tapestry will not inflict any kind of magical malady, but may make identifying what needs to be repaired to reverse a magical effect more challenging, or may make repair altogether impossible.

At the start of each new jump, the tapestry will change in appearance. It will always include you, but the other people represented may change to reflect changes in your personal relationships. Post-chain, this will occur every ten years.

Should the tapestry be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24
hours. Damage inflicted to represent active curse or unwanted magical effects remain present in the replacement."
2079,,600,The Sorcerer's Apprentice ,Disney Villains Victorious,Making,"Where in the world did you find this!? This magical hat was said to be owned by the great sorcerer Yen Sid, granting even apprentices the ability to work great wonders of magic. While wearing it, if you don’t have “Higitus Figitus”, you gain some magical ability similar to it with the potential to grow in magical prowess. If you already have that perk, you’ll find that your raw magical might is amplified to match even Yen Sid, Merlin and Maleficent in power! Though, you’ll need to figure out how to correctly channel it to get the most of this, since you won’t be taught all the possible spells you could perform right away."
2080,,600,Laurence's Skull,Bloodborne: Covenants,Making,"A malformed skull, similar in shape to the deadly cleric beasts, that once belonged to the founder of the Healing Church, Laurence. Though macabre, this relic has been shaped into an effective helmet, one that grants the wearer the strength and durability of the beast that the first vicar would inevitably become. Additionally, it has the strange property of covering the wearer in purifying flames which burn anything that dares get too close to you. A reminder that even long dead, one should fear the old blood, and the metamorphosis it induces."
2081,,600,Pandora’s Box,Marvel Magic,Making,"Oh, Pandora. She fell victim to the most human of drives: simple curiosity. Tasked with guarding a box she may never open, she found the question of what was inside unbearable and opened the lid to peek inside, With the tiniest crack, the great evils poured forth from the box and were unleashed upon the world. This box may or may not be the same one given to Pandora all of those eons ago, but it is capable of much the same purpose. Any being -- no matter how powerful or vast -- that can be tricked, forced, or sealed inside the box will be completely unable to escape for so long as the box is not opened... I would suggest not handing it off to an overly curious strange, if I may."
2082,,600,Eye of Aggomotto,Marvel Magic,Making,"​Now how did you get this? Created by Aggomotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme of earth, this is a powerful magical amulet that takes the form of a pendant that opens to reveal what appears to be a living eye. The Eye serves a potent channel for many mental and illusory magics. In addition to simply greatly empowering any form of mental magic or illusions cast while using the Eye, it also allows you to dispel the illusions or mental bindings of others by casting forth a bright light from the eye and to see things as they truly are. The powers of the Eye also accompany you while in astral form where most artifacts would fail to do so.

The Eye can also be used for various other mystical effects, though less efficiently. It is capable of projection of mystical shields and blasts of raw magical energy as well as teleportation within and between realms and can even absorb mystical energy into itself."
2083,,600,Wand of Watoomb,Marvel Magic,Making,"​This is a valuable and powerful artifact, fashioned and empowered by one of the Principalities, Watoomb himself. Taking the form of a small, demonic appearing ruby sceptre, this wand allows for powerful manipulations of magical energy, From directly manipulating, absorbing, or projecting larges amounts of energy to greatly amplifying or focusing any spells cast through it, any sorcerer would consider it a great boon to possess this artifact."
2084,,600,Decimator Armor ,Marvel Magic,Making,"The Destroyer Armor of Asgard is worthy of its name, created to serve as armor fit for the king of the warrior gods, the Allfather himself. It was made in preparation for the return of the Celestials, who had bested the gods of earth in the past. This armor is not quite the Destroyer Armor, but was made in its image. Forged primarily of Uru, this armor stands nearly ten feet tall and is virtually indestructible, though not quite as much so as the original. Capable of serving as traditional armor or of being inhabited by a spirit, even a mortal man clad in this weapon would stand above most gods. It not only grants strength and durability on par with some of the strongest beings alive, but can fire tremendously powerful blasts of energy from the faceplate as well. Go forth and decimate your foes. 

You can also optionally import a suit of armor or power armor that you already possess to gain these qualities."
2085,,600,Artifact Savant ,Marvel Magic,Making,"​Agomotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme of earth, created many wondrous things still in use all of these millennia later. Perhaps his most notable creation was that of the Three-Fold Path, a system of magic still in widespread use today. But also extremely important were the potent magical artifacts he created, many of which serve invaluable roles as badges of office for the Sorcerer Supreme and tools for the defense of all existence. You understand just how powerful and important such tools can be, for you yourself are a skilled and talented enchanter. You find that imbuing items with powers is a simple matter for you, overlaying nearly any spell or magical ability you know onto some item to more easily invoke it yourself or even to allow others to do so. Though you are not yet as skilled in the creation of such wonders as Agomotto, this may yet change in time. Perhaps you will even find a way to permanently imbue living beings with your magic to grant them great powers of their own."
2086,,600,Forgemaster         ,Marvel Magic,Making,"You are skilled in the art of the forge. You craft weapons and shape armor in the way a master artist plies their trade. Perhaps you trained with a god of the forge or studied under the dwarves of Nidavellir or maybe you've simply honed your skills over lifetime's. Whatever the case, your skill with the forge goes beyond what normal mortals would be able to accomplish. You have the skill to work with metals – though perhaps not the natural hardiness required to survive the conditions needed to forge them. And even were you to only have sub-par mundane materials, you could still craft weapons and armor fit for any king who has ever lived. Further, if you know how to utilize the mystic arts, you will find yourself talented at enchanting your creations with your spells and perhaps you will even be able to forge great and powerful artifacts. But the modern world has largely moved beyond the crude weapons of old and if you wish, you may do so as well. With some effort you would be able to transfer your skills to more advanced components, creating powerful firearms or masterful mechanical vehicles."
2087,,600,Excalibur,Dial,Making,"Excalibur, the legendary sword of unmatched power, transcends the boundaries of mere mortal weapons. In its presence, even divine and conceptual beings tremble. This particular version of Excalibur carries the weight of its illustrious history, capable of slaying any being, no matter how mighty or ethereal. When grasping the hilt of Excalibur, a surge of invincibility courses through your veins. The sword acts as an impenetrable shield, warding off attacks from both physical and metaphysical sources. Its indestructible blade cleaves through all obstacles, rendering defenses futile against its divine edge.

But Excalibur’s might extends beyond offensive capabilities. The sword holds a profound healing energy that can mend wounds and restore vitality to you and your allies. In dire moments, its touch revitalizes weary bodies and bolsters the spirit, rekindling hope and boosting morale even in the face of overwhelming odds. The true potential of Excalibur is realized when the sword’s legendary healing properties and invulnerability converge. As you wield Excalibur, injuries that would cripple others simply fade away, granting you unparalleled endurance and near invincibility. It is as if the sword itself becomes an extension of your very being, protecting you from harm and empowering you to stand as an unyielding beacon of light.

However, one must bear in mind that the power of Excalibur comes with great responsibility. Its immense potential demands wisdom, humility, and a steadfast commitment to righteousness. Wield it with caution, for the sword’s indiscriminate might can have unintended consequences if used without discretion. Excalibur is an irreplaceable relic, an embodiment of sovereignty and the embodiment of true heroism. With it, you hold the power to vanquish the mightiest foes, heal the wounded, and inspire hope in the hearts of all who fight alongside you."
2088,,600,A Weapon fit for a Ruler,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Making,"A weapon of equal might as Thor’s Stormbreaker and Zeus’s Thunderbolt, only made specifically for you. You are free to design it however you want, and may take inspiration from Stormbreaker, All-Black or some other weapon for what abilities the weapon have."
2089,,600,All-Black the Necrosword ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Making,"Forged at the dawn of time and imbued with power anathema to that of the gods, this blade of darkness made absolute is a nightmare great enough to leave entire pantheons hiding away scared. While it is true that it’s piercing edge is terrible enough to slay gods quickly, it would be more accurate to say that the weapon’s terrible power is a bane to all existence-oblivion itself manifested as a longsword. It grants the wielder power over shadows-letting them teleport through darkness (even between realities), and shape hordes of monsters to their will powerful enough to stagger even the likes of Thor in battle. So greatly does it empower the wielder and so swiftly does it restore itself from harm that even Thor wielding the Stormbreaker and in fighting form struggled to merely stalemate the God-Butcher, was briefly trapped by him in a realm where darkness held greater power than light, and ultimately required help from those wielding a shadow of his powers to lay him low. The corruption it exerts on its user is undeniable, slowly killing them over time and binding their lifeforce to itself. Yet by purchasing it here, you can form a...symbiosis with the blade and suffer only the overwhelming urge to kill when you hold it.

And is it’s silent song so wrong? The gods of this world are petty, callous creatures who while away eternity amidst orgies and sacrifice competitions, caring little for the civilisations that revere them. They will evade punishment forever in their ivory towers.

To scatter their blood across the depths of space is no sin. It is the purest justice there is in a universe that abhors the very concept.

Rip and tear, until it is done."
2090,,600,Bag Of Tricks,Loki,Making,"You might not think of yourself as a magician... but you’ve certainly got quite a lot of useful things up your sleeves. More accurately, you have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of various things that you can conjure up seemingly from nowhere at any time, ranging from a quill and paper to a warm blanket. Nothing in this particular collection is particularly powerful, valuable or dangerous, more akin to various odds and ends that you’ve picked up over time, but the sheer variety of things you can pull out of thin air somewhat makes up for this. It could be useful for getting up to all sorts of mischief."
2091,,600,Serpent Crown ,Marvel Primal,Making,"A crown for the Serpent-Men of Set, this snake crown vastly enhances the psionic and personal mystic power of the person wearing it."
2092,,600,Vibrating Ore  ,Marvel Primal,Making,A heap of thirty tons of metal that absorbs literally all forms of force or energy and has near-infinite applications. Regenerates weekly.
2093,,600,Siege Perilous,X-Men the Claremont Years,Making,"Normally a one of a kind artifact possessed by the Omniversal Guardian, you have somehow been gifted a copy of the Siege Perilous. Appearing almost like an ornate mirror this is actually a magical portal into a new life. While you possess and have not used this gateway you and your companions will find that you are immune to the electronic and mystical sensory of those who are not aware that you are alive - preventing powerful beings from noticing you entering a jump - but that is merely a side blessing to help you settle into a new life.

The main use of this portal is that any being who passes through it will be judged by the
portal and transported to a new life in the same reality. The nature of the mirror’s judgments may seem bizarre at best at times. This new life will often include the loss of prior memories, and can include changing history; Havok was made a Genoshan Magistrate with no memory of his prior life, and Dazzler was placed into the position of a successful movie star who had never been a member of the X-Men. The Siege Perilous will only grant 1 new life each jump and while it is very likely to put you into a position of trouble, it will ensure that your current enemies have no knowledge of what your new life is at the time (drawback enemies will still eventually track you down).

You may allow others to pass through the Siege Perilous and into a new life determined by its strange judgment. It has been used as a means of removing foes too powerful to defeat conventionally in the past.

This portal can be shrunk down to a size comparable with a smartphone for greater ease of carrying or moving it, while shrunk down so it is not usable as a portal."
2094,,600,All-Black the Necrosword,Thor: Love and Thunder,Making,"This is probably what you’ve been waiting for. The Necrosword. This god-slaying blade of legend has chosen you as its next wielder. Firstly, being a sword, this thing is sharp enough to cut through even the hardiest of gods like hot butter. Like Mjølnir, the Necrosword will empower you to godly levels, so you may fight on equal terms with the gods it was forged to destroy, as well as granting you a healing factor so you may recover to kill another day. The blade also has a plethora of shadow-related abilities as befitting of its name. It lets the holder teleport through shadows in the same way Shadow Monsters do. Those said monsters may be created from the gloom to serve as your army of darkness. You may also make constructs of darkness, such as tentacles, cages, and claws to aid you in your pursuits. The blade negates any immortality its prey has, so you may cut down what would normally be an invincible god. Nothing is unkillable to this blade. Now go forth and slaughter. Lastly, this blade is entirely loyal to you and will not corrupt you whatsoever, in body or in mind. "
2095,,600,Mjølnir,Thor: Love and Thunder,Making,"Whosoever holds this hammer, if they be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. This is the legendary hammer of Thor in all its glory. It has pulled itself together after its destruction at the hand of Hela and is ready to fight once more. The hammer has a leg up on Thunderbolt and Stormbreaker, as only the chosen may wield it - all others will find it an immensely weighty object that is completely immovable by the unworthy. Mjølnir, too, gives its wielder Thor’s powers over electricity and the tempest, able to project terrific blasts of lighting from the hammer or the sky above, whip up hurricane-force winds, and allow the user to fly by spinning it at great speeds. It can now break into fragments that can be individually manipulated by its user, and like the other weapons, it returns to the hand of its wielder. Where the hammer truly shines is bestowing its holder with all the powers of Thor. As long as you are the master of this hammer, it will augment you physically. Not only do you have Thor’s domain over thunder, but Mjølnir will grant you his physical abilities and skill. It’ll empower you with the form of a Norse god(dess). Effectively, Mjølnir gives you the abilities of an Asgardian God of Thunder as well as I Got Naked, Which I Was Okay With. If you are sick, this hammer will not waylay any attempts at recovery, unlike the original."
2096,,600,Stormbreaker,Thor: Love and Thunder,Making,"The strongest weapon in the history of Asgard, ironically only forged after its destruction. This axe (or at least, its original) was created in the ruins of Nidavellir to slay the Mad Titan. The weapon is almost indestructible to the point where it is able to overcome full force blasts from the infinity gauntlet. Like its predecessor, it bears command over thunder - its wielder can generate tremendous displays of thunder and lightning, and control over storms, as well as allowing for flight. Whoever wields it will find that it channels and amplifies any powers they wield, due to its composition of the mythical metal, Uru. The axe is also capable of harnessing the power of the bifrost, allowing its wielder to teleport untold distances and generate bridges for walking on. Out of all the 600cp weapons, this one can hit with the most force. When thrown, the axe can home in on its prey before returning to the hand of its master. However, it does not have the worthiness enhancement, so anyone can wield it. Beware, for a cunning opponent could turn the axe against you. But they’d do well to fear you - for you now wield what could quite possibly be the most powerful weapon in the universe."
2097,,600,Thunderbolt,Thor: Love and Thunder,Making,"Zeus’ iconic weapon, known to some as the Master Bolt. In another universe, it is said to be the most powerful weapon in the universe, and its theft nearly results in a civil war between the gods of Olympus and Tartarus until the crisis is averted by two 12-year-olds and a satyr. Thunderbolt is a javelin shaped like a bolt of lightning. Unlike the other 600cp weapons you’ll find below, it does not enhance the physical abilities of the owner. The bolt bestows its wielder with powers over the storm, generating and controlling lightning as they please. When thrown, it can be recalled to its user's hand, and it allows for flight, teleportation, and can split itself into smaller versions of itself for dual wielding and reunite when needed to. Lastly, I’ll throw in an upgrade for free, because otherwise Thunderbolt seems like the lamest of the weapons. This weapon is effectively imbued with the perk The Power of Jumper and can transfer its power to various other hosts."
2098,,600,Gungnir,Thor: Love and Thunder,Making,"Want something even cooler than the laser rifle? Look no further. Since Asgard was destroyed, you can take their symbol of rulership. Gungnir, spear of kings. The spear is supremely sharp and durable, as fit for royalty. It can summon the Bifrost and has been infused with the late king Odin’s power - the Odinforce. This allows it to fire energy blasts capable of injuring even the strongest of the nine realms. Since you now hold this spear, an ancient automaton seems to have pulled itself back together to fight again, now in your name. The Asgardian Destroyer now serves you. Never mind that it got turned into a gun. The destroyer is a colossal beast of metal, standing at about eight and a half feet tall and able to smack around Asgardians like tennis balls, though it falls short of the power of the gods. It can also use the Odinforce offensively, this time in the form of discharges from the faceplate. You control this automaton as easily as your own body and can scry through the automaton and perceive things through its senses. Now, a word of warning. Don’t show these - both the spear and the automaton - to the Asgardians. They’ll think they rightfully belong to them. Which, I guess, is true."
2099,,600,Mysterious Bangle,She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Making,"This is quite the family heirloom, Jumper. Though it appears to be an ordinary piece of jewelry, this piece of otherworldly technology is designed to channel energy from the Noor dimension. While this near-mystical energy passively benefits you by slowing your aging and strengthening your body, it can also be actively used to shape the world around you. A novice may manage to create simple hard light constructs while more advanced users can summon armor and weapons to their person. Even greater workings may be possible while wearing this focus. As a final benefit, this artifact has the ability to awaken latent abilities in its wearer. Whether you're a mutant, magician, or another oddity, you may unlock more than you expected when you put on this bangle."
2100,,600,Scarlet Scarab,Moon Knight,Making,"The Suit of a Little Scarab herself for when she became the Avatar of the Goddess Taweret. The Suits Wings are extremely durable, able to let you fly, shield you from damage and even send it back at the attacker, while also serving as bladed weapons."
2101,,600,Khonsu’s Armor ,Moon Knight,Making,"The ceremonial armour of Khonsu, granting the wielder a powerful healing factor and letting them use the crescent on the chest as an infinite source of projectiles. Can come in the form of a fancy suit and matching truncheons as well."
2102,,600,Embers of Genesis,Marvel: What If...?,Making,"These strange glowing flakes are actually interstellar dust collected from an ancient supernova. The embers contain enough nutrients and essential building blocks to turn a barren planet into a garden world with just a touch. A few measly shavings were enough to bury Knowhere in vines and vegetation. The vial you now own could transform dozens of full-sized planets into overflowing greenhouses, ending hunger on a galactic scale. Someone more scientifically minded could apply the incredible potential of these particles in even more amazing ways. Just be sure not to swallow any. This vial will refill at the start of each Jump."
2103,,600,Poseidon’s Trident ,Marvel Noir,Making,"This is a towering statue of Poseidon of Atlantean design. The statue is ultimately rather mundane, and so too is the trident in its hand. But not so much the head of the trident. The trident’s head is made of pure orichalcum, a three pronged piece of it about the size of a man. Orichalcum is an immensely powerful power amplification, one which at the bottom of the sea could create electrical irregularities for miles around, with a single volt battery create an electrical display which fills the air, power a (1930s) city on a 12 volt battery, turn the last dregs of power in a suit of powered armor into an electrical storm capable of wiping out a fleet of airships, or in the right situation create an electrical storm so powerful a vortex manifests which sinks an entire island nation.

It’s only fair to note that this trident both created and destroyed the civilization of Atlantis, though since you’re paying so much for it you possess the ability to render the orichalcum’s energy amplification inert with a touch or active once more.

If you have somehow used up the orichalcum of the trident’s head, it will be replaced at the start of each jump. Similarly the statue will be repaired/replaced at the start of each jump."
2104,,600,The Hammer,Heroes Reborn,Making,"Mjolnir, the Hammer of Thor, or something close to it. This doesn’t have to be a hammer, it can be another form of melee weapon if you would prefer. What matters is less the shape and more what it is. Made of an element nowhere on the periodic table, this weapon cannot be lifted by any other than yourself, and will come to your hand when called no matter the barriers that lay between it and you. This weapon can also be ‘hurled’ in front of you to allow you to fly at great speeds, pulled along behind it, and regardless of the design of the weapon you will find that it makes an excellent thrown weapon striking where you want it to, instead of somewhere else. Of course you’d not be wrong to expect more than that from the weapon of a god. The weapon is an excellent conduit for any energies you are able to project, amplifying them further and refining your control, and even if you can’t project any energies on your own, it allows you to call down the thunder like a god of it, lightning bolts strong enough to stun the Hulk, crater the ground, or destroy a building. It can also manipulate outside energies, deflecting energy beams of others - or in the right situations reflecting them - draining energy away, and generally working as a conduit to manipulate energy."
2105,,600,Hammer of the Old Gods ,Amalgam Comics,Making,"A hammer from before Ragnarok, wielded by an unknown warrior god before Highfather Odin used it to revive Thorion. Whoever holds this hammer, if they are worthy or paid cp, shall possess the power of the Astro-Force."
2106,,600,Sorcerous Regalia,Amalgam Comics,Making,"A collection of mystic artifacts of vast power, beginning with a cape that lets you fly and protects you from most spells. The helm of Nabu the Ancient One, and the All-Seeing Eye of Agamotto. Even the most mundane and boring person in the world could learn to be a master of the mystic arts with these tools and this teacher."
2107,,600,Godly Weapon,Avengers Vs X-Men,Making,"Divine power shines in your hand now, in the form of a grand weapon that few others ever get to hold. Like the Mighty Thor and his hammer Mjolnir, a weapon of power has been granted to you. The form this weapon takes is decided by you now but possessing the weapon, like Mjolnir itself, will grant you the powers of a god on the level of Thor himself. Whether it is power over an element of nature or something stranger, the weapon will endow you with incredible physical powers, flight, a host of minor abilities and immense control over a domain of your choice, such as storms or war. You may import an existing weapon or tool into this option."
2108,,600,Soul Gem,Marvel Cosmic,Making,"The Soul Gem is another of the vaunted Infinity Stones. It is sentient and desires the collection of souls. It gives its user great power over the souls of others. It allows one to peer into other people’s souls, trap souls within a Soul World contained in the gem therefore allowing access to the memories and skills of those trapped. The gem can circulate the powers of life and death over entire worlds, give its user control over any life regardless of sentience, and protects its user from soul based attacks. It is empowered if its user is in possession of the Reality Stone and in turn empowers the Mind Stone. Is usually green or yellow."
2109,,600,Artificial Cosmic Cube,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Making,"A failed attempt at creating a Cosmic Cube; unfortunately, not a shred of power that went into creating this cube remains. However, the potential for power is still there. Essentially, this cube is a currently empty, unlimited, battery. While it is empty now you can keep charging it with power for as long as you have power to supply it with."
2110,,600,Nine-Realms Craftsman,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Making,"You have the skill to create wonders; not only those of technology, but of magic as well. You’re a skilled enchanter, capable of creating armor and weaponry that withstands the ages and never dulls or breaks; your skill is such that you can permanently enchant Uru safely, which would allow you to create weapons like Mjolnir or Stormbreaker. You’re even capable of enchanting machinery; granting them similar magical effects, and more. Even without magic, your crafts are of quality worthy of the gods, and the quality of all of your future creations will be increased greatly. Post-Spark, your ability to create wonders will increase; weaponry that would allow one to go toe to toe with cosmic beings and bridges that span the worlds you’ve visited; with time, there’s very little you couldn’t create."
2111,,600,Magical Mona Lisa,Fate/Zero,Making,"The pinnacle of one of your chosen magical specialisations or at the very least, it is such for the foreseeable future. This powerful artefact has found its way into your possession and is an example of how far a modern magus can really go with effort and the right stuff. Lord El-Melloi’s Volumen Hydrangyrum is a lesser example of what this would offer you, your version of the same artefact would be fully aware and self-sufficient, acting with unnatural intelligence to predict and act in the best way to serve you. Whatever you chose to gain, studying it will greatly accelerate your own learning in the areas of magecraft that were used to create it, until the point that you can replicate the artefact’s creation on your own.This can be imported into."
2112,,600,Code Creator,Fate/Zero,Making,"Many Magi rarely move beyond their own field of focus when crafting items imbued with magical power. What reason would there be when they could simply pay for another Magi to make something if they absolutely needed it? You’re one of these skilled experts that others come to. Obviously in your chosen field, you’re one of the great masters in creating magical items, such that something like Volumen Hydrargyrum wouldn’t be hard at all, but even when it comes to fields of magic you have no knowledge in at all you can get surprising results. So long as someone with the requisite knowledge is nearby and willing, you can draw on their knowledge of the subject as you work, effectively combining your skills with their knowledge to become a master craftsman in fields that you have no knowledge of. 

Boosted: The sorts of things you can draw from those assisting you or willing to offer help has grown beyond just skills, now including abilities and powers that you yourself do not possess or possess at a much lesser level. Whilst you may only use them when you are crafting something and with their permission, you can use any skill, ability, spell or power that they have alongside what you yourself possess to bring your crafting even further beyond what you are normally capable of. 

Boost Requires Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant to Activate"
2113,,600,"Old Dog, Strange Tricks",Fate/Zero,Making,"You’re perfectly aware what more modern mages think when they see your refusal to use technology of the current era. You don’t even need to see their faces to know the disdain they have for tradition. That’s alright. You know that their technology isn’t needed, because you can already match it with magic. Not to say you can just cast Missile or chant up a Microwave. Rather, you create mechanisms that run on magical energy, rather than whatever force powered the base you are working with. These magical machines require a great deal of magical knowledge to create and roughly the same effort and materials as a mundane variant would but are powered solely by magical energy, no matter what originally powered the machines you are recreating.

Boosted: You may now replicate the effects of technology in your spells, rather than just as recreated items. This is a far more costly venture, taking several times the amount of energy it would take to create the same effect as if you used the perks normal ability to make a machine running on magic to do it, but it is possible to now do instantly and without requiring prior preparation or materials. 

Boost Requires Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant to Activate"
2114,,600,Original MK,Fate/Zero,Making,"All people possess an Origin, a concept that lies at the very core of their being and what your Origin takes form as is up to you, though it should take the form of a single word that describes specific concept related to your being. You may also pay an additional 100cp to gain a second Origin word, which has all the effects of the following applied to it. Unlike most people though, you’ve learned to take full advantage of that Origin. Whatever you choose your Origin to be, you are immensely skilled in creating magical items and mystic codes based around that concept. These can range from simple, such as a Fire Origin allowing you to create explosives capable of tearing down large buildings, to the esoteric, such as a Severance/Binding dual Origin allowing one to create bullets that can disrupt and destroy a Magus’ ability to generate and channel magic, potentially crippling it entirely. You also gain the ability to tell at a glance the Origins of other people, this translating into insight into their character that you can use against them.

Boosted: You may now include your Element in the original effects of the perk. Elements work similarly to Origins, but instead dictate the general alignment of a mage. In practice, you may repeat the process of choosing an Origin to gain another concept with which you can create impressive magical items with. Stacking the same concept twice is possible and brings you to the verge of Noble Phantasm quality items in your work. This also extends to the empathic effect, allowing you to recognise the Elements of others on sight and increasing the innate understanding you gain of other beings.

Boost Requires Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant to Activate"
2115,,600,Mystic Code Crafter,Fate,Making,"You have a wealth of experience with crafting these grand artifacts, and you skill is unmatched among the modern world. With enough study, you could recreate the anti-magic bullets used by Kiritsugu or even the Volumen Hydrangium. With research you can even begin to make your own Mystic Codes, possibly with even more power then these have."
2116,,600,Alchemist’s Brews,Darkest Dungeon ,Making,"“Finally the serum is working, and the side-ef ects are… manageable.” Among the Ancestor’s pursuits in his quest for ultimate knowledge was the study of alchemy. The transmutation of materials and the creation of tonics to bolster mortal flesh- or melt it away like so much putrid meat- is valuable. As a fellow student your knowledge pales in comparison to what he learned before his demise, but you may still make use of it. You are capable of creating noxious liquids and gasses that melt and poison in equal measure, as well as a variety of substances that explode into bright flashes of light to stun. You also have a few recipes which can be used to aid your allies, such as an invigorating tincture that increases strength and speed for a while, and a sort of cure-all that heals cuts and poisons and restores a bit of vitality- though diseases of the mind are not so easily healed. By experimenting you may be able to create new and interesting weapons and medicines with your knowledge of alchemy; and there are doubtlessly tomes to learn from and interesting subjects you can dissect to expand your understanding of the world… perhaps with time even the creation of homunculi or monstrosities of your own will be withing your grasp."
2117,,600,Devil in the Details ,Bayonetta,Making,"A weapon is not a mere tool. It is not some piece of metal or material to be used and abused, to be simply discarded. It is the expression of a self's whims. Their lust. Their views on a battle and their views on death. You must learn a great deal about a person and spend a tremendous amount of time longer than usual to craft their weapon, to say nothing of the absurd material quality required. But if you do... the synergy between weapon and wielder increases their combat prowess and the effectiveness of their powers a significant amount. It might even grant them lesser, beneficial abilities while they wield it, if it's just right…"
2118,,600,Kinsmen of Claw,Ragna Crimson,Making,"The Bloodline of Claws is not one necessarily made out of dragons descended from their Monarch, the Severing Dragon Gilzea, but instead they are made out of those she picks as her disciples, be they human or dragon. Considering that the mere presence of Gilzea is enough to paralyze even high dragons with fears, merely joining her Bloodline is quite the feat. And not only did you join and learned her martial arts, but you managed to pass with flying colors, making Gilzea herself recognize you as one of her Kinsmen of Claws. This means that, whatever your race is, you are clearly one of the strongest individuals in this world, with a personal might that approaches that of the Second Seats of the Bloodlines at the very least. And that it is without taking into account any other magics that you may have.

There is a second boon to be gained from this: you have gained one Gilzea’s Claws. Whether you took it from another member in combat or she crafted it for you, this demonic weapon that you can call at your side at any time is one of tremendous power, for it grows alongside you, always making you stronger while you wield it, as well as being a perfect channel for your abilities."
2119,,600,Legend-to-be armor,Shovel Knight ,Making,"You gain a new set of armor, or apply it to an armor you already own. This set will be very well created and will be associated with you by whoever sees it. It will inspire on the battlefield, and, if you're clever, may be used to send messages."
2120,,600,Soulbound Relics,Super Dragon Sword,Making,"Old treasures from the old world, these Soulbound Weapons are one of the few tools available to outsiders like you. You start with two Relics that act as Job Stones, each of which has every perk of those Jobs and Mastery of those Jobs. The passing of the age has left their mutating nature to the annals of history, but when they see enough battle, these Soulbound Relics may occasionally create a “juvenile” version that grows to the power of its parent Relic as it sees combat."
2121,,600,Dancing with the Devil,Super Dragon Sword,Making,You were granted the most prized and coveted treasures of the old gods in order to enforce their will. You gain 3 Job Stones and 1500 Job Points to spend on Job Perks.
2122,,600,Light up the Night,Super Dragon Sword,Making,"Irreplaceable treasures granted from the depths of Neo Serannia, you are in possession of two Job Stones and 1000 JP to spend on Job Perks. In addition, you are capable of creating new Job stones from the hearts/essences of Gods you slay. These Job Stones are often themed after what the God was known for. They start at the weakest level (a single 100-point Job Perk) and require the blood/essence of divine creatures to advance."
2123,,600,Chrono Navigator ,Ben 10,Making,"Upwards and backwards is time is all good, but what about different dimensions? Alternate universes? Different outcomes stretching out like branches on a tree, all for you to explore? This is the answer. In the shape of either a pocket watch or a metal gauntlet (your choice), this is an extremely powerful device that acts as a GPS for the rest of the multiverse. 

Not only can you travel forwards and backwards in time to the precise moments you wish to be present at, you can enter branching timelines where events in a universe unfolded very differently. This isn’t quite ‘any possible universe’ but ‘any probable universe’...perhaps the Omnitrix wasn’t invented or Max Tennyson died shortly before Ben acquired it. Small variables that branch off into new possibilities, nothing too outlandish or outright impossible for a given universe. So long as that criteria is met? You can go there."
2124,,600,Master Craftsman ,King Arthur ,Making,"Thanks to being taught by faeries anything you make by hand is a great deal better than anything regular human can make. Armor is nearly indestructible and lighter than it should be, blades are sharper, blunt weapons have more force behind them, bows and crossbows can shoot farther and are easier to pull back. Even mundane items like baskets work better, though you can't give items mystical powers without being a wizard or something."
2125,,600,Hades’ Vault Coupon(600) ,Dresden Files,Making,"The Vault of Hades is quite possibly the greatest treasure trove in existence. And now you have access to it, in the form of a single coupon, which can be exchanged for one or more items from the death god’s collections.

For 600 CP, on the other hand, the Good Stuff is on offer for you. The items here are among the greatest in the world, things like the Christ Artifacts, the personal symbols of powers of some gods, magical WMDs... the items you can get here are truly mighty, on a scale that has to be seen and withstood to be believed.

Both levels come with virtually unlimited access to all kinds of precious metals and stones, because of course they do. This is the Vault of Hades."
2126,,600,"""Soul Transposition""",Dark Souls 3,Making,"Soul Transposition, the process of extracting and coalescing the essence of a soul with the aid of a Transposition Kiln. You are well versed with this forbidden art, and those who would inhibit your use of it are dead or far. Soul Transposition in basic terms allows you to take an especially powerful or twisted soul and shape them into useful items. Powerful weaponry, jewelry that bestows special abilities or a scroll with instructions to learn some form of magic are the more common results. What you can make with a soul is related to the former owner in some way, whether it's based on an ability they had, significant items in their memory or past and so on."
2127,,600,“Blue Eye”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"Blades of the Dark Moon resemble blue phantoms when invading other worlds and meting out justice. Tis good that you may appear this way as you will, for the guilty may lurk around every corner, you would do well to be prepared. You may appear as a spirit of vengeance, cloaked in blue aura that hides your identity and causes you to resemble a phantom. In this form, your magical might is greatly enhanced, causing any spells you cast to be far more potent than usual. Additionally, any weapon you put your hands on is cloaked in the same dark blue energy as the rest of your body, greatly empowered by magic that assures enemies that don’t have some form of protection against it will suffer. When purchased with Grand Delusions, your illusions will be empowered like any other spells in this form, allowing you to shape larger illusions or illusions that are much more substantial. This allows you to actually create minions that pose credible threats to those who challenge you."
2128,,600,“Red Eye”,Dark Souls 1,Making,"Kaathe bestows the Red Eye Orb to his Dark Wraiths, allowing them to take the guide of a red phantom in other worlds for their hunting leisure. How appropriate then that you are able to take this form to perform Kaathe’s ultimate teaching, Lifedrain. On purchase, you acquire the ability to wrap yourself in a cloak of red energy that leaves your appearance hazy and intimidating. One that causes you to appear as a phantom. In this form, you have the ability to blanket the area around you with darkness, which you blend into with unnerving ease. This allows you to hide within plain sight, essentially. More importantly is Lifedrain, the ability to suck the humanity and lifeforce out of your victim after grabbing them, and absorbing it into yourself. The longer you keep your stranglehold, the more you suck out, but the process itself is tiresome. When purchased with Dark Hand, the black energy used to enhance your melee attacks grows stronger and becomes transferrable to melee weapons within your grip."
2129,,600,Charm of Fire & Terror ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making,"Two talismans, one orange with the “炎” for flame, the other the “怖” for terror. When rubbing these talismans on to your weapons, you can imbue one with fire and the other with the ability to inflict terror into your enemies. The backside of these talismans is adhesive and so long as they are on your person, you will be immune to fire and fear."
2130,,600,Gourd of Rejuvenating Waters,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making,"A gourd infinitely producing the immortalizing rejuvenating waters. You can use this to replenish yourself at the risk of feeding your immortal centipede, or you can share in your curse with others to make them immortal undead such as you."
2131,,600,Petrified Lightning,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making,"A green crystalline branching sword made of fulgurite. This allows one to harness and manipulate the very wind, to call upon storms and tornados. You can use this sword to manipulate the various elements such as the wind, water, and electricity. With enough practice, you can even manipulate air pressure to create tornado storms."
2132,,600,Charm of Lightning,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Making,"A palm-sized talisman with the character “雷” written on it. The back of it is adhesive. When you rub this talisman on your weapon, it will produce and channel lightning. While touching the talisman, you are immune to any and all electricity."
2133,,600,Storm Ruler,Demon's Souls,Making,A powerful weapon: when swung the very wind will tear asunder your foes. You require no ancestral spirits nor a monolith forest to have its full power. Perhaps with time you can do much more? You may instead apply Storm Ruler’s power to any melee weapon you currently have.
2134,,600,Soulcraft,Demon's Souls,Making,"With the souls of strong opponents, you may forge great weapons and armor out of them. Of course you can craft with lesser souls but the product won’t be that great. The weaker souls can only be used to upgrade things instead. You instinctively understand how to use any thing you made."
2135,,600,Grafted Grotesquery,Elden Ring,Making,"Oho, are you as much a trueborn heir as Godrick himself then? For it seems your body is unnaturally receptive to all manner of modification both surgical and mystical-as well as terrifically resilient to all manner of invasive surgery. Neither blood loss nor poisoning will phase you when grafting the severed arms of strangers to your person, and the bloodletting needed to power certain blood magic-based fighting arts will be as a nosebleed to you where it would direly cost most others. It would still be wise not to push this too hard-Godrick had at least a smidgen of divine power before shoving his stump into a dragon’s neck after all-but on top of that you’re extremely gifted in the surgical procedures and techniques of grafting that have allowed both Godrick and his grafted scions to be terrors on the battlefield despite their ungainly appearances. Your highly limited yet potent magical gift on top of your battlefield surgical skills makes you well-versed in conducting grafts on both yourself and others, whether to “enhance” a “friend” into a grafted monstrosity or to bind the maw of a legendary monster onto your body- and have it retain some semblance of life while under your command.

This also makes you extremely good at keeping people alive through the most grievous of wounds, if for whatever reason you see something morally aberrant with mutilating the dead for a questionable increase in power."
2136,,600,Horcrux,Harry Potter,Making,An object imbued with part of your soul. You cannot be killed entirely unless it is destroyed. Mundane object of your choice.
2137,,600,Tomb of a Rose,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"A stone coffin with a sacred prize within: The preserved body of a saint of the Dusk Legion. Their body works off the principles of “Venerable of the Dusk”, and in life they had the unique and mighty power to gain magical and physical strength from death occurring around them until the sun set or dawned next - a power their relics imbue into whoever holds them.

And with a preserved body...that’s quite a few relics to make, though one may notice that this is not exactly the Dusk Rose herself, but a very convincing “fake” - perhaps a cunning priest’s daughter, or a body double for the venerable saint. The very land is charged with dark mana, useful for a necromancer. "
2138,,600,Secrets of the Golden City,MtG - Ixalan,Making,"The secrets of Orazca sing to you. Though it’s basic at first, the knowledge to create the venerable defenses and great magical constructs that survive for untold eras - from traps that reset to autonomous golden guardians - have been given to you. While you require materials and other knowledge in order to match the majester of the Santum of the Sun - such as other magical arts or scientific knowledge - this alone would allow you to make rather fearsome sanctums out of any adventure story as well as the treasures held within. If you were to know the true depths of Sparks, one could even replicate the creation of the Immortal Sun… "
2139,,600,Wishclaw Talisman,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making,"They say to be careful for what you wish for, as you might just get it. This talisman was created as an object lesson in the wishful, greedy nature of humanity by a particularly nasty witch - a monkey’s paw that can be wished upon and use its great power to grant the wish, being capable of using any ability on the Fae or Realm list to accomplish these goals, and even the creation of items similar to the ones in this item section as part of this. The only catch is that the Talisman is sentient, able to judge the nature of these wishes, and after every wish it will find a new master somewhere in the world to serve, vanishing from sight. The nature of the master they find is based on their previous master’s wish - a wicked selfish wish sends it to someone who will retaliate against that evil, while a sweet or normal wish finds another master with a good heart. This wishing artifact could either cause a plague of darkness across the land, or a run of good fortune and goodwill to all of Eldraine...the Witch’s test has begun, Jumper."
2140,,600,Irencrag Shard,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making,"The Irencrag’s heat and endurance is legendary, a massive dark stone, and with its great stores of fae magic can even bless the weapons of those who show great courage in striking it and then removing their blade as it heats in their very hands. This is a much smaller shard of the stone, only about the size of an anvil, but it still carries the power of the Irencrag with it. 

Much like the Irencrag, it is capable of testing prospective knights, and granting them the power of the “Knight of Embereth”, and in addition, if you were to leave a blade here for long enough, you could easily ensure that it became a powerful flaming blade, a named weapon worthy of a hero."
2141,,600,Fires Of Invention,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Making,"While the Knights of the realm quest, defeat all evils, and right all wrongs, there are those who find their calling in an equally important place of the Realm - the brilliant creators of treasures and weapons that shake the realm. Your mastery of magic and craftsmanship is such you could make wandering castles, stone serpents that ‘drink’ magic, or the servant gargoyles and servitors that act as guardians to the various lords and ladies and their keeps."
2142,,600,Mana Mastery ,MtG - Shandalar,Making,"There are many artifacts of fame, beauty, and exquisite craftsmanship... but the most well-known of all each had a single purpose - to provide unmatched raw power to those who mastered their intricacies. From the magnificent jewels known as the Moxes to the near-mythical might of a Black Lotus, a master Artificer can draw upon arcane power with a speed and efficiency unmatched by near any other mage. Now, you are a savant in the field of creating artifacts to generate, manipulate, or alter the flow of power. Whether it is creating alternative sources of mana such as those mentioned before, storing it for later use in powerful capacitors or vaults, or even converting other forms of energy into one or more types of mana (or the reverse), your mind is filled with ways to manipulate the energies of the cosmos through the items you craft."
2143,,600,Isochron Scepter,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"A metallic scepter created long before the surfacing of the Phyrexian forces, it was made to allow weak spells to be imprinted upon it, to be easily cast at a later time. Using it, once per day you may imprint a spell you know, so long as it is not very resource or mana intensive- in the case of spells which run on a different system, such as vancian magic, or need specific reagents, enough of those for a simple cast need to be provided to create an imprint- which will then allow the scepter itself to be used. For a token expenditure of mana or another power source, no matter the color, the spell may be cast from the rod, without a limit to the number of times it can be used, only having a recharging time of 5 minutes."
2144,,600,A Box Full Of Mirrors,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making,"A very very long time ago, a despicable Soratami once said “only in mirrors do heroes find their equals”. The phrase, while apt, is undermined by the fact that he was scum. Still, over the past thousand years one of his prized possessions, a gallery full of mirrors, has been added to, taken from, and refined over and over again until we reach this. This box has two powers. The first is that it empowers anything that can be said to be unique, be it the current reigning emperor, a planeswalker, or a Kami and their shrine. The second is that it emits a unique aura, that modifies the summoning magic that many planeswalkers make use of and allows them to summon supposedly unique artifacts and such to their side without compromising the spells integrity in the usual manner that summoning two versions of the same legendary artifact normally would. If you intend to make use of such a means of summoning, then this box would be an invaluable thing - I should mention it works on other attempts at duplicating things in this manner, but that is merely the most apt example. Another use might simply be if you intend to be greedy and build a dozen versions of your own Shrine."
2145,,600,"Aoi, The Kami Of Jumps ",MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Making,"Two years ago, the Emperor was attacked by a man with a metal arm, and her damaged Spark ignited, sending her careening off into the Blind Eternities with no way to control her fall. At the same time, a very special Kami was born from a cast off portion of her Spark, one that would eventually become the Kami of Planeswalking. Your entrance into this world has caused the birth of a similar Kami, a ghostly blue ball of energy contained within a raven construct. For now, it serves as your familiar, able to shift its form into a mask or a simple weapon, as well as spy upon others for you. It’s true power however, is you - on the first day of each jump, you may opt to cast off a number of your powers and abilities, which will then be absorbed into the Aoi. At that point, anybody who wears the mask Aoi turns into will gain these powers until another wears the mask. Any natural talent they possess that is aligned with the borrowed power will cause them to rapidly grow in skill and possibly even keep some of them once they lose access to the mask, or you take it away from them. Oh, and don’t worry about losing these powers forever - you’ll get them back on the next jump, at which point you can make this choice all over again."
2146,,600,Crown of the 3 Day King/Queen,MtG - Innistrad,Making,"A crown inspired by the court of the 3 day king holiday. A form of celebration by the Voldaren vampires, where a human is kidnapped and crowned king. Then served the finest of wine and food, while vampires wait on them obeying any orders that will not harm them or allow the ruler to escape or abdicate. At the end of the three days, the vampires collectively feast on the victim who has spent 3 days in terror awaiting this. The crown when worn induces paralyzing fear in its wearer, rendering them unable to think coherently enough to escape or fight back. It cannot be removed by the wearer for three days once it has been placed."
2147,,600,My Masterpiece ,MtG - Innistrad,Making,"The madmen in their labs occasionally come out with what they call a masterpiece, and the rest of the world runs from screaming. Notes recovered from the labs of men such as these point towards a mixture between obsession, inspiration, and madness. Like children they will have a ridiculous idea. ""I want to have a giant lizard, I want to be a bug, I want to stitch these corpses together."" The trouble is that they’re too smart to let little things like impossibility stop them, and too dumb to let the idea rest. They seem to be able to trigger bouts of obsessive research, I’d almost swear a giest had them. then turn that obsession into tangible results far beyond what they should have been able to do with what they were given producing the occasional project years or decades in advance of all the other things they’re working on. What we recover from the laboratories makes me wonder what they could have done, if they weren’t born mad, and put that determination to something useful. Rather that inventing a tube, and playing with lizard eggs until they finally get eaten by the 15ft horror they were trying to create."
2148,,600,Lifeless Legion ,Warbreaker,Making,"Ten thousand Lifeless, obedient to you and anyone you share your custom trigger phrase with. They’re not all fantastic soldiers, but fear and pain and exhaustion are unknown to them."
2149,,600,Lord Jumper’s Armor,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making,"You can infuse copies of your abilities into objects, turning them into focuses for those powers. Using these focuses in concert with the original power within your body will see your might with these abilities enhanced dramatically. Alternatively, you could loan these items to allies and subordinates to grant them access to these powers. Objects that you infuse with your power are also infused with your will. This allows them to act independently to enact your will, and enables them to refuse others the right to use the power they grant. You may only create one focus per power, and a destroyed, the power flows back into you, and you can create a new focus for it.

Boosted: Your power has risen to new heights in a number of different ways. Firstly, you are capable of creating multiple focuses for the same ability with no loss in their overall power level, and using the same item as a focus for more than a single ability. The true strength of this ability, however, is that each and every one of your powers has become a semi-sentient being of its own, a kind of pseudo-consciousness based on your will attached to the ability. These consciousnesses are aligned with you in terms of morality and intent, and can add their force of will to yours. When you work in concert with them, your precision, control, and raw power output increase without any additional exertion on your part. Furthermore, in the event that you are incapacitated in some fashion, these consciousnesses can take control of your body, wielding the power they are attached to in order to protect your body until you return. Alternatively, you could grant your powers control of your body while you fully devote your mind to other tasks. Because of this boost, you may choose to make your focuses tangible avatars of your individual powers, turning them from semi-sentient objects to fully sapient ones. These conscious powers will not manifest as whispering voices in the back of your head unless you want them to.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
2150,,600,Doll ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Making,"The Magicians of this world have a reputation for being rather fragile, and it’s one that’s not entirely undeserved. After all, they don’t tend to be the most physically fit of folk, and the average spellcaster’s Borg can be broken by a strong enough spear thrust. The members of Al-Thamen, however, have come up with a way to compensate for this weakness: Instead of fighting in person, they just send a puppet with all their abilities out instead. Perhaps you used to be a member of this organisation, perhaps you still are, but the result in the same: You, too, have learned of this technique.

By crafting a detailed matryoshka doll shaped to resemble you and filling it with copious amounts of Magoi, you can cause that doll to grow until it becomes a simulacrum completely physically indistinguishable from you. The more time you spend imbuing the doll with your magic, the closer it will come to matching your abilities. The simplest simulacra require about a month, but only replicate your appearance, knowledge, and personality – effectively a convincing body double.

More complex simulacra capable of using your supernatural abilities take more time to create, eventually matching your own level of power after a year’s effort. These simulacra are guaranteed to be completely loyal to you and can either act independently on your behalf or be remotely puppeteered by you, allowing you to remain in safety while the doll does your dirty work. If one of these simulacra are killed, their body evaporates to leave only the original matryoshka doll behind. If this doll is left intact, you can quite easily feed it more Magoi to resurrect the simulacrum in a mere fraction of the time it took to originally create it, requiring at most a day."
2151,,600,Magic Tool Creator,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Making,"So far, the use of Magic Tools – items enchanted by Magoi to produce magical effects when used even by normal people – has not become particularly widespread. As of the present, the only way to obtain one is by plundering a Dungeon, since no modern Magician knows how to create them themselves... None, that is, except for you. You seem to be ahead of the rest of the world by at least a decade, for you have figured out how to create a wide variety of useful Magic Tools: flying carpets, orbs which allow for long-distance communication, cannons that shoot giant serrated shards of ice, gems that can seal one’s magical abilities, and far more.

Even if you don’t happen to be a Magician in this world, you’ll find that the process of creating Magic Tools can be applied to the magic of other worlds as well. Through this, you can enchant items to replicate the effects of any spell you know though, of course, more powerful effects will require greater lengths of time and energy in the crafting process."
2152,,600,Smelting Experiment,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Making,"All right, here we go. You’re in the big leagues now. A smetling experiment is quite frankly a ludicrous idea. That the laws of nature will not allow for a particular outcome, so instead you will forge your lifes’ work outside of reality itself, in the Boundary. Sometimes this also involves an attempt to reach the Blue, or instill a fragment of it into your experiment. Skipping all the technical terms and confusion, you are now knowledgeable on the creation of artificial humans, something that will come to be known as the murakumo units. In some ways, this is an attempt to combine a body with a weapon. In others, it’s an attempt to bypass the Boundary by making a person made from it. For you? It means the creation of artificial human that are empowered by, and resistant to, whatever you made them from. Or, if you fuck it up on purpose, it means another Black Beast."
2153,,600,Divine Blade,Campione,Making,"A Divine ‘sword’ whose legend has grew enough to be considered a minor god or demigod all on its own. At its basest, it has the ability to empower its user, cut through spells, negate or penetrate magical effects and powers and lift or cancel curses. It also contains greater power than any magical weapon. You won’t need Advent Magic to use it. Depending on the weapon you choose and its legend, other effects and even Authorities may be used."
2154,,600,Lance of Longinus,Campione,Making,"The name is a bit of a misnomer, really. This weapon here has a curious ability, namely, its capable of penetrating all magical defenses as if they were paper as well as being able to target and damage the ‘soul’ of those in its path. For some this ability wouldn’t matter much, but the Authorities wielded by the Campiones are tied to their souls and a good hit from this blade could seriously cripple them. Aside from that, I’m sure you can see the uses of a weapon capable of striking souls and no sell magic."
2155,,600,Fancy Chains,Campione,Making,"This is a plain-looking circlet imbued with Keeper of the Horses, a powerful ancient spell that allows the user to subdue an unruly god by placing it around their head. It will paralyze the god and seal off their divinity, making them as dangerous as a baby while the effect is on. The effects aren’t eternal and the circlet can be taken off by another under certain circumstances, but it can be  used to gain advantage in some cases."
2156,,600,Tome of Prometheus,Campione,Making,"A Grimoire that has the power of Theft, granting it the ability to steal the Authorities of any God, to then be used by the Grimoire's wielder. However, if the stolen Authority is used by a normal human, the effect would be devastating, most likely killing them. This power is born from the myth of Prometheus stealing fire from the gods to grant it to humans and it requires that the user knows enough about the god whom they are trying to steal the power from."
2157,,600,Watery Reflections of the Heavens Above,Fate/Extra CCC,Making,"The Imperial Regalia of Japan number three; the sword, the jewel, and the mirror. And it seems that you’ve come to obtain one of them, somehow. Representing wisdom, this ornate mirror is perhaps one of the most useful and yet indirect of the three regalia, depending on your own abilities. As you are now, even as a high rank Servant, you’ll only be able to utilize a fraction of its power, allowing you effectively endless magical energy for some time once activated. In truth, it is a treasure from the land of the dead, an Authority that harvests the idea of reconstruction of a destroyed dominion, to manifest it into reality.

While using its full function as a normal Servant, even that of high rank, would kill you in mere seconds, should you find some way to upgrade your Matrix beyond that normally allowed by the Moon Cell, you’d be able to utilize it for longer. Beyond its base effect mentioned above, it could be used to isolate the principles of the afterlife, bringing the dead back to life, and revitalizing the soul and life force of anything alive to peak form, with an effective range of a whole country. Perhaps you’d be able to focus all that energy into a devastating attack as well? All that aside, perhaps you should try coming up with a very convincing excuse for why you have this."
2158,,600,Tool Creation,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making,"The ability to make and alter tools at an astonishing level. Designing and crafting magical tools of
exceptional power is easy, from potions to magical weapons to siege engines, and even creating
non-magical implements that can accomplish magical effects at a lower level is entirely possible. You
could with time, design and create some of the greatest weapons wielded by heroes in this age, provided you find the tools and resources you’d need to do it. Your talents lie particularly towards
weapons of destruction and war, as your inventions in that area seem to end up having far more
power, lethality and effectiveness than you had expected from what you designed. Lastly, when
forced to spend time amongst other living beings, you also find that your capabilities with tools can
be applied in certain ways to living beings, letting you trick and manipulate other people to do what
you want with quite a high degree of skill. "
2159,,600,Jumper’s Box,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Making ,"How odd. A massive black cube floats in front of you, twinkling as little lights appear and disappear
within it’s inky depths. It feels quite familiar to you. There are legends of a particular box, the one
that Pandora opened thousands of years ago and released awful things into the world, but this cube
doesn’t feel right for being that one. It feels too much a part of you. 

As Pandora had her box, so too do you have your own and it’s something of a special box. The box
moves to your will and is always by your side should you wish it, even shrinking down to fit in your hand when you desire. For others, most of what is contained inside are curses but you might see
them as blessings. The cube can spew out mud in enormous floods, somewhat similar to that
created by Angra Mainyu in another time. The mud acts to your will, attacking and defending you as
you command it mentally, with enough power to kill many strong heroes and even defend against
legends like Heracles for a time. There’s no limit to how much mud you can produce with the cube
or control either. More notably, the mud can form itself into heroic spirits, somewhat lesser versions
of the heroes that roam the world in the times you now live in, though still a capable threat against
the people of these times. While the mud, much like Angra Mainyu’s, must cover and corrupt a spirit
to be able to control and produce them, you cube has apparently already eaten up hundreds of
heroic spirits from dozens of different cultures. It currently lacks figures on or above the level of
power of Heracles and only one of each spirit can be made at a time, but it still results in a powerful
army that follows your commands absolutely.

The final secret of the box is that it is truly your own box. Not only does even opening the box
against your will or somewhat damaging it require multiple immensely powerful magical engines
with the capability to warp reality, such as proper Holy Grails, outright destroying the box could
require something as immense as the efforts of a whole World. Deep within the box, the Hope that
forms the core is in actuality, you. The most important part of you, your soul, kept safe and guarded
by the shadows of the box within it’s centre. Should you perish from outside of the box, you’ll be
able to restore your form from the black mud in a short time. Others would need to force open the
box for enough time to delve into the vast, muddy depths of the box and destroy your soul from
within or destroy the box outright to get at your core.

If you somehow have a box you’d like to use, even as just cosmetic changes to the outside of this, you can import it into here."
2160,,600,Eightfold Mirror of Amaterasu,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Making ,"A divine treasure among divine treasures, the mirror that would later be known as the Yata no
Kagami. An artefact said to be descended from Amaterasu herself, it has come into your ownership. The large mirror levitates around your body at your will, slamming crudely into foes to make use of
it’s unbreakable nature. It’s true power is to create a bounded field of great size and immense
potency. Within this bounded field, the user is able to take command of magical energy and direct it
as if it were their own, commonly to turn to the use of mighty blasts of raw power.

A simple use, as full activation of the mirror interferes with the property of ‘Eternal’ to the bounded
field. While there are several effects possible with this, the primary one the user will note is the
generation of infinite amounts of magical energy. The mirror continually draws forth as much energy
as is present within the bounded field, including your own body, allowing you to use as much as you
can handle without running dry. With practice, it is possible to use this interference in other ways, such as making it possible to revive the dead without the use of a True Magic or Miracle. 

However, full activation of the mirror is exhausting for those below the divine power of Amaterasu. A normal youkai might find it too much to hold active for more than a few moments each day and
even Tamamo herself would struggle if in her lesser forms to use it for more than five minutes at a
time. However, as your power grows and the time limit lessens, the range of the mirror’s bounded
field will increase. Amaterasu’s power was enough to enable to extend the Bounded Field across all
of Japan, allowing her to reconstruct and alter the entire country at the same time."
2161,,600,Musical Mayhem,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Making,"An orchestra of pure destruction has been created, an array of instruments to surpass any ever
made. Around forty musical instruments are lined up in front of you, each one a thing of beauty in a
different style. Any collector or musician would be glad to hold even one. But they are more than
just able to produce fine music. Each tool here is a magical item, varying from those of moderate use
to mighty weapons. A flute may be present that can automatically inflict a hard to notice but weak
charm spell on any who hear it, whereas the ornate and massive trumpet in the back could unleash
sonic waves that crush castle walls to dust. There may even be an organ in the back, composed of the bodies of theatre goers, that can be used to create sonic weapons and significant magical curses. The arsenal of music present here could turn an ordinary orchestra into something that can bring
down an army, as each tool requires minimal magical energy to use despite some of their powers. However, each one must be played well for the powers to manifest at proper levels. If you wish, you
may find replicas of actual magical instruments, such as La Black Luna or Christine Christine, in the
array."
2162,,600,Sublimation,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Making ,"Originality and uniqueness may certainly be the king of the high class art world but that’s only when
people can tell it’s there. If not, a revision works just as well. Sublimation is the name of this
capability you now have, which allows you to reproduce objects you have a chance to study and
‘revise’ them in the process, like stealing and rewriting a play. You’ll need the desired item as a
catalyst but this will let you slowly make copies of it, quality depending on the time and resources
you invest into each one. A few hours is usually all it takes but already powerful items can take
expensive, rare or dangerous to acquire materials to remake. 
   
More uniquely, your revision ability allows you to alter these catalysts. Again, basing the extent of
the effect on time and resources, but you can certainly make a magical sword several times as
powerful or add numerous new abilities to it, altering it’s history or composition so that it always
had those qualities. Perhaps a cart of raw materials from the local town square is all it’d take to take
an ordinary iron blade and make it sharp enough to cut metal and alight in flame on command. But
improving an already legendary blade like Durandal even moderately could take fortune’s worth of
materials that would already be difficult to attain, even for a king. There is not technically a limit on
how far an object may be revised, though the cost of doing so will continue to grow greatly. Of
course, selling your reproductions and revisions would certainly help build the fortune needed for
something big. "
2163,,600,Artificer ,Tsukihime,Making,"Even among the everyday alchemists of Atlas, you have a talent for the creation of new and interesting items. Mystic Codes, modern Conceptual Weapons, even living Homunculi...with the time, study, and resources, you can create new and amazing items and magical beings that modern magi would happily chop off a limb just to possess. You also have the skill to reverse-engineer magical enchantments that others make,and with enough time, you may almost perfectly recreate them - though it takes a proportionate amount of resources and study to make something that departs from the norm,and something on par with a relic from the Age of Gods may take a king’s ransom and a near lifetime of work.

To explain, a Mystic Code is a ‘support’ item utilized by magi that come in two types. The first is an Amplifier, which can strengthen or support their magic by storing reserve energy for later use or directly amplifying a spell, as the name indicates. An example of this is the jewelry used in the magecraft utilized by the Tohsaka family. The second is a ‘Specialized’ Mystic Code, which can perform a given spell or function upon being activated by the user’s magical energy. This Could even be utilized by those without magical circuits under certain conditions - for example,the Salamander Gloves used by Azaka Kokuto in a different world, which could generate flames using her ‘talent’ for spontaneous combustion alone.

A Conceptual Weapon, to contrast, is a weapon that has accumulated a history within it, and do more than simple physical damage or interference - it has a singular ‘concept’ embedded within it and is able to damage or disrupt things like physical laws or magical beings, or even formless things that normally couldn’t be damaged by mundane means. It does so by imposing its given concept onto the world, and inflicting it on those the user attacks with the Weapon. A common modern example are the Black Keys utilized by the Holy Church itself.

Finally, a homunculus is a magical being, an artificial lifeform created without the normal biological process of birth. The concept of ‘age’ is largely meaningless, as they begin with all of their required knowledge for whatever task they were made for upon being created, aging to adulthood in months instead of years. They also possess powerful Magic Circuits as a result of their artificial creation - though as a consequence, homunculi are usually physically frail, havemental defects, or short lifespans - some trade-off to their creation process. Perhaps in time you could eventually make one with a human lifespan or iron out some of these defects, but that will take years and resources you likely could have used a simpler creation for. For some reason, ones you create are guaranteed to be unshakeably loyal (or at least benign) to you in particular.
"
2164,,600,Psychic Pills ,Kara no Kyokai,Making,"A box of what appear to be over the counter medication, mostly pills and drops. Significant painkiller effects, for the most part, calming headaches and soothing pain to the point that even painful injuries are easy to deal with. But the different types of pain medication here are more for their secondary effect, of sealing and cultivating unique powers. The medication in the box appears to have each type, of which there don’t seem to be a limit, corresponding to a unique power or ability that you have. A specific kind of Mystic Eye, an individual psychic power, perhaps a stand alone magic power. While taking the medication, that power will be sealed and unavailable to you. But it will grow in strength and capability constantly under those pills. A steady and, over years, quite significant growth rate. Especially since it can improve well beyond normal limits. Mystic Eyes of Distortion that might normally be limited to twisting off limbs, heads or tearing a car in half at best could grow over four or five years to be capable of tearing apart an entire city river bridge, a metal suspension construct twisted asunder. Something as broad as all your Magecraft would be too much for this medication however, as it seems to work on a very specific basis. It never runs out at least and there don’t appear to be complications from taking many pills at once, though it will not improve the growth rate for each individual power beyond the base boost one dose gives."
2165,,600,The Sorcerer's Apprentice ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Making,"Ah, your studies into the occult must have paid off...and not in the way that it ‘paid off’ for Tomoko Nozama. You learned the skills behind turning magic stones into wizard rings! These rings can do a variety of effects, from producing fire to donuts or creating magic gateways...By channeling ‘mana’ or magical energy through the rings, you are able to activate them! While the only source of magic here is being a Gate, that doesn’t mean they’re limited to only Gate mana. However, there are a few caveats. Firstly, magic stones aren’t simple to find. You now have the skills to pick one out but it’ll take a lot of searching to get a few good ones just like this. Secondly, you won’t be able to know if the stone ‘wants’ to be that ring. Magic stones have a will of their own and it’s liable that you could craft a stone that wants to be a “Bind” ring into a “Fly” ring. This doesn’t have any overtly negative effects, per se, but they might not work as effectively as ‘happy’ stones. Still, with time you’ll be able to figure it out. As a bonus, you also know how to make Plamonster Golems animated by the rings. They’re small and low intelligence, but extremely loyal to you.
"
2166,,600,Garnet​ ​Orb​ ​,Sailor Moon,Making,"This gem carries with it a taboo power. Time is an important aspect of reality, one that carries terrible consequences if tampered with. This gem has the power to stop time. Pausing time, however, is not forbidden because of the impact on time one could have of its abuse. Pausing time is a powerful ability, as the entire flow of reality itself is put on hold for the actions of the few. Such a power, to halt the movement of an entire dimension itself, requires the sacrifice of the life of the one using it. Sailor Pluto’s Garnet Orb allows her to do this forbidden ability. This orb is similar to hers, but the cost is merciful.

You may pause time for up to a total amount of one hour per jump with this orb. While you can stop time at any moment you like, the gem will, during the paused time, begin to crack as you use more and more of this paused time. When you have paused time for up to a total of one hour, the gem will shatter. For example: If you paused time for twenty minutes the last time you used it during a jump, and then paused time for forty more minutes, the gem will shatter. You will find a new orb when you go to the next jump. It can also summon up a circular force-field to protect the user and their friends from any time altering acts, such as freezing or slowing them.

If the user has the Senshi Origin, they may also summon up a great power from this orb,​ ​Sailor Pluto’s Dead Scream. An attack that speeds up time around the target to disintegrate them. This power is a great draw on its reserves, and can only be done thrice per month. Dead Scream usage will not harm the orb, but time pausing will.
"
2167,,600,Libriomancy ,Libriomancer,Making,"You have mastered the basic arts of libriomancy. With an appropriate book you may reach inside of the pages and pull out any item described. There are of course limitations to it, most significantly you can only draw out items that are small enough to fit through the open pages of the book in question. Any item you create will also drain your magical energies slightly for however long it exists. While this is slight if you keep too many items active at once (usually ten) it will become more noticeable and will negatively impact your health. Similarly, if you do not return items that you have used back to their books after using them, you will likely burn the books out and make them unusable after a mere twenty five uses. This power comes with a number of other restrictions and drawbacks (paramount that the books must be published, read by a large number of people in hard­copy and be actual books, not comic books or manga or the like) but other than that nearly the whole of literature is available to you. (Additional rules and restrictions may apply. See notes)"
2168,,600,Gutenberg’s Pen ,Libriomancer,Making,"You seem to have acquired a copy of Gutenberg’s fountain pen, made of gold with silver fletching and a diamond nib. With it your skills of libriomancy are greatly enhanced. Books can be ‘locked’ preventing other libriomancers from using them and other magic users may have their magic or memories sealed away. (Keep in mind that ‘sealed’ and ‘gone forever’ are two very different things and there are at least three cases where such attempts have utterly failed). Your skill with High Libriomancy is also increased, allowing you to alter book­born characters and assemble complex spells with no risk of magical char to yourself, though the books will still char if overused.
"
2169,,600,Ponce de Leon’s Cane ,Libriomancer,Making,"The cane of Ponce de Leon, given to him by Gutenberg himself, broken down and reforged with the highest grade of magic manageable by mortal hands. The cane is composed primarily of flawless black wood with a chromed operatic handle with flakes of gold in both it and its  neck. Using it to channel magic almost completely removes the effects of magical char from all but the greatest of workings. It may be used to store spells for later casting, though this requires a command of magic above that of most ordinary wizards. Nearly indestructible, the cane can be commanded to transform into a multitude of melee weapons and has even been known to keep devourers at bay for a time.
"
2170,,600,Gear Up to F*** That Noise ,Generic MG,Making,"Transformation trinkets are the backbone of a magical girl’s combat abilities. And someone has to make and upgrade them. That someone is you, by the way.

You know everything about the magical artifacts of this world. This isn’t just rote knowledge of what to do, you have the experience and intuition like you personally have made all kinds of transformation trinkets. This leads into you being able to innovate and improve transformation trinkets well beyond what they can already do, if you put in the time and effort.

In addition, you can combine other kinds of magic besides this world’s into personal equipment you make (not just transformation trinkets.) Though you don’t gain any extra experience, using aspects from another magical system shouldn’t take you more than twice as long as normal.

Finally, you can create transformation trinkets that awaken magic in the user, even to those that have no innate talent or potential for it. Users awakened this way will be completely dependent on the transformation trinket to start with, but after a decade of use will be able to use the magic on their own.

More complex items will take more time, material, and resources to create. In addition, it will take roughly a decade before you can make transformation trinkets that grant a basic level of skill.

(CG Note: The remainder of this perk requires The Power of Friendship - Generic MG first.)

Intelligent Devices (The Power Of Friendship)

What better friend is there in combat than a weapon? You can make sapient equipment, and the better you know the intended user, the better you can tune the new personality to work with the user. The more compatible the equipment is with the user, the more comfortable the user will be using it, and the less training they’ll need for it.

In addition, with a sufficiently compatible personality in the equipment, it will become bound to the user, constantly returning when needed and incapable of being destroyed while the user still lives. And if the user returns from death, so can their gear.

The level of sapience is up to you to decide during the design stage. You may want an armor that only gives feelings of danger to allow the user to dodge better, or a staff that is not only a good magical focus, but a peer to the wizard that uses it.
"
2171,,600,Mini-Hakkero ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Making,"A magical furnace that takes the shape of an octagonal block, made of wood, with the eight trigrams printed in a circle on its front. The internal components were originally made of mundane steel, but was replaced by the mythical hihi-irokane metal after it became rusted. Despite its small size, being able to fit in a person’s hand, it is an incredibly potent source of heat and magical energy. This is the engine that powers the infamous Love Sign Master Spark, but unlike the original, requires little to no physical fuel in order to function, but purely of the user’s magical power.
"
2172,,600,Yuuka’s Parasol ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Making,"Kazami Yuuka has been said to be one of the strongest class of Youkai, that even with a relatively unimpressive power of being able to manipulate flowers, she is able to stand her ground against reality warping Youkai with far more potent powers on paper. She carries with her a parasol made form a flower that would never wilt, one of the only examples of such in all of Gensokyo. And now, you have a copy of it. This parasol can cut through the sun’s rays of the harshest summers, never falter through even the heaviest rainstorm, and is strong enough to deflect attacks with ease. It seems like this parasol has embodied some of Yuuka’s powers, and will allow the wielder to manipulate flowers as if it were their second nature. However, its most impressive feat is the ability to allow the user to travel to a pocket dimension of their design, defaulting to a sunflower garden for their relaxation. Though, that can be changed permanently if the user wills so."
2173,,600,Brain of the Moon ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"Did you study under Eirin? Like her, you can make a drug to perfectly cure any possible disease, make drugs that could manipulate the Dream World, and likely produce even more fantastical effects. This does have a few limitations, you cannot create a drug that does the impossible, you can’t cure something you do not know or understand, and you cannot make drugs without base ingredients. Perhaps if you found someone who could manipulate eternity itself you could even replicate the Hourai Elixir. This does not come with any raw materials, but you will also find ways to substitute the raw materials of other worlds for anything you could have found here.
"
2174,,600,Creating Spirits ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Making,"Creating new youkai is a trivial task for you, even ones for ideas that have yet to exist, though you utterly lack any inherent control over them. You could easily flood Gensokyo with new youkai and throw the lands into chaos if you really wanted to. This is by far the most feared of Okina’s true abilities, as it threatens the delicate power balance of Gensokyo. You can also change what, exactly, these new youkai need to survive – creating youkai that draw from your own power instead of fear, for instance.
"
2175,,600,Pretend Eating ,Peter Pan,Making,"Peter often has pretend meals that fatten him up as easily as normal cuisine, and while most boys have trouble you have learned how to fill yourself with these pretend dinners. By simply imagining a desired food and then visually acting as if you ate it, you gain half the nutritious value you would get with the real version of the food. If you took Mother Knows Best, you can also serve imaginary foods to other people with the same benefits as long as they play along with the pretend. Additionally, if you try hard enough, you can imagine even more things, and perhaps make imaginary doors and windows to keep people in or out, among other possibilities; these imaginary constructs will be invisible to other people, but have a solid feel to anyone who touches them. This also lets you potentially perform various tasks using “pretend” items in place of the real ones you’d need otherwise; for instance, with this you could do sewing (even Shadow Sewing) without real sewing equipment. However, you are limited to mundane, ordinary things; at most, you could pretend to drive an ordinary car, but don’t ask for a James Bond limo, much less a nuke. Similarly, this cannot be used to recreate magical things.
"
2176,,600,Pearl Dream* ,Peter Pan,Making,"Do you know how mermaids are born? You must, since you are one. A mermaid is born from the chaotic irritation within a clam creating a pearl, which then is enchanted by Never Never Land’s magic and becomes at once a fully-aged mermaid; being the manifestation of that irritation, mermaids are naturally vain and jealous. This insight, combined with your magic, gives you the ability to enchant pearls with magic. But more than that, you know how mermaids are born, and can reproduce the process yourself. By growing clams under the right magical conditions, you can create new mermaids. The more magic the pearl is exposed to before the clam opens, the more mysterious and wiser the mermaid; the longer the pearl grows and the irritation intensifies, the more beautiful and vainer the mermaid. Generally, with a stable supply of magic, you can grow an average mermaid in 2 to 4 years, though she will not have any magical powers besides breathing underwater. To grow a mermaid with special abilities such as singing or controlling water can take up to seven years. As for creating a mermaid at the level of a nymph queen or water spirit, it would take 10 full years. That said, with a large enough aquaculture facility and ready access to natural magic, you can grow multiple pearls at once.
"
2177,,600,Treasure Map/Chest ,Peter Pan,Making,"You receive a map of Neverland that will lead you to a large chest filled with tons of treasure of all sorts (though it’s not infinite). If you unearth the chest, you could rebury it (with different items if you wish) at a new location, and the map will change to show you its location. As long as the treasure is buried on Neverland, the map will consistently adjust to account for the island’s ever-changing form, so that you will always have a reliable map of Neverland. Whenever the treasure is buried, nobody but you and people following your orders can find it. If you die or leave a jump without reclaiming the buried treasure, the protective curse vanishes and anyone can stumble upon it. If you do not retrieve the chest before the end of a jump, the map will instead lead you to a similar chest with generic treasure within your current jump."
2178,,600,Totem Pole ,Peter Pan,Making,"A towering, beautifully-carved totem pole of the tribal spirits and guardians. You can now speak with these spirits for advice, and can also summon them for aid in times of desperation. If purchased along with Tribal Magic, you can summon up to 8 totems that encircle a specific area (no larger than a small village) and cause anyone who approaches the sanctuary without permission to become hopelessly lost.
"
2179,,600,Fairy Mage Collection ,Peter Pan,Making,"An assortment of random fairy potions and spell books that have a variety of potential effects, from shrinking humans down to the size of fairies to enchanting a target so everybody laughs when he or she speaks to temporarily making storybooks come to life.
"
2180,,600,Living Ingredient ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Your body has strange magics to it that make whatever can be safely removed (hair, sweat, snot, nails, drool, etc. – or other parts depending on your form/powers) have magical effects when consumed. These effects and their correspondence to your body parts will be randomly determined, but you could find a wide range of effects, from making the eater constantly leap about to letting the eater let loose a terrifying roar to making you grow or shrink. Please also note that while the magical enchantments won’t normally affect you even though they are technically part of your body, if you consume those “ingredient” parts after they are detached from your body, you can receive the same magical effects.
"
2181,,600,Unusual Attire ,Wonderland No More,Making,"Wonderland certainly has some...unique styles of clothes, with some humans preferring clothing made from paper – actual paper, not recycled or mixed with something else! Yet they somehow make it work. You can now make clothes out of any material or substance you want, even if they would normally not work at all for clothing. These clothes will not harm the wearer even if their properties normally would. Even so, the materials retain their other properties, which may prove detrimental in their own way. For example, a glass ball gown would not be at risk of cutting the wearer (and wouldn’t actually be that stiff when worn), but it would still be at risk for shattering if directly struck (and the shattered pieces, no longer counting as clothing, could hurt the subject). Or if you had shoes made out of molten lava, the user wouldn’t be burned, but they’d set on fire anything else they touched (and that resulting fire could in turn burn the wearer). On the flipside, any positive attributes of the materials will also be retained.
"
2182,,600,Mother Nature ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Making,"Most apprentices of the Jade Order are the children of Jade Wizards themselves, and Magister Matriarch Tochter Grunfeld has seen eight of her own children become full Magisters of the Order of Life. So it may someday be with you - not only are you incredibly fertile, able to bear or sire healthy children long after non-wizards or even other wizards would go barren and in greater numbers, but each and every one of your descendants shall possess a deep aptitude for and tie to the magics of Ghyran. Life begets life.
"
2183,,600,Khorne’s Anvil ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Making,"This massive anvil is a one of a kind gift from the Master of Murder, completely engraved with the markings of Khorne. It will seem like it is otherwise unassuming until you begin creating weapons on it. Weapons that are hammered into shape in this anvil will be of masterwork quality regardless of the metals used, and they are eternally sharp and will never wear and tear. But this is not the greatest gift of the anvil. Khorne is willing to use the souls of magic users who are sacrificed on the anvil to grant a weapon a magic effect that reflects the magical “strength” of the mage that was sacrificed on it...with no limits. This may seem hypocritical for Khorne, but Khorne believes that magic weapons made from a subjugated mage is perhaps the greatest example of might over magic, and the weapon’s existence confirms his ideals.
"
2184,,600,The Shadow Of The Enemy ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Making,"The story of Agahnim was told four times. In one, he was a mortal wizard. In the second and fourth, his story was never elaborated on. And in the third, he was an extension of Ganon, a fragment of power given life and given purpose. Not unlike the Phantom Ganon’s from another era, though admittedly far more powerful. Regardless, you may now cut away portions of yourself, a bit of raw physical might, a few years of studying magic, an afternoon or two of swordplay, and turn them into a person. They are ultimately you and as such can neither harm nor betray you, but are also NOT you, and as such can bypass defenses that would normally keep you out. Like a magical seal across an entire dimension, for example. Modifying them from far away is difficult, but not impossible, if you need to give them a bit more later. Like some dark magic after they’ve been declared holy or some rot like that.
"
2185,,600,Fountain of the Fairy ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Making,"A familiar sound may be heard...this fountain houses within it a “Great Fairy”, a being of great magic who will provide a specific service if you give her some rupees(or currency, it’s a tithe anyhow.) By providing some materials to ‘use’ and a piece of equipment, the Great Fairy will empower it, giving a strong enchantment that makes it much better at what it was meant to do - though you can do this indefinitely, the costs in both materials and currency become more and more expensive with each subsequent upgrade. You may end up having to pay a king’s ransom just for a slight boost, but...if you’re willing to lay all you have before the Fairy, you’ll get what you desire. The Fountain can be deployed in any jump you arrive at, or be attached to the warehouse for convenience."
2186,,600,Arrows of Light ,Hyrule Warriors,Making,"Zelda used her light magic to permanently enchant the bow and arrows she gifted to Link in a future that may or may not come. Ancient sorcerers crafted the great magic ring that would become Wizzro. Now, so too can you bestow upon objects a form of permanent magic power. 

This is an enchantment style ability allowing the infusion of either innate magical power, such as Zelda’s divine light, or learned magical power, such as Zant’s twilight sorcery, into objects to permanently bestow new or heightened abilities. 

The most basic application is making weapons with an elemental affinity based on the Sorceress’ own mastery of the element. This can allow more esoteric effects such as infusing some summoning magic into an item to be able to call it back to you at a whim. 

Objects can only handle so much power, and must be stripped down of their magic before they can be gifted with something new. Fortunately, you know how to do that too if you’re itching to retool your favorite staff.
"
2187,,600,Relics ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Making,"All too often, the hero of legend has to go on some great quest to acquire some object of power. A sword, a magic wand, some magic instruments or what else. Rest assured, if you go looking for these legendary items, as long as they exist, you’ll be able to find them. Doesn’t help you actually get them, as they might be in the possession of powerful and dangerous foes, but knowing is half the battle."
2188,,600,Armor of Wishes ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Making,"When the hero of old slew the man-eater, the beast vanished into thin air, it’s body long since replaced by naught but spirit. It’s armor was the only thing left of it, the same armor that was supposedly able to grant wishes. The hero took that armor, and began to carve a mask from it. Much like him, you are now able to create masks of power from fallen foes, the more powerful the better. They do not need to be masks that transform, like the other masks made from the dead, but if you wanted one, you know how to make one. Also of note is the fact that such a mask would weaken the power of your foe if they were to ever return to life, trapping them inside the mask instead of truly bringing them back.
"
2189,,600,Crystalized Magic ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Making,"What is a rupee? Where does it come from? How is that relevant to you? Well, maybe it isn’t. Anyways, you now have the power to create small shards of crystalized magical energy. These crystals are basically pure lifeforce. Regardless, these gems are now your preferred form of currency, because you seem to be able to use them instead of the local currency in most cases. A merchant will accept them gladly, though they may not fit in a vending machine. Or if you prefer, you can save them up to convert back into energy later - wasn’t there a shield of some sort around these parts that ran on rupees?

"
2190,,600,Artifact Hunter ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Making,"There are many strange and wondrous artifacts scattered around the land of Hyrule; remnants of a bygone age, magical items of great power, or the advanced technology of a city hidden in the clouds. While such things aren’t exactly common, for you they often seem to just end up in your lap. Sure, you might have to defeat a mini-boss or do a job for someone, but quickly amassing a veritable treasure trove of tools and weapons is worth the effort. Future worlds will have similar artifacts coming across your path and although they tend to be somewhat specialized for certain jobs they tend to be highly effective at doing that job- and many of them will have uses in combat or additional utility uses- and will continue to be useful well after you leave the world that you discover them in one way or another, so long as you have the wisdom to find out what those are.

"
2191,,600,Weapons of the Weak ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Making,"The Wise Men of Hyrule brought forth the fruits of their labors to defend the land, but were too late in their response. However they have kept them in wait, hoping to ensure that the proper hands received the instruments of Hyrule’s Peace. These are the tools you’ve inherited - the Magical Rod, Magic Book, Power Bracelet, and the Blue Ring. The Magic Rod is enchanted with a lethal spell, by waving this rod you will fire a blast of powerful energy at your enemies - with the power of the “Fire” spell in “Wise Man’s Teachings”, the Magic Book giving you the lessons to further refine your magic. By reading through, the Magical Rod’s attack now becomes a ball of fire upon impact, allowing you to torch dry grass that could hide secret paths as well as allowing you to defeat multiple enemies at once. The Power Bracelet is an enchanted bracelet, while wearing this you will have the physical strength to push large boulders. Unfortunately, it does not increase your damage with any of the swords, nor does it allow you to fight any more effectively with your bare hands. Finally, the Blue Ring acts as an enchanted ring giving you the effects of “Shield” from the Wise Man’s Teachings as long as you or any other wears it.
"
2192,,600,Plunderer’s Pack ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Making,"The land is not an easy one to delve - there are hidden passages, rushing waters, lost places, harrowing heights, ancient doors and dark caverns. Searching for the hero and the treasure of Hyrule will be difficult normally...but with this collection, you’ll find no corner of Hyrule is beyond your reach! The items you receive are the Hammer, the Ladder, Boots, the Cross, a Compass, the Red Candle, and the Magic Key. The Hammer is enchanted to smash through stone easily(and nothing else) to remove boulder obstacles, the boots allow you to walk across water, the Cross reveals mystically hidden and otherwise “invisible” objects/creatures/places, the Compass will always point to the closest valuables around you(prioritizing magic artifacts from strongest to weakest if there are multiple around), the Red Candle is a magical flame that cannot be doused and used to ignite flammable material, and the Magic Key is a “Skeleton key” that can shift itself to fit for any physical lock and key system. All this together ensures one thing - the treasures of Hyrule are yours to seize, including the Triforce your master howls for.
"
2193,,600,Two Masks,TES: Dovah,Making,"The final two Dragon Priest masks, and the most powerful, Konahrik
and Miraak. Both will never fall off its wearer's face, while improving the power of their
Thu'um. Konahrik grants its wearer a powerful regeneration, resistance to all types of
damage, and allows them to summon a protective cloak of dragonfire. Miraak grants the
wearer a vastly increased pool of magicka, high magicka regeneration, and allows them
to summon a spectral dragon."
2194,,600,Master of the Craft,TES: Magic,Making,"Through long study and years of effort, you have become an
undisputed master of your craft. In addition to all of your enchantments being five times
more potent, you have learned a very valuable, and very difficult technique. You can
add new enchantments onto already enchanted items, as well as further enhancing
pre-existing enchantments! With your skill, you could even make those vaunted Daedric
Artifacts more powerful than they already are."
2195,,600,Nightingale Set ,The Elder Scrolls,Making,"As the protectors of Nocturnal's Twilight Sepulcher, they are equipped with the best that the shadowy warriors could ask for. You can summon a set of armor made of shadows at any time. Not only does it conceal your identity, it muffles your movements, makes illusions easier to cast, increases your lockpicking skill and frost damage, and let's you do more damage with weapons. The Nightingale Blade absorbs the health and stamina of it's targets, transferring them to the wielder, while the Nightingale Bow deals a great amount of frost and shock damage."
2196,,600,Monster Maker ,World Seed,Making,"Monsters are creatures that are not given birth to through evolution like normal animals, but are rather birthed by mana. Though after that, they can reproduce normally. The birth of a monster has two stages: first is the catalyst, where elemental mana comes together in certain quantities and patterns, which then triggers stage two, the gathering and formation of other mana types to create the body, such as fur, bone, or blood mana. And now, you know three methods of causing the same process yourself.

The first is simply drawing together the mana manually, whether that is through a Druid’s affinities or a Mage’s spells. The second is to draw runic spell formation circles to gather the mana. This can be used in various ways, such as simply making ones to gather and store the mana types you want and then create a number of monsters at a trigger, or to just spawn them endlessly the moment enough mana is gathered to level up at a fast pace.

The third is Summoning Magic, which you are decently good at. It works through the same principles as the first two methods to create monsters, but as teleportation magic is part of it, you can also use it to do things such as actually summoning monsters or other beings and things within a certain radius matching your specifications to you, teleporting yourself, or creating contracts (forced or willing) to easily summon creatures or their spirits, in case you killed them and placed a mark on their body before they died. Another thing to mention would be that in this world, Dungeons are also a kind of monster, which you would of course also be capable of creating.

Now, those are some useful skills, but the one thing separating you from others capable of doing the same is your talent for creating and designing entirely new life, whether that is monsters or animals. With careful study, you can find the right mana combinations for nigh-anything you might want to create, whether that is a hermaphroditic moose reproducing with itself throughout all of time and space or simply a fluffy fox girl. As a last bonus, anything you create will be loyal to you. It would be pathetic to die to the improved version of the Lunar Titan you made, right?"
2197,,600,Natural Regeneration ,World Seed,Making,"In Neolife, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that magic is in everything. One interesting facet of this can be seen in how on many worlds, dug earth and other natural resources are replaced by the ambient mana over the course of a few weeks if there isn’t anything like a support structure preventing it. While this is certainly convenient, you thought to yourself, “I can do better”. After all, many important resources can’t even be found on planets, like mana gems or the insanely rare mineral osmium, which are only found on asteroids. But with the ability you created, this won’t be a problem anymore, because you can just restore them anyway: simply by spending enough mana, it is possible for you to regenerate any natural resource or duplicate existing ones.

You could pump mana into an asteroid to restore whatever it is that was mined there to get effectively infinite resources out of it, do the same to the extremely valuable gem lying in front of you to get multiple copies of it, or send out a massive wave of mana to cover a whole planet in a forest. The mana required scales linearly with the amount of the resource you want to work with, its complexity, and its power. So while you could easily get massive amounts of diamonds and wood even with a little mana, duplicating something like the Top 5 metals (see Notes) or similar materials would require truly insane amounts of mana."
2198,,600,Master Craftsman ,Danmachi,Making,"You are a master of crafts and trades, from weapon-smithing to alchemy and more. This gives you the requisite knowledge, experience and skills to create and craft any item that you want, with the right materials. The items that you make tend to last for a long time without maintenance and are unlikely to break before their owners, along with it only costing a tenth of the original materials to make without sacrificing any quality and beauty. With enough time, research and materials, you can recreate any magical item that you can get your hands on with the same quality. The items that you have already made can also be mass produced by you at a faster rate and even less materials than before. This skill doesn’t give you the ability to make items at the height of a god with a similar purview but your breadth of applicability should be broader. Through, with enough time and experience you could reach the level of a god’s purview but it would take decades with only this perk."
2199,,600,The Flesh Is Receptive ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Making,"Moulder uses a variety of tools when creating their fleshy monstrosities, or augmenting the bodies of soldiers or commissioned Warlords. Sometimes the flesh and sinew of a victim is used. Sometimes it is judicious amounts of warpstone and mutagenic chemicals. And in both cases, the flesh might not cooperate - growing cancerous tumors instead of the desired mutation, or the blood and muscle of a “donation” rejecting the body it was implanted into. This can lead to the creature weakening & failing, or even dying outright.

Not so in your case, monster. Your flesh is... receptive to such changes - in fact, your flesh would make a Master Moulder or Mutator salivate and squeal for the chance to study. Surgical implants and mutations will suffer fewer negative consequences when introduced to your biology, to the point of nullifying the potential of rejection. Additionally, such augmentations will change over time to accommodate your actions and capabilities - cancerous tumors aiding in the building and development of musculature as well as regenerating wounds, as an example. A mutated immune system would eventually grow to the point of resisting magical infections, as a potential other example.
"
2200,,700,Sword Sigil,DC Comics,Making,"At some point, you met a jovial redheaded fellow who asked if you wouldn’t mind taking over
some of his duties. For one reason or another you agreed, and were gifted with this
workmanlike yet flawless sword. What does the sword do? It destroys everything, with only
your martial skill and innate capacity for destruction limiting its capabilities. Each swing or thrust
with it, each moment it spends in your hand focuses the power of destruction through your will.
It cuts through concrete, steel and Kryptonians like a hot knife through butter of course, but as a
great enough warrior you could cleave atoms and gravitational singularities apart with it. Kill an
idea. Bring the demise of entire civilizations by finding and attacking some appropriately patriotic
structure. Of course it’s for the better if you can cast fireballs or other destructive magic, the
sword will serve as a magical focus as if not better than a weapon and with it a bumbling
apprentice could lay low even a god. Be careful, there is truly no facet of destruction the sword
cannot empower. Stir a pot of venom with it, and that brew may eventually poison the universe
itself if not well-kept.
Destruction of the Endless also taught you an odd flick of the wrist which lets you cut your way
to a small pocket dimension. It’s nothing like his own realm. It’s just an incredibly peaceful
meadow, with a painting easel, a stool and an endless supply of paints and brushes neatly laid
out for you. A note on the stool reads “For when the job gets too hard”."
2201,,700,Custom Sacred Gear(Tier 3),HighSchool DxD,Making,"Time to bring out the big guns. Sacred Gears are also known as ‘God’s Artifacts’ and are part of the Judeo-Christian God’s system to enact miracles on Earth. It’s known that only humans (and rarely human-hybrids) are born with them. Powered by the desires of the user, adapting, and evolving based on their wielder's thoughts, needs, and feelings, gaining abilities or qualities as time passes. This is also how they can enter Balance Breaker, a state also known as the Forbidden Move, which is the strongest manifestation of the SG, and a form that goes beyond the initial plan of its creator.

The effects, abilities and powers they have are incredibly varied. From the relatively common Twice Critical, to the unique ones like Twilight Healing, to the Longinus – a group of powerful Sacred Gears said to be capable of killing a god.

Does the sparse list of options I present to you seem disappointing? Do you want something a little more...unique for a Sacred Gear? Look no further. You may design and create a single Sacred Gear of your choosing with this option. The price will depend on its effects, based on the options below...a simple but useful utility effect or single combat ability will have a base price of 200, a Sacred Gear capable of manipulating others or natural forces or creating permanent items from thin air would be around 400, while a Gear with various different abilities or simple but extremely powerful combat power will be about 600. Add 100 to that base price (base price is the one discounted if applied) and that will be your price for your personal Sacred Gear."
2202,,800,The Caloric Stone,Overlord,Making,"The actual origin or source of the Caloric Stone is a near total
mystery. It forms only from large concentrations of the Seven Prismatic Ores, legendary divine
materials that possess qualities far and away above anything else. Why this occurs, or even
who first discovered the Caloric Stone, is unknown. While held the Caloric Stone grants the
usual benefits of a World Item upon its bearer, providing protections against negative status,
instant death, being trapped or held, scried upon, and so forth, trumping even the effects of
other World Items. However, while useful, those are far and away the least impressive aspects
of the stone. The truth of the matter is quite simple; the Caloric Stone is the ultimate crafting
material. No matter what you are making, no matter how mighty, no matter what other materials
are included, adding the Caloric Stone will make that item or bit of craftsmanship better.
Food, drink, weapons, armor, buildings, vehicles, golems, indeed anything that can be crafted
can be quantifiably made superior (by an astounding degree) by the inclusion of the Caloric
Stone in its creation process, as the stone expands the possibilities and power of what can be
done with crafting. If you were to use particularly mighty materials in the creation of something,
say ingredients on par with those usually used in the making of a Divine Tier item, the resulting
piece of equipment would be truly legendary, halfway between the status of a Divine tier item
and a World Item. Obviously, and unfortunately, the stone is expended when used.
However, since you’re paying at a premium, you are guaranteed to receive a new Caloric Stone
exactly one month after using it, appearing in whatever location is most convenient for you. You
may explicitly hand this to other people but you need not fear losing it. If separated from your
person in a fashion you didn’t intend it will appear in the closest convenient location for you a
day later. However if it was used in this time frame to make something then you must still wait a
month for it to respawn."
2203,,800,Nth Metal,DC Comics,Making,"Native to Thanagar, this anomalous metal is most famed for it’s anti-gravity properties. But like
much about it, there is more to the metal’s history than meets the eye; in truth the Nth Metal
originated within the Dark Multiverse, being an incomplete replica of the 10th forged by Barbatos
outside of linear space and time. A person equipped with a belt of it can fly like a bird, despite
not being aerodynamic at all. But between regulating the environment around the wielder,
healing wounds and increasing one’s personal strength there are far, far more powers waiting to
be discovered. The metal is adaptive for example, fine-tuning it’s own defenses in response to
incoming attacks while biting deeper into opponents, and both transferring energy as well as
negating magical effects wielded in opposition to it’s holder. It has symbiotic properties, bonding
to wearers who integrate it at a cybernetic level to shape and form weapons or armour at will-
and even permitting those simply exposed to a particularly high grade concentration to
perpetually reincarnate or even resurrect on the spot, as well as let weapons forged of it fly
around at their wielder’s will. Suffice to say that the godlike, soul-eating, reality warping Onimar
Syn’s power stem from his close bond to the metal, and that both the cosmic destroyer dragon
Barbatos as well as the vampiric Monitor Mandrakk have been fended off by the comparatively
much weaker Carter Hall throughout his reincarnations by wielding a mace forged of this metal.
You have several crates worth of the Nth metal, and optionally a weapon such as a mace forged
from it-one that will make you powerful enough to stand your ground against cosmic beings by
reflexively absorbing their energy and augmenting you with it. "
2204,,800,God Tree,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Making,"The God Tree is a special alien species of gigantic tree, capable
of growing up to enormous heights, and a key part of the Ōtsutsuki Will. A God Tree
is born when a Ten-Tails, which acts as the tree’s seedling, consumes a live member
of the Ōtsutsuki clan (or alternatively a vessel of an Ōtsutsuki, as long as the
biological data within the Kāma must already have extracted to at least a majority
percentage for it to work) and is nourished by bloodshed and the natural energy of
the planet they’re planted on. This energy is then used to produce a single Chakra
Fruit, which grows over the course of a thousand years, but can be harvested earlier
if needed. As you’re paying a special price for this (or receiving this as a reward),
your own God Tree is a little different. First of all, it’s already in its tree form and most
of its conditions and drawbacks related to its growth are removed. The tree’s growth
won’t drain away the life of the planet by default, though you may cause it to do so if
you wish. You can still feed your God Tree with bloodshed or donations of energy to
accelerate its growth, but it’s no longer a requirement. Live sacrifices are also
possible and they’ll provide bigger boosts to its growth than just donating energy,
and more powerful sacrifices will speed things up more than weaker ones.
Similarly, an Otsutsuki sacrifice is not required to make its Chakra Fruit bloom, but a
sacrifice with an equivalent level of power or greater will still cause the Chakra Fruit
to provide an even greater amount of power than normal in addition to speeding up
its growth. If you use a sacrifice that doesn’t have chakra, but instead have some
other form of innate energy, you may cause the resulting Chakra Fruit to grant
immense reserves of that form of energy instead of chakra (like Ki, Nen, Aura,
Spiritual Energy and many others). Similarly, if the planet you plant the God Tree on
is imbued with some unique natural energy, you may make use of it to alter the
properties of the Chakra Fruit it produces. After absorbing a sacrifice or type of
energy for the first time, your God Tree will gain access to the option of switching the
nature of its Chakra Fruit to reproduce it in the future, even without access to a
repeat sacrifice or that same kind of energy. As an extra effect, besides just
absorbing energy, the God Tree will also absorb the biological data of any living
beings that live or lived on the planet they’re planted on, making it possible for both
the tree to replicate and the Chakra Fruit grants the biological traits and abilities of
these living beings.
Optionally, if you want to use your God Tree as a mass destruction weapon rather
than a tool for growth, you can make it revert to its seedling form, a Ten-Tailed Beast
with the same power of the Earth’s Ten-Tails. To do it, the tree must already have
matured enough to bear a Chakra Fruit. The beast produced by the tree will be
absolutely loyal to you and can return to its tree form at will.
All the energy stored on your God Tree and time dedicated to the Chakra Fruit’s
growth are conserved across Jumps and any progress won’t be lost in each new
Jump. Lastly, you also gain access to the technique known as “God: Nativity of a
World of Trees”, which grants you the ability to manipulate the roots of your God
Tree at will, being even able to spread them around the world with enough power."
2205,,800,Shinju Seed,Naruto,Making,"Shinju are born from Ten-Tails seedlings and nourished by bloodshed, the energy of the planet they are planted on, and the sacrificed life of an Otsutsuki. That energy is then used to produce a single Chakra Fruit, which grows over the course of 1000 years, but can be harvested earlier if you need to. 

Because you’re paying with CP, your version is a little different, with the majority of the conditions and drawbacks associated with its growth being waived. The tree’s growth will not drain away the life of the planet, though you may cause it to do so if you wish. You can still feed your God Tree with bloodshed or donations of energy to accelerate its growth, but it is no longer a requirement. Live sacrifices will provide bigger boosts to its growth than donating energy, and stronger sacrifices will speed things up more than weaker ones. Similarly, an Otsutsuki sacrifice is not required to make its Chakra Fruit bloom, but a sacrifice with an equivalent level of power or greater will cause the Chakra Fruit to provide an even greater amount of power than normal in addition to speeding up its growth. 

By eating the Chakra Fruit produced, you will gain a strength similar to Kaguya Otsutsuki, whose power was so great that even Juudara paled in comparison. By eating this fruit, you will awaken a free Rinnegan, increase your chakra reserves by a substantial amount, and gain access to All-Killing Ash Bone. While you might still tremble before the might of most other Otsutsuki, who feast on such Fruits regularly, you still have the power to destroy a planet.
"
2206,,800,Hōgyoku,Bleach,Making,"The Crumbling Orb at the centre of so much conflict. The magnum opus of both Sosuke Aizen and
Kisuke Urahara. Each man wished to find a way to break the boundaries of the spiritual world in
some way and, somehow, each found their way to the same creation. A device capable of realising
the deepest desires and dreams of those around it. Yet, this tool has a will of it’s own, an intelligent
to read the desires of others and serve the one considered it’s master. Whatever the truth of it’s intelligence, the completed Hōgyoku rests in your palm now, a fusion of
two component orbs and incredible power to bind them. It’s power is to manifest dreams as reality, not in a temporary sense or only maintained by focus but as truth. It could break down the barriers
between two races to create a new species, awaken powers in those that desperately desire or
evolve a man to ever greater levels of power. Indeed, these dreams manifest through evolution, change and growth in those affected. The orb requires a large amount of Reiryoku to activate, either injected in to activate in regards to a
single desire or constantly infused by being near a powerful source, allowing the orb to manifest
wishes as it sees fit. However, the orb manifests desires that people are capable of achieving. If one
does not have the raw potential or power to achieve something, the Hōgyoku will instead attempt to
lead it’s user towards being able to do so. They might be forcibly evolved in stages first to prepare
them for the true goal or be guided without realisation towards what is needed to gain the potential
for what they desire. The more powerful the user, in raw power and capability overall, the more the
Hōgyoku can achieve on it’s own."
2207,,800,Ladybug(Tikki) ,Miraculous Ladybug,Making,"Concept: Creation

Form: Earrings

Tool: Yo-Yo

Powers: “Lucky Charm” - Summons a useful arbitrary object. It will take some creativity to figure out how to use a banana to defeat Doc Oc but if you get a Lucky Charm, it can help you in your goal with some quick thinking.

“Miraculous [Hero Name]” - If there is damage caused by whatever conflict the Lucky Charm was summoned to defeat, the user can throw the Lucky Charm object in the air and say Miraculous Ladybug to turn the Lucky Charm into a swarm of magic ladybugs with restoration power that repair all damage from the crisis. The restoration power is also capable of healing those who are hurt by the target or their own powers, even going as far as to bring people back from non-existence. This ability will only fix damage they caused or damage caused by others trying to defeat them. For more limits on this power (although there are basically none), check the wiki. This power starts the detransformation countdown even as an adult.

The Yo-Yo can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures."
2208,,800,Special Grade Cursed Tool(800),Jujutsu Kaisen,Making,"By purchasing this option, you receive a cursed tool imbued with one of the abilities from the cursed technique section, allowing you to wield it through this item. The exact form of your cursed tool, as well as how it specifically interacts with the cursed technique it carries, is up to you. Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

The price for such an object is equal to the original cost of the cursed technique.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
2209,,800,War And Other Hobbies,DxD Universe,Making,"A lot of people tend to forget, but the reason why Azazel fell in the first place was by spreading his knowledge of war, but you make him look like a dumb child, you are amazing at anything involving war, from tactics to recruiting, but war isn't everything and just like Azazel you have acquire incredible knowledge about sacred gears, and while you can't make something in the level of a Longinus yet, you can create weaker ones."
2210,,800,Vritra Gear,HighSchool DxD,Making,"The Black Dragon King who was also known as the Prison Dragon, has his soul split and sealed in multiple Sacred Gears following his defeat. His direct power was the weakest among the Dragon Kings, but the amount of powers he has was unmatched even by the Heavenly Dragons. Each of these abilities play and help each other exceptionally well.

Absorption Line
It has the appearance of a small black bracer in the form of a small and cute black chameleon-like lizard and can produce multiple glowing pale blue colored lines that can be used to restrain, absorb, or transfer the power off of beings or objects its connected to. It’s also able to absorb life energy and convert it into either demonic power or magic energy, exsanguinate the blood of a person, and such.

Blaze Black Flare
It gives the user access and control over Vritra's intensive jet-black colored flames that are infused with curses similar to hellfire. The flames themselves are able to curse the soul of any being caught and killed by them for eternity, with the user being the only exception as it grants it immunity over them. The curse properties of these flames are enough to counter the divine attribute of Incinerate Anthem's Holy Fire to a certain degree.

Delete Field 
The user gains the ability to suppress and negate the abilities of an opponent or items within their range. The effects are strong enough to give pause to beings as powerful as Gods. Using it smartly can easily tide the battle on your favor.

Shadow Prison
It gives the user the ability to use Vritra's shadowy aura to restrain opponents, as well as some degree of power over shadows in general. Very little is known about this Sacred Gear, but its ability to detain enemies mid-battle can’t be ignored."
2211,,800,Caliburn,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Finally, there is the original sword wielded by Arthur Pendragon in ages past: The Sword In The Stone, Caliburn. In terms of power, there is no equal among Holy Swords - the holy aura of the blade alone repels the wicked and the infernal, its cutting power able to rend flesh as easily as air and even slice through space itself. While lacking in the host of abilities and utility of a completed Excalibur, this blade more than makes up for that in terms of raw power."
2212,,800,The Trident,The Little Mermaid,Making,"The Trident of King Triton! Or a copy of it at least. This a potent magical item, a god-given artifact some might argue. Allows you to do things like transforming mermaids into humans, creating rainbows, controlling the body of multiple sapient beings, and non-violently destroying castle walls. It is, basically, a very powerful magic wand, and possessing it gives you a legitimate claim to the Throne of Atlantica. As a weapon you will find it dealing mortal wounds that override invulnerability and healing factors.

When I say “override invulnerability” it does not mean One Hit Kill, it means that those who would normally be invulnerable to weapons/injury/death et cetera will find that invulnerability/immortality failing. As in, you could stab Superman with this and it would hurt him, but he would still have his strength, speed, laser eyes, and every other power not directl related to his invulnerability, and so long as it was not immediately fatal (through the head or heart for most life forms) he could still heal afterwards (but it would heal at a normal human rate). This also applies to those with healing factors/superhuman regeneration."
2213,,800,All-Black the Necrosword ,Marvel Magic,Making,"The Slicer of Worlds. The Annihiblade. The blade that slew a billion gods and carved the first dawn from the stone of the endless night. A primordial piece of darkness, turned into a weapon by an ancient alien god in a time long forgotten. This god ironically fell victim to his dark weapon as Gorr, the God Butcher took it and thus began his crusade to kill every god to ever live. In a far-off future, the last king of the dead earth will take up this weapon and become All-Black, the Allfather, the God of Butchers.

This is not that weapon -- at least, not quite. This is a shard of that weapon, a pale shadow of that ancient darkness... but with great potential. Just as the original, this Necrosword hungers for godblood and draws strength from drinking it in. If you allow the Annihiblade to serve its purpose and slay gods as cattle then it shall grow without bound. 

As it is now, the Necrosword takes the form of an inky armor of the darkest black that coats your body, granting you enormously increased physical abilities and allowing you to shape it to your will, growing anything from whips to functional wings, but it is particularly easy to form blades of shadow. The armor also sustains you in the case of wounds received, allowing you to shrug off and regenerate from massive amounts of damage. As you further use it and feed it the divine ichor it so desires, it will grow in power and you will discover new uses for it. In time you may perhaps even be able to sprout life from this instrument of death... or turn a star as black as night. And one last thing: This shard is entirely loyal to you and will never betray or attempt to corrupt you.

You can also import an existing weapon that you possess to gain these traits."
2214,,800,Worthy Weapon,Marvel Magic,Making,"Forged with the heat of a dying star from a mystical metal such as adamantine or Uru by a divine blacksmith and imbued with the power of a skyfather, this artifact (a melee weapon of your choice) is a potent weapon indeed. Enchanted and bound to your will such that it is impossible for it to be so much and lifted by someone without your permission and will always return to your hands with but a mental command. Nothing shall stop this weapon from returning to its master's hand; it will shatter dimensional barriers and plow through the core of planets to heed your call. As a weapon it can impact with sufficient force to shatter mountains and will cut through anything short of similarly strong materials or enchantments and is all but unbreakable – it can be broken, but the weapon is imbued with the will of a skyfather, a being whose words shake galaxies, and it will take similar strength to damage it.

It also has a number of additional abilities. First, it is not only a potent channel for all types of energies, but can also be used to forcibly absorb, store, and redirect nearly any type of energy in truly astounding quantities. Secondly, anyone who wields this weapon gains the benefits of Elder God Hybrid and one Domain that you may choose now and may additionally purchase more domains to be possessed by the weapon at a discount. Finally, the weapon may be used to open portals by rapidly moving it in a circular pattern. These portals may act as bridges to any place either in your nearby dimension or in adjacent dimensions connected to it."

2216,,800,Macguffin,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Making,"By retrieving the macguffin, you have acquired an item of immense yet non-determinate power. Its appearance shifts constantly, even while in your hands, and technological or magical observation returns conflicting results. That uncertainty is where the macguffin's true power lies... 

The macguffin is your get-out-of-jail card, the missing equation, a cure to the plague. Ask the macguffin a question and it will transform into something to provide a solution. Ask something direct, like 'how do I infiltrate this base' and the macguffin is now a dossier of blueprints, patrol schedules, and command codes. Ask something vague, like 'how do I acquire ultimate magical power' and it will become a series of insanely complex arcane equations that will take millennia to solve. Ask something ridiculous, and it will turn into a tiny Jump-chan doll and punch you in the dick. Even if you don't have one. 

If used creatively, it can even overcome a drawback in another Jump. Afterwards, the macguffin's non-specific nature is lost, locked into whatever fixed form was required of it. Entities or phenomena not on the level of Jump-chan or those with a Spark cannot replicate or reverse-engineer macguffins. "

For a expenditure of five conflicting, opposing magical forces- such as the 5 colors of mana of the multiverse- the energy provided to the gauntlet will be massively incremented- almost threefold, allowing much greater spells to be cast than that amount of energy of a single kind could ever achieve."

Individual costs are 200CP, discounted for their respective origin, and a bulk purchase is
800CP (Discounted Phyrexian).

-Deceiver´s Glaive:
Devised by the Phyrexian scientists of the Progress Engine under close examination of their Praetor, this glaive-bladed staff projects a field that allows its wielder to sap the will of their enemies, keyed to only affect those it's user considers their foe. Strong or particularly willful individuals may resist this, but it is sure to make dealing with the rabble easier.

-Tormentor´s Scythe:
A painful reminder to the Mirrans that being allowed to live in the Furnace Layer does not mean the Phyrexians under Urabrask will be kind to them, this scythe-like instrument can emit a searing, painful heat it's wielder is protected from, burning their enemies, and holds the strange ability to enhance the strength of their allies.

-Brutalizer´s Cane:
A hooked cane made out of the metallic wood of Tangle, not only is it an excellent blunt weapon, but it's attunement with green mana has granted it the uncanny ability to sense nearby living (or unliving) creatures, and command those wild ones with weak wills.

-Inquisitor´s Staff:
Wielded by the clerics of the Father of Machines, spreading the word of Elesh Norn, this staff allows the wielder to sap the life out of those struck by it, opening old wounds, or heal the allies of the user in a mockery of divine magic.

-Entombers Gauntlet:
A clawed metallic gauntlet, sharp enough to cut through the vegetation of the bogs and mires the Thanes have made into their turf. Thanks to the inclusion of the necrogen present in the area in its design, it's capable of raising the corpses of the fallen into weak-but plentiful- walking dead. Whether they're used as a cheap workforce, or meatshields to blunt an offensive, they're certainly useful."
2219,,800,Faceless One’s Corpse,Skulduggery Pleasant,Making,"It seems that the corpse Baron Vengeous found wasn’t the only one. This is a corpse of a Faceless One, an eldritch abomination, one of many that has existed for quite a long time. Somehow, this one died and its corpse has come into your possession. In the past, one of these was used as the basis for a patchwork monster made from several different creatures and sorcerers. The resulting creature was known as the Grotesquery, a nigh-unstoppable abomination that obeyed only the commands of its master. What you do with it is up to you. It’s rather expensive, owing to the fact that it is the corpse of a ‘god’."
2220,,800,Collector,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Making,"Gold as far as the eye can see. A endless sea of treasures, like an desert where every dune is a
mound containing the legends of a hundred different tales. Before you is a great golden portal in the
air, within which these endless treasures constantly shift and swirl before you. It is like a Gate, one
that leads to the source of so much wonder. All that you can see is now yours and it is even more
valuable than you might think at first.

The power you now possess is to be the Collector of all of Humanity’s creations. Every invention, every making, every forging, every last creation that mankind has created, is creating or will create is
found within this endless vault of space. However, this only applies to singular creations. Any
mundane and magical weapon or vehicle or potion or book or armour or anything else in that vein
can be found present in here. However, outright locations cannot be found. While one may find the
individual buildings in a city or collective fortress, they would not find the city itself. Nor will the
vault contain things that are merely slight alterations to non-human objects. A mountain that has a
castle on it or a stone stuck to a stick. Mankind has created a great many things but for it to apply to
your vault’s contents, it must be wholly a creation of man. A metal blade might be made from
natural materials but it has been shaped and altered thoroughly through human processes. A last
note on the contents of the vault, is that anything retained within it will not be harmful, even if it
normally should be, to the owner of the vault while within this space and that you are able to use
anything within this space, regardless of the normal conditions some magical items may have for
their users.

You can summon the vault’s portals with a few moments concentration or through the turning of
one of several golden keys from within this vault that you can obtain. These portals can be made
anywhere within your sight range, even should you not be looking where you form them at the
moment, and are very quick to open. While you do not know the exact nature or presence of
everything within the dimensional space, you can instantly call anything from the vault to your
person as you wish and search within it for anything that fits any kind of specifications you have in mind. With just a thought, you can even organise the space and it’s contents however you might
choose. Setting it up as a great golden museum instead of the endless desert of treasure, for
example.

Once you have opened the portal to your vault once, you can freely continue to open them at an
incredible pace within your range, even dozens at once or enormous portals through which an entire
castle could pass. Through these portals, you can bring forth anything within your vault, no matter
how large or how far in. You may also choose to fire out things from within the vault, with the
maximum speed that you can do so rising with your magical power. Even at a base level however, you can fire the smaller objects within at the speed of sound. Anything that exits the vault can be
instantly retrieved with just a thought, replacing it within the vault due to the effects of an artefact. Due to the same magical item within the vault, anything that is sourced from the vault originally will
slowly repair or, if destroyed, reappear entirely within the vault over the course of a few days. Items
made for single uses however will not repair or reappear.

The final and perhaps most notable attribute of this quality of yours is that your vault has not ceased
growing. While the space only draws from this current timeline and world, as you travel to new
worlds or timelines, you will find that the space you have access to will fill itself with all the
achievements of humanity from each new world and timeline at an instant."
2221,,1000,Artifacts of Karsus,Baldur's Gate 3,Making,"Which archdevil’s vault did you rob to get this artifact jumper? Within your hands rests
an artifact of immense power. It can even topple gods themselves and it already had as a matter
of fact. You get one of the three artifacts of the legendary wizard Karsus, which he used to
ascend to the godhood. You can only take this item once and pick a single one these artifacts.
Also, your companions can’t purchase this item.
First artifact is the Crown of Karsus. This three-pronged jet-black crown magically
floats above your head, if placed upon it. Netherstones dot the center of each prong of the crown.
This crown is an incredible power amplifier. It can turn a squire into a great knight, a wizard’s
apprentice into an archmage and so on. If we were to put it to numbers, it boosts your overall
powers’ (physical and magical) and skills potency about five times and this number will
increase more you attune yourself to the crown, eventually capping at an order of magnitude.
Not only it boosts your prowess and skill, but it also provides you with boundless potential in
any subject you devote yourself to. This crown also has another function. Using the netherstones
placed in the crown, you can fully dominate a single being that wears the crown. Once you
target a being this way, the crown immediately flies above their heads and they will be fully
controlled by you, no matter how powerful they are compared to you. Sheer willpower and
mental prowess will provide a great deal of resistance though and some beings can even
overtake your mind. Be careful of how you use this power jumper.
Second artifact is the Orb of Karsus. This orb, to simply put, is a magical battery. But
this battery can hold magical power up to entire span of the Weave. For context, this means
practically infinite magical energy for any mortal being. It continuously absorbs energy from
the atmosphere without a need for any input. It can be used to power any ritual or arcane
machinery forever, but it can only power a single process at a time. This orb can be melded
within your chest and act as your own personally magical battery, you can also detach it with a
single thought. While you are melded with this orb, your spellcasting energy (arcane, psionic,
divine all of them...) is colossal. You can cast a mighty spell like fireball all day without a
single break, and only then you would be able to deplete a noticeable percent of this orb’s total
energy. However, this energy isn’t infinite, and rituals of godly power can still deplete its energy.

Even then it only takes couple of hours for it to recharge up to its full capacity. As a last resort
you can cause all of the energy stored within this orb to erupt with a single thought. Resulting
explosion will be cataclysmic, it will be flatten out an area equal to a metropole city. This ability
cannot be used by anyone other than the owner of the orb. Additionally, this version of the orb
works as intended and you don’t have to feed it like Gale’s orb.
Third artifact is the Scepter of Karsus. This is the most mysterious of Karsus’ artifacts,
but it is equal to other two in terms of power, nonetheless. This scepter has the ability to regulate
the flow of magic perfectly. It acts as an excellent spellcasting focus and will boost the potency
and efficiency of your magical spells threefold. You can imbue spells within this scepter for
casting them later, without any resource expenditure on your part. It can only hold a single spell
at a time and that spell can only be cast once per day this way. It seems underwhelming
compared to other two so far, right? But the true power of this artifact lies elsewhere, these are
only the side effects. This artifact can discharge and unmake any kind of magical energy at your
will. This means that you can negate any spell and magical effect with a single wave of this
scepter. It can even disenchantment magical items including artifacts. You can create zones of
dead magic, where no spell can be cast, either temporarily or permanently. Finally, if you were
to touch someone with this scepter, you can cut them from magic. This means they lose any
magical effects they have and lose any spellcasting they have access to. With a brief touch this
could only last for couple minutes at most, but with extended exposure you can take away their
magic permanently.
None of these artifacts can be taken from you unwillingly, they are fully bound to your
soul, cannot ever be lost, damaged or destroyed. Only by your choice these objects can be given
to another. Also, if you were to possess all three of these artifacts at the same time, you may
attempt to ascend to godhood. Be careful though, this ritual is immensely dangerous and has a
very high chance of failure. Failure creates a grand magical cataclysm and then turns you into
a stone, ending your chain, if you don’t possess any 1-ups. Ascending means you become equal
to greater deities of the Forgotten Realms setting but it ends your jumpchain here and there,
binding you to your local multiverse for you to act as its deity.
Now temper your ambitions jumper and take an example from Karsus. Otherwise in
time your actions may come to be known as Jumper’s Folly."
2222,,1000,Monkey King’s Implements,The God of High School Jump,Making,"The great Monkey King had four mythical artefacts that accompanied him on his war against the Gods of Heaven and each of these are now made available to you for purchase, granting you perfect copies of the weapons that are loyal to only you. Each artefact is a separate purchase, though every purchase after the second is discounted to 500, for Demon origin takers and for non-demon origin takers.

The first and most famous. Ruyi Jingu Bang, also known as Yeoui. A silver Bo staff, it is imbued with many great abilities. It can change its length at the owners command, from being small enough to use as a toothpick or fit behind one’s ear to extending from the surface of the Earth to several times beyond the Moon, this change of distance happening almost instantaneously. The width and thickness of the staff may also increase at the user’s will, enlargening to stay proportional to its greater lengths. This lengthening power can be used in combat to blow through enemies, even piercing through and destroying whole planets. Its weight can also alter as the owner commands, becoming as light as air or so heavy that even Uriel, a Goddess who held up a planet with little issue, had her arms torn off by trying to hold it in the air. Yeoui returns to its masters hand when called, either teleporting back or flying towards them, destroying everything in its path as it travels at terrific speeds. The staff itself is almost completely indestructible, the only two beings who have managed to damage it being the First Prince of Natak, leader of the war gods, and the Jade Emperor using the Blade of Tathagata. One being, 666:Satan, was able to destroy the staff, but fear not as the implement will regenerate to its full health in a few hours of being broken.

Then there is the Kinto-Un. A cloud that the owner may call to their service, no matter where they are. It will even appear in the depths of space. This cloud can be used for transportation, travelling at absurd speeds even considered against the speeds achieved by Gods and Demons but its main purpose is the raw offensive power. It allows the user to manipulate storm related events, such as creating and controlling winds strong enough to hold up an entire continent, calling down an almost limitless number of lightning bolts with each able to damage even the powerful Gods of this world and being able to create fog so thick it cannot be seen or passed through except by the strongest of beings. However, the Kinto-Un is powered by the user’s life energy and abilities such as its lightning calling power will create a great drain on the power of the user.

Next is the Crimson Gourd. Taking the form of a small gourd, tiny enough to be fully held in one hand, it is able to absorb attacks and seal away monsters on a vast scale. The Gourd is nearly indestructible, with not even the First Prince of Natak scratching it, and is able to absorb any sort of energy attack fired at the user, with no discovered limit on how much it can store. The second use allows it to suck up and seal away monsters of every sort. In a single command of the wielder, it was able to suck up every single monkey in the Monkey Country of the Sage Realm at once and has no difficulty sealing monsters of almost any kind, though those of sufficient power can resist the call. Gods may also resist, whether through raw power or through being in their true forms.

Finally, the armour and garments of the Monkey King, Yongpyo. When not actively worn it takes the form of a shifting mass of black energy and when worn, it may take the appearance of any clothing the user desires. When worn as clothing, it is an armour unsurpassed by any form of defence save a Barbadium body, and is still capable of working as a powerful shield even when all combatants are flinging about attacks that can destroy whole worlds. The armour massively enhances all of the user’s physical abilities, propelling even a mortal to Godlike levels. It is partially sentient and acts to protect its master even when they are not aware of attacks, changing form to block attacks. The armour is also capable of at least two transformations, with possibly more to be discovered. The first is the Boost Mode, which creates wings and jets on the armour, multiplying the speed of the user several times over. The second is Power Mode, bulking the armour up greatly and in return granting a significant multiplier to the user’s strength. Yongpyo may also be loaned to other people or recalled in an instant.

Boosted: While purchasing these options will grant you the chosen implements as normal, it will now act as an immense boost in power to one of your own personal implements, one of the 2-4 things that you gained by taking the capstone booster. This boosted thing will vastly outmatch even the Monkey King's tools, which will be used for examples. The Ruyi Jingu Bang would become tough enough that even 666 Satan, the God who would eventually shatter it, could not even scratch it at his best and be capable of stretching from Earth to Pluto in an instant. The Kinto-Un would make its’ original speed seem like molasses while being able of summoning lightning that can shatter large parts of a planet with each individual bolt whilst the winds it brings could scour a planet to dust in a minute at tops. The Crimson Gourd could store any matter at all, sucking away even entire planets to store within its’ depths until recalled. The user would also gain great power over the space within, becoming able of warping it almost as desired, though not entirely limitless. Yongpyo would become many hundreds or even thousands of times more durable and gain not only vastly increased transformations but several addition ones, boosting various other traits of the user. Whatever your implement may be, it receives a similarly massive boost. You can optionally choose to simply boost the Monkey King Implement you received instead of boosting one of your own.

Boost Requires Reincarnation(High God) to Activate

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
2223,,1000,Black Grail,Fate/Stay Night,Making,"Much like another child from ten years ago, you were implanted with fragments of a Lesser Grail, the initial and weaker form of the Holy Grail. Much like the Grail itself, these fragments held the essence of Angra Mainyu, but that being's mind does not seem to be active in your fragments. In fact, somehow you have managed to gain both full maturity of these powers and retain your full sanity. 

These fragments have bestowed multiple incredible powers onto you. First is an astonishing level of regeneration, enough that most wounds that would kill a human heal in minutes whilst something as extreme as bisection or organ destruction would only take a day or so to heal fully. While you are not connected to the Greater Grail and thus lack the nigh infinite prana Matou Sakura gained, you still possess an immense storage of it. Enough to equal an Servant with an EX rank in Mana with ease, if not surpass them though it will take some time to be able to use it all as at first you can only channel the equivalent to the number of Magical Circuits you possess in any one instance of spell casting. This limit will increase over time and use until it disappears completely. You've also gained the ability to create and manipulate the Black Mud in vast amounts, enough to cover multiple city blocks with ease, though actively expending magical energy can create more if you do not have enough naturally. This Mud contains the essence of All the World's Evils, though not quite every sin as Angra Mainyu himself does, and can quickly break the minds of any human it touches. It can also shaped as the user pleases, forming weapons, shields, attacks and more. The mud also allows you to drain energy from spiritual beings at an incredible rate or to cover them fully in the mud and corrupt them into Alter servants of yourself, the mud making them into blackened versions of themselves with increased power, aggression and loyalty to you. You may also form the Black Mud into animated familiars or warriors, each of which has a low level of intelligence but absolute obedience to you. The presence of this Black Mud and what lays within it has also made you extremely resistant to any attempts to control or read your mind, as those who try must dig through a portion of All the World's Evil to see into your own mind. This resistance also applies to attempts to corrupt you with supernatural substances, the existing presence of the Mud, even if it does not corrupt you, allowing you to shrug off most attempts."
2224,,1000,Telos Karma,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Oh, the sadness. This has the ability to forcibly create and enforce options and choices that aren't possible normally, changing the possibility of certain phenomena into unexpected events. In short, it can manipulate the karma of the people, objects, and even world at large. This shows, for example, to having an experienced warrior experience failures and unusual surroundings, leaving them unable to react to something as simple as a thrown stone. Something sure becomes probably, something impossible sure, something possible into probable, and so and so."
2225,,1000,Sephiroth Graal,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Better known as the ‘Holy Grail’, this Sacred Gear is a decorated golden goblet that grants complete understanding of life, death and the soul to the user - right down to its creation and how to manifest it. This is potent enough that the will of said user could be broken from its overuse, unless they possessed very strong willpower. From the power to control the principals of life, the Sephiroth Graal can summon and control souls as it was used to bring revive the long dead, can strengthen others, or remove their racial weaknesses, heal, restore youth, bypass seals, and so on."
2226,,1000,Regulus Nemea,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Containing a legendary Nemean Lion within, this mighty axe is strong enough to break open clean fissures in the earth with a good swing and full mastery of this weapon is said to give the user the potential to split planet Earth in two. This also protects the user from projectile attacks, forcing opponents to brave the melee or find a different way to stop the oncoming onslaught. The Balance Breaker of the Nemea creates a golden armor around the user, giving them the physical strength and durability of the axe itself, and fully shielding them from projectile blows. It will take time and mastery to manifest this might for long, however."
2227,,1000,Divine Dividing,HighSchool DxD,Making,"A rival to Boosted Gear, as it contains the dragon Albion, who was the sworn enemy of Ddraig back in the day. This Gear manifests as a pair of wings that enables the user to fly. Like the Boosted Gear, it has greater-than-average evolutionary potential even among other Longinus, but instead of directly increasing the user’s power, it has an ability called Divide. It halves the power of anyone or anything the user targets, and adds it to their own. Excess energy is expelled through the wings, and thus can be discharged completely or in part to protect the user. However, constant use of power at the user’s absolute limit can be damaging to their bodies. The Balance Breaker enables the user to form Scale Mail around their bodies."
2228,,1000,Boosted Gear,HighSchool DxD,Making,"This Longinus contains the Welsh Dragon Ddraig, appearing as a draconic red gauntlet around the user’s arm. It has perhaps the most explosive potential for growth, having one of the strongest Dragons in this world powering it. It starts with Boost, which will double the user’s power every ten seconds until they reach their physical limit, and then can release this stored power in an Explosion. Its Balance Breaker creates Scale Mail, a powerful draconic armor that greatly increases the durability of the user and the Gear’s powers, removing the need to wait 10 seconds for the next boost."
2229,,1000,True Longinus,HighSchool DxD,Making,"It's the most holy weapon in existence, provides enough raw power that can be used to immediately make gods bleed, even in a normal human's hands. It can massively weaken any demonic being or effect merely by being in its presence. It also has a power known as ""Truth Idea"", which takes in the ambitions and will of the user, mixes it with the dying will of the biblical God, and then manifests a miracle. If your will is strong enough and the biblical god agrees with you, it can basically blast just about anything out of existence or grant godlike blessings onto your allies...but the biblical god can actively disagree with you when using it, causing it to fail or have unpredictable effects."
2230,,1000,Excalibur,HighSchool DxD,Making,"Originally the sword of legend wielded by the original King Arthur, this fantastic Holy Sword possessed not one but several abilities that made it a bane of the unholy. However, it was shattered in the distant past, and reforged into different blades containing a fragment of its power. If you get them all (or pay 1000cp for the finished product) you may obtain the full Excalibur, powerful enough to let you fight gods. Here are the seven fragments made into different swords and the legendary sheath:

Excalibur Destruction:
Sometimes simple is best, and what’s simpler than a big sword that can smash a room-sized crater into the Earth with its strength? This two-handed weapon’s power is simple: a fantastic amount of destructive power in each swing of the blade. Naturally, it will hurt Devils and their kin all the more with a direct blow.

Excalibur Transparency:
You can’t hit what you can’t see, right? This Excalibur has the special ability to turn itself or the user invisible. Hm? And what? That’s it. Not all of these are that impressive, you know.

Excalibur Mimic:
Why just one kind of sword, though? Why not, say, a katana? Or a zweihander? Or even a blade made entirely out of molten light?! The power of this iteration allows the user to change the blade into any size, shape, or material they desire, even other objects or life-sized replicas of living beings...though, obviously, those won’t really be alive or do anything without the user’s input. However, the more complex the form, the more training and refinement is needed with the sword’s power - you will start with being able to transform it into different sword shapes or even mundane objects, but larger and increasingly exotic forms will take longer to master

Excalibur Blessing:
This version of Excalibur is perhaps the ‘holiest’ of the bunch, and better used as a ritual aid than a weapon. Its power relates directly to the faith of the user in the religion of the God of the Bible, enhancing the power of blessings and greatly damaging or weakening devils when used together with ritual. Oddly, this version lets this effect apply to all ‘holy’ magic or faiths from this jump onwards, so long as they fit the same themes.

Excalibur Rapidly:
Speedy, aren’t we? This blade has another simple power, but a potent one - it enhances the speed of both itself and the user, moving faster than the eye can follow and can create phantom after-images that make them difficult to predict. It also creates enhanced flexibility, letting the user better avoid attacks or danger.

Excalibur Nightmare:
Another simple ability, this Excalibur has the ability to create illusions from the ether as well as manipulate the dreams of others. Very good for sleep therapy or Halloween parties! And, you know, misdirection in combat.

Excalibur Ruler:
Said to be the strongest of the seven Excaliburs, this blade is the embodiment of ‘ruling’ over both sentient beings and objects, able to subjugate and control both according to the user’s will. Stubborn or strong-willed beings will need to be weakened considerably before they can be bent to the user’s will, but if they can establish and maintain control, this subjugation may well become permanent as long as the control is kept in place for a long enough time.

Excalibur's Scabbard:
The legendary holy sheath and main component of the true Excalibur. It provides the user with increased durability to the point of being semi-invulnerable, as well as granting the user enhanced healing and regeneration abilities to the point of being considered immortality. If wielded by a devil it would grant him enough capacity to take on blows from gods of light without flinching, and such other feats. A formidable weapon waiting for the right wielder."
2231,,1000,The Swords ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Making,"A set of powerful artifact swords, each attuned to two of the colors of Mana in the Multiverse. Each of them costs 400CP- Discounted by Origin as usual- though the bulk purchase may be obtained for an undiscounted 700CP for Mirrans and a 1000CP for the Phyrexian origins. You may import a weapon you already own into this item to gain its powers instead.

-Sword of War and Peace:
A sword of black steel, with a perfectly round guard and two blades- one shining with divine light, the other burning with pure flame. Each attack with this sword invigorates you, closing wounds and mending flesh- and burning your enemies, the flames growing more vicious when fighting those who would be lords and hedonists

-Sword of Feast and Famine:
A iron-colored, though definitely not mundane sword with spikes on the guard. It's blade glows with black and green energy, each blow sapping at the will and focus of the enemy and regenerating any pools of power you may have, granting you renewed strength to strike them down. It seems to be even more effective when used against beasts and the undead, eating away at their corrupted flesh.

-Sword of Body and Mind:
A sword with a thick guard and horns sprouting from beneath the sides of the blade, a blue and green sheen illuminating its split blade. Whenever a foe is struck, the green glow flows into the air, forming ghostly wolves that follow your orders until the battle is over, before promptly vanishing, each bite breaking the enemy's concentration, as if eating the ideas right out of their mind. It seems to be even more powerful when used against schemers and great beasts.

-Sword of Fire and Ice:
A sword with an elaborate twisting pommel and decorative guard, it's split blade glowing with a cold, humming blue and with roaring red flames. Strikes against a foe have the hungry flame leap to nearby enemies, and just holding the blade fills your mind with a cold focus, allowing you to think clearly in the heat of battle. It's power only seems to grow when opposing impulsive forces and those who rely most on their magic.

-Sword of Light and Shadow:
Larger than any of the other blades, this weapon glows with an unearthly darkness, contrasted by divine light. Defeating foes with it seems to imbue their bodies with a fraction of the shadow, allowing the wielder to spend some of their energy to raise them as obedient dead- and the divine light seems to shield the user as they cleave through enemies, keeping their wounds from reopening or bleeding,no matter how dire. It seems to grow to its true strength when facing divine or infernal beasts-or what used to be that way."
2232,,1100,Custom Sacred Gear(Longinus),HighSchool DxD,Making,"Time to bring out the big guns. Sacred Gears are also known as ‘God’s Artifacts’ and are part of the Judeo-Christian God’s system to enact miracles on Earth. It’s known that only humans (and rarely human-hybrids) are born with them. Powered by the desires of the user, adapting, and evolving based on their wielder's thoughts, needs, and feelings, gaining abilities or qualities as time passes. This is also how they can enter Balance Breaker, a state also known as the Forbidden Move, which is the strongest manifestation of the SG, and a form that goes beyond the initial plan of its creator.

The effects, abilities and powers they have are incredibly varied. From the relatively common Twice Critical, to the unique ones like Twilight Healing, to the Longinus – a group of powerful Sacred Gears said to be capable of killing a god.

Does the sparse list of options I present to you seem disappointing? Do you want something a little more...unique for a Sacred Gear? Look no further. You may design and create a single Sacred Gear of your choosing with this option. The price will depend on its effects, based on the options below...a simple but useful utility effect or single combat ability will have a base price of 200, a Sacred Gear capable of manipulating others or natural forces or creating permanent items from thin air would be around 400, while a Gear with various different abilities or simple but extremely powerful combat power will be about 600. Creating a new Longinus will cost about 1000, same as the others - these are game-changing artifacts with a host of various abilities that can elevate a mere human to be an equal to the greatest beings in the Great War, if used and trained correctly. Add 100 to that base price (base price is the one discounted if applied) and that will be your price for your personal Sacred Gear."
2233,,1200,Crimson Gem of Cyttorak,X-Men the Claremont Years,Making,"The same gem that would give Juggernaut his power. This gem transforms its user into a more muscled version of themselves, granting them a forcefield which is seemingly invulnerable to physical force, even Thor and Mjolnir could not hammer through this forcefield. It does remain potentially vulnerable to magic, whether spells that circumvent it or how Mjolnir was able to temporarily drain the magic of the forcefield, and it does nothing to protect you from telepathic assault. It grants you strength that although less than Thor’s own, would still allow you to face off against him, and its magic makes you something of an irresistible force, able to push through any physical barrier by simply walking through it. Some barriers will slow you more than others, and if you’re unable to move at all it may take even more time, but even completely buried and sealed in cement you would be able to walk your way out through the ground with time. Which brings up the fact that the forcefield seems to prevent you needing to breathe.

Finally while the gem is absorbed within you, you are able to summon mystical armor at will. This armor offers a little protection if your forcefield is negated or disabled, and you may import armor into this mystical armor. The forcefield, however, will not protect your armor against attacks directed at it."
2234,,1600,Tenth Metal,DC Comics,Making,"You have seen it’s flawed alloys. Now behold: The purest form of creation itself, the limitless fire
of the Fourth World which can fabricate anything by actualizing pure possibility. With thought
alone it can take any shape and augment existing weapons, as well as shape and materialize
anything the wielder believes hard enough in-and amplifies those who don it with the sheer
strength of their will. With extremely close communion with Element X comes a cosmic
awareness of events throughout the universe, moments yet to come and a deep communion to
all of existence. And that is merely the raw, unrefined form of the metal. Worked by skilled
hands, it is the power source for much of 4th World’s technology: From the Mother Boxes, to the
Mobius Chair, to the Miracle Machine itself.
You have several crates of the Tenth Metal, also known as Element X. Do not fret about lacking
a weapon; volatile as it is, you need only dip your hand into it to clad yourself in arms and armor
befitting your fighting style which can literally fight through impossible odds and cut cosmic foes
down in size."
