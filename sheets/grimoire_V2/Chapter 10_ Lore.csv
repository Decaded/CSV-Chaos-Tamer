1,,Free,Scholar,Final Fantasy XI,Lore,"During the Crystal War, these military tacticians often served as high-ranking officers in allied forces across Vana'diel. Extensive knowledge of ancient martial theory granted Scholars the ability to wield dual schools of magic, between which they would alternate depending on the situation at hand."
2,,Free,Habitual Intruder,The Old Republic,Lore,"You have a habit and talent for getting into places, files, and situations you're not wanted. You're an Expert
slicer, opening locked doors with ease and extracting sensitive files from heavily-encrypted computers
without leaving a trace, provided you can secure hardware access. That access is easier than ever, as well,
given your knack for finding convenient shortcuts through vents, waste chutes, and unused spaces, or
targeting the human element and conning your way past unsuspecting security officers; you're a
Proficient liar, mechanic, and saboteur. As a final bonus, you're more likely than normal to arrive just in
time to hear, see, or interfere with things your enemies would have preferred you missed.
You've also been around long enough to know that sometimes, things don't go smooth. If all else fails,
you're an Expert with Vibroknives and holdout weapons. You're also Proficient with all non-weapon
equipment you bought with CP this Jump, regardless of whether it was discounted or not."
3,,Free,Veteran Field Medic,The Old Republic,Lore,"Whether you're a soldier killing for a cause or a hunter killing for money, you've chosen a dangerous life.
What better way to make sure you come out on top than knowing how to put you and yours back together
again? While not exactly a family doctor, you're an Expert at battlefield medicine and triage, and can
evaluate patients and render aid twice as fast as normal, no matter how chaotic the environment or how
advanced or primitive the supplies available to you.
Speaking of supplies, you're able to stretch whatever you have on hand farther
than should be possible. When applying any form of aid or healing, you
consume only one quarter as much of any limited resource for the same
amount of benefit, whether it be practical items like gauze and antiseptic,
magical items like healing potions, or metaphysical resources like 'mana'"
4,,Free,The New Chess,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Lore,"Never worry about finding yourself and your friends on a bored afternoon again. You’re a genius at
creating games to amuse or challenge yourself or others, through almost any medium imaginable. Physical sport games, card games, games linked to the supernatural powers that you or others have. They’ll be well made, with fair rules without loopholes or easy cheats unless you desire them to be
and most of all, they’ll actually be pretty fun to play even on your own. Good Style practice too if you
go for the word games. "
5,,Free,Thinker (Multitask),Worm CYOA v17,Lore,"You can give your full focus to several things at the same time without difficulty. The amount of things you are able to focus on varies depending on how mentally taxing each task is, so you might be able to hold only 2 or 3 conversations at once but you could do a dozen minor tasks simultaneously. You are still limited by your physical capability to do multiple things at once; you only have so many hands after all."
6,,Free,Lore Mastery,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"You possess an adaptive understanding of most customs, with only the most obscure or alternative eluding your grasp without sufficient knowledge. While it’s not a big loss if you don’t take this, it would be all too sad for you to lose your head only because you forgot to bow to a king, or being burned at stake for asking a priest for a buff, or being beaten by local dryads for dirty jokes. Thankfully you now have a little bit of local common sense: knowledge of customs and traditions, an overview of history, and an understanding of how to act without provoking the locals. "
7,,Free,Woodscraft,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"You have skills in almost anything that pertains to the​ woods​ or forest, especially in making one's way through the​ woods​ or in hunting, trapping, etc. Expect to be more than capable of making your way through environments that may be especially hostile, so if you’ve got a Monster or some other manner of beast lurking around you’ll be sure to know long before it catches your scent. 
"
8,,Free,Horsemanship,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"Unlike what video games may tell you horses are not medieval cars, riding all day at maximum speed and putting them the in the ​garage​ stable is a good way to lose your steed and they cost a lot, sometimes so much so that your own life is cheaper. However, you’ll now find that possess the skills to care for and ride these magnificent beasts, and somehow being capable of always taking care of them, even if at bare minimum. "
9,,Free,Common tongue,The Song of the Nibelungs,Lore,"Wherever you are in Europe or the world at large and wherever you travel you will have no problem speaking with the locals. This may be because all of you speak an unidentified lingua franca, a common language, or because you instinctively know all the different languages spoken around the continent by heart. In future worlds you may be able to understand and speak most common languages you may come in contact with."
10,,Free,Divinity,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"It was the light of Flame that drew those hollow beings in, giving them the opportunity to become something great enough to challenge the everlasting. Your soul was bound to light, marking you as one of the gods who follow the Great Lord Gwyn. Not only is your form as captivating as light itself is, rarely muddied or marred, but your mind has been illuminated, allowing you to learn and master whatever skill you desire faster than most."
11,,Free,Words of Magic,Marvel Midnight Suns,Lore,"Magic is the catch all term for energies that specific people can manipulate. This is usually done through spells and phrases that have mystical meaning. Now as a child of Lilith who can be conferred was a powerful witch before being corrupted you can use magic. There is a wide range of spells but you don’t have the expertise and specialty of other users like Doctor Strange or Magik.

Magic users have a niche of abilities and yours through this perk is Witchcraft. Witchcraft is heavily connected to the energies of the earth and usually comes from the goddess of Witchcraft but yours is fate-backed."
12,,Free,Magic        ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore,Given how important Dr. Strange and the other practitioners of the mystical arts are here it would be a shame if you couldn’t learn magic. This perk will grant you an average affinity with the various types of magic used here and skill equal to the average member of Kamar-Taj.
13,,Free,The Basics,Generic Alchemist ,Lore,"You have the minimum knowledge to be considered an alchemist. You know how to perform the seven alchemical processes (Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Fermentation, Distillation, and Coagulation), what the five elements are (Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and Aether), and you know the three reagents (Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt). You also know the interplay of Mind, Spirit, and Body."
14,,Free,Beginner's spellbooks,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,You receive a satchel of books that hold the simplest spells for each of the three spellcasting classes. They are very straightforward in application and offer little outside combat applications. 
15,,Free,Eureka Moment,Bloodborne,Lore,"“It seems to occur so often, a sudden breakthrough that comes from agonizing work and failure. It’s never quite the way you expect, just a dawning realization, a new way of looking things. For some, it comes much too late, hopefully that’s not the case for you. 

As you work on perfecting some new scientific procedure, replicating a phenomenon from the world around you, or discover some hidden truth, signs seem to crop up around you. These signs can come in any form, but always inspire sudden awareness or point you in the right direction to hasten progress.”"
16,,Free,Basic Deck ,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"All mages start with the basics, no matter how... lacking in spectacle they might be. You receive a collection of moderately useful spells suitable for your magical specialization and purchases in this jump. Including a variety of summoned creatures, enchantments, sorceries and other such temporary effects, as well as a number of mana bonds to lands rich in mana, it’s everything you need to get started and sufficient to have at least a beginner’s chance in any mage-duels you might find yourself in. That said, you may wish to look for better spells and other improvements, as this collection on its own won’t be enough to excel."
17,,Free,IS MAITH SIN! ,Wolfwalkers,Lore,"You are fluent in Irish Gaelige, and in future Jumps in all languages present in the setting. It’s flippin’ great."
18,,Free,Fairy Fluent ,Peter Pan,Lore,"You can naturally understand the tinkling, bell-like language of fairies, and also know how to teach people to understand the language. It is the most wonderful of tongues, sounding like the sweetest, most innocent bells whether you are professing love and rudely insulting somebody. However, unless you are a Fairy, you cannot speak it in turn, unless you pay 100 CP extra.
"
19,,Free,Elementary Thaumaturgy,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You know the most basic levels of magecraft. You can
use the most basic forms of Structural Analysis, Gradation Air, Reinforcement, and
Alteration. You have the beginnings of an understanding of the laws of magic in general,
but don’t expect to outclass anyone but Shirou Emiya. Some of the more haughty mages
will resent referring to you as a mage at all."
20,,Free,Family Research,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"Every magus lineage has some focus, some subject they’re
studying, such as the biology of a specific Phantasmal Species, mystical archeology, the
human genome, the interaction between Paracalus’s alchemy and the Periodic Table,
astronomy, or the inner workings of Mystic Eyes. Whether you inherited it or stole it, you may pick one such focus here, and gain a vast well of knowledge pertaining to it -
enough to rival an accredited doctor if there is such a thing. At base there is little
mystical benefit to this knowledge, but as your magical skills improve it will grant you
access to numerous mysteries that are either unusually powerful or extremely difficult to
replicate using modern thaumaturgy. Some of those shall be the fruit of your family’s
research, some will be the tools necessary to continue it. It’s nowhere near enough to
reach the Root, but maybe someday, if you keep at it. Additionally, some Thaumaturgic
Attribute - probably one that resonates with your family research - has been passed
down your bloodline, like any magus lineage, which adds “meaning” to elemental
magecraft, making it many times more effective and versatile, and may even open up
otherwise-impossible options, though you cannot claim the most impressive canonical
examples such as Tradition Carriers and Wish-granting with this perk alone. Like
elements, these can be changed, but never casually. Known attributes include swords,
sisters, opening wounds, the flow and transfer of power, and absorption, so you can pick
just about anything you can imagine. Just remember that having “almighty” as your
Sorcery Trait won’t actually make you almighty, though the Queen of the Clocktower
might have something to say on the subject."
21,,Free,Mark of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Lore,"Either on your body or permanently upon your soul, Tzeentch leaves a mark of his claim on your service. The Mark of Tzeentch causes your intellect to swell massively, and you’ll find that even the most difficult mental tasks are child’s play to you. You can easily translate languages that are completely new to you with even a small amount of information on the language itself, and information that would threaten the sanity of a stern mind is easily accepted by you as a simple truth, nothing more. Lastly, you have the basic capacity to utilize the Winds of Magic, and you are a decent sorcerer currently.
"
22,,Free,The Learner​ ,Persona 4,Lore,"Well, as you're certainly the newcomer here in this world, you've got a lot to learn. You learn new things 10 times as fast until you reach what would be considered an average level of proficiency. You also get a flat ×2 multiplier to any form of learning or training that you do. You can also learn innate traits of other beings, although it will be harder to do so than normal."
23,,Free,That Who Records​ ,Persona 4,Lore,"You now have the ability to summon your own compendium at will. As long as you are helping someone grow, you can record a copy of any of their powers at will. You may only use these when you are directly fighting against them in order to test them or help them grow (unless you have Wielder of Power), but these can be used to restore their power if they ever lose it or it lessens below the level you have recorded. This applies for any powers they may have, including physical abilities, skills, and supernatural powers like personas. Furthermore, as long as you have one example of a specific skill in your compendium, you or anyone you are helping will learn that skill at ten times the normal rate until you reach the level your recorded power is at."
24,,Free,Academy Training,Naruto,Lore,"You now have all of the training and knowledge of a new Academy graduate. This includes practical ninja skills such as survival training, trap making, and stealth. You are familiar with basic ninja tools and weaponry such as storage scrolls, exploding notes, kunai, shuriken, and ninja wire. You’ve also received training on manipulating your chakra. You can use it to reinforce your muscles to give you greater speed and strength than a civilian. You can flare your chakra to dispel genjutsu. And you can perform three basic ninjutsu techniques including an intangible clone technique, a replacement technique, and a transformation technique. Finally, you have mastered the standard taijutsu style of your village with enough skill to fight off civilians with ease."
25,,50,Trade Skill,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"You possess the knowledge of any one late medieval skill, with a minor reputation boost in regards toward your mastery of it, that of a journeyman. Have you considered Blacksmithing or Masonry? ​You have the training of a tradesman, being of at least journeyman skill in whatever trade you pick. This would allow you to be successful in your trade in the level needed for a town or a village, but insufficient for a larger city with a resident master. Each Trade you choose must be an appropriate medieval trade (tanner, potter, brewer, hunter, blacksmith, scribe, etc.)."
26,,50,Heroic Histories,Fate/Stay Night,Lore,"You received a small but thick book, detailing the true history of either your chosen Servant or one of the many other Heroic Spirits that exist in this universe. It will tell every story, myth, tale and legends that is true about your chosen character, in an entertaining and easy to digest manner. It holds no knowledge of magical secrets or advantages and is simply a surprisingly knowledgeable story book. Perhaps you could embarrass your new friend with some of the less flattering tales about them. "
27,,50,An Ancient Language Dictionary,Inheritance Cycle,Lore,"At the beginning, the endless pages of this book are empty but as you learn more of the Ancient Language, it will fill up with the knowledge of that word including proper grammar and such. Post-Jump, this book will act as a true Dictionary and Encyclopedia that fills itself as your adventures continue on. The book itself will always open directly to the page you desire to read, and is never larger than an ordinary dictionary."

38,,50,The Jumper Files,The Dresden Files,Lore,"It's a box of empty file folders. Didn't see that one coming, did you? Of course, that's not how it's going to stay forever. Any time you do something majorly noteworthy, one of these folders will start to fill itself in, generally with pages written in your own hand but sometimes scraps, photographs, and other interesting things. It's nothing you couldn't have filled in yourself, but when it's done, it'll be a complete record of your cases, start to finish. Can either be written as if it were your own autobiography, or from your perspective but ghostwritten by Jim B... er... Harry Dresden."
39,,50,"""Teacher's Pyromancy Tome""",Dark Souls 3,Lore,"""What's a teacher without a pupil?"" A large, empty tome with an ability that aids in passing down the art of Pyromancy. When a Pyromancy Spell you know is written down in the book, a number of notes that break it down, simplify it and aid in explaining it scrawl themselves out to join it. The relationship of teacher and pupil is an old one in the Great Swamp, but not all can teach. For people who have the desire to follow the lead of their predecessors, there's this tome."
40,,50,Mystical Tomes,Elden Ring,Lore,"Aha! Something of a student of the mystic arts, are we? With each purchase here you may collect a small shelf’s worth of notable mystic tomes from this land, your choice of those concerning incantations and those detailing the principles of sorcery. It may still take a learned cleric to fully elucidate the lightning incantations from that ancient dragon prayerbook or a skilled sorcerer to teach you the spells stored on a scroll written by the Carian royal family, but the knowledge here still represents an extremely valuable commodity given how far civilisation has fallen in the Lands Between.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
41,,50,Cookbook Collection ,Elden Ring,Lore,"Much of the knowledge in this world has been lost in tomes of ancient repute, from the recipe needed to make venoms that put victims to sleep, to the minor magics that let fighters store the lightning of dragons or the light of the Golden Order in explosive pots regardless of faith, to the knowledge needed to make a freezing grease. Instead of needing to take it off the bodies of the fallen or hunt through treacherous dungeons for it, you now own a sizeable collection of such knowledge-enough to fully stock a small shelf.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
42,,50,Knowledgeable ,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"The number of spells known in the multiverse is beyond count, and new ones are discovered (or recovered) on a daily basis. But finding the more rare or powerful effects can be difficult - many mages guard their mightiest magics with fevered dedication, and long-lost arcane lore is often only found at the bottom of dangerous magical ruins and tombs. But that doesn’t mean such knowledge is entirely unavailable. With each purchase of this Perk, you may gain mastery of a single spell seen in the Shandalar game, from the most common sorcery to the most rare arcane ritual. You can initially memorize and prepare a single copy of this spell, and do not need to use talismans, runes, or other such methods to re-memorize it, being able to do so through sheer mental ability. You are not forced to keep it memorized, nor are you forbidden from expanding the number of times you can do so with whatever methods you have available to you."
43,,50,Event Causality Language,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Lore,"I’ll be honest with you. Those words mean absolutely nothing. They’re just there to look fancy. But, but! You know that now. See, you now actually understand at least some of this nonsense. I can’t promise you the science behind it, but all these nonsense words that people here seem to live to use? Actually make sense now. On top of that, you can continue to speak the local dialect in future worlds. Spread the confusion! "
44,,50,Infinite Library Priority Access ,Lyrical Nanoha,Lore,"Nifty! You have acquired an all-access pass to the Infinite Library of the TSAB. The name isn’t for show, either - it’s a huge library containing the collected knowledge of the TSAB, or at least things available to the public. Excellent for research or literary pursuits. Post-jump, this card functions as a lifetime library card for any public library in existence. Secretive ones not included, sadly.

53,,100,To Seek Tomorrow,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Lore,"Your eclectic skill set has left you with a number of strange
skills, all of which have been trained to at least adequate levels. You now have at least a basic
knowledge of almost every mundane medieval skill, enough to at least do easy tasks."
54,,100,Inner Compass,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"Have you got lost because bandits attacked your group
and you ended up outside the main route for your destination? Regardless of the
reason, every time you get lost while going to a specific destination, if you already
had access to the information of the way you should’ve followed under normal
circumstances, you’ll still have an innate sense that will guide it to there, preventing
you from losing hours and hours due to the lack of a map, an actual compass or due
to getting out of the route."
55,,100,Vast Array of Skills,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"In order to reach a high position in the military or in
another area of the capital with more ease and to be able to survive somehow if
things ever get bad, you decided to start by raising your own skills, mainly the ones
related to housekeeping, being pretty skilled in tasks such as cooking and sewing for
example. Your incredible array of skills also makes you moderately skilled at
blacksmithing, enough to allow you to forge good but regular metal tools and even
weapons if you have the needed equipment and materials."
56,,100,Databases & Censuses,A Mage of Sorothustra,Lore,"You have access to very basic databases concerning the
proliferation of your kind. Not only are these databases very basic, but it’s possible for
Sorothustrans to avoid registering their full families, which can lead to discrepancies between
the actual numbers of Sorothustrans and what is on the databases. In future jumps you can
choose to sync this to another supernatural population, though it is much more accurate if you
are a member of the supernatural population in question."

Force Disciplines (pg 51), giving you a grasp of basic applications such as recognizing and responding to
danger, pushing and pulling objects, sensing the mood of those around you, and judging the ambient
energies that may linger in places of significance. Your attunement to the Force also grants you better
reflexes and a keen intuition, as well as an intuitive feeling for the next step you need to take to pursue
your goals, even if the path ahead is unclear.

Requires Force Sensitive or its upgrades to purchase."
59,,100,Advanced Force Training,The Old Republic,Lore,"You have already achieved a knowledge of the Force equivalent to a newly christened Padawan; that of Familiarity in every category. There are four levels skill (Familiarity, Proficiency, Expertise, and Mastery) for the four categories of Force powers, and you must level each discipline individually: Combat, Control, Mind, and Mystery. For a repeatable purchase of 100 CP, you may increase your skill in one of these disciplines, and unlock the corresponding Force abilities. The Light and Dark perks are mutually exclusive until the requisite perk is bought. At your discretion, you may add esoteric or unlisted Force powers to the each skill level, as long as they remain roughly equivalent in capability.

group into a city, wouldn’t you? Thankfully there’s none of that, now.
You have the skills of an absolutely master-level hacker, thief, cutpurse, terrorist and
all-around criminal. You know how to setup protection rings, street brawling, how to
steal sensitive information and how to go about using it to blackmail or other
purposes, manage heists, and even things like gaining and retaining command over
the dregs of society are easy for you now."
63,,100,Influence,The Games We Play,Lore,"What kind of teacher are you anyway? How can you have so much pull in so many
places? Turns out, you’re a genius at using whatever resources you have at hand to
obtain power for yourself and your causes, by hook or by crook.
You find that people remember you fondly if you assist them or are benevolent to
them in a position of authority, they recall your wisdom and seek it, or just want to
return a favor or maybe even earn one from you.
Either way, you find yourself walking the very highest corridors of power in your
land, and all you need to keep yourself there, to wield real, palpable influence over
national policy and development is to keep doing what you are.
In future jumps too, you find it trivial to use even the most innocuous positions and
responsibilities to accrue power and influence, parlaying even insignificant deeds into
massive favors left and right."
64,,100,"Teach Me, Mom!",The Games We Play,Lore,"Well, maybe not your mom. You have an incredible gift for being around incredibly
talented and capable people, who are not only good at a vast variety of things, but are
very willing and able to teach you.
While their means may or may not range from hellish to torturous, their effectiveness
is nonetheless unquestionable. They tend to know just how to push you, just how to
beat even the most tedious or complicated subjects into your head, and how to bring
you to the absolute limit if your potential.
As soon as you outgrow one, another teacher seems to wander into your life somehow,
ready to continue your training. Mind you, coincidence, fate or their attitudes
somehow always prevent them from being any use any other way."
65,,100,Vit,Germanic/Norse Mtyhology Jump,Lore,"The second gift: thought. You now hold a certain wit and charm about yourself; whatever your intelligence was before, you are at least above average now. You have also gained the skill of pithy retort and common banter, never again being at a loss for words.
You also possess a talent for Flyting, argument as a contest, consisting of the exchange of insults, subterfuge, and shade, often conducted in verse, between two or more parties. It could be described as the art of eloquently insulting the opposition, usually as a prelude to battle, a battle in and of itself, or even as a friendly competition among comrades. While this perk doesn’t make you the best in the realms by itself, or even a master, you are an expert and could easily run circles around the common man."
66,,100,Shinobi,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Lore,"What with all the screaming jutsu names and giant fireballs and kaiju summoning, its like these
people have entirely forgotten that ninja are supposed to be stealthy. Well, good thing you’re
here to remind them.
You are a true Ninja, a true ‘Old School’ shinobi. You have ungodly dexterity, patience and sheer
skill at sneaking. You could sneak through a village full of ninja at high alert while wearing
bright orange, and your skills at lockpicking, picking pockets, stealing, sneak attacks and the
like, trades which demand stealth like this, are just as ridiculous.
In addition, you no longer need to cry out any of your jutsu’s names, being able to just execute
any and all of your techniques without even muttering a word. You’re also a dab hand at using
the more ‘traditional’ ninja methods of dealing with people, such as poison use and various
practical assassination techniques that don’t require engulfing your hand in lightning and
running in a straight line at someone.
Finally, while you do not gain any supernatural abilities related to stealth, you can maintain any
abilities you do have in just about any condition, be it drunk, injured, or unconscious."
67,,100,Apprenticeship,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"It's not as bad as you thought it would be, learning your craft under a skilled Master. At first it was difficult but after some practice, you’ve found it to be not that difficult at all. In fact, it does not take nearly as much effort to complete the tasks you’re Master is providing you with, with 
you discovering that you can excel under their tutelage, learning thrice as fast as you would have without their tutelage. For some reason your Master and other Apprentices do not feel jealous of you, they’ll even encourage you efforts and share their own little tricks of the trade. Even if you were to change profession, you would find that your teacher is always very competent and helpful."
68,,100,Basic Mastery,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"Sorcerers use the energy of the four elements for their spells. Taking energy from water is the easiest to learn but it is not always available. Earth is inert and slow, so you need better skills to take energy from it, but there is always earth under you. Air is hard to control, for its energy is too light, too slippery, but you have all the benefits of availability and speed. Only a few can take chaotic and unstable energy of fire without losing themselves, not because it is hard, but because it gives too much, too fast, burning away the very sanity of a sorcerer. There are many nuances. The first and most important - sorcerers do not always interact with the elements themselves, they draw strength from them, their energy, then transform it into spells. Borrowing energy is a very delicate process. Directly channeling it into a spell is dangerous as this can cause an uncontrolled release of energy, turning the most innocuous spell into destruction, crippling or even killing the sorcerer himself. Therefore, many sorcerers absorb energy into themselves, only then transferring it into a spell. 
You have all necessary skills to connect to all the elements and take their energy to fuel your magic, practically never risking a loss of control. 
"
69,,100,Kido Training,Bleach,Lore,"The arts of the Shinigami are many, fitting given their long existence. Few Shinigami pursue training
in all the disciplines available and Kido is by far the most neglected. Many Shinigami possess only
rudimentary skill in the Demon Magic Art, the spellcasting system of Soul Society. Some have no
knowledge at all. But you’ve eagerly pursued such things, reaching the level of a capable caster in
both Hado and Bakudo spells. Hado spells largely deal with offense and destruction, while Bakudo is
for both defense and a variety of support uses. At least ninety nine spells exist for each form, numbered in order of power. You know over a dozen spells for each discipline with your maximum abilities being a pair of spells in
the 30 range. 31 Shakkaho, a powerful blast of fire in the Hado arts or 30 Shitotsu Sansen, a Bakudo
spell that creates restrictive triangles of light around an opponent. In Shinigami terms, you’re the
equivalent of a graduate of the academy who received top marks in Kido, which may explain the
natural talent you have for learning more Kido down the line."
70,,100,Academic Foundation,Bleach,Lore,"Clever girl, aren’t you? It’s no real surprise you took the path of the scientist, with everything there is
to discover. In one world alone, there are endless wonders, but in all three? Marvels are waiting to
be made. A rookie still but not one without potential, you’ve got moderate experience in a wide
range of scientific disciplines. Biology, physics, engineering and a particular education in spiritual
theories unique to the afterlives. Reishi doesn’t always work like atoms do but you know the
differences and even have a few lessons on how exactly you go about making use of them all. You’ve
got an adept mind for science and it comes easier to you but there’s a long road ahead."
71,,100,Fourth Division Janitors,Bleach,Lore,"Ungrateful meatheads! The medical staff and research teams both are looked down on by their
brawny, stupid comrades. Every race is filled with morons who only see the sword and fist as the
way to win, barely able to comprehend how much you help them. So they just push all the
unpleasant tasks on you and your lot, housework and chores to maintain the whole bloody city. But you didn’t let it hold you back, did you? You mastered even that. Housework is nothing before a great man of science and medicine, a task you easily take care of. Mundane chores from cleaning to maintenance are swift and easy to your hands, barely even a
bother to your mind. You can easily look past the boring busywork and occupy your mind with
analysis and introspection instead, perhaps even reaching a meditative state to improve your
thinking. And often, despite the rudeness of the meathead fellows, you do find little gifts and notes
of appreciation where you clean and do work, showing that people do notice and enjoy what you do."
72,,100,"Doctor, Doctor",Bleach,Lore,"Every being fears death. Pain, too. It’s only natural to shrink back from the things that hurt us. And
maybe it’s only natural to be drawn towards the ones that cleanse that pain. Every race has it’s own
carers and while you’re not yet a master, you are still a Doctor. For your particular species, you’re
fully trained as both doctor and surgeon to care for them. Inexperienced, sure, but still
knowledgeable and able to help. You’ll have a good understanding of mundane methods of healing
wounds with real world medicine as well as a decent training in several lesser Healing Kidou or your
race’s equivalent abilities. A Hollow might instead rely on biological mutations or mixtures. You’ve
also got a decent bedside manner, enough to at least get normally hostile patients to let you have a
quick look and listen to your suggestions for a while. Sometimes it’s more helpful than actually
knowing how to heal, with some of these warrior types."
73,,100,It's No Fun With Two Hands,Bleach,Lore,"Not everyone is as blessed as you are in matters of war. Most likely, they’re a whole lot less lucky if they find themselves facing you. But you can be kind. You’re in it for fun too, after all, so why not take a little handicap to make things interesting? You’ve got an easy time weakening yourself, to the point that you’re always able to find a way to limit or suppress your powers and abilities to some degree if desired. It might be a special ability that lets you do it or easily finding devices to help out, but it’ll ensure you can still get a good scrap going. It’ll even retain some of the fun, if you’re the sort to not enjoy it when limited, letting you gain satisfaction from winning under these challenging restrictions."
74,,100,Officer in the Making,Bleach,Lore,"Despite the individualistic nature of war in the afterlife, it’s still important to have good leaders. Officers are more than just the stronger weapons, they’re the ones meant to manage everyonebeneath them in the chain of command. You’re capable at the task in both war and peacetime, beingan effective tactical commander of small units and able to keep your men from causing too much of a fuss when there’s no fights to be had. The extensive experience in handling paperwork of all kinds, even the most obtuse and obviously pointless, is just a natural extension of what it means to be a leader. "
75,,100,First Kills,Bleach,Lore,"Even if it ain’t much, you’ve still been blooded. You’re no stranger to scraps and fights to the death, whatever you are. It might be the formal training in a Shinigami academy or the lessons of the wild in Hueco Mundo but you’ve got a good idea of how to tear other people apart. You’re a capable
combatant in a general area, such as Zanjutsu for Shinigami or the natural weapons of a Hollow, and
have enough combat experience to mostly keep your cool in a fight. You actually turned out to be a
decent hand at it all, maybe you’ll be able to learn to fight even faster going forward. "
76,,100,Divine Scholar,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Lore,"Either as an old and experienced Ōtsutsuki or a
particularly studious Ōtsutsuki, you managed to acquire a wealth of precious
knowledge, having an intimate understanding of all existing Shinjutsu including the esoteric and powerful Omnipotence shinjutsu. The Shinjutsu
are techniques of the highest form mainly used by members of the Ōtsutsuki clan
and some lucky humans that inherited our power, which allows their user to
manipulate chakra without the need of weaving signs, seals or concentrating energy,
being closer to divine miracles as described by Amado. Remember, while you know
every form of Shinjutsu, this doesn’t mean you have the needed power to use them,
similarly to how knowing the hand seals of the Multiple Shadow Clone technique isn’t
enough to allow a shinobi to use it.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."
77,,100,Accumulated Combat Experience,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Lore,"The Ōtsutsuki tend to acquire a vast
combat experience, accumulated overtime through multiple cycles. Even if a mere
human acquired a portion of this experience, be it through a Kāma or something
else, they would turn into a high performance fighter in a matter of seconds. You also
have this same combat experience collected through millenia, regardless if you
acquired it by yourself or if a more experienced member of our clan trained you.
Basically, you’re a master in hand-to-hand combat, or as humans prefer to call it, in
Taijutsu, comparable to both Isshiki and Momoshiki. You’re capable of adapting your
fighting style to face the more diverse opponents, even if they have non-conventional
combat form or even lack a humanoid body structure. Despite this, you don’t innately
have access to any of the special Taijutsu techniques developed by the humans, so,
if you want them, you’ll still need to learn them by yourself."
78,,100,Eidetic Memory,Naruto,Lore,"You possess a memory that will never forget anything and with an instant recall attached to it. Furthermore, no matter what, you will never be able to forget anything unless you consciously choose to forget."
79,,100,Elven Forestry,The Lord of the Rings,Lore,"You are trained, not in the ways of hunting and gathering, but in the mystical arts of the forest. You know how to find and use magical plants such as Athelas, and in times of great hardship can call upon the spirits of nature for aid."
80,,100,Talking Is A Free Action,Bofuri,Lore,"In a VR environment, you aren’t actually breathing air. So feel free to keep chatting while sprinting, jumping around, and other battlefield actions. It won’t even be distracting, as it seems you’ve got an extra half of a mental thread to keep your tongue moving."
81,,100,Weapon-Based Classes,Bofuri,Lore,"NWO’s class system is based on what type of weapons the player chooses. When you create your first NWO character, the weapons you select are chosen for this perk.

Your skill with these weapons are as if you have trained or fought daily with them for several years. In addition, any example of your chosen weapons will always work for you, being capable of handling your power and adding your durability and toughness to its own."
82,,100,Book​ ​Of​ ​The​ ​Dead​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Lore,"A heavy, leather-bound antique book with blank pages. When the owner writes the name of a recently deceased mortal on a left-hand page, writing will appear on the right page that details the events that lead to that person’s death. Closing the book makes the pages blank once more."
83,,100,Guidance,Cradle V1,Lore,"When you are taught by those who have achieved mastery in whatever skill they’re trying to teach you, your learning speed doubles. In addition, you have a 6th sense for finding those who can teach you to master new skills."
84,,100,Hunt Club,Final Fantasy XII,Lore,"Game hunters on the Phon Coast, they excel at tracking down and killing rare beasts. They’ll be willing to help you track down and capture wild animals for your various purposes.

When you leave this world, they will leave you with a free primer that lets you record and track down wild monsters from the lands you go to. The primer will also help point out weaknesses."
85,,100,Gift of the Gab,Irish Mythology,Lore,"You speak well, and quickly, and in all the tongues of men. You’re quick with a joke or pun, and other forms of wordplay, like riddles."
86,,100,Faultless Recall,Irish Mythology,Lore,"A bard is a living record of history. That may sound tenuous - have you ever played telephone? But a trainee bard who alters one word of a memorized saga is harshly punished. You have the gift of a perfect memory, not merely for stories and sights and songs, but exactly where and when and how you heard of them."
87,,100,Celennia Memorial Library,Final Fantasy XI,Lore,"Displaying twelve freshly sharpened swords glinting from the glow of the Sun behind them adorns the crest of this library, by purchasing this a copy of the Celennia Memorial library will attach itself to your warehouse. Inside this warehouse add on you will find a copy of every book found in Vana'diel, should you lose a book it will reappear in the library."
88,,100,Quick learner,Final Fantasy XI,Lore,"Where others may fall behind in their studies you excel. You find it easier to learn new abilities than most be they magical or mundane in nature. This exists as a form of natural talent for most things you put your mind at trying to learn, even though you may be good at something natural talent is nothing if not polished."
89,,100,Experience,Final Fantasy XI,Lore,"All adventurers live and grow through battle, every foe you slay gives you a varying amount of experience which allows you to grow in power. Stronger foes grant more experience upon their death while a foe that is weak and no challenge may not give any experience though this may seem like a powerful ability it also comes with its own weakness, any time you are defeated or lose to an enemy you also lose a portion of your own gained experience and can potentially become weaker if it keeps happening. As you struggle here in Vana'diel your skills will be greatly tested, in order to grow you must seek out ever more powerful enemies to slay and thereby write your own legend in history. Basically You can slowly become better at your job or class by killing monsters. Though this also allows you to learn how to use weapons more effectively by using using them in battle this is a slow process, after this jump the downsides of this perk (the loss of experience shown by weakness after a loss) goes away allowing you to gain experience slowly through battle and thereby become stronger by leveling up though unless the beings you fight actually have some chance of harming you they won't give you much experience."
90,,100,Revival of X,The God of High School Jump,Lore,"It is the belief of some that you cannot be a true master of the Martial Arts until you have contributed a creation of your own, instead of just learning from others. Whether you believe it or not, you have an inborn talent and ability to create a martial art, one that will perfectly fit you. You do not start with some fully built style embedded in your mind, rather you will occasionally, in the heat of battle gain a burst of inspiration that will result in the creation of a new technique in your own personal style, one suited for the battle you are in at that moment. As the years go by and you fight more and more impressive battles, your own personal style will form around your achievements, filled with techniques fitting to you and your own style of fighting, as well as the opponents you have conquered in the past."
91,,100,Book of the False Attendant        ,Fate/Stay Night,Lore,"A red, hard cover book has found its way into your possession. This book contains two things of use to you. The first and most notable is a single extra Command Seal is held within the book, connected to you or any you wish to have. This Command Seal regenerates once per month but cannot be used to maintain the Servant bond if it's all you have left. The second use is the ability to store several basic spells as well as a limited but constant amount of energy to supply them with. These spells include basic Reinforcement, a basic blast of dark energy and a basic healing spell. "
92,,100,Catching Up,Fate/Stay Night,Lore,"One of the most basic functions of the Grail System is to ensure that all Servants have the basic knowledge necessary to function in the modern world. This include things like basic knowledge of technology levels, culture, laws and modern society, as well as the most spoken language in the region in which the Grail War will take place. While any Servant automatically gains these effects during this jump for the Fuyuki City, Japan area, purchasing it will cause it to apply wherever you go. This ensures that you always possess the knowledge listed above for any area you are in, though without external influence this knowledge will be temporary and leave you as you leave the area in which it affects. "
93,,100,Dazzling Intellect,Knight’s and Magic,Lore,"But you are not just a pretty face. Your mind is now boosted to the limits of humanity making you always experimenting, considering and wondering along with giving you a very imaginative or creative mind about a topic of your choice. Ernesti’s would be Giant Robots, so think something as constrained like that. This can be bought multiple times.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
94,,100,Web of Lies and Faith,Cult of the Lamb,Lore,"They say that a liar must always remember what they say lest their words come crashing down upon them. What remains unsaid is that this is just as true in matters of faith. Neither shall be a problem for you now, as you have been granted much enhanced memory specifically in the field of things that you have said in the past. Never again will you accidentally tie yourself up in conflicting stories as any time you wish, you can perfectly recall what you have said in any past interaction at a moment’s notice."
95,,100,Regulation Rules,Final Fantasy VIII,Lore,"Rules matter. Rules make the world go wrong. Rules make the trains run on time. And somehow, you always know the rules. You automatically know the rules, regulations, and standards of any sort of organization, nation, or group in which you're a member. Even those pesky unwritten ones. Does not automatically come with the authority to enforce them."
96,,100,"Charity, Kindness and Fairness",Fate/Grand Order,Lore,"Chivalry may be a difficult code to follow but you have it a little easier than most. You have the uncanny knack of being able to always make a fair judgement, regardless of whatever your feelings are on the matter at hand. No matter what situation, you know what the fairest resolution to all parties will be, if there is one. If there isn’t, you’ll be aware of what the closest substitute is. This knowledge may not be too helpful if you’re not in a position to decide such matters but to make up for that, this knowledge will also make you a much more skilful negotiator in hopes that you will be able to put yourself in such a position. You could do a lot of good with this good judgement."
97,,100,Book of Jumper,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Lore,"Now turning yourself into a book is a pretty bad idea, you can’t defend yourself, if a librarian gets their hands on your book then they have your powers, and all your secrets are open to whoever reads you. But this is not really your book, it’s more like a fancy autobiography than something made from dying in the Library, it’s indestructible by normal means and if damaged anyway you get it back in a week. If any companions have the Book Smarts perk then they can equip it like any other book to get a copy of your abilities, though you can choose if anything you have is not in the book."
98,,100,Body of Control,Bibliomania,Lore,"Your body and mind are now flawlessly connected allowing you full awareness of you physical bodies condition and capabilities but more importantly is your full control over your body to the point that if you are physically capable of an action you can do so effortlessly with 100% action even if normally such action would be involuntary(Controlling your heart beat), normally impossible to do on its own(flexing individual muscles rather than muscle groups) or simply something your body isn’t normally capable of(completely relaxing every muscle of the body). This makes training physical skills much quicker, roughly 5 times faster, though just because you have conscious control doesn't mean you have the training or skill to do something without training.

It should also be noted that this is focused on the body but your control does bleed over slightly to any supernatural powers and abilities you have allowing you to train the control of them 3 fold as well as makes supernatural abilities grow twice as fast as before."
99,,100,All Myths Are True,High School DxD,Lore,"Well, not necessarily, but in a world where Angels, Demons, Norse Deities, Youkai, and even more absurd creatures co-exist in the same setting, it pays to know what’s what. You have an encyclopedic knowledge of all myths and religious texts that exist on present-day Earth, and how to quickly draw connections between them and the ‘real deal’ in this world and beyond. This won’t teach you about any unique mythologies in other worlds, but it will let you draw connections and learn about them quickly so long as you have a way to research them. Never mistake a Reincarnated Devil for a Pure-Blood ever again!"
100,,100,You Can Talk?,Final Fantasy VII,Lore,"You sure can, even if logic or even basic biology would dictate otherwise. Regardless of what species or physical form you're in, you are miraculously capable of human speech as well as clear verbal communication. Don't think too hard about it."
101,,100,Forbidden Scroll ,Legends of Runeterra,Lore,"This scroll is completely blank for everyone else. For you, however, it will have written instructions to learn one of the powerful martial arts of Ionia. Post-Jump, it will adapt to any kind of martial art present in the setting."
102,,100,Exotic Weapon Proficiency,Fairy Fencer F,Lore,"How exactly do you use a sword/spear/axe/knuckle/gun/rocket launcher? You have an incredible mastery of strange and exotic weapons. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never seen it before. As long as the weapon or martial style can theoretically be learned, you can master it with ease. This Perk means never having to say “I shot my own foot off with my Fury.”"
103,,100,Scholar,Inheritance Cycle,Lore,"You find it easier to retain information after a long period of study. You are able to retain focus even when going for far longer than normal when studying. You also retain information easier, having a truly exceptional memory. It isn’t quite “perfect”, but it’s close."
104,,100,Old World Knowledge,Honkai Impact 3rd,Lore,"Despite Old World stuff mostly disappearing and their knowledge dying out due to the end of the Old Era, you have retained the majority of the knowledge that an accomplished scientist, scholar, and citizen of that era would know. You also have a perfect memory with limitless capacity and instant recall, along with a genius intelligence, in order to allow you to properly make use of this knowledge."
105,,100,All Speak,God Of War (2018),Lore,"Like Atreus you have a preternatural talent for languages. You can now understand and speak any non-magical language. For instance if you want to have a conversation with Jormungandr you can, but if you wanted to speak in the Thu'um from the Elder Scrolls universe you would have to learn the hard way. However, you also gain a resistance to the downsides of certain language based magics. No tearing apart your vocal cords from overusing the Thu’um, instead you may get a really sore throat. "
106,,100,Ancestral Language,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Lore,"There is more to one’s blood than simple genetics. It carries a spiritual and esoteric connection to one’s own species, especially if you’re a hybrid. The results of this aren't as impressive as you might think, however, or perhaps it is. What does this do then? One simple thing. It lets you communicate with any member of your species without any issues such as language barriers getting in the way. A half-human half-merman person would be able to speak with any human and any merman without having to worry about learning specific languages, for example.

This doesn’t help you if you don’t know any language at all, of course, you still have to know how to speak at all to be able to speak with others. This might be quite useful in certain situations, but for the most part it’s unlikely to see much use. Still, it can be interesting to be capable of it, no?"
107,,100,Un-princely Education,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Lore,"Please don’t slack off. As royalty, you have a responsibility to your nation. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like you’ve listened, or perhaps you have but managed to make time for other things, as now you are an expert at some mundane skill not normally associated with kingship. Combat with any form of weapon (specialized on a specific one like a cudgel), artistry weaved with musical instruments, sailing seafaring ships, anything that wouldn’t normally be part of directly ruling a kingdom is valid here. You’re not going to be a master at this skill, not with just this, but you’re very much above most. Learning combat will let you fight against even hardened soldiers and have the upper edge in the fight, musical skill could let your name echo across history, and if you learned how to sail you’d be able to contend with all but the most violent storms with minimal issue. But, as a prince or princess, what use could this possibly be? Surely you aren’t planning on eloping?"
108,,100,History Book?,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Lore,"Curious. While scouring the land for the oddly absent copies of Dracula, you seem to have found a peculiar combination of a set of presumably fictional stories of notable figures, the sort that would be summoned in Grail Wars, with what appear to be more factual additions contradicting or correcting what is deemed to be historically or mythologically correct with what is actually the case. Handy little thing, if where you are has actual events being a bit different from mythology and history you are aware of through other means. Of course, some of this may seem a bit unbelievable to some – Frankenstein’s Monster, King Arthur and Jack The Ripper all being female, for instance. There are even pictures. You’ll get a new copy of this for each world where historical and recorded events don’t necessarily match up."
109,,100,Freelancer,Final Fantasy V,Lore,"You don’t really have a ‘Job’ per se. You’re fairly talented all around. Nothing extreme, but you find that you can pick up most tasks in a relatively short amount of time, just by figuring out how it should be done. Granted, you tend to plateau just as quickly, but when you can learn a trade in a few hours when it takes someone else a few months or even a few years, that’s not so bad, is it?"
110,,100,Weapon Training,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"A knight wields many weapons, from sword and shield, to axe and lance. Melee weapons in general are second-nature to you. Even ones that are unwieldy or poorly balanced feel natural in your hands, and it takes less than a minute for you to become familiar with its use."
111,,100,Worldly,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"You’ve been at this awhile, and have been around a great deal. Due to this, you know a lot about a few things, and a little about everything. Obscure facts, ancient legends, and rumors of powerful artifacts linger at the edges of your mind at all times. Even as a Drop-In, you will know things about the worlds you jump into, this one and beyond."
112,,100,Genius        ,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"There is no doubt that you’re exceptionally skilled in one aspect, but the hallmark of the Prodigy is that you’re gifted in a single area. You may take only a single Class, but you gain its 200CP perk for free. You may still take Advanced Classes. Also you’re far more skilled in your chosen Class, often outperforming adults with years of experience who lack your natural genius."
113,,100,Restless Hearts,HighSchool DxD,Lore,"A bunch of papers, more than enough to make even the most seasoned of bureaucrats sigh in resignation. These papers are blackmail, the result of being alive as much as you have been. Here are many names from prominent, influential, and even dangerous individuals of power. Knowing the secrets written here is enough to force their hand to move at your tune, or just become a card in negotiation. Naturally, how this blackmail material ends up is completely up to you."
114,,100,Total Slaughter,The Voynich Hotel,Lore,"Most people think that this magazine, prominently featuring guns and all sorts of killing devices up for sale, is a joke put together by some cosplayers who like to pretend to be hardcore assassins. Few realize that it truly is what most people mock it for. A twice monthly magazine that ranks the top one hundred assassins currently working in the business as well as a one-stop shop for hitmen who want to buy implements of death. This special subscription will find you no matter where you head to in the multiverse and will give you a list of the top local assassins. Sadly, you won’t be qualified for ranking because we are told you would hog the number one spot for some time to come. The magazine will also feature a number of exciting stories about spectacular jobs pulled off by the local assassins on the list."
115,,100,Heroine's Great Principals EX,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Lore,Small booklet detailing (Brave) Elizabeth's views on what exactly it means to be a Hero. Oddly following the rules inside can cause you (and others) to slowly develop powers appropriate for a Hero in the current world (nothing you get to keep when you leave but you get them back if you ever visit another form of said world).
116,,100,...And the Scholarly One ,Final Fantasy III,Lore,"Maybe you aren’t as outgoing as some of your peers, but you make up for it through your scholarly nature. You know many of the common stories of this world, and your reading speed and comprehension has been greatly improved."
117,,100,Two Types Of Genius,Fate/Apocrypha,Lore,"There are two types of genius in this world. There’s the jack of all trades, those who are impressive at anything they do, and become omnidisciplinaries even if they don’t reach truly legendary heights at anything. And there’s the specialists, those who focus exclusively on one thing and take it to unprecedented heights. With this purchase, you may choose to be a genius of either type. The former of course requires no further thought, but for the latter you must of course choose your specialization. In case it needs to be said, it has to actually be a specific thing, such as a narrow form of magecraft, or perhaps even a single spell. The more narrow your focus, the better, and if you don’t pick something that is actually specific, well, you may as well just choose to be a jack of all trades at that point. As perks can only be taken once unless otherwise specified, you may only choose one of the two options."
118,,100,Balanced Aptitude,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"Jumpers have the ability to learn many things in any discipline, but primarily do so through Perks. There are natural inclinations to be had that can interfere with learning through practice. With this Perk, that limitation is removed. While this doesn’t increase one’s learning speed, there is no longer anything blocking your ability to learn any trade or talent, given the time and inclination to learn it."
119,,100,Ancient Books,Hellblazer,Lore,A handful of rare tomes. Take twice for a shelf. Take a third time for a small library. These tomes are expensive and rare.
120,,100,Encyclopedic,Hellblazer,Lore,"You gain a radically improved memory, and a broad knowledge base of the occult."
121,,100,Of Course I Know How To Drive ,Fate/Strange Fake,Lore,"A common trait also shared among all Servants. It seems that regardless of the era you find yourself in, you have a great knowledge of the customs of your current time, as well as being able to understand and communicate with all humans regardless of your original language. Finally, the Holy Grail also imprints in you a great knowledge of the legends of other heroes. You may not be able to identify anyone with just a glance like a Ruler or a powerful clairvoyant would, but hearing the True Name Release of an Heroic Spirit’s Noble Phantasm or laying eyes on a specially significant weapon like Excalibur will allow you to connect the dots quite easily. If this were taken by a human, you would be seen as quite an oddball."
122,,100,Quest Log,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Lore,"Your system will now dynamically bestow you with a quest, or mission whenever you are given a task, something important happens or something relevant to you personally occurs. The Quest Log will show you what actions you have taken so far, what information is relevant to the Quest and it will bestow you some form of reward upon the Quests completion such as points."
123,,100,Magic Mirror,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Lore,This magic mirror can perfectly reflect your opinions with it answering any questions you ask it honestly without personal bios. The mirror can also switch between a hand mirror and a full length wall mirror.
124,,100,Arcane Grimoire,Godbound,Lore,"A theurgic invocation is inscribed in this precious tome, a piece of wisdom lost since the days of the Former Empire. Such is the value of what this represents, that the alternative you could purchase is an entire set of instructional materials on a lost form of low magic. This item may be repurchased, at half price if discounted, for additional such shards of wisdom."
125,,100,Gunner,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Lore,"You are now a great shot, proficient in the use of all mundane projectile weapons, as well as arm cannons. You are also an expert in the properties and usage of explosives. Finally, you understand how to use personal shield deflectors."
126,,100,Swordfighter,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Lore,"You are now a master of the blade, proficient in the use of most swords, as well as the shuriken and the chakram. You can also adapt to using other ‘unconventional’ weapons (such as sticks, clubs, or even brooms) in the same manner as a one-handed sword, provided you are capable of wielding them one-handed.

Alternatively, if your preferred blade is a bit ‘special’, such as being excessively large, or possessing unique functions, there is another option. You may choose a single specific sword wielded by a Super Smash Bros. Fighter to gain mastery of. In the case of particularly large or heavy swords, such as the Buster Sword, you will gain the necessary strength to wield it, should you lack it, but this additional strength will only apply for the purposes of wielding this type of sword. For swords with additional forms, such as the Sword of the Creator, you will also gain a mastery of their alternate form (in this case you would gain a mastery of whips). Such mastery will also translate over to similar swords, for example mastering the Buster Sword will allow you to wield other similarly sized swords. However, choosing to master a sword will not enable you to wield it if it is the ‘choosy’ type, that only works for a select few.

You may purchase this perk as many times as you like, each time choosing a new sword to gain a mastery of, or to gain the effects of the first option. You may only gain the effects of the first option once.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
127,,100,Brawler,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Lore,"You are now an expert in punches, kicks, grapples, and feints. If you prefer, you may instead gain mastery of a form of martial arts style demonstrated in Super Smash Bros., such as boxing, pro wrestling, or Shotokan. However, if you choose to do this, you will not gain any spiritual or supernatural abilities associated with the chosen martial art. You will not be learning the Hadoken by purchasing this perk alone.

For some reason, taking this perk also gives you a talent for Shot Put. Maybe you can find a use for this?

You may purchase this perk as many times as you like, each time choosing a new form of martial arts to gain mastery in, or to gain the effects of the first option. You may only gain the effects of the first option once.

128,,100,Wizarding News,Wizarding World,Lore,"Given someone in your position, it pays to be kept well-informed of the comings and goings of the world, wherever you may be. Which is why you have these two. The first thing you have now is a daily subscription to the Daily Prophet. While people’s opinions on the paper may vary, you cannot deny that it will be rather useful to read about whatever might be going on in the world. Even if the sources can be rather biased, there will always be useful bits of information within, if you know what you’re looking for.

The second thing you have is a special radio, one that is by default, connected to the Wizarding Wireless Network, a wizarding radio station. Like the Daily Prophet, the WWN can help keep you up-to-date with the coming and goings of the world and you don’t need to wait a day for more news to come through. Of course, if the WWN isn’t to your liking, the radio is capable of picking up other wireless airwaves, letting you listen to other radio broadcasts, including ones that are not necessarily meant to be heard.

Beyond this world, the Daily Prophet will display appropriate and fitting news for you, no matter how different that world may be."
129,,100,On the Job Education,Wizarding World,Lore,"Curse-breaking is a rather dangerous profession given that it entails a person diving into ancient and secret tombs, all loaded to brim with protective curses and enchantments. It doesn’t help that training programs for curse-breakers are, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. But given how prestigious the job is, it only makes sense that so many witches and wizards would try their hand at it. So, let’s give you a leg up against the competition.

Whenever you find yourself in a new profession, you will quickly be able to pick up on the basics of said profession, even without going through any basic or specialized training. For example, as a curse-breaker, you’ll quickly be able to learn how to determine any traps or curses within your area. For something more normal, like accounting, you’ll be able to serve as a good enough accountant to not get fired.

Still, this only gets you to the bare minimum. All you’ll be with this alone is someone good enough to not get fired or someone who isn’t going to get themselves killed with their own stupidity. If you want to do more than that, you’re on your own."
130,,100,Charta Opus Coepi,Wizarding World,Lore,"Paperwork is the bane of many of a desk jockey. Piles of paper reaching the ceiling stacked on top of one’s desk almost makes you want to just jump and end it all. And even magic can only help so much, especially if you want it done right. But then again, you have your own special brand of magic, don’t you?

And so, you have no need to fear! For you, paperwork is now done all on their own. And you don’t even need to worry about any mistakes here. The paperwork will be done as if you yourself did them. If need be, you can also set a few conditions regarding the paperwork so that they won’t be done if you really need to take a look and make sure on what’s written in them."
131,,100,Knowing the Book,Wizarding World,Lore,"Ah, the law. It’s a bane and a boon for so many people of the law. You are no different. But unlike many fools, you’ve made it your mission to be well aware of it. From now on, regardless of when or where you are, the laws of the land shall be made known to you. You will know what acts are legal, what acts are illegal, and what acts merely frowned upon. Even something as confusing and dense as Wizarding law are all too clear to your mind’s eye.

Of course, such a wealth of knowledge is remarkably easy to abuse for one such as you. Given how in-depth your understanding on the law can be, you could make for a very fine lawyer. That is, if you don’t abuse your newfound expertise on it for your own personal welfare. After all, few systems are perfect and there will no doubt be many such loopholes you could scurry your way through, no matter how iron tight they are."
132,,100,Lingua Franca,Wizarding World,Lore,"There are thousands of languages spoken throughout the world and that only includes the Muggle world. The magical side of things has even more languages to offer such as Mermish and Gobbledegook. It can all make things very confusing but luckily for you, you have a knack for linguistics. Regardless of the language, you can pick it up very well, enough that you could learn the basics of a language by the end of a day and speak it fluently by the week’s end. If you do this right, you could even gain a bit of respect from the notoriously stingy Goblins of Gringotts."
133,,100,A Scrapbook Of Memories,Disney’s Cinderella,Lore,"A simple, leather bound book of blank pages. Once you touch it, it automatically fills itself with your memories and allows you to play them like a dream/vision so that you can re-experience them. It sorts itself chronologically and cannot be read by anyone else without permission."
134,,100,Penny Dreadful’s Homework,Wizard 101,Lore,A loose leaf collection of notes on the Undead. Provides an in-depth primer on any kind of undead you encounter in the wild. Please ignore any cooking instructions.

139,,100,School of Death,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of Death, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those whose soul is not shrouded in the tattered remnants of a reapers cloak, as yours is."
140,,100,School of Life,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of life, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those whose heads are not crowned in fae flowers, as yours is."
141,,100,School of Myth,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of myth, finding them to hit harder and cast faster than they would for those whose minds gaze not upon mist-wreathed Avalon, as yours does."
142,,100,School of Balance,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found in the school of balance, finding them to hit harder and cast faster than they would for someone not otherwise attuned to the school that lies between all elements."
143,,100,School of Storm,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of storm, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those not so attuned to the hidden depths found in the darkened skies."
144,,100,School of Ice,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of ice, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those not dusted with the eternal frost found at the heart of winter."
145,,100,School of Fire,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of fire, finding that they hit harder and cast faster for you than they would for those whose hearts do not burn with the sparks of the everflame as yours does."
146,,100,Apprentice ,The Owl House,Lore,"Magic users at this skill level have already received some basic instruction and have started to specialize, putting them on par with Hexside students in their first or second years. An apprentice of the Construction Coven would be able to craft simplistic dwellings or enhance their physical prowess to twice their normal strength.

147,,100,Proficient ,The Owl House,Lore,"Magic users at this skill level have mastered the fundamentals and can manage most spells within their specialty. You could easily use your magical talents to make a living, like how Morton crafts specialty potions for the citizens of Bonesborough.

148,,100,Standardized Education,The Owl House,Lore,"Rote memorization? Pointless busywork? Sounds like public education to me! Whether you attended Hexide, Glandus, or another of the Boiling Isles’ approved magical institutes, you’ve received a basic education in the magic systems of this world. You were taught to cast spells as well as any witch or demon, which grants you some basic command of elemental magic and telekinesis, which will expand as you grow in skill and strength. This also comes with a foundation in one Coven specialty of your choice, preparing you for the rest of your magical schooling. This doesn’t grant any esoteric knowledge, and this won’t give non-natives the innate ability to cast magic, but you’ll start with the same information as everyone else."
149,,100,Old Witch's Ring,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"Old ring from an old witch. Engraved minutely with indecipherable script, but seemingly useless, at least until you speak to others. While wearing this ring, not only will you be able to understand any spoken language you hear as though you were a native speaker, but you will be understood by them in turn."
150,,100,Gravelord Miracles,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"Much like the tales that will be told of Lord Gwyn and his pantheon, there will one day be stories based around the concept of Death, the faith in their truth manifesting as tangible miracles. You are capable of casting these miracles, as well as creating new ones based upon Death and all that stems from it. For now, you can merely summon crimson blades from the earth to impale your enemies, but more is sure to follow, as surely as all that lives shall one day perish."
151,,100,Divine Miracles,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"In the ages to come, miracles would be performed by reading tales that bring about a revelation, yet is your very existence in these times not one in and of itself? You are capable of casting these miracles through the use of a talisman, all connected to the concept of light and what it represents. Healing yourself, reducing the effects of incoming magic, slowing nearby enemies, and many more."
152,,100,Minstrel,Walt Disney’s Robin Hood,Lore,"The stories of heroes and villains and underdogs of medieval times were the work of traveling bards. You have a gift with storytelling through music. Moreover, you automatically receive accurate information about the stories you are telling. For instance, you can perfectly recall how a couple do-gooder-thieves outwitted the Sheriff’s soldiers in the forest, even if you were nowhere in the area. However, your ability to fill in the blanks depends on both the artistic level of your narrative and how much information you have about the story; if you don’t give enough musical flair to your storytelling, for instance, or only have minimal information about the scenario you’re retelling, the more likely it will be that you will fail to acquire the extra info, or even come to false conclusions. The perk also gives you insights on how to use musical instruments as defensive tools in combat."
153,,100,Flash Cards,Wizards of Waverly Place,Lore,"Justin Russo has been taking notes on every school subject since he was in kindergarten. And now, you have a copy of all the notes he has taken up to his graduation from high school. These include English, Spanish, geometry, algebra, calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, history, geography, politics, general knowledge, and even wizardry."
154,,100,Feel It In My Code,WRECK-IT RALPH,Lore,"You have good instincts, especially when it comes to learning new things. It almost seems like you are simply relearning things that you already knew, with insights and skills coming quickly to you. This also has the effect of weakening any amnesia effects on you, allowing you to recover lost or hidden memories faster than before."
155,,100,Bending Scrolls,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Lore,"Instructions on different forms of bending and how they’re executed. These scrolls can teach you a number of offensive, defensive, and utilitarian moves, but they’re no replacement for a real teacher. You’ll receive a dozen scrolls for your nation’s element, and you may purchase additional scrolls for any element at a discounted price.

156,,100,Spellbooks,Marvel Magic,Lore,"These musty old tomes contain enough occult knowledge and basic spells to start one down the path of the Mystic Arts. Just the basics, mind you. But you will do well to never forget your basics, no matter how wise or powerful you may become. And perhaps an apprentice of your own may have use for these, some day?"
157,,100,Arcane Asgardian,Loki,Lore,"While others might rely on a mighty hammer or swords, you can cope without such tools thanks to possessing some degree of talent with magic. You’re not any sort of supreme sorcerer, more of a magician, this being more of the capability to use this talent rather than any sort of mastery or extensive knowledge. You know how to do basic illusion projection, duplication casting, minor conjuration, pull small objects towards you and unleash some relatively weak blasts of energy."
158,,100,All-Speak,Marvel Primal,Lore,"You speak the All-Tongue, which all men hear as their native language. Also, you can understand all speakers. Doesn’t help much with reading though."
159,,100,Mystic Arts Lore ,Ultimate Marvel,Lore,"You have knowledge of most Mystic Lore, allowing you to recognize most demons, gods, magic items, rituals, and various other things related to the mystic arts."
160,,100,Training ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Lore,Power is not a stationary point nor can it be numerically valued so to live another day warriors must train. This perk gives you the ability to train with any weapon – both physical and magic – and also be able to teach another if they have experience of capabilities. You can always find growth even if it is miniscule. This can’t give people magic or force a paraplegic to dodge with a roll.
161,,100,Artefact Expert ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Lore,Artefacts can be great channels of magic and hold many secrets. By separating the different pieces and studying them you can unlock new lore and ideas. This can lead to new spells or weapons. Beginners must be wary though to put all the pieces back together. These can’t be more powerful than you. An example of this is if you separated the Eye of Agamotto you could create an event revealer spell and the Ebony Blade could help you figure out umbrakinesis but to do so you must be a Sorcerer Supreme.
162,,100,Mystical Instruction,Marvel: What If...?,Lore,"Now we’ve solidly left the realm of mundane thinking. Whether you trained at Kamar-Taj or found another master to study under, you have achieved a basic proficiency in drawing energy from the multiverse to shape the source code of reality. These programs or spells may be small at first, but practice and training will reward your effort."
163,,100,Occultist,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Lore,"You possess a basic knowledge of magic and the occult. You are familiar with the concepts, and have some recognition of the various occult elements that exist in the world; you know what a Sorcerer Supreme is and what their duties are, know about how Hell is divvied up between Mephisto, Satanish, Hades, Hela, and Hellstrom, and the basic principles which govern magic in this universe. This only gives you a very basic knowledge of how to cast spells yourself, but you are guaranteed to have at least enough talent in this world’s magic to make some use of it (even in future worlds), even if this perk alone won’t guarantee you more than the bare minimal capability.

In future worlds this won’t grant you any guarantees to be able to use their magical systems, but the information will update to give you the basic knowledge that a low end individual in the know of its occult systems would know."
164,,100,Old Witch's Ring ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Lore,"Old ring from an old witch. Engraved minutely with indecipherable script, but seemingly useless, at least until you speak to others. While wearing this ring, not only will you be able to understand any spoken language you hear as though you were a native speaker, but you will be understood by them in turn."
165,,100,Miracles,Dark Souls: Covenants,Lore,"Members of the Way of White are typically seen utilizing miracles, a type of holy magic that is granted to one by reading tales that bring about a revelation. You are quite experienced with the usage of these, being able to perform such acts like healing yourself, reduce the effects of incoming magic, slow nearby enemies, and teleport yourself back to a previously located Bonfire."
166,,100,Academia ,Fate,Lore,"You've spent your whole life learning and helping out your teachers, and those benefits have stuck with you. You'll find it much easier to teach others, as well as understand new knowledge a fair bit quicker."
167,,100,Weapon Specialist ,Toaruverse ,Lore,Humans created weapons to help them fight to make them a better killer; this is especially for magicians and their spiritual items. Choose any weapon that you like from the most common to exotic ones and you become a master at wielding that said weapon making you capable of fighting and defeating several skilled opponents without breaking a sweat. You also gain a preternatural ability at combining or synergizing your spells or abilities with your weapon style allowing you to create your own deadly style of fighting.
168,,100,Hearth of a Teacher ,Toaruverse ,Lore,"Others like to teach children while some are forced in that role but unlike the latter you have the passion to teach the younger generations to guide them to their future. You are able to connect and form a bond with any student that you have and these students of yours always retain and understand anything that you teach them. Students that formed a bond with you always looks up to you as their parents, especially those that don’t have one and would go through hell together with you if they have nothing to lose. This also makes you incredible and creative at creating teaching materials to teach your students that none of them are bored when you are teaching them."
169,,100,Sorcerer,A Certain Magical Index,Lore,"You’re a magician with a purpose. It isn’t just enough to get good, oh no. You have to give back. You’re a sorcerer, or a magician that seeks to and is perfectly qualified to train the next generation of mages. You have a great grasp of magical theory & practical application, and have no problems with passing it down. You’re strong enough to handle the power of a grimoire easily, and can use one to teach your apprentices magic. Yes, even if you can’t demonstrate it to your students. You’re that good."
170,,100,Speculative Spectacles,Bayonetta,Lore,"What a nice pair of glasses! Stylish, yet effective in what they do. Even if you already have perfect eyesight, this pair of glasses assists you with memory retention when you're reading various writings and documents, ensuring you will always be a repository of knowledge. You'll even find that while wearing them, you can read significantly faster than normal with no loss of study effectiveness!"
171,,100,Prior Findings,Bayonetta,Lore,"Obscure knowledge of myth and legend are your forte, and if you don't know it yet you'll learn it soon. After all, that's why you got into this job, right? To learn about this kind of thing? You have a knack of picking up information, learning it faster and retaining it much easier than normal. Expect to match other intellectuals quite soon, if not baffle them with your wealth of knowledge. You could have nerd wars!"
172,,100,Master Swordsman,Ragna Crimson,Lore,"What’s power without some skill? Unlike the more brutish dragon hunters, you are actually skilled in the use of a weapon of your choosing, having several years of experience behind you and a particular talent for it. Not that skill alone would let you defeat the powerhouses of this world, but with a strong weapon in your hands and provided they didn’t use any strong magics, you could give a good battle to even the middle dragons and even hold the weakest Seija for a time. You are also able to recognize the talent or experience in others by exchanging just a single blow with them."
173,,100,Linguistically Talented,Trinity Wonder,Lore,"Among other things, different worlds have different languages. Given that they are completely separate universes, there is no guarantee that these languages will share any kinds of roots or have similarities. This doesn’t matter so much for you. Much like Emily and Wujin, you are shockingly talented when it comes to picking up new languages that you’ve never encountered before. With a guide to help, you would be able to speak in broken form of that language within a day. Within a week you would only have a faint accent."
174,,100,Symbology,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You have in depth knowledge of the symbols, pictographs, shapes, and patterns that carry some measure of meaning and power as well as how they can be used in the process of alchemy or magic. While it is possible to learn them and figure out how to put them together as you go, it is a time consuming process that requires a lot of trial and error, where an error can have severe side effects. You gain an increased skill in drawing and have an eye for measurements in terms of length and angles that would allow you to draw a complex alchemical circle without any tools other than your own hands, eyes, and a drawing implement."
175,,100,Pen & Paper,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You are a skilled writer, both in terms of creating manuscripts detailing your alchemical findings and pursuits, but also in the writing of fictional stories. You never suffer from writer's block and can ensure that what you write is evocative and easily understood, relatively speaking, by the targeted demographic. Finally, your books can teach in your stead, adding about a third of your skills as a teacher (and any boosts to teaching speed) to the rate at which one can learn something from your books."
176,,100,Nose for Secrets,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You have a knack for ferreting out lost, hidden, forbidden, forgotten, and/or useful information and artifacts during your travels. This makes you an exceptional archaeologist and detective as well as giving you a fair bit of skill in stealth and trapfinding."
177,,100,Academic,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You are a skilled researcher, able to read quickly, organize information you’ve gained, and extrapolate from that data more readily, with fewer mistakes and false leads. You also find that books are nearly as good a teacher as having an actual person there to aid you."
178,,100,Scholar ,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You have a perfect memory, with unlimited storage, the ability to instantly recall any information, and an immunity to outside tampering. You also possess an enhanced ability to visualize things within your mind and can create mental constructs or formulas at will to simulate simple devices and processes."
179,,100,Magic Theory,League of Legends,Lore,"You've spent your whole life around magic, and it'd be a darn shame if you hadn't learned a thing about it. Whether through formal education or through trial and error, you know the basics of how magic works on Runeterra, and how to apply it towards various minor cantrips that make life just a little bit easier."
180,,100,Basic Theory,Super Dragon Sword ,Lore,"You are capable of using Force 1, a weak offensive spell that deals approximately the damage of Fire 1, while having no elemental strength or weakness attached to it. You are also capable of casting Shield 1, a defensive spell that increases your evasive abilities. They’re not much, but they’re a key part of your studies. In addition, you are capable of shaping these magics and any others you know as areas-of-effect, be they “Force beams” or “Shield balls.”"
181,,100,Tale of Terror,Super Dragon Sword ,Lore,"While you may not be as capable of transforming into a beast as the Blue Mages of the stories, you do have a talent for retelling their beastly exploits. You are capable of entering a state of Recording for one minute, during which you may “Archive” any spell or ability used by a monster or other non-sapient creature during this state. You are able to analyze the properties of Archived spells or abilities to be better informed of how to avoid them."
182,,100,Basic Spellbook,Ben 10,Lore,"Every spellcaster worth their salt has to start somewhere and this is no exception. This is a collection of several basic spells and the essentials of how to use magic, enough that someone with no talent for the mystical arts could become a decent practitioner in a few months. This gets your foot in the door but anything more than simple mana constructs and blasts will take further study. Post-jump, this book functions as a ‘beginner’s guide’ to any sort of magic in future settings you jump to, though it may not necessarily mean you’re able to use it."
183,,100,Wizard Brain,Ben 10,Lore,"Magic involves a lot of book learning and memorizing things, so this gives you photographic memory and an extremely quick recall, letting you remember things like spells and incantations on the fly and react quickly. You’re also one heck of a speed reader!"
184,,100,Four Dimensional Wit ,Ben 10,Lore,"When you’re a time traveler, something you have to get used to is how confusing things are when they don’t happen in a linear fashion. Meeting your past or future self, people you haven’t met yet acting familiar to you, or things you’re destined to do in your own future. Thankfully you’re able to comprehend this sort of thing easily and have excellent guesswork on things having to do with your own future, able to comprehend events happening out of order without getting much of a headache. That might not be true for anyone accompanying you, though. Remember: Spoilers."
185,,100,Advanced spellbooks ,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,"These books offer stronger spells with more varied effects, and even a small degree of utility. These are a necessity for spellcasters to survive the mid-dungeon. "
186,,100,Council Trained,Dresden Files,Lore,"You have all the power, talent and training to make you a full Wizard of the White Council. Your specialty and specific skills are left to you to decide, but you are extraordinarily skilled in at least one field. You may choose to be a Warden for free if you want.

This perk can be bought multiple times for additional skills and knowledge, either general or specializing in certain fields of magic.

187,,100,Clued In,The Dresden Files,Lore,"Rather than walking around with your blinders on, you've dived into the supernatural world headfirst, and you've picked up a lot of useful information on the way down. You don't know everything, of course, but if it's common or even uncommon supernatural knowledge, you've probably picked up on it. You can tell the difference between demons, ugly faeries, and things that aren't either, and know their common weaknesses, behaviors, and will provoke them into killing you. It's also easier for you to learn new information about the supernatural, or call it to mind when being chased by something ravenous."
188,,100,Sign Language,Dark Souls 2,Lore,"“Stemming from nonverbal communication built up with compatriots with discretion was the better part of valor, you know sign language. . .of a sort. First of all, you’re quite gifted at understanding the intent behind whatever gestures or silent modes of communication others might be directing at you or someone else in sight. More importantly, you’ve become far more capable of reading context clues to decipher nearby threats. A freshly charred corpse means the threat of fire is nearby. A broken note left by a dead warrior could be a treasure trove of information based on location alone. Sometimes even markings on a doorframe could tell you a trap is waiting, and how to trip it safely.”"
189,,100,Ashina Arts ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Lore,"You are trained in the ways of the sword. Perhaps not in the Ashina school, but none the less, you were trained in a similar principle where with the clash of blades is less of a clash but more the dancing of a carp. You were taught to replicate the movement of fountainheads and incorporate the mannerisms of rivers and waves into your swordplay. The end result is a free- flowing style of swordsmanship that can easily change from attack to defense to counterattack seamlessly like the constant uninterrupted flow of water. This also affords you training in archery. When paired with Shadow Style, you effectively become a master swordsman who can augment their swordsmanship with the ninja’s knowledge of balance and windows of opportunity. So long as you have a blade in hand in close combat, it’s difficult for any weapon to reach you and it’s equally difficult to defend against you."
190,,100,Introduced Instincts,Bloodborne,Lore,"“Reduced cognitive abilities, a new body, and unleashed aggression seems like a recipe for awkwardness. However, mysterious as it is, even the freshly turned are able to exhibit seamless movement and fluid aggression, as fluid as any beast could be anyways. 

This enigmatic quality goes on to benefit you with your bestial skills, a background awareness of just how such things work even if you haven’t been fully transformed. You’ll get an idea of what your body is capable of, its limitations, what it’s designed for, and a comfortable familiarity with using it.  

Additionally, should you ever find yourself taking on new form in other ways, your instincts will likewise cover for those forms as well.”"
191,,100,Heightened Capacity,Demon's Souls,Lore,"​Magic requires those that use it to be more than just dumb brutes. This is reflected in you improving your intelligence and as a direct result your mana capacity. You can cast some basic spells(Flame Toss, Soul Arrow, and Water Veil) without them failing on you."
192,,100,Move Set,Demon's Souls,Lore,"You understand how to hold and use many weapons: halberds, swords, spears ,bows, crossbows, and et cetera. However it’s all rigid as if you're following from a book. With time you can innovate them into a fluid combat style."
193,,100,Astrologer,Elden Ring,Lore,"From divining the fate of things to come in the heavens above to invoking and calling forth the glintstone that is the amber of those that dwell among the heavens, the work of an astrologer is the lifeblood of Raya Lucaria. You have the training and knowledge deemed acceptable to be a scholar at the academy-not that which is needed to be proficient in battle, but rather the theories underlying your magical practices and the nuances of spell formation. It was minds like yours that innovated the Shard Spiral spell in order to emulate a comet; even failures of your insight into the heavens can result in useful magical effects. You’re also a very gifted teacher, capable even of teaching a loutish brute how to imbue magic in his weapons."
194,,100,Dark Arts Cache,Harry Potter,Lore,A cache of around 10 ancient books of the Dark Arts. Each one restricted by both Hogwarts and the Ministry. The contents are disturbing but interesting. There are some especially unpleasant curses in these books.
195,,100,Dedicated,Harry Potter,Lore,You find it much easier to study for a long period of time without getting bored. You can do a few hours of reading of even the driest material a day without ever losing focus and retain more information.
196,,100,Spellcaster ,MtG - Amonkhet,Lore,"By default, you are a cleric wielding your faith as magical power, though you could just as easily be a wizard commanding mana through knowledge and training, or even a druid exploding a deeply spiritual connection to the natural world, if you so chose. Regardless of your exact method of doing so, you have the ability and knowledge necessary to draw upon magical energy and weave it into spells. You are not a particularly knowledgeable or powerful mage, only reaching basic proficiency, but even at this level you are a resource to be cherished and a power to be reckoned with."
197,,100,Battle Trained,MtG - Amonkhet,Lore,"The Trials are primarily martial endeavours, so of course every child learns how to fight. You took to it like a fish to water. Regardless of whether you’re fighting with archery, a khopesh, a spear, a bolas, or even your bare hands, you are one of the best combatants your crop has to offer. You can fight in formation or alone, armored or otherwise, with or without a shield, if need be. In the future, your natural talent for violence will allow you to pick up any form of violent skill with incredible speed."
198,,100,The Song of All ,MtG - Homelands,Lore,"When the planeswalker Serra codified her religion, she did so in the form of a song to be expressed through her angels. The Song of All chronicles the beliefs, worldview, and wisdom of Serra, divided in exactly one thousand cantos of varying lengths. The whole song would take a choir of angels many days, perhaps over a week, to sing from start to finish.

What you have now is a complete version of the Song of All, in the form of a book containing all of Serra’s teachings. A perfect tool for promoting peace and harmony. It also comes with a couple of extra props to go with it, white robes and little idols carved in her likeness. 

Or if you’d prefer, you could instead get a different book with a Song of roughly equal length that instead contains all of your own beliefs, worldview, and wisdom. Just in case you wanted to codify your own religion in the form of an (angelic) song."
199,,100,Second Master ,MtG - Homelands,Lore,"The wizards’ school was largely founded through the efforts of a single man, the mysterious and enigmatic First Master who taught the first wizards as his personal apprentices. While he never revealed his identity to his apprentices, Feroz gave them much in just the few short years he was with them, left behind a large number of magical tomes, and most importantly taught them enough to learn and discover more for themselves.

While you’d need to bring in the knowledge yourself, this gives you more than enough skill at teaching to perform similar feats. Training a core of wizards who will go on to research and discover more magic for centuries afterwards is the work of a few years, bolstering a nation can be done by teaching a secret society a single spell, and with enough knowledge to pass on you could single-handedly start schools that can compete with nations."
200,,100,Tome Of Knowledge ,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"This large, iron-bound spellbook is a repository of knowledge unmatched on Shandalar. When attuned to a user, the tome will form an exact copy of the user’s sum knowledge, made avaiable with great ease. Though the most immediately beneficial use of this tome is in the fact it allows a user to more effectively organize their thoughts and, hence, expanding how many near-identical copies of spells they can keep track of, it also provides lesser boons. After all, as a repository of knowledge, it would not do to remain out-of-date. The book automatically updates itself as you learn new things or simply experience life, and unless the Tome Of Knowledge is later attuned to a different user, it will never lose any of its knowledge. Should you fall victim to a mind-rending spell or experience an unfortunate bout of amnesia, you may be able to use this book to restore that which you have lost - and the transfer of knowledge is instant in both directions.

The tome cannot be used by others without your agreement, so you need not fear your secrets being revealed within its pages... unless you wish it, at any rate."
201,,100,Whispers,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"The knowledge of man can fill a thousand books... but the knowledge of those beyond the veil can fill a thousand more. From ancient tombs to binding spirits from the afterlife, from demonic contracts to vile experimentation, you have a knack for finding usable knowledge... especially the kind of knowledge that more weak-willed or hypocritical people might consider ‘forbidden’. As a side-effect, you are also quite accustomed to protecting yourself during such risky endeavors, and while there’s no guarantee the reward is worth the risk, you’ll usually survive to enjoy the spoils… or at least get away before things get too dicey."
202,,100,Valorous,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"‘Know Thy Enemy’ is an important principle in combat, and you exemplify the teaching in all that you do. You are an expert at countering a single, specific strategy or style of magic at a time, and this focus allows you to gain a sizable advantage... but only against those who meet your expectations. A well-timed Circle Of Protection attuned to your foe’s main source of magical power can provide protection against even the mightiest monsters they might call to battle, but it is wholly useless against a spell of the wrong ‘color’, after all."
203,,100,Spell Mastery ,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"Representing a level of insight and competence in a specific spell surpassing that of even other mages, each purchase of this Perk allows you to maintain one spell acquired through ‘Knowledgeable’ within your mental focus regardless of any other limitations you might otherwise have, including the minimum amount of magical power needed to manifest it. Essentially, this ensures you always have your first copy of this spell ready at the start of a battle. This means you’ll be able to manifest it within a moment’s notice, eliminating any potential difficulties with the semi-random process of acquiring spells in your mental focus and the need to draw mana from lands or other sources to fuel this spell’s casting.

This spell does not interfere with any other spells you might try to bring into focus, and while an enemy’s spells might disrupt the necessary focus for lesser magics, your mastered spell cannot be ‘discarded’ in such a way unless you permit it.

In addition, you receive an additional three copies of this spell as if you gained them through ‘Knowledgeable’, though these copies do not gain the same benefits and must be ‘drawn’ and used normally.

Requires Knowledgeable(MtG - Shandalar) "
204,,100,GOLGARI GUILDMAGE ,MtG - Ravnica,Lore,"As a member of the Golgari, you’re going to be dealing with a lot of dead stuff, so if you’re squeamish, it’s going to be difficult. Luckily, this perk ensures that even if you’re up to your elbows in body parts, you’re fine with it. Not only that, but you have a much deeper understanding of the Golgari beliefs of nature as a cycle, where death is a natural and necessary part of life, making your magic concerning areas like these a little stronger."
205,,100,AZORIUS GUILDMAGE,MtG - Ravnica,Lore,"An Azorius guildmage is expected to know the rules of Ravnica inside out, both those intended to guarantee safety for the citizens, and those intended for more... selfish purposes. You have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the laws in the setting you’re in, and you get a slight boost to intelligence as well, to help you understand these laws."
206,,100,Infallible Metric,MtG - New Phyrexia,Lore,"Even mistakes are not hated if they are recorded- And you record everything! Blood loss from the operation, the angles at which the body can ́t bend further without breaking, the amount of oil you can pump into a human before they dissolve... When you ́re operating or researching, you take notice of even the smallest details, and can accurately measure any of the (quantifiable) details. Your reports are thorough, but they might be a bit boring to read. Never again will you miss anything potentially important in your research."
207,,100,Don’t Leave Matters Incompleat ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"As one might expect, each of the major factions has a philosophy that guides them both in battle and in peace, a style of magic that they favor, perhaps even an environment or a terrain their skills work best in. The gleaming white Samurai work best in wide open streets, brightly lit by the promise of a better tomorrow, while a Reckoner who stands in those same streets knows without question that they dun goofed. You are something of a master at adapting to these tactics, easily making minor changes to your stance and combat philosophy to better blend into and take advantage of your environment. Similarly, any experience you may have using or fighting these drastically different styles means that it’s much harder to catch you off guard - having fought something vaguely similar in the past, it becomes easier to predict the next actions of your foes even if they’re style is mostly completely new to you. "
208,,100,Information Security Is Key,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"A sad but important fact of life is that among those constantly seeking to push the boundaries of scientific advancement, resources, information, and even more ephemeral things like insight or motivation, are always at a premium. To that end, you have learned to ward off attempts at stealing your research, whether it’s by less upstanding scientists who think that you hold the key to their success, or by the Imperials checking to make sure that you’re actually doing what you’re supposed to be doing. As a side note, while this is more of a social skill that allows you to use your intelligence to intuit weak points, it also extends to programming knowledge, allowing you to set up a simple firewall around your machine's cores to prevent just anyone from using them"
209,,100,Depths of the Mind,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"The path of a Wizard is study, rote memorization and learning. These qualities are innate to those who wish to practice magic. Being infused with the cooling touch of Blue Mana, your intelligence has boosted along with your memory and ability to learn. Put simply, you are quite the savant, easily worth three of your peers when looking towards solving a problem, learning three times faster than normal, and having a perfect memory barring magical interference."
210,,100,Lawmaker ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"Rules keep society together and following them is of the utmost importance. Put simply, you have an intuitive understanding of the most basic rules when entering a new place allowing you to blend in with the crowd and avoid getting into trouble unintentionally. With just some minor study of a law book, it would not be difficult for you to be able to serve as a lawyer ensuring an understanding of even some byzantine law codes. This likewise also helps you when writing laws, helping you close loopholes in the law, prevent the creation of laws that are impossible to enforce or that contradict, and make it so that the spirit of the law comes first."
211,,100,"Encantus, Pocket Edition",The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Lore,"Sorcerer's bible, it serves as a combination of textbook and historical document, detailing the art, science and history of magic. Essentially every Encantus ever created is patterned after Merlin's original text, although this means that most modern copies of the Encantus are missing several chunks after damage incurred during his fall – such as a copy of The Rising spell. It also details the history of previous owner of the Encantus or the original it was copied from, and as such you can trace your sorcerous lineage back to Merlin through this. Your copy is a modern copy of the Encantus, which means while it lacks spells such as The Rising, it does have many more modern spells that have been invented since his time. For an additional 100cp, the Encantus will continue to update itself in future worlds to include the basic relevant skills of magic, as well as tracing your magical ancestry, if applicable."
212,,100,Multilingual,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"Who doesn’t want to speak another language to know another culture? You won't meet a sorcerer who doesn’t know at least one extra language. It's part of their way to hide among the mortals to live among them to immerse themselves in the world. That, and the fact that after a few decades, people can get incredibly bored and start learning anything to keep themselves entertained. But let's go with the former, since it’s more dramatic. By purchasing this, you gain mastery in speaking, reading, and writing a language of your choice, as well as gaining in-depth knowledge of the culture your chosen language is local to. This perk may be purchased multiple times."
213,,100,Combat Training,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"This world isn’t like Harry Potter where fighting is always done at a distance and only with magic. Here, sorcerers use every advantage they have to fight, win, and survive. All origins receive training in a single form of combat equal to that of a master of said discipline. The definition of combat training is rather broad, and can cover anything from a specific martial art to swordsmanship to the use of firearms. Now before you get a big head, I should remind you that the majority of the main characters are masters of several martial arts, so do try to be careful. This perk may be purchased multiple times."
214,,100,Common Tongue ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Lore,"It’s pretty convenient that, thanks to the meddling of a certain special Djinn, almost everyone in this world speaks the same language, the Torran people being the only exception. While it would be a bit unusual for this universal monolingualism to follow you into future worlds, you’re fortunately blessed with the next best thing – in every setting you travel to, you’ll automatically be completely fluent in the dozen or so most commonly-spoken languages, as if you’d been a native speaker of them your whole life. While you’ll have to put in the time yourself to learn any dead or rarer languages, it’s still pretty handy to be able to communicate with a good majority of the world’s people in their own tongue."
215,,100,Library of Babel,Campione,Lore ,"Perhaps a name too big for what it is, but its usefulness can’t be denied. This is a large library is a collection of myths, legends, fables and records about gods, angels, demons, heroes and other fantastical beings. It also recorded the cults for each and their transition in time and geography. As expected, it would take a long time to memorize it all, but is a good source of information if you happen to need it. It updates every jump."
216,,100,Modern Myth,Campione,Lore ,"This is a world were all myths and legends hold some truth to them, as such, you have been studying them from as far as you remember. Researching Gods, heroes, and esoteric matters in detail left you with a wide arrange of knowledge about them, their cults and related trivia. From the origins of certain heroes, association between gods and festivities, evolution of cults and which ones still remain in some form. This knowledge will update each world you visit, provided they had a similar cultural progression. Also, that historical and myth trivia may be a nice way to make small talk with others"
217,,100,Philosopher Kings,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore ,"The greatest kings and military leaders were more than just warriors and tacticians. They were men
of incredible fortitude beyond the simple body, with wills to push forward against the impossible for
years at a time, so that they could grasp victory. They were more than fighters, with experience as
philosophers or explorers that they bent towards their goals of conquest. You’re not a great king yet
but you share those beginnings. You’ve got a will like a wall of diamond, incredible hard and near
impossible to break or bend. You might not last forever against everything but it’ll take a damn lot to
make you bend the knee by choice. Your childhood, where you found that will, was spent not just on
military training but also in another field of life of your choice, such as exploring distant lands for
years to experience new cultures or spending time as a notable teacher of the arts at home, which
has given you a wide array of minor skills and experiences that aid you in finding creative solutions
to your enemies."
218,,100,Let’s Go Hero,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"To be a hero, you need to be a complete package. Fighting? It’s useful. You’re good at it too, enough
to handle ordinary soldiers in small groups on your own well enough or take down a minor magical
beast or five at once, but that’s not enough. Being a hero is about adventure and that’s where you’re
shining. You’ve got a wide array of skills when it comes to exploring and adventuring, from
acrobatics and navigation of land and sea to organising expeditions and how to sell off all the
treasure you find. In later times, you could definitely make a name for yourself as a great discoverer. Helps that you’re an able seaman, horseman and can handle weeks or months long travels without a
problem. You’re great at adapting to the strange things you’re likely to encounter on your journeys
as well, since thinking outside of the box, particularly when it comes to using magical or superhuman
solutions to things, comes naturally to you. Some people might not think of rerouting an entire river
just to clean some stables but you? You’re the smart cookie that can figure out how. "
219,,100,Witch In Training,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Magic is at once both plentiful and rare in these times. The world itself is abundant with magic, in
the land and in the beasts, but humanity itself has far less access to it than in modern times. While
magicians and witches are known factors, they are not things everyone can be. You have the luck to
be one of the special few with the potential and the training to start making use of your power. You’re still a novice, with a few years training in a handful of straightforward magical disciplines, but
you’re quite capable with your power, utilising the energy in your body and the world around you
with significant skill. An elemental mage would at least be able to destroy small buildings without
much effort and would be a highly desired force for any practical king’s army. If you have a special
talent, strange as it may be, it’s your ability to cook pancakes. Apparently, you have the skill to make
anything into a delicious pancake. Even say, a demon god, should you have it restrained, beaten and
unable to resist. The pancakes might look weird and have weird effects but gosh darn, they’ll be
tasty."
220,,100,Once Every Century,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Talent that comes only once in a hundred years might stand out at the time but against the expanse
of history? It just means there’s been a dozen or two others like that already. World class talent
might be the peak of what normal human’s can do but it’s just the start for those in the magical
world. Like the famed Salieri and his music, you have that world class talent in one art form of your
choosing. Singing, the piano, painting, architectural design, acting or some other method. With just
this and the right connections, you could certainly go down in the history of the mundane as one of
the greatest performers of your art to ever live. But you’ve got the potential to go further, as you
find yourself having a moderately easier time learning magical spells and abilities closely associated
with your chosen art, as well as such things becoming easier to use and somewhat more powerful as
well. Magic cast through a special instrument of the musical art you’ve mastered would be stronger, whereas a great painter would find magic relating to manipulating paintings and drawn images to be
significantly better for them than any others."
221,,100,Magician’s Tome,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Lore,"Magicians are ill-prepared without their tools. Not that you’d ever be found without your trusty
tome. This book is a powerful grimoire, a magical tool that not only stores a enormous variety and
depth of magical knowledge, but also a tool with which your magical power can be significantly
increased when you use it. Your grimoire is quite old and stores spells that master magicians have
created and encoded, across three or four fields of magical knowledge that you have an interest in.
It does not contain any world-changing magic but would be quite useful to any young mage wishing
to have a guide towards becoming a master. It’s notable for how efficient it is as a magic tool as well,
increasing your power by almost half again when you hold it as you cast spells, and the book has
several minor demons bound to it that will attack any but you that try to force the book to open to
them. You may import a book or casting implement into this role."
222,,100,Prodigious,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"The core of an artist is their art. One can hardly claim to matter in the art world if you’re not at least
proficient in some form of art, so you’ll have at least a little talent to get by on. A little, of course, being relative. Whether it be a kind of music, a form of visual expression, a manner of writing or
some strange way to create art, you’ll find you have quite the talent at one such thing. You’d be a
noted prodigy in any of the artistic schools around Europe and with years of effort, might one day be
able to claw your way up to the world stage. Your impressive talents do, one must admit, lie more
outside just performance. However it takes form, you have even more talent at turning your art to
combat than you do making beauty with it. A violin that somehow becomes a lethal sword, songs
that can be used to transmit magical spells to many targets at once. You have a talent for taking art
to a deadly and/or magical level, both what you already specialise in and what else you might learn
in the future."
223,,100,Mind of a Beast Man,Angel Notes,Lore,"Being born from the mix of an animal and a human, you’ve got some traits left over from your less
intelligent side. We don’t mean the humans either! The instincts of your animal form teach you how
to move your body right, how to fight well and other useful things but they also make it hard to act
rationally at times and your fight or flight response is really just too extreme. You won’t find yourself
dealing with any of that. You’ll still get all the useful knowledge from instincts like this but you’ll
always remain totally in control of yourself, at least when it comes to biological impulses like this."
224,,100,Arcane Tricks,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Lore,"You were apprenticed to a master magus as a child, one that took a liking to you and taught you well. Out of that training you came armed with knowledge of all kinds of magic and how best to use it too. You have a fair degree of skill in over half a dozen magical disciplines, such as Alteration or the
summoning of spirits, and significantly better and more magical circuits as any ordinary warrior or
witch around these parts. If you were in the modern world, you’d be a fair bit beyond the Tohsaka
heir in power and well beyond her in versatility. Perhaps due to your rather quirky teacher, you also
picked up skills on how to really mess with other people. You can get all but the most stoic people to
snarl in anger at you and provoke a good laugh from an entire troupe of soldiers with little effort."
225,,100,Student’s Lifestyle ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"Being a student’s harder than it looks. You’ve got to manage
your time, take good notes, listen to boring lectures, read boring textbooks, search
through a library for references, and write papers that actually make sense. Fortunately,
you’re perfectly adapted for academic life, and have all those skills. You also have a deep seated love for discovery and learning, in general but especially when it comes to the
supernatural, which will carry you through even the most unengaging classes."
226,,100,Teaching Aid ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You might not have a teaching degree, but frankly you deserve one.
You know exactly how to organize a syllabus, grade papers, lecture effectively, and keep
a classroom full of rowdy teenagers in line. Er, mostly in line."
227,,100,Experimentation and Papers,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You are at home in a lab. When it comes to
experimentation, you know all the procedures, can keep detailed and accurate notes, and will never accidentally violate a safety protocol. You also have the ability to compose
your findings in ways that are elegant, informative, and understandable even to the less
educated. You also have a knack for correctly connecting cause to effect, which would
make you a half-decent detective, though it is nowhere near infallible."
228,,100,Family Library,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"A collection of several dozen mystical texts and hundreds of
notebooks which contain all the information necessary to learn common magecraft, and
a great deal of information about your family’s magic and research in particular."
229,,100,Waltzing with the Reaper ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"To be a Magus is to walk with death. The very act of using what we call magic, of mixing the Mana of the air with the Od of your body to create Prana and circulate it into your Magic Circuits, is something that has inherent danger. To accept that knowledge and revel in it is to take on the air of something more than human. The petty concerns of human life fade somewhat, making it so much easier to retain the sophistication and grace expected of a refined member of the Association. It requires a will stronger than normal people to brush up against death and that same will, in a rather less dramatic application, is something that allows most Magi to withstand the long hours of study, research and constant requirement for creative thinking when it comes to learning magecraft. Exam hell doesn’t even begin to describe it, when you’re studying to make sure you don’t incinerate yourself from the inside out!
"
230,,100,Magus Education ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"An official education! The proper way for a magus to learn his arts, to travel to the famed Clocktower institution and learn from the greatest, and most egotistical, minds of the Mages’ Association. Even if you’re some country bumpkin from the Far East, you’ve had the chance to get a formalized education and degree at the Clocktower over the course of four to eight years. It taught you all the basics of being a Magus, such as decent capability with Formalcraft, Reinforcement, Gradation Air, and Hypnotism. The core arts of any magus, as well as a general familiarity with the supernatural world. You also took on something of a specialty, possibly even a family legacy you inherited, in magecraft. In a field of modern magecraft, you’ve made a name as having decent potential. An amateur to any professional but in your chosen field, from a rookie Alchemist to a burgeoning Elementalist to a spirit user or something more specific, you’ve got a few years training on the other students with no ability at all. Your time there also lets you gain a few friends and contacts at the Association, mostly classmates and perhaps a faculty member or two. You can buy this perk multiple times, gaining another specialization of the same level each time.
"
231,,100,Basic Magecraft - Formal Craft,Tsukihime,Lore,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement, Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used by Magi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events and Misaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modern Magecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in that particular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Lastly, Formalcraft is enhancing similar magecraft through a long process of ritual and ceremonial sacrifice, which is time consuming but rewarding if you have the patience for it. "
232,,100,Model Student ,Tsukihime,Lore,"If you find yourself regularly skipping class to go on nighttime hunts for vampires or just general adventure, then it pays to be a good student on paper if nothing else. You're a model student, soaking up what teachers say like a dry sponge and speed reading your required studies in but an hour. You learn about twice as quickly as other top students, absorbing academic and mundane skills with very little trouble, even on a time crunch. Supernatural teachings or things like complicated science takemore time, but you’re still an excellent learner as long as you have a good teacher - whether an actual mentor or a very informative book.
"
233,,100,A Rarefied Mind ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"It would be a shame that in your quest for enlightenment you suffered a lapse of memory. It’s not like some of these secret teachings can be found in the local library. This simple perk makes your memory perfect, limitless, and retroactive, while also allowing for instant recall and perfect indexing. You’ll never forget any moment of your life, no matter how small, and you’ll be able to recall those moments as if you were currently standing there again. As a retroactive effect, your past memories will also be affected, even if you’ve somehow managed to forget them.
"
234,,100,Erudition ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"The acquisition of knowledge is more than just the senseless hoarding of information. With this purchase you now excel at predicting, interpolating, and connecting information, and can easily cross reference your knowledge with external information, making studying a relatively painless endeavor. Combined, these benefits will allow you to triple (3x) the rate at which you study and convert conscious knowledge into instinctive understanding.
"
235,,100,Textbook ,Sailor Moon,Lore,"Using this textbook, filled with information about any one field of knowledge, ranging from tactics to the curriculum of a high school science class to astrophysics, you can study up on subjects and learn things quickly. You find that studying from these books helps you understand and retain concepts much easier compared to a normal textbook. They have an almost magical quality to them that can help you get an intuitive feel for the book’s subject. You may purchase this item multiple times for different subjects.
"
236,,100,Book​ ​of​ ​Curses​ ​,Sailor Moon,Lore,"This is a standard book of curses, meant to inflict minor things like nightmares, bad luck, and other kinds of evil magic. The curses aren’t very strong, and can be easily resisted, but they sure are annoying.
"
237,,100,Underworld Connections,DC Comics,Lore,"What, did you expect to be robbing banks and pulling heists to pay the bills? No, you’re above
that. You might not necessarily be Lex Luthor’s rival in the boredom, but you have considerable
experience in dealing with the black market and other underworld operations so you can get
your hands on the more illicit substances your schemes require. You won’t hesitate on the
appropriate conduct for dealing with a mafia don or an Intergang rep, and you have a good head
for how to motivate thugs as well as what their work is worth in the current henchman job
market. Paying reporters to dig out dirty secrets, bribing officials and all the other nitty-gritty
hardball tricks in the grey areas of society’s moral spectrum is also well within your repertoire."
238,,100,Batman's True Superpower,DC Comics,Lore,"What, did you expect to be selling autographs or robbing banks to pay the bills? You’re no
celebrity, have some self-respect! No, that won’t do at all. Doesn’t running a business in your
secret identity to fund your caped identity sound so much better? You have a natural sense for
business, and how to make money. Sell the technology you invented! Sell your superhuman
services! Sell people superpowers of their own! You almost always walk away with a better
deal than you were offered, having talked circles around the other party, and the way you can
run a business as it grows from a deal selling weapons research to the government to a multi-
billion dollar international conglomerate is simply a work of art.

You’ve also got a habit of digging up profitable business ventures and other ways to make
yourself very, very rich."
239,,100,Shrine of [Insert Patron Name Here],DC Occult,Lore,"Your power comes from an outside source, and some such sources demand attention, whether through prayer or rituals performed in their names. This is a special shrine, a few feet tall, and made of wood. The drawers at the bottom contain a range of eclectic and occult tools and accoutrements, from sticks of incense to bowels and blood letting knives. All of these are marked with the symbol of your patron of choice, which can be changed with a quick chant... Maybe don’t tell them about that bit, they may not appreciate how quickly your devotion can change targets. It comes pre-devoted to the being of your choice, which can freely change once per jump. Devoting it to other beings will be far easier than it would normally be.
"
240,,100,The Lost Tongues ,Stardew Valley,Lore,"The languages of the magicals creatures of this world used to be far more widely known than they are now. People used to entreat earth spirits in their own tongue for a bountiful harvest or negotiate with dwarves for their solid steel tools. But now only the mages and the intensely curious know them. You’re one of those who can speak to dwarves and earth spirits in their own language. You can also make yourself understood in shadow brute, but most of their kind are through listening to humanity. You will also have a small talent for picking up other mystical languages.
"
241,,100,Esoteric Lore ,Libriomancy,Lore,"You have a body of esoteric lore embedded in your mind. From ancient legends of buried treasure to what really happened to Atlantis, you know all of the old secrets and just how the secret supernatural wars shaped history into what it is today. This knowledge is updated whenever you move to a new world and while not granting you any particularly germane knowledge to your current situation, perhaps you might devise a unique insight or solution based on knowledge that no one else is privy to. (Imagine if you were the only one who knew the story of the trojan horse)"
242,,100,Family Tree ,DC Occult,Lore,"​It can be hard, sometimes, to track down ancestors when one side of the family can live for centuries, but now it’s just a little bit easier. With a drop of blood on this large scroll the names of your ancestors will be filled in - provided their identity isn’t being supernaturally concealed. This only provides the name they would be most commonly known by, which may unfortunately be a title for some beings, but hey - it’s a start."
243,,100,Fluency ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Magical spells can be a real tongue twister, you know? Luckily for you, that’s not a problem. Whether it’s speaking in ancient Latin, backwards English, or ţ͢h̛̕e̕ ̴̧͡ ̧ş̢̛́͞ ̧ ̛p ̛e ̴̧͡ è̀͜ c̛͟h̀̀͜ ̶̷̡ ǫ̢̨̧̢̛́͟͞͞ ̨̢̨͟͟͞f ̶̷̡̕ ţ̴͡ h ̶̷̡ǫ̢̨͟͞ ̶̷̡s҉ę̸̧̨̢̨̧̀͢͢͟͞ ̧̀̀͜ ̸̨̢̨̨̧̀͟͢͞o ͢ u ̀̀͜ t̛̕͟s ̨̢̨̕͟͞ ì̀͜ ̴̧͡ d ̀̀͜ ę̢̨͟͞ , you’ll never trip over your words or mispronounce a spell. Rather handy to make sure you never summon a demon when you’re trying to wash the dishes.
"
244,,100,Supernaturally Streetwise ,Libriomancer,Lore,"You are familiar with the magical underground, the major players in your area and rumors of all supernatural goings on that travels through the inhuman grape­vine. Wherever the supernatural exists you are able to find it, drawn inexorably to stories, legends and myths which are more often than not true. No matter what world you go to, so long as there is a secret supernatural world you will almost certainly find it with only a modicum of effort."
245,,100,Play Along With Me ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Lore,"Music is the soul of mankind… and, well, your soul isn’t in your body anymore so it makes perfect sense you’d be good at it, right? What? That doesn’t make any sense? Well, who cares! Pick a single mundane musical instrument. You are now amazingly talented at playing said instrument. You can, if you wish, give magical abilities you have a ‘musical’ aesthetic by having the sounds of your chosen instrument play along with whatever sounds your magic makes...though this won’t add anything except a personal touch to it, mind you. Go forth, Jumper. And play.
"
246,,100,Genius,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"Maybe you had information implanted into your head. Maybe you had a childhood locked away where the only thing to do was study. Either way you are a genius for your age and have university level knowledge on a number of topics. You excel at mathematics, physics, cooking, athletics and a number of art styles."
247,,100,Perfect Memory ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You have a perfect memory, able to remember knowledge of magic that you haven’t thought of in over a decade as if it was minutes ago."
248,,100,Amezaiku Crafting Anthology ,Golden SKy Stories,Lore,"Amezaiku is typically viewed as more of an art form than an expression of culinary ability, though kids might argue that there is no shortage of the latter. Essentially the art of moulding candy into specific shapes, like animals or symbols, this crafting practice originally had religious implications, but has since become an artistic demonstration.

This book teaches you this craft, and as you get more practice you’ll be able to craft them more proficiently. With sufficient magic, you might even be able to awaken the spirit within them – and bring these living taffy sculptures to life.
"
249,,100,Magician’s Mind ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Lore,"Magic does not come naturally for some, but by taking this perk, you will gain the potential of shattering the barrier to perform magic that many fail to overcome. Even for those already proficient in magic, your own magical be polished as well, allowing you to learn new kinds of magics and special abilities with far greater ease. Additionally, once you do learn a new skill or ability, you will never forget how to perform it.
"
250,,100,I Read About Them Before ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"Your knowledge of youkai is vast, from all the books on youkai you’ve read. You have a general grasp of all youkai except the most exceedingly unknown ones who have faded out of memory. From your long studies you understand their psychologies, such as how to chase them away and keep yourself safe from their attacks.
"
251,,100,Real and Fake ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You’ve steeped yourself in supernatural energies for so long you can, at a glance, tell the difference between real supernatural texts and fake ones as well as read the energies and emotions in a text, learning exactly how someone was feeling when they wrote something. You could, for instance, tell from a stack of letters which ones were written with love, growing desperation or despair.
"
252,,100,Fairy Fluent - Boosted,Peter Pan,Lore,"You can naturally understand the tinkling, bell-like language of fairies, and also know how to teach people to understand the language. It is the most wonderful of tongues, sounding like the sweetest, most innocent bells whether you are professing love and rudely insulting somebody. However, unless you are a Fairy, you cannot speak it in turn, unless you pay 100 CP extra. (CG Note: requires base Fairy Fluent first.)
"
253,,100,Porcelain Bowl ,Neverland: The RPG,Lore,"A huge porcelain bowl with paintings of violent monsters, humanoids, and other creatures (whatever beings/creatures most frightened you as a child) on the side. The bowl is filled with whatever drink you disliked the most as a child, and drinking the liquid from the bowl lets you understand (but not necessarily speak) any language for an hour. You can bottle the liquid, but the bottled liquid will turn poisonous after several days. The bowl remains constantly full but never overflowing – except in the case that the bowl is destroyed, in which case everyone within range is at risk of being hit by the liquid and in this scenario taking damage from contact with the liquid; if destroyed, the bowl repairs itself and refills in a week.
"
254,,100,Know the Rules ,Wonderland No More,Lore,"The various scriptures for the different faiths in Wonderland can be quite complex – especially the code of honor for the Spirit of Conflict – and that can create a problem when breaking one of said rules can make you lose your spiritual power as a cleric. This perk lets you easily memorize all the various rules and expectations for whatever faith, group, organization, or culture you’re following. You’ll also know what the general costs will be for breaking any of those rules, and how you can properly atone for committing those sins.
"
255,,100,The Articles of Imperial Magic: Pocket Edition ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"It would appear that one of your colleagues has reproduced the entire contents of the Articles of Imperial Magic in a small, portable volume, with footnotes explaining the more arcane fine print (pun intended). Not only is this tome easy to carry, but an enchantment placed by said colleague will update the book to contain the full text of any code of laws applying to wizards and other law-bound magicians in your future destinations. Note that these laws do not concern the workings of magic, but rather concern the extent of its legal uses and restrictions."
256,,100,Beginner’s Luck ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Lore,"“What happened, buddy? My bracelet did what now? Huh. Who knew?”

You have a great talent for making use of new weaponry and tools. With just a few swings of a sword, you’d be able to figure out how to effectively wield it even if you had no prior experience with fighting. Whilst it’s a long way from mastery, this instant intuition applies even to more complex weapons like bows, magical rods and hookshots, which would typically require hours of research before you could otherwise hope to use them competently in a fight.
"
257,,100,Treasure Map ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Lore,"A red scroll, opening to reveal a random location with a single red X located on it. And I do mean random, as it could be pretty much anywhere. The only real guarantee is that it’s going to be somewhere in the ocean. Find where the X is in real life, and you’ll find some treasure. Might be a neat magical artifact, or just some rupees. The map changes a few days after you find each treasure.

258,,100,Basic Books ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"You’re going to need these as a drop-in. These books will provide you with knowledge of up to four paths of linear magic. They’ll get you on your feet, magically speaking."

260,,100,Psychic Abilities - Channeling (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psychic world’s answer to the Path of Ephemera, channeling is sometimes called Necro-Psi, and often confused with the aforementioned Path. It allows the psychic to interact with the spirits of the dead, but not other forms of spiritual beings, perceiving their presence and even drawing upon their skills and experiences.

[1] The channeler may sense nearby ghosts in a vague sense, and channel the skills and knowledge of one ghost of choice, once per day."

265,,100,Clever Craft ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"Having been trained as a mage, you know basic spells from each of the schools of magic, and can easily learn new spells."
266,,100,Artist’s Eye ,The Dragon Prince,Lore,"Part of Primal Magic is being able to sketch runes in the air. You, fortunately, have a great eye and memory for detail, and can replicate a rune after seeing it once. Of course, this also helps you be better at drawing in general."
267,,100,Lore ,Terraria,Lore,"You are a seeker of mysteries, wishing to understand this strange world that you are now a part of. As you enter a new location or interact with a new individual, you will gain snippets of understanding about history, lore, mythology, and other information associated with the target of your focus. The more you study them and interact with an area, the more these pieces of understanding will pile up."
268,,100,The Rune is Mightier than the Sword ,World Seed,Lore,"The one thing putting people off the runic language is its sheer volume. Considering that there are ninety-nine million, two hundred and thirty thousand, seven hundred and sixty nine of them, representing every single word and concept in all known languages, even things such as “watering the grass every week”, that’s no surprise. Because of that, even learning the runic language can be a challenge, requiring either a brain implant or some other form of perfect memory.

Anyone who doesn’t have access to these things needs to spend time and effort to search for those runes they’ll actually use and transcribe them into a book or save them to their computer. Luckily, you won’t have to do with such shortcuts: as of now, you are fluent in the entirety of the runic language, and will never forget it. Furthermore, as you will undoubtedly encounter words and concepts foreign to the people in this universe throughout your travels, it will update itself to include runes for anything you might come upon in the future."
269,,100,Linguistic Talent ,Danmachi,Lore,There are many types of language existed in this world. This grants supernatural insight and comprehension at learning new languages as this allows you to learn dead or magical languages with just hearing someone talking in that language over a prolonged time or staring at an inscribed word for a long time. Potentially you can even create your own language to prevent others from reading your notes.
270,,100,Abstract and Decoder Ring,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Lore,"A book which contains the past, present and future of the Gibborim and their servants, the Pride, as well as the rites of sacrifice that bind the two. Plus dark secrets, black magic and forgotten scientific lore that the Pride used to enhance their powers and skills. Comes with a decoder ring to enable translation. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart."
271,,150,Ace,The Old Republic,Lore,"Your piloting and engineering skills are among the best in the galaxy. Anakin Skywalker would consider you a peer, though your achievements might be lacking compared to his."
272,,150,Cyclone Tome,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"The Emperor’s Cyclone, in a learnable format. If you train it to its maximum power, it can decimate towns and host a defensible castle in the middle. It persists as long as you’re to concentrate upon it. For another 50CP, the tome will not be blank afterwards."
273,,150,Ultima Tome,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"The Ultimate Black Magic, Ultima. Ultima grows more powerful for each other spell you know. This tome will teach whoever reads it the spell, and then the Tome will become blank, as the other tomes. For another 50CP, the tome will not be blank afterwards."
274,,150,Bag of Tomes,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"All the standard magical tomes. Once read, it will commit to your memory and the pages will become blank. For another 50CP, the text will remain, allowing multiple people to read them. Contains all the spells aside from Ultima, Revive and Destroy."

Whispering a demon's true name to it will bind it to your service for a year and a day. The demon will be prohibited from seeking vengeance. Shouting the demons true name will ruin the demon. It will assuredly seek vengeance.
276,,200,Inspiration,Baldur's Gate 3,Lore,"On occasion, you may randomly get inspired by some events. This could occur by doing
something you are interested in or maybe something closely related to your area of expertise or
something that truly satisfied you with how it concluded. On those occasions, you’ll gain a
something called an inspiration point. You can hold a maximum of four inspiration points at
any given time. By spending these points in times of need, you can turn the tides in your favor.
Stuck with a problem that is nagging you for days? Spend an inspiration and have that final
push to solve it. Having trouble penetrating an enemy’s strong defense? Spend a point to gain
chance for breakthrough. You get the idea."
277,,200,The Master of Torture,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"During your time hunting and looting Danger
Beasts, you acquired a good knowledge of their physiology, however, you further
improved it, gaining an extensive knowledge of not only about the beasts’s bodies,
but also of human physiology. Your skill and knowledge in the human body allows
her to perform immediate medical care to yourself and others, as well as having the
needed skills to dissect a dead body to find information on them. But this is only the
basic usage of your medical abilities, as this is also the needed knowledge and skill
in order to torture your enemies in the most painful way possible while keeping them
alive for as long as possible, being a specialist on the most varied forms of torture
and punishments. Additionally, your mind is also blessed with a cruel creativity when
it comes to developing new forms of torture, mainly when it involves any
supernatural ability you might possess."
278,,200,Da Rules,A Mage of Sorothustra,Lore,"You have a complete codex containing every bit of wisdom the Mystic
Mother gave her earliest followers, as well as a complete record of the most famous conflicts
solved by Sorothustran peacemaking, be it on Sorothustra or on foreign worlds. In future worlds
you can use this as proof of your peacemaking skills, or as a series of fantastical bedtime
stories, or any other context-appropriate usage, and it will be received in the vein it is meant to
be taken in."
279,,200,Xeno-Psychologist,A Mage of Sorothustra,Lore,"You have an innate, remarkable grasp of psychology. You
instinctively read body language and subtle physiological cues, and while at first, you are more
adept in applying this understanding to humanoids, if you have as short as a few hours of
intensive conversation and time to study them you can apply this understanding to other
creatures. You have a powerful instinctual ability to know what actions allow you to give off the
impression you want to give off, even to strangers."
280,,200,Skilled Sorceror,A Mage of Sorothustra,Lore,"All Sorothustrans are skilled sorcerers but there is something
uncanny about your talent with sorcery. You seem to be the Sorothustran equivalent of a
prodigy, able to naturally understand even completely foreign magic systems with frightening
ease, and you are especially talented at redirecting magic. If you opted to specialize in Iron Law
then your ability to tank magic is noticeably improved (and with time you can absorb the
energies in other spells and use them to fuel and modify your own magic), if you are a wild
dreamer then you can snuff out lesser magic with a thought (able to do away with even
planet-scale effects with some level of mild difficulty, using nothing more than your thoughts and
focus), if you are a practitioner of chaos calculus then you are able to use rituals to tear apart
effects, and you are notoriously skilled at capturing the energies contained with hostile magic
and turning it into ingredients for your sorcery. In case you happen to be someone who
memorizes the nornic fractal you are able to turn negative effects into positive ones powered by
the same magic, allowing you to take curses and debuffs and turn them into buffs and blessings.

Requires The Sorothustran Set-Up to purchase."
281,,200,Kihara Method,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Lore,"Like most people in this world, you seem to make
the greatest strides in your research when you actively violate social codes, whether those
codes are ethical, legal, moral, or religious. The more codes you violate and the worse the
violation, the more usable and accurate your data will be. You devil."
282,,200,Innovator,TES: Dovah,Lore,"Just as language changes over the course of hundreds of years, so
too does the Thu'um evolve through experimentation by inquisitive Dovah. You are one
of those experimental folk, finding it much easier to develop new Shouts through better
understanding of the Words, and how they all tie into each other. In time, you will even
be able to create those rare, powerful Shouts requiring four Words of Power. Perhaps, with enough time and perks, you might be able to create something altogether new: a five word Shout.

Requires Thu'um to purchase."
283,,200,Secret Creeper,The Old Republic,Lore,"You live and breathe secrets. You never accidentally reveal more than you intend though speech or deed,
and you don't think of pink elephants—mind readers will be furious as you refuse to follow their bait and
bring sensitive memories to the surface. Only extreme circumstances, such as the total violation of your
mind, can force you to divulge information unwillingly.
On the flip side, you have a knack for learning things people would rather you not know, able to track down
information even with the barest thread of evidence to follow. You're an Expert investigator and
interrogator; you know just the right threads to pull to get to the truth, and can do so either flagrantly, or
so subtly your mark may never realize what they've given away. You're also Proficient at torture."
284,,200,Powerpedia,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Lore,"The more you stack up, the more confusing it gets to keep them all sorted. You’re probably already
in the habit of collecting a wide array of abilities and it’ll only get worse from here. So it’s good that
you’re now able to not only have a complete awareness of every ability and power that you have at
all times but also all of their potential uses and combinations with each other. Even creative, obscure
combinations between two seemingly irrelevant powers are immediately revealed to you upon
possessing both of them. "
285,,200,Total Concentration Breathing,Demon Slayer,Lore,"Can be purchased three times. Oh, now it gets interesting. After a certain point, training your body in the classical sense
just doesn't make fighting demons any easier. But! Fret not, because with this, you're now a practitioner of a
Breath Style; at the core of this technique, whatever it happens to be for you, is specialized patterns of
breathing combined with precise movements of your blade, evoking something elemental or natural with
each technique. At first, this simply makes you a fair fight for your average demon - not the Twelve,
certainly, but someone who's had a few good meals in their lifetime - thanks to your expanded stamina,
heavily-oxygenated muscles, and precisely stylized strikes. You'll never break a blade (or spear, or mace,
or whatever else you fight with) because of a bad swing again, and as your lungs grow stronger, so do you.
Of course, this baseline assumes you're practicing an established style...but with an additional purchase of
this Perk, you develop you'll have achieved Pillar-level mastery of something more unique, a signature style
of sword-fighting that may very well be yours and yours alone, and by buying this Perk a third time, you are
the progenitor and grandmaster of a complete fighting style on par with the Breath of the Sun itself - hell, it
may not even be a sword-based fighting style. This will allow you to teach others your style as well, and like
the Breath of the Sun, there will be enough material for other skilled fighters to develop their own variations
of it if they don't have the necessary constitution.

Note: Price is doubled for Demons."
286,,200,The Art ,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"You can proudly call yourself a Sorcerer, the years of hard work and study were worth it. While other children played around or wasted away their lives you learned the great lore and secrets of science, mastering many spells. The power taken from the elements and bound in a spell may be used for healing, protection, destruction, teleportation, the manipulation of minds, the creation of illusions, and the capacity to alter forms. The spells themselves are a mixture of gestures and speech. The slightest mistake in the pronunciation or positioning of the fingers can lead to disastrous consequences, but you are not one to easily make such mistakes, as you are incapable of making them at all! Even taken by surprise or sabotage, your execution of the magics will be flawless and unaltered.

Note: Requires Basic Mastery."
287,,200,Kido Specialist,Bleach,Lore,"Kido is far from a single unified discipline. The most obvious divisions are that of Hado and Bakudo
but several groups exist outside of this numbered system as well. Kaido, also referred to as the
healing arts, or the wide variety of seals and large scale barrier techniques apparently outside of
normal Bakudo. You’ve found quite the gift for one such field of Kido, one of the above classifications or even just a
type of spell like those that manipulate lightning or which suppress spiritual energy. You’ll easily
make great strides of progress in learning your specialty and find it possible to take those arts well
beyond the normal limitations. Much of this has to do with how easy you find it to modify existing
spells that fit your chosen field. Hado 4- Byakurai is normally a single beam of powerful lightning but
in your hands, it could quickly be used as a homing laser that chased foes till caught or a rapid fire
blast of smaller lightning bolts or even act as a lightning rod towards your fingers to protect others. "
288,,200,Self Surgery,Bleach,Lore,"All these wonderful inventions, fantastical improvements to the spiritual form. Yet to trust your
incompetent assistants with the surgeries? The fools without a tenth your skill? No, you have to do
some things yourself. You learned to be self sufficient, even when it was your own body on the
operating table. Self surgery and otherwise operating on yourself is no more difficult than
performing procedures on others. You might need a few extra tools but your skills will be as sharp as
ever and the pain easy to ignore in the face of your curiosity. As long as you have some sort of
manipulator left, even a single limb or some strange tentacle appendage, you’ll work quickly and
surely to put yourself back together. "
289,,200,Sharpened Mind,Bleach,Lore,"If you’re not just a brute that fights with overpowering strength, it’s important to know what the
enemy can do and will do. Judging opponents has been a talent of yours since your youth, helping
you quickly piece together the capabilities of an enemy even from just small hints. With both
physical senses and the use of reiatsu sensing, you can tell a lot about others. The way they use their
Shikai will tell you a lot more than they’d like to let on. If they try to set up traps or feints, you’ll
usually see through pretty easily and be able to figure out a way to turn it to your advantage. Even
outside of combat, this sort of observational skill can tell you quite a bit about other people, letting
you make scarily accurate guesses about what they’d do in certain situations once you’re familiar
with them."
290,,200,Improved Experience Modifier ,Bofuri,Lore,"It seems you collect three times the experience as normal. And I’m not just talking about in NWO. Any training, learning, or practice yields three times the result it otherwise would."
291,,200,Natural Adept at Aptitudes (1),DC Comics,Lore,"In this world, the line between mundane skill and supernatural proficiency is rather thin. Just ask
any of those “peak human” fellas who can lift a car, or folks who can cut down a group of armed
men before they can fire-with the element of surprise, at least. And now you are one of those
veritable Renaissance Men and Women, who seem superbly talented for whatever your race is
at anything you can naturally do which you actually turn your hand to. You pick up new skills
and knowledge unbelievably fast, growing in ability as if you were a once-in-a-generation
prodigy in every field you enter. You can discover and invent objective and subjective
advancements beyond what any normal expert could accomplish, and apply them to such great
effect that you seem to be decades if not centuries ahead of your time. Mind you, this grants no
skill or knowledge on its own-merely the latent talent of your natural mind, body and spirit with
one exception-you may have started on a fitness, logic game and self-defense regime of your
own devising that’s pushed you physically and intellectually, and kept you both in shape and
sharp of mind.
For 200 CP, you are “merely” skilled, resourceful and talented enough to stand as a valued
teammate among the likes of the Justice League or Legion of Doom side by side with beings
that can destroy a planet with a punch or run faster than light. Like Helena Bertinelli, also known
as the Huntress, you could have a repertoire wide enough to confidently teach school, conduct
espionage and fly vehicles while being skilled enough in hand to hand combat to stand and
trade with Batfamily members after a childhood spent training at the family estate. Like Oliver
Queen, if someone dumped you on a desert island you could survive for years despite a
relatively louche lifestyle beforehand. By focusing on a specific skill, you could train something
like archery into a talent capable of taking out multiple combatants with a single arrow-or
become a world champion in boxing like Wildcat.
"
292,,200,Masterful Acting,Naruto,Lore,"You have to hand it to Obito: for decades, he masterfully hid his identity and truly became Madara to the point where even those who knew him best could not recognise him. Like him, you too are a performer of masterful skill and talent, able to subdue your original personality and truly become another person where even the closest of friends of the one of you are copying could not find a single flaw in your disguise. From tone of voice to dress to conscious and unconscious acts, you perform as if second nature with there being nothing ever giving you away for even a second. Except maybe your face, but that’s what masks are for."
293,,200,Specialist,Naruto,Lore,"Every ninja no matter what, specialises in at least one area. Some specialise in ninjutsu, some specialise in genjutsu, and some in fuinjutsu. Specialists possess far greater power and skill than those not specialised in their chosen area.

For each purchase of this perk, you can become exceptionally good at learning your chosen specialization. For example, one who picks fuinjutsu would have the potential to equal the greatest of the Uzumaki Clan with the proper training, while those who pick genjutsu could eventually rival Itachi Uchiha himself even with his Sharingan. This purchase bestows all the relevant knowledge and information needed and allows for a beginner to learn everything related to your chosen specialty in a fraction of the time it would normally take. The narrower the focus of your specialization, the faster you learn. This perk can be purchased multiple times, and you can mix specialities for free, such as making a Nin-Taijutsu specialization, but you have to purchase the specialities you want to mix and fuse in order to do so. Barring medical ninjutsu, you can purchase any specialty.

For specialties that have multiple different styles, like taijutsu and kenjutsu, you can choose what style you want, such as kenjutsu in either the iai-focused samurai style or Killer B’s multi-bladed style, or focusing on the Strong Fist or the Gentle Fist for taijutsu. For those who want to purchase multiple styles, they get a discount, but only if they are purchasing different styles for the same specialty..

One free purchase.

294,,200,Memories of Anotherself,Black★Rock Shooter,Lore,"You’re not them, you just... look like them, but perhaps that is enough, no? The closer you look to someone else, the more you’re able to draw upon their memories and personalities to help complete the disguise that you’re going for or otherwise help you pick up the pieces if you’re not so sure of what you are anymore. Due to picking up the memories of this person it'll also allow you to utilize their skills more effectively, even supernatural ones if this transformation you’re in allows for that sort of thing.

As a bonus, you’re able to fool items that only allow one person to use them so long as you look like them in the first place. If you look like Ainz from Overlord, you can use the guild staff without any problems and so on."
295,,200,Learning of Airmed,Irish Mythology,Lore,"It came to pass that when Miach, the greatest healer to ever live, died, murdered by his jealous father, that all the medicinal herbs of the world grew from his grave and his sister Airmed did gather and order them, but their father Diancecht did scatter them, and so men were forced to learn them by trial and error. You, however, know all the properties and uses of every herb in the world, whether magical, medicinal or toxic. This knowledge updates in future Jumps."
296,,200,Beneath The Throne,Dies Irae,Lore,"You gained a brief peek into the Throne itself and while you gained no power or nature from it, you became aware of a wealth of information that only one other man is normally privy to you. You are innately aware of the true nature of existence, of the identity and nature of the creator or ruler of all existence and of a great deal of other information about the universe that you find yourself in, its metaphysics and its structure. Much of this knowledge is lost, hidden or protected but in this world and even in future worlds, you will always possess this knowledge on existence and it’s ruler, even if it might be desired otherwise of you. This knowledge will never harm you to possess nor will anyone immediately know that you possess it."
297,,200,The Greatest of Challengers,Dies Irae,Lore,"How can one hope to reach the greatest heights of power without some motivation? A rival is a perfect source of such motivation, something far truer for you and any rival you have than for others. Whenever you are part of a rivalry between yourself and another being, that rivalry will steadily increase the rate at which you learn and grow so long as the both of you continue to strive to compete against each other. So long as you continue to desire to have them as your rival and treat them as such, they will benefit from this steady increase to their growth rate as well, providing you with a challenger who will constantly be able to push you to grow even better than you were."
298,,200,Real Memories,Dies Irae,Lore,"Through the blood that runs in your veins, you have a connection to your forefathers. The genetic memory of all those who preceded you biologically is still present within you, in a way. Over time, you slowly absorb the memories and knowledge of your direct ancestors, starting from the most recent and going back as the years go by. Some of this knowledge will be useful, some outdated and some plain scary to know at all. You’re able to force this genetic memory to focus on specific ancestors with time but it can be actually quite tiresome to do. "
299,,200,Self-Made Man,The God of High School Jump,Lore,"Training in the martial arts on your own is rarely a good idea. Who knows what fatal mistakes you could memorise into your fighting style or what ways you could hurt yourself learning a new technique? You manage to buck this trend to an extent though. Even despite lacking a teacher or teaching materials, you seem to fall into the correct procedures for learning the martial arts on your own. You’ll instinctually correct your movements to be more in line with the style you are trying to learn and you’ll get a warning feeling whenever you’re about to try something that will definitely hurt you. It’s not as good as having a real master teach you personally but you’ll actually manage better on your own then with some ordinary teacher in the martial arts with you."
300,,200,The Crusaders ,Final Fantasy X,Lore,"Well even if you’re completely new to this world, it’s good to at least have a foothold somewhere right – some place that you can consider as a safe haven is better than nothing. Thankfully, you’ll find that the Crusaders seem to be somewhat sympathetic to your plight.

In addition to making you a better fighter against fiends and massive beasts alike, you’ll find that the Crusaders also have ample supplies, being aligned with the Church of Yevon. There’s word that they’re planning something big against Sin though...though you’re a bit too new to be involved straight away. In future worlds you go, you’ll find that your Crusader training can help you adapt to  monster attacks better and respond to them quicker."
301,,200,Cloistered Souls,Final Fantasy X,Lore,"Years spent sheltered inside Guadosalam has given you plenty of time to look inwards and develop yourself, rather than be distracted by the outside world. The outside world has nothing to offer you...but there are secrets within yourself just waiting to be discovered. As you meditate, you’ll find that you can learn and develop skills at a much quicker rate than normal – the deeper your trance, the more effective this becomes.
 
But be careful of tunnel vision...after all, a person can only go so far alone. You may find yourself going in circles if you obsess too much...and you’ll only end up limiting yourself. Maybe that’s what getting some exposure to the outside world would be good for."
302,,200,Moon Scepter,Elantris,Lore,"Kept by the curators of the Rose Empire, the Moon Scepter would appear to be an exquisite, if mundane, light blue rod covered in intricate carvings. However, this art piece hides a powerful secret; the carvings that adorn its surface contain translations between the different magical languages used on Sel. An Elantrian who studied the Moon Sceptor could access the Dor in Fjordell using Dahkor symbols, or take their magic to MaiPon using Forgery markings instead. This artifact alone doesn’t grant the ability to use Investiture, but it is a key component in adapting different types of Investiture to work with each other. See the Notes section for additional details."
303,,200,Fervent Focus        ,Elantris,Lore,"With the dangers of Elantris and the torment of the Shaod, Prince Raoden would have been forgiven for ignoring the secrets of AonDor and focusing on his survival. Thankfully for everyone, he chose to attack his studies with the same ferocity that fueled his altruism. Now you share his dedication and drive. Whether you’re studying Aons or practicing your Forging, you have the focus and determination to plow through the countless hours necessary to truly master a craft. In return for your commitment, you’ll see a steady benefit in your studies. As long as you dedicate yourself fully to the task, you will learn new knowledge and skills twice as fast as you normally would."
304,,200,Pioneer,The Games We Play,Lore,"You’re not just a scientist, you’re a true innovator, a pioneer! You just don’t know the
meaning ‘limits’. No matter how much a science advances, how many discoveries or
inventions are made, there is always the next horizon, and you never fail to know how
to start chasing it.
You have an instinct for advancing any fields you’re interested in pursuing. Any
failures are only new avenues to explore, and if all else fails, one branch of study
eventually leads into another. You have an unlimited imagination and innovation,
being able to tackle problems and questions in ways most people can’t even imagine,
let alone attempt.
No matter what you start on, you find yourself making new and varied advances in if
on a regular basis, comprehending more and more as you go."
305,,200,A Handy Book        ,RWBY,Lore,"Found this on a Farm? This little book can give you details about all sorts of Monsters you may meet on your Journey. For every new beats you encounter, a page is added and should you find yourself in... odd circumstances I advise you to take a look at the newest page. You might be under the influence of a newly discovered type of Willpower draining Grimm without knowing. The Book will know however and detail you exactly what the beasts abilities are."
306,,200,The Defenders of the World         ,RWBY,Lore,"Let’s be honest... you can’t do this job forever. Sooner or later you will have to retire. It is good then that there are many young aspiring heroes around to fill your place once you won’t do it anymore. If you like you can have a direct part in their training. It will become easy for you to train any young heroes, passing on your (learnable) skills and knowledge to the next generation of Defenders. In time, even a certain Jaune Arc could go from a hopeless case to a capable fighter."
307,,200,Dyne,Final Fantasy IX,Lore,"Though it seems to be excerpts from a book elsewhere, this manual guide is titled “Considerations of the Perfect Genome”. There’s a long list of techniques, skills, and traits in here – perhaps all considerations made by the first creator of the Genomes, and from the various descriptions it appears this guide illustrates the potential paths a “Perfect Genome” could have followed.

There are a couple useful tips and tricks that you can draw out of this, though a lot of the pages have been crossed out or scribbled over. You’ll learn a set of Dyne skills and the equivalent base skill, namely “Free Energy”, “Tidal Flame” and “Scoop Art”, though the rest you’ll have to innovate yourself, or learn from perhaps another Genome in the world."
308,,200,Big Fucking Heavy Book,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Lore,"This book’s most basic function is Dimension/World hopping. While you can’t hop to other jumps until you spark, demi-planes, connected worlds, etc. are all pretty easy to learn to poke your head in. Just don’t get it bitten off. Actually, do, so that I don't have to see your fugly ass face."
309,,200,Not That A Yankee Would Understand Me,Solo Leveling,Lore,"Communication is a key factor for Hunters inside a dungeon. Sadly, the language barrier usually makes assembling international teams a difficult task at best. Even for non-humans that can speak their own tongues, communication between different species can possess a problem.

Unlike most beings, you don’t seem to have that problem. Be it due to your own magic, such as the High Orc Shaman Kargargan, or due to speaking the ancient language that some Monarchs and Rulers use, you are capable of understanding and being understood by every sentient being. Being able to speak to one another may be useful to solve so me conflicts, but different interests would still mean that preventing blood from flowing will not always be possible."
310,,200,I Love Your Style: Sincere Admirer,Avesta of Black and White,Lore,"Appreciation for an opponent’s power and talent, regardless of their side, is a common trait among the warriors of the Evil side. And what better way to show your respect for an enemy’s style than through pure imitation? You have a natural talent for analyzing and dissecting the techniques of your enemies after crossing blades just for a few minutes, before being able to start to reproduce them on your own. It may not be a perfect reproduction, but when it comes just to pure combat styles, and disregarding actual supernatural abilities, you are able to take them apart and assimilate them into your own style as easy as you walk."
311,,200,A Well Preserved Sword: Body of the Kings,Avesta of Black and White,Lore,"For someone as busy as you, it may seem impossible to maintain your martial skill when you are left behind, buried under the paperwork. Yet, you find that your abilities refuse to degrade over time, and whenever you grab a weapon, the experience accumulated over years rushes into you as if you were still in the midst of a campaign. Regardless of how long it has been since you trained or saw real combat, your battle prowess and skills never seem to rust."
312,,200,Growth Curve,Fate/Grand Order,Lore,"Not everyone learns the same way. An oft repeated childhood saying has rather more relevance in this world and for you especially on buying this option. The way and speed you learn has been altered to one of three modes of which you may pick only one. Linear Mode will allow you to always learn at a constant rate. You will learn as fast as at the start as you do during the middle and ending stages of your learning, even if the process would normally slow down greatly in one of these phases. S Mode learning reduces your learning rate during the beginning and ending stages of training but magnifies it greatly during the middle portion of your growth. Reverse S Mode alters this by having you grow much faster during the beginning and later stages of growth, while slowing down significantly during the middle stages. This alteration cannot be changed once picked."
313,,200,Abnormality Pages,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Lore,"The Library used to be the main facility of L Corp so the agents, clerks, and sephirot became librarians, but what happened to the abnormalities? Well, they became the books, and not just any books or even the ones used as equipment by librarians, Abnormalities give pages capable of changing the user’s abilities in various ways, reflecting those of the abnormality with its weaknesses and strengths. There are two kinds of them, breakdown(red) and awakening(green), with different abnormalities giving different pages. Breakdown pages are usually stronger but come with a downside like an ability that requires getting hit to use or doubling all bleeding caused by you and your enemies, while awakening pages are completely positive effects but usually aren’t as powerful as breakdown pages. Each purchase gets you a single floor’s set of abnormalities, and you can freely use up to 5 at a time, 2 tier 1 pages, 2 tier 2 pages, and a single tier 3 page, you can freely mix pages from different floors if you have multiple available.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
314,,200,Book Smarts,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Lore,"The most distinctive thing about the Library is how when someone dies in there they are turned into a book which can then be used by the librarians to replicate the skills and equipment of whoever got booked. Now you can do so too, regardless of if you’re in the Library or not. These capabilities extend beyond just the books made by someone killed in the Library or by you if you have Beaten into a Biography, you can use the power of any book regardless of what it is about or who wrote it, with different subjects and levels of expertise from the writer changing the effect and power of the book."
315,,200,Artificial Existence,Bibliomania,Lore,"Like I mentioned in the beginning of this jump, humans aren’t the only beings in this world. You are still human but are a result of experiments that create some of the entities that may still exist in this world. Effectively you are modified yet artificial which puts your base physical and mental capabilities to the peak of your species. But that's just your base, since you can now train and improve yourself to be 2 times better than you should be possible allowing you to go from post human to superhuman. Most important about this is that any enhancements you gain also benefit, allowing you to train them to be twice as powerful as what should be possible."
316,,200,Mind of Illustration,Bibliomania,Lore,"You remind is special, being that your mind is a fantastical advanced mental book keeping a detailed archive of all you have experienced and learned with all that information being a single thought away, hell you remember with such clarity now you could vividly describe the complete experience of your birth and every word, sentence and intent you have ever heard. Your mind simply doesn’t forget and more importantly you have full control over it. Nothing can read your mind without your permission as if your mind itself is in a different language, coded, and sealed away from view all at the same time, it would take very powerful psychics to even notice your mind with how subtle it is as well and even then you have a passive defense of your mind seeming normal. Due to the way your mind works now you have an absurd reading and comprehension level allowing you to read 20 times faster than before casually and learn and comprehend from written word as if you have studied and practiced whatever it is you are reading, though keep in mind that aside from Mental knowledge and skills your physical skills can develop from this but will seem un trained or rusty until put into practice at which point it would only take a few moment to fully practice the skills. You think clearly and can focus on 5 things at once from now on with the ease of focusing on 1."
317,,200,Skilled Development,Bibliomania,Lore,"You are now very talented being that you now improve physically and mentally twice as fast as before but for skills you now improve 5 times faster than before. Now you might be wondering why not just take Body conTrol for that growth instead of this perk. 1st, your skills will now naturally lean towards optimizing and improving via repetition, meaning you will improve skills just by using them as if actively training them. 2nd you now have the peak natural talent for any skill you attempt, you won’t be good off the bat but you will effectively have a higher base learning rate for any form of skill. 3rd your skills no longer degrade meaning that your skills will be just as good as when you stopped practicing no matter how long it's been. 4th and last if you are starting training a new skill and already have similar skills you will find your pre-existing skills experience will enhance your new skills growth rate, the closer a skill is the faster the growth and multiple stack, though only to the same level of skill. Almost identical skills will see growth almost doubling while something that's only tangentially related(such as Piano and Guitar both being music skills with no direct overlap) will improve growth only by 1% minimum."
318,,200,Guide Book,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Lore,"This book contains maps of another world! This tome offers readers details about the geography, politics, and culture of each world they visit. The book changes to suit the current setting on arrival, and contains plenty of space to take personal notes. Should you find yourself in an alternate timeline or mirrored version of a familiar world, the book will detail the differences between the prime setting and any divergent timelines. Wherever you wander, you’ll always be informed!"
319,,200,First Class Saber Teaching Licence,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Lore,"Sabers don’t spring up from nowhere. Sometimes. They mostly do but the best Sabers are the ones you raise yourself! Legally, one can only raise a proper Saber if you have the right qualifications. You passed every licensing test with flying colours and now any Saber would be lucky to have you as a professor. You’re not just brilliant at teaching other Sabers to be better Sabers in the ways you do know, such as the skills and abilities you purchase here, you’re even great at helping them develop the Saber-like qualities you don’t even have. A knightly teacher could cheer and encourage their magical student so well they make leaps and bounds of progress each night! Those not blessed with the Saber class, or a similar focus in life, can still learn Saber-like things from you at an accelerated rate. They’ll just have to accept that they’ll never be quite good enough for you."
320,,200,Goddess Scriptures,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Lore,"This is definitely how archaeology works. You’ve uncovered a hidden cache of records, each one billions of years old. Somehow, they still hold information on the ancient history of your universe. Each log reveals the secrets of how things came to be, what came before and details on the true creators/rulers of existence. Even should there be no logical way for anyone to have recorded or remembered this information, you’ll be able to learn it through these logs, along with much secret information on how the universe works metaphysically. Whenever you travel to a new universe, the scripture box will reveal a new set of logs with adjusted and appropriate information."
321,,200,Kinetic Learner,Honkai Impact 3rd,Lore,"You learn faster physically and through experiencing stuff than from classroom environments. This does not mean that you learn slower from classroom environments than you did before – it simply means that you’re more of a kinesthetic learner than before, and you learn things about ten times faster when you learn it kinesthetically. And, when it comes to combat, you can learn it ten times faster kinesthetically than you can learn normal things kinesthetically, meaning that you can learn combat one hundred times faster than normal."
322,,200,Book Drop,Library of Ruina V1.0,Lore,"Librarians have a need for books, and this power allows you to gather them from other avenues of life. Upon besting an opponent either through combat or through some kind of competition, a book based on the opponent may drop. The contents of the book widely vary based on the manner of their defeat. Defeating a champion through chess may describe well known strategies of chess and their perspective on it. Whereas killing a man will often provide a biography as well as the person’s own musings on their favoured subjects. The odds of a book dropping depends primarily on the emotions of your opponent at the time of defeat. At the height of despair moments before death could net you several books giving a full biography of the person, while losing a casual game of darts will need plenty of luck to even give you a page."
323,,200,Book of Ruina,Library of Ruina V1.0,Lore,"It’s not the one perfect book being sought after, but it should prove useful for those who wish to log their adventures. A grand and thick book that records data of realms, regions, animals, monsters and significant figures that you and your companions encounter. The book is impossibly durable, repairing itself and regrowing pages in seconds. All the information in the book can be sorted, filtered and otherwise tailored to you (and any readers you may designate). Finally, it allows you to read any book you own as if you were holding it there instead. Access your library on the go!"
324,,200,Abnormality Pages,Library of Ruina V1.0,Lore,"These sheets of paper are like strange contracts that enable the use of powers and abilities from one person to the other, provided certain criteria are met. For example, gaining the ferocity and regeneration of a werewolf, but while the recipient is in combat, currently in a heightened emotional state (typically anger and frustration) and can actually see a moon. How strict the conditions are depend on the amount of power and traits being provided. Some of the strongest effects can go as far as channelling the being themselves, granting their entire moveset, but only capable of doing so in highly intensive or long lasting battles."
325,,200,Scroll Collection,Final Fantasy VI,Lore,"Magic scrolls exist in this world but are rarely seen in this era. Most consider them merely collectables of the past. But the set granted to you, contained in a handy scroll case, has their magic well intact and ready to be unleashed. The case contained two scrolls of fire, water, and lighting, each capable of unleashing a blast of elemental magic on an entire group of enemies when activated. It also contains three that grant the user invisibility and three more than create several illusionary images of the user. Both operate for a short time before the magic fades. The case will automatically refill any used scrolls every third day."
326,,200,Monster Knowledge,Final Fantasy VI,Lore,"The Magi have been around for quite a while. They survived the War and the thousands years after despite every hardship. What has helped them the most is their studious nature and curiosity. You’ve taken that spirit to heart and dove into the literature of sages past. And whether due to sheer passion or simple age, you’ve learned all there is to know about the monsters of this world. You understand their weaknesses, their strengths, and just which spells hurt them the most. Even better, any monsters you choose to study in other worlds will reveal their secrets to you much more quickly."
327,,200,Divine Mind,God Of War (2018),Lore,"With this perk your mind is something truly divine, in comparison to mortals that is. Not only is your intellect greatly boosted but your ability to develop your skills is as well. If you put enough focus into one skill, let’s say for a decade, then you would be able to become skilled enough to be known even by the gods. Though keep in mind that this skill alone would not make you the best among the gods, though it could if you spent a century practicing this one skill. Keep in mind that this perk does synergize with other perks that boost skill development."
328,,200,Book of Dreams,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Lore,"Some dreams can have omens of the future. Some are just meaningless gibberish. This book deals with the former, although sometimes it might seem that all dreams are prophetic. It's quite a thick tome, having almost a thousand pages and likely more hidden away through magic. Thankfully it has an index to navigate it efficiently. What it can be used for is deciphering dreams, which almost always give clues of a future event, usually the immediate kind that'll arrive within a month. Even in future worlds this'll work as intended, letting you diagnose a person's immediate future even if that world doesn't actually have any kind of prophecy or fate. Do be careful, people aren't very pleased when their future is grim."
329,,200,The Time Has Come,DxD Universe,Lore,"You wait long enough, but at least waiting has paid off, because the longer it takes to get revenge against someone else the faster you grow, with this maybe you could reach the level you need, this doesn't work in any revenge however, it must be something that really makes you mad, the death of a loved one for example."
330,,200,Language Lessons ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Lore,"It would be unfortunate if you showed up unable to speak the local language or travelled to another country here that you weren’t too familiar with. Now you can read, write, speak and understand any normal language, which can either be like learning a language like everyone else, showing up as subtitles only you can see, or make it seem as if everything is in your own native language. Basically, it works however you think would work best for you. You can pay 100CP to keep this in future jumps, and for 200CP you can communicate in anyone’s native language even if they’re from a different time or planet, so feel free to converse in Sumerian, Ancient Greek, Klingon and whatever else you encounter. You can use, lack, perceive or not hear the correct accent for the language, at your preference, and you’ll be aware of literal translations of names as well as how they should be said. Doesn’t automatically solve things like codes with just this though, at most you’ll be aware of that trick when people say something in a language they think you don’t know and claim they were saying something other than what they actually said."
331,,200,Intuitive Mimicry of Skill,Final Fantasy V,Lore,"There’s a saying that imitation is the highest form of flattery, but your imitation begins to take on a whole new level. If you are able to watch someone for a time with a higher level of skill than yourself (or if you can temporarily gain additional skill), then you can determine exactly what makes them more skilled, and incorporate it into what you’re doing. The more advanced they are over your current skill, the longer it takes you, but as long as you can replicate what your target does, nothing is out of your reach."
332,,200,LITERACY,CthulhuTech,Lore,"You are well read. You can speak a couple foreign languages, and can of course read and write them too. You also know how to read four dead languages, usually ones used in ancient magical writings like Akkadian, Aklo, Aramaic, Coptic, Latin, Old Norse, Pnakotic, R'leyhan, Sanskrit, or Tsath-yo. This also make learning new languages easier."
333,,200,PROFESSIONAL,CthulhuTech,Lore,"You have a professional skill. You could be a doctor or lawyer or accountant. You could be a mechanic or craftsman.

Now of course, the Library itself usually covers this issue for you by providing the experience of whatever poor fool got invited while wielding that weapon, but now that proficiency extends to any armaments you pick up. Even if you’ve never seen a violin case full of mechanical phalanges before, you can draw upon the maker’s vision of how to use it to manage a passable job, even better if it had prior wielders."
335,,200,Dance Fight 69,HighSchool DxD,Lore,"The ones that were forged in war are just built differently. Not only are you a descendant of a hero, but a hero in your own right.

Rituals of all kind. This, again, means different things in different worlds, but the least of the
powers you have would be an ability to control your own blood’s flow absolutely, up to and
including an immunity to all magic or abilities that specifically targets blood.
Beyond this, you have a ludicrously high affinity towards rituals towards all kind, such as
adoption rituals, inheritance tracing rituals, or rituals that boost your physical or magical abilities
through runecraft or sacrifice of creatures. Indeed, you can outright acquire magical abilities like
an incredible physical strength through Re’em blood, magical resistance through sacrificing a
Dragon, so on and so forth."
350,,200,Monster Book of Monsters,Wizarding World,Lore,"Written by one Edwardus Lima, the Monster Book of Monsters is a rather interesting tome. While being a very informative guide on creatures that can be found in the world, the thing is named Monster for a reason. The book is in fact a living thing that will bite and gnaw at anything it can get its jaws around. Fortunately for you, the book likes you and will let you hold and read it as much as you desire. The same can’t be said for everyone else though.

Moving on to its benefits, the book already contains a veritable treasure trove of knowledge of every creature that can be found in this world. It details their strengths, weaknesses, habits, temperaments, and so much more. Basically, if it can be found in a high-class encyclopedia or bestiary, this book will have it. Of course, it also has a special feature just for you. In every new world you find yourself in, this tome shall update itself, writing down new pages of information for every manner of beast to be found within such worlds."
351,,200,A Set of School Books,Wizarding World,Lore,"School can be a difficult time for many people, even for those you’d believe to excel in such things. But what students often forget is that they are not the only ones suffering and that they are not alone. Help will always be given if they but ask. And if they cannot find help in the present, then they can always find help in the past, from the students and teachers who came before.

At first glance, these books appear to be nothing more than ordinary schoolbooks with some wear and tear due to use and age. But open them up, and you will see writings on almost every page. Examine these writings and you will see that they have information quite relevant to the book at hand. This information is generally better than what you would normally find on the book but it’ll be quite useful regardless of the form it takes. You receive a new set of these books every time you start a new class, regardless of the subject."

Together, these two magical relics work in tandem to ensure that names of each and every person with a scrap of personal magical talent are written down so that they may be admitted into the school. Not once has it failed in this task. Not once has a Squib or other non-magical person ever been admitted into Hogwarts.

Bound in black dragon-hide and dipped in silver ink, your copy of these two items are meant to serve the same purpose. Without fail, the names of every person with magical potential in the world shall be inscribed within the book. With this, you will be able to create the foundation of something like the eleven Great Wizarding Schools. With this, wizards and witches shall be made known to you. Whatever shall you do with such a thing?"
353,,200,Safe & Sound,Wizarding World,Lore,"If you were to compare magic to any natural element, it would perhaps be most similar to fire. Like fire, magic has changed people’s lives and like fire, magic can run rampant and take away life as easily as it saves it. After all, there are no shortage of witches and wizards who have met their ends in magical experiments. Fortunately for you, you are far from the foolish sort.

You now have considerable experience when it comes to all manners of research and
experimentation which means that you know the processes involved in such things and you know what safety measures are needed to ensure that everyone will come out of it unharmed, mostly.

Not that you’ll need that last one when you consider that, unless acted upon by an outside influence, your experiments will never have any risk of catastrophic failure. It doesn’t even need to be your experiment. So long as you’re somewhat involved in the process, you don’t have to worry too much about catastrophes and disasters."
354,,200,Heir of Slytherin,Wizarding World,Lore,"Salazar Slytherin was one of the four founders of Hogwarts, and he possessed a peculiar talent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth and so, he could talk to snakes, communicating with them through Parseltongue, the language of serpents. Perhaps you are a descendant of his if this ability of yours is any indication. Others will certainly believe so should you deign to make such information public. They might even name you as his heir.

As a Parselmouth, you will be able to converse with any serpentine creature, from the simple and common garden snakes to even the great and mighty basilisks. But more than that, your status as a Parselmouth ensures the loyalty of mundane serpents of any kind and the respect of all other serpentine creatures, enough that they would be willing to follow your commands unless you prove yourself unworthy. And with Parseltongue, you know how to enchant or create objects such that they will only respond to those who can speak the tongue."

This perk makes you skilled in whatever skills are desired in a club of your choice. The Engineering club would make you skilled at making wacky inventions, while picking the Hot Spring Development club would make you better at determining the locations where underground hot springs might be found along with how to excavate them. If none of the canon clubs catch your eye, feel free to make up your own. Just don’t get too wild though, you’re still just students after all."
357,,200,Quick Study,Blue Archive,Lore,"It might be easy to forget due to the amount of shenanigans that happen in Kivotos, but you are still a student, with all the tests that implies.

Enchanted with the knowledge of countless witches before you, this hat is a veritable second brain, capable of helping the wearer come to innovative conclusions and solve problems easier than they could alone. Please be advised that the witch’s hat cannot command you, and in fact, cannot speak. If you hear the hat speaking to you, please remove the hat and seek assistance from the nearest Conjuror or other mind-arts practitioner."
360,,200,Lightning in a Bottle,Wizard 101,Lore,"A literal spark of inspiration, trapped in a complex assembly that surrounds a glass bottle that serves as its prison. If you need an extra kick of inspiration to get you past a roadblock in your studies, you can put on the attached breathing mask, release the valve on the bottle, and breathe in pure creativity for a small bit. The Lightning has enough juice for five light hits, a couple modest hits, or one long draw a month. Once depleted, the Lightning grows noticeably dim and listless until it recovers."
361,,200,Eureka!,Wizard 101,Lore,"Storm Magic is often advanced in fits and starts, as bolts of inspiration strike the mind. Like all storm mages, if you are truly out of ideas, you are almost guaranteed to have a moment of inspiration, such as why your creations fail, or your new spell keeps fizzling."
362,,200,Expert,The Owl House,Lore,"Magic users at this skill level have pushed the boundaries of their specialties, distinguishing themselves and their Covens.

Just as a Lord requires subjects, so too can you take on students to help push your agenda of acquiring knowledge. You are capable of teaching anyone magic, even if they are as mundane as dirt itself. So long as you teach it like anyone is capable, they will learn and eventually pass along your knowledge long after you have left the world."
364,,200,Copy of the Book of Spells,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Lore,"If you got yourself a magic wand, you may want this. It’s a book of spells known in the universe. Mind you, the book is thoroughly disorganized, and sometimes nigh-illegible, but it comes with a magic entity (not Glossaryk, unless it is) to help you learn how to learn magic. You’ll need this to learn how to do things like stop time, or cast The Spell with No Name – but those won’t come without excess amounts of practice, or power levels comparable to Queen Eclipsa. Remember to write down any new spells you develop or learn; this version doesn’t have an auto-transcribe feature."
365,,200,Monster Hunter Trainee,Wizards of Waverly Place,Lore,"Monster Hunters are people who protects the Wizards and non-Wizards from unregistered monsters.

371,,200,The Library of Cagliostro ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Lore,"Keen eyed readers may note that the author of this obscure collection of tomes is the very same writer of a book used to invoke the power of Dormammu. While spells from across the ages and invaluable research for refining the mystic arts abounds within, one piece of knowledge in particular poses terrifying potential. That spell describes the art of summoning mystical creatures of varying power-and then devouring them to increase the magician’s strengths. Creatures ranging from tiny beings far below a mortal sorcerer’s power, to terrifying dragons straight out of legend and even eldritch horrors from beyond reality’s veil. Devouring such beings causes them to fuse with the user’s very soul, allowing them to invoke the entities’ forms from parts of their body as well as increase their magical power. The library does NOT warn you of the demonic amalgam you will surely become if you spend centuries inhaling such entities. Only promises the power to thwart even an Absolute Point in time after perhaps centuries of consumption, a promise it would be unwise to trust at face value."
372,,200,Chakra Books,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Lore,"It can be difficult for those who are unaware of the world around them to grasp that they know nothing. It can also be difficult to show them just how small their worldview has been all this time, or help them. But the first step to learning is awareness. This is a substantial supply of books regarding the body, such as a map of the nervous system, MRIs, and more importantly, chakra points and how to open them. These maps for the body will help bring awareness to would-be students, and how to show them the wonders of the world or themselves. For an additional undiscounted 100CP, you may also gain a substantial collection of spellbooks that will assist in helping you learn the formation of spells, the art of drawing energies to power them, and the basics in casting them. Just be aware that the warning labels come AFTER the spells."
373,,200,Notes of the Vishanti ,Marvel Primal,Lore,"Agamotto would one day, with two friends, pen the ultimate tome of white magic. These scrolls are not that, but they do contain surprising insight, perspective and trivia that would transform any caster’s understanding of the art, and a decent collection of spells and rites. More, in each new world it updates with information on the local magic systems."
374,,200,Sorcerer(200),She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Lore,"Went to find spiritual enlightenment, did we? A trip to Kamar-Taj has introduced you to supernatural secrets, granting you powers and capabilities that seem pulled from a fantasy novel. For 200cp, your exposure to the mystic arts was rather brief. Whether you left willingly or were expelled like Donny Blaze, a few weeks of training has left you with the skills of a novice sorcerer. "
375,,200,Sorcerer(400),She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Lore,"Went to find spiritual enlightenment, did we? A trip to Kamar-Taj has introduced you to supernatural secrets, granting you powers and capabilities that seem pulled from a fantasy novel.

377,,200,A Weird Piece Of Wood ,Helltaker,Lore,"What’s this? A piece of wood? Anyway, it has a weird inscription written on it. Could it mean anything? If you’re into the whole ‘benevolent god who loves to test their chosen ones’ shtick, you can place this under one of the blocks in your puzzle, demarcated by a rune of your choice written on it. You can buy two more but undiscounted now. Post-jump, it has one third of one of the current setting’s most powerful rituals written in it. My rule of thumb for ‘how powerful should the ritual be’ is: as powerful as a perk worth 400 cp. If the setting is much more powerful than the perks on the jump doc then adjust accordingly. If the setting is non-magical then the inscription has a third of some kind of vital information. Do note: whatever benefits the ritual gives you fade away every jump.

378,,200,I Made Some Sparks ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore,"Sometimes it can be difficult to control your abilities. You however seem to have instinctual control over your powers. This doesn’t mean that you will have immediate mastery over them, but you will never have to be concerned about losing control. This will also accelerate the speed at which you gain mastery over them and the speed you increase your control."
379,,200,Mystic Study,Marvel Cosmic,Lore,"There are many paths to power and the path of the mystic arts is an alluring one. It is also very dangerous to both its practitioners and victims. You have begun down a path trod by some of the most powerful entities in the cosmos. You are not yet the match of those such as Dr. Strange but you know dozens of spells, can identify the most famous mystics, and are familiar with dozens of grimoires and artifacts. You instinctively know where to find new sources of mystic knowledge and power and learn new magical skills much faster than others."
380,,200,Light Chakra ,Avatar: Beginnings,Lore,"The Light Chakra at the brow is the seat of insight, and inhibited by illusion. Your insight has pierced the greatest and most essential illusion of all: that of separation. Though humans and spirits come from different worlds, they are much alike. Though the elements appear in conflict, they are part of a greater whole. Perhaps this insight can help with your bending abilities, but your piercing intellect makes most forms of disguise and deception useless against you."

Alright, so you’ve got your foot in the door and you’ve got some kinda superpowers. But maybe you dunno how they work or the super smart alien who gave it to you doesn’t wanna explain it. Good news is you’re fast at figuring out what your powers can do just by testing them out a little bit. You’re quick at figuring stuff out like strengths, weaknesses, how to look cool using your powers...if you had enough time, you could get a good grip on it in time for lunch! Plus, when you’re in a real fight or trouble, you’re real quick at making snap decisions with these new powers and finding new tricks with them. Cool, huh?"

You’re really good at finding nerd stuff like information or clues almost instantly, as long as you have some kind of Internet or big library to consult. It only takes you a few minutes to find info on where bad guys came from, who gave what to who, where they’re hiding out...even stuff that should really only be on cop computers.

It’s like they’re expecting everyone to be... well, you, actually. Turns out you do know all the proper mannerisms and etiquettes. Yes, all of them. You seem to have been provided a very strange form of intellectus now. Or maybe you’re a kind of Archive. Anyway, the point is that you have the ability to just know the right way to behave in any and all supernatural environments and interactions. You know the obscure phrases in languages dead for most of history that this specific demon lord likes, you know that the king of the Tylwyth Teg is a baseball fan, you know to turn away and run really fast if you see a certain mother-daughter pair at Disneyland... and so much more."

While it's mostly empty, the first page has a number of names on it, including pronunciation guides, and a description of exactly who the name belongs to. Write a name you know on one of the other pages, and it'll be stored the same way, and even update if they change it. Speaking the True Name of someone, exactly how they say it, creates a link so strong it's like you're touching them, perfect for working thaumaturgy on them or summoning them up. It's also good for getting their attention, hence the warning."
389,,200,"""Convenient Translation""",Dark Souls 3,Lore,"These lands are churning, converging at the base of Lothric, and they bring with them a wealth of knowledge considered lost, possibly even mythical by modern standards. This perk allows the buyer to quickly decipher and translate text, no matter how foreign, ancient or alien it may be, as long as the text itself covers a field of knowledge the reader has extensive knowledge In.

393,,200,Mindful ,MtG - Amonkhet,Lore,"Martial strength and unity will lead a crop through some of the trials, but not all. Kefnet’s trial cannot be won by force of arms alone. It must be won by intellect and adaptability. Fortunately, your mind is sharp as a razor and adaptable like few others are. You are a natural puzzlemaster, and your years of training have only made you better. Whether it’s cracking a code, memorizing a text, or solving a deadly riddle your mind is fluid and flexible, and shall always remain so."
394,,200,Curious Intruder,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"The Wilds are vast, unpredictable, but filled with all kinds of wonders and treats for those who can snatch their dinner from the jaws of the wolf. You’re one of them - trolls, witches, and wolves may see you as a delicious prey, you’ve learned quite a bit of what makes the shadows tick - what scents the wolves desire or the way that troll flesh withers under fire, and you can leverage your wit to not only make off with their treasures, but with some luck and pluck slay the beasts. Though, make no mistake - one wrong move or one cocksure step against something that much stronger than you and you’ll find that instead of being the hero of this story, your bones become a cautionary tale."
395,,200,Lore Master,MtG - Zendikar,Lore,"You are a library of knowledge passed down in oral tradition, much changed over the years as spoken word is wont to do, but preserved nonetheless. In your years you have accumulated a rather encyclopedic knowledge of the tales told in this land. While it is useful socially as an understanding of the culture you are speaking to, the years spent accumulating said knowledge have also led to you develop a flawless memory for the spoken word. In future jumps you will always find those willing to tell you the tales of the land, both to fulfill your curiosity, and occasionally draw forewarning of age-old problems."
396,,200,Falconer,MtG - Homelands,Lore,"There is always one amongst the tenders at the aviary in Onella who is known as the Falconer, and is responsible for tending to the birds and ensuring their safety and comfort. The position is a prestigious one, for to have the respect of the great mesa falcons is to have the respect of Serra herself. Additionally, the Falconers know the language of the birds, the knowledge taught from Falconer to Falconer throughout the history of the aviary.

Belonging to the same family as the Falconers, you may be either the current tender to hold the title, an apprentice, or perhaps a retired Falconer. Regardless of the specifics, you know how to take care of and approach just about any bird, from the common falcons to macaws and giant albatrosses. Being able to speak and understand their language is, of course, a great benefit to this as well. The wild birds see much, and are quite willing to talk."
397,,200,Imperfect Colors Are Better ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"Black as a color is, ironically enough, lesser than a dark blue when it comes to not being seen. A mishmash of colors is even better, especially if you’re in the woods - you want several shades of brown and green for the best result there. They all have their place, however, and now so do you. With this you may opt to learn the special techniques of your faction and whatever ninja may be affiliated with it… If there are any, at least. Ninja are rather looked down upon in the Imperial Army, trading the level of reliability that the Samurai hold for even more speed and power, while the Asari Uprising has none to its name. Well, none that we know of, or none that have managed to make a name for themselves as anything other than less than mooks. Something to do with artifacts or improvised weapons might be appropriate if you intend to be the first. Beyond that, feel free to undergo whatever training you want to acquire the skills appropriate for your faction. "
398,,200,Golden-Tailed Graduate,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"During the era of the Kami War, a kitsune with a golden tail was known far and wide to be one of the greatest swordmasters of that era. As such, when the reborn empire opened the academy, many of the teachers they hired were his own students, and the school was named after him. You are a graduate of that school, and as such are a competent samurai, advisor, and negotiator all, as required to properly serve your emperor. In addition to that, you may choose a topic of study to focus on - perhaps you entered the academy with the intention to become a Kami diplomat, and as such are top of your class in the arts of debating and conversing with the strange minded Kami. Your other skills will not suffer for it, but this is where your true speciality lies."
399,,200,Go for the Eyes!,MtG - Kamigawa,Lore,"No matter how tough a foe is, there has to be a weak point. Even the most powerful ogre has eyes that could be stabbed after all. In general, you have a knack for figuring out the best time and place to strike and your blows have become debilitating when they aren’t lethal. This feature can be turned off at will."
400,,200,Sophisticated Commands,Warbreaker,Lore,"Oh, you can command a rope to just snare or grab, but it’s more effective to say something like “become as my arms and grip what I would.” You know how to phrase Awakening commands for maximum versatility."
401,,200,Creative Combatant ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Lore,"So many warriors believe that their rigid, disciplined style of fighting makes them strong, when all their refusal to stray from tradition really does is make them inflexible and unable to adapt to change. Though you may not be the most skilled or most powerful of fighters, you do happen to have one advantage over the majority of combatants: You’re incredibly creative when you fight, able to improvise new ways to use your powers and attacks on the fly to adapt to whatever foe you may be facing. What’s more, you’re also surprisingly adept at using your surroundings to your advantage too, be it baiting your foes into environmental hazards or making full use of terrain and elevation."
402,,200,Sorcery Tomes,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Lore,"Before Nine created the magic formulas, she tried to teach the world sorcery. Sadly, sorcery still requires a level of affinity for magic, and that’s something a significant portion of the world is missing. Hence the magic formula. Anyways, this set of books was Nine’s first attempt, a collection of introductory tomes, as well as a few for dummies equivalents that she wrote herself. On top of that, these books can flat out grant magical capacity to a total of six people per year. Now, there’s nothing in here that’s particularly advanced, but you should be able to grant a fairly decent understanding of the basics."
403,,200,What’s This Doohickey?,Campione,Lore,"Ah, supernatural powers. They don’t come with an instruction manual, be it the magic of mortals, the Authorities of Gods or something else entirely, one needs to get their exact limits and improve themselves by trial and error. Well not anymore, this little blessing works to take care of that. Now, you gain an innate knowledge of how to use any new powers you acquire, as well as their limitations and advantages. Doesn’t sound like much until you get a power-up in the middle of a battle and you realize you don’t know how to use it. Embarrassing. "
404,,200,Records of a Matrix,Fate/Extra CCC,Lore,"Half the battle is knowledge. And how could you call yourself a Master without proper information gathering tools? You now own a touchpad, a laptop, or some other kind of electronic device that can be used to read information, that has a special program installed in it. This program lets you learn the matrixes of Servants, or even other beings such as powerful combat capable AI, and in future jumps anyone that has some measure of power beyond the average human. The way this works is that you can simply learn more about some specific target, such as a Servant’s legend, and the more you learn about them, the more filled out with details on their abilities and elaborations on their history and personality their entry in this tool becomes.

You don’t even need to learn such things directly, even just learning a Servant’s full legend from beginning to end would give you full information on their abilities, regardless of if the legend is unclear on details or twisted into something somewhat different but still recognizable. Learning from the subject themselves does yield somewhat more detailed results, but mostly in terms of learning about their personality and secrets, so maybe it wouldn’t be quite as usable in combat. In case you were thinking about it, no, information obtained from the tool itself won’t count for the purposes of the tool itself unveiling more information."
405,,200,Shinsengumi Way,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Lore,"The samurai code is in reality, a thing mostly of fiction. The many restrictions and honourable rules
that the noble warriors supposedly lived under were fabrications of a later age. Mostly. There were
indeed good men who bound themselves in vows and promises to show their morality, as well as
those who did so to restrain their own dark sides. But the sacrifices made through a warrior’s vow
can have it’s own benefits, the loss becoming new power for battle. 

You are able to take vows that restrict your own life, receiving increases to your overall combat
ability in exchange. The more restrictive the vow is to you personally, the more significant the
increase. Sacrificing a few hours of your time in prayer each week would be a minor boost in power
at best, whereas constant limitations such as never breaking your word or always fighting in an
honorable manner could improve your power by half or even double the normal level. Breaking a
restriction removes the benefit and applies a proportionate penalty to your power on top, as well as
a damaged mental state. These penalties will disappear in time and slowly removing a vow over a
few days will allow you to drop the restrictions without cost. A vow’s power is based on how it
affects you personally at the current moment, something strong for others but weak for you will give
weak benefits."
406,,200,Striking A Deal,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"The Geas is a magical contract made between two people of whom possess magic themselves, holding each person party to the Geas bound to the contract, else they face some terrible
punishment. You are well aware of how to cast such things, with the agreement of the other parties, without the need for anything but magical energy. The Geas must be made willingly and knowingly
by all parties, though they need not fully understand the implications of what they are agreeing to or
be aware of how you plan to take advantage of it. A Geas can even be laid on yourself, by yourself, to enhance your overall power at the cost of burdening you with various harsh restrictions. Breaking
a Geas inflicts a punishment decided at the time of the deal being struck, often a terrible injury, disease, binding or even death. You cannot free yourself of your own Geas and even managing to do
so will discorporate the deal entirely, for all sides of the deal. However, you do find yourself with
unnatural skill in wording these deals to your advantage, leaving and finding loopholes in them and
in manipulating people into being willing to take on these deals."
407,,200,Dark Teacher,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"Teachers have a great deal of power, given they are the source of each proceeding generation’s greatest warriors, magicians and leaders. Rarely is this more true than it is for you. A teacher like few others, those who study under you find that they learn as if they had enormous talent for anything you teach them, picking up everything from the combat arts to the spells of the far off Norse with lightning speed. Even faster this grows should you welcome them into your bedchambers and give them the gift of your thighs. You are particularly charming to any student you have in that manner indeed, and find that even those not yet your student will feel a growing desire to become such as your own fame for great skill and power grows. "
408,,200,Always Learning,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"The immortal life is one of long years and a constant struggle for meaning as everything around you
has begun to fade. You are somewhat familiar with this, as you age at just a fifth the rate other
humans do and have already lived for many years. Of course, unlike many immortal beings, you
found a great spring of motivation within you. You have apparently endless patience and focus, no
matter how boring the task at hand is, and that is coupled with a terrific propensity for learning new
information, as if you were still a child-like blank slate to stamp new knowledge onto. If anything, the more you know, the easier you find it to learn new things, as you apply the lessons, principles
and data from past subjects to anything even remotely similar to what you have learned before. The
final aspect to your lifelong task of endless improvement is that you find you do not technically need
a teacher, even for things that normally need such a thing, so long as you work at your task many
times longer than normal. Even the strangest of magic can be figured out eventually, given you have
centuries of isolation to do so."
409,,200,Man of the New World,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Lore,"As the world moves on from hitting each other with crude sticks and fists, power begins to change
hands. The strongest man in the room goes from an undoubted leader to mere muscle for the true
power, the man with all the knowledge. A combination of natural prodigy and years of effort gave
you a position among Britain’s most vaunted minds. While your most famous talents are focused in a
single academic discipline, such as Moriarty and his world renowned skill with mathematics or an
unsurpassed brilliance with biology, you are broadly skilled with many other fields. From several
respected academic paths to the different styles of the arts and even a deep understanding of
philosophy, you match the learning in each of what most men try a decade or more to come close to. Though a touch barbaric, you even indulged in learning a martial style of the empire, having enough
experience in boxing or baritsu to knock back-alley heads together without trouble.

It’s made possible with a particular mental technique that allows you to easily absorb and retain
information, the creation of a continually expanding ‘memory palace’ style territory within your
mind. Information is easily memorised and efficiently stored, granting the ability to rapidly make
connections between even seemingly disparate pieces of data that you have gathered. Knowledge of
disciplines you once studied thirty years ago remains as fresh as the new fad you spent an afternoon
exploring."
410,,200,Faded Scholar,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"Magecraft is just another art to master, a viewpoint even many proud magi in the clocktower can
share. But the sort of mastery you have is a little more uncommon than most. In a general sense, you’re the equal of a clocktower elite magus, with years of study across most basic fields of
magecraft that while mostly scholarly, still render you enough to take down a company of non- magical knights with ease. Your true talent lies with a single field of choice in particular, where you
are not only one of the current age’s prodigies but also able to cast spells in a unique way. An
Illusionist would cast illusions that trick the very texture itself, making for powerful, long lasting
magic that will be treated as if it was reality by other magic. It would still be an illusion, however. Perhaps a necromancer could raise the undead and trick the world into thinking that they are
genuinely alive, massively lessening the upkeep and cost of the undead. As a minor additional
benefit, you are quite experienced at convincing the non-magical folk to fund and aid your efforts, such as bringing in several wealthy nobles to provide the materials for your demon summoning
rituals."
411,,200,Dark Spell Book,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"A dark tome, one given as gift to you by a friend that is in to some very worrying research. Wrapped
in a leathery material best not asked about, this volume is a spellbook of notable power, should you
be willing to pay the price to use it. Collected together either by Prelati himself should you be in his
time, or a similar figure elsewhere, the tome both garners you a new friend in the form of it’s creator
and lets you use the eldritch magics held within, even if you lack magical training. The spells can be
paid for with both your own magical energy and that of any sacrifices you make to it, children
appear to be especially potent if you are depraved enough to use them. The book contains a range
of general spells, such as reinforcement or elemental magics, but most of what it holds focuses on
the summoning and control of twisted creatures covered in tentacles, from those as big as a dog to
things that tower over entire castles. In future worlds, the book will work as normal but the
depraved ally who created it will adjust to fit the new world. It may even be an alternate version of
Prelati if you like."
412,,200,Godly Personality,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Lore,"Power may be what initially draws worshippers to your cause but it is your mind and heart that
keeps them there and grows them into the devoted worshippers you most desire. A mind ideal for a
god is what you possess. You have the mental capacity to listen and answer to thousands of
individual prayers and rituals at once, the intelligence to accurately predict the effects of your divine
actions and interference for years in advance and the charisma to create cults and religions that
dominate entire countries, inspiring love and worship. Truly, your demeanour is one that makes the
sun rise in the hearts of men and inspires them to do great things for you, especially as it is those
men who are more civilised that find themselves naturally drawn to your beliefs, making the more
advanced and developed nations believe in you more easily as opposed to the barbarians."
413,,200,Fast Learner,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"Ironically, the greatest students are often the ones who spend the
least time as such. Your mind soaks up knowledge and new skills like a sponge,
absorbing information that will shame all but the best of your peers. Regardless of what
academic discipline you’re trying to learn, you’ll master it in half the time it takes most
people."
414,,200,Dusty Old Notes ,Tsukihime,Lore,"You’ve hit some sort of jackpot, Jumper. It’s a collection of journals and diaries that belonged to a now-deceased magus without an heir. It will take some time to decode and translate, but it contains knowledge of how to use common Magecraft practices such as utilization of the Elements, and some practical substitutes for some Formalcraft items, letting you execute effective rituals with common materials you could find in a modern grocery Store.
"
415,,200,Thought Acceleration ,Tsukihime,Lore,"Even a human brain operating at peak capacity has its limits - it is, after all, what amounts to biological hardware with set limitations.But what if those limitations could be surpassed? You are able to accelerate your thought processes to twice their normal speed, letting you quickly multitask and react faster than body and nervous system would normally allow, running calculations and strategies in a blink rather than a minute. In time, you could even accelerate this to three, or four or more times in speed. However, much like overclocking a computer, this is a stressful technique that is exhausting,and if overused, can burn your brain out like an overheated engine. Practice and careful moderation may let you overcome this, but for now, be cautious in how you use this.
"
416,,200,Rites of initiation ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"What is a pastor without its sheep? A hunter without the hunt? An occultist without its tools? This purchase grants you basic knowledge surrounding the rituals needed for this jump, including the ritual to induct new followers. This includes a general understanding of their inner workings, allowing you to tailor them as you see fit. You may use this power to induct an individual into the dark side of the world, allowing them to unlock an affinity based on one of the Principles of the Mansus. This affinity will closely match the nature of the new disciple. Those that already possessed an affinity before the rite receive no benefit from this perk.

For an additional 200 CP, you may take these rituals to other worlds, allowing you to create a new framework for magic based on the Principles and rituals found in this jump. This framework can interact with existing magical systems, allowing you to use the rituals you are familiar with to tap into the system, or you could have your powers work in an entirely separate manner.
"
417,,200,Bibliovore ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"There’s so much knowledge out there, and so little time. With this perk you have the innate ability to instantly memorize the contents from text and other visual media with just a touch. This ability can be used on any kind of visual medium, from engravings on ancient pottery, to diagrams in crumbling parchments, to blurry text in waterlogged codices, or even books written in a language you don't speak. The actual understanding of these contents is an entirely different matter, but you’ll figure it out with time. This ability can be toggled on and off at will, so that you are not burdened with unwanted knowledge.
"
418,,200,Loresmith ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"It pays to give back to the community, and for someone that has been everywhere, you could have a wealth of knowledge for sale. With this ability you can now easily contribute to the collective knowledge of the world by instantly creating essays, books, manuals, papers, recipes and other written documentation of any subject you are familiar with. This information is compiled with as much care as if you had done it over a few years, and can be formatted, rewritten, and edited on the fly, allowing you to tailor the final results to your liking. Teaching perks will increase the rate at which your documents are studied and assimilated.
"
419,,200,A collection of paintings ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"This collection consists of 9 different paintings created using rarefied pigments that can only be found in the strange side of the world. Each masterpiece depicts an Hour that best associates with each of the Principles of the Mansus. These paintings can be used in rituals as tools to perform magic, or to summon spirits. In future jumps, the subject of these paintings will change to depict a god-like entity that best embodies each of the Principles, and with the appropriate rites, it may be entirely possible to communicate with them and gain their favour.
"
420,,200,The Geminiad ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"An extensive treatise in the Principle of Knock. This text provides knowledge on every lock, every door, and every barrier, and the many ways to open them.
"
421,,200,Magecraft,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You have sufficient understanding of modern magecraft to claim the title
of Cause, an average magus, and may pick one form or style of modern magecraft to
specialize in. Canon examples include alchemy, curses, holy sacraments, spiritual
evocation, runes, formalcraft, kabbalah, jewelcraft, golemancy, necromancy, puppet
mastery, gravekeeper secrets, druidcraft, astromancy, witchcraft, summoning, zoology,
onmyoudou, shugendou, Apache shamanism, Traditional Japanese magecraft, and many
others. You have a firm grasp of both its theory and practice, as well the general
fundamentals of thaumaturgy, but unless you’ve got something else up your sleeve you’re nothing special. You may purchase this perk as many times as you like. First
purchase free to all but Drop-In and Student."
422,,200,Magecraft(Mastery),Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore," You may pay 200 CP to elevate your skills in one form or style of
magecraft you know from average to incredible - mastery worthy of the
Association’s elite, rather than a common mage, even if you learned it on another
jump. This isn’t enough to defeat a Lord of the Clocktower in a straight fight, not
without some serious talent and quite a few more magic circuits, but they’ll at
least take you seriously as a mage. You may also buy this upgrade multiple times,
but not for the same form of magecraft. 

Requires Magecraft of any Variety."
423,,200,Magecraft(Brand),Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"By paying 200 CP after taking Mastery - or having equivalent
skill - you may elevate your skills still further. At this point, your command
of your speciality is amongst the greatest living mages. Regardless of how
long or short your lineage is, you are on par with such exalted figures as
Rufleus Nuada-Re Eulyphis, Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald, and Inorai
Valualeta Atroholm, even if your magic circuits aren’t up to snuff and your
general skills leave something to be desired in comparison. Unlike the
previous perks, however, this may not be purchased multiple times - Brand
is the highest practical rank these days, and it would stretch credibility too
far to reach it multiple times. It also does not come with a ridiculous name,
even if you want one.

Requires Magecraft(Mastery) or equivalent Skill Level"
424,,200,Circles and Symbols ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Rather simply, this is knowledge of how to construct various magical symbols. Runes, circles, glyphs, you have an expansive knowledge of them, their uses, and how to modify them. On their own, they don’t have a ton of use besides warding away certain beings, but they are often important parts of other rituals or enchantments.
"
425,,200,The Fog of Ages ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"One of the things that can make a supernaturally long life hard to bear is the gradual loss of memory. Over time, family, friends, and lovers all fade from the mind. Your happiness and sadness, your highs and lows. All that makes a person who they are slowly slips away. For you, that isn’t a problem. Your memory of events from ten-thousand years ago are as sharp as those from ten minutes ago.
"
426,,200,Planning for the Long Term ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Lore,"The Liche Priests, for all their cunning and trickery, failed to fully research the spells of immortality that they subjected themselves to. They believed that by binding their souls to their own body, they would live forever. They were right. What they assumed wrongly was that they would live forever with eternal youth accompanying that longevity. They were wrong. They continued to age, rotting away till they were animated skeletons with dusty, leathery sacks of skin hanging from their bones in strips. If only you could have known the long term consequences of that act, you might have chosen to pass it over yourself. At least now you will not make the same mistake, as you are aware of the long term consequences of any magic, ritual or other process done to yourself. If a spell would cause your death after sixty years of empowering you, you would know that. If a serum would result in gaining a cancerous tumour within you, you would know that upon examining the serum, even if you could not have found it out before."
427,,200,Taketori Monogatari ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"This old and tattered book illustrates a folk tale of a Lunar Princess who temporarily sought refuge on the Earth, and those who came in search of her hand. Though she would return to the moon in the end, she left a blessing to the man she had grown enamoured with during her stay. He would reject it in the end, but a fragment of the blessing still remains. 

Whoever reads this ancient tome will attain the blessings of the moon, and under moonlight, their natural capabilities improve dramatically, including their magic and their body’s natural capacity to regenerate. One would wonder how different things might be had the Lunar Princess’ lover chosen not to forsake his beloved’s blessing...
"
428,,200,“When the loli is mass-produced: An introduction to cloning” ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Lore,"This book, by a famous Scandinavian Alchemist, details the fundamentals behind custom construction of human bodies, and then implantation of memories into them. When handled by a sufficiently skilled Alchemist, one can learn how to automate this process and the mechanics behind copying, implanting and transferring memories.
"
429,,200,“Auto-scoring your love life: Advanced fundamentals” ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Lore,"By an anonymous author, this book details the creation of artificial constructs via alchemy, such as the vaunted auto-scorers, bizarre wind-up machines of death. Auto-scorers are mostly known as capable combat machines, resembling marionettes, but the grand majority of them exist as assistants and custom made tools for Alchemists, such as Tiki, an auto-scorer that functions as a living observatory.
"
430,,200,Bibliophilic Luck ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You have an unusual knack for picking up rare books, books of magical knowledge, and dangerous books infested by youkai or evil spirits. Many of these books here will offer invaluable guidance should you wish to learn magic, study youkai for their strengths and weaknesses, as well as protecting yourself against common supernatural pests. Does not come with any inherent ability to store them safely, so you might want to fix that – these books are occasionally known to come alive if stored around too much youkai energies.
"
431,,200,Youma Books ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You have a collection of supernatural books, such as grimoires written by magicians, valuable historical texts about supernatural occurrences, letters soaked in feelings until they begun to take a life of their own, and books written by youkai to record their own existence. Includes the first Japanese translation of the Necronomicon. Be careful of thieves.
"
432,,200,Ocean Secrets* ,Peter Pan,Lore,"Mermaids know all of the secrets to the ocean, and every secret whispered that rippled off the water's surface. You are incredibly wise in spite of your outward personality, and often know things that no one else does, from where a treasure is hidden to what Hook (or someone else) is plotting, to ancient spells and lore hidden beneath the waves at Atlantis. Not only is this information available for your use, but many will come to seek your advice, giving you more opportunities to drown them. After the jump, the ability applies to any ocean or sea you can access. If you also took the Water Fairy Talent, you can apply the same power to any body of water, even the water in a bathtub or bottle."
433,,200,Lore in Iron ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The Lore of Metal, as you might expect, resonates especially well with metal. It also, however, resonates especially well with the rational mind. It takes a clear head to memorize the thousands of formulae necessary in a true Alchemist’s work. As such, you find that your connection to Chamon also grants you enhanced clarity of thought and speed of cognition. The Gold Order has no use for scatterbrains, after all.
"
434,,200,Hedge Empathy ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"Alone among the Imperial Orders, the Jade Wizards are known to often seek out hedge mages as Apprentices - at least, those whose magics align with life and growth. The orders the Druids belonged to before the coming of Teclis still have survivors, so perhaps this makes sense. You may be just what the Jade Order needs to call that wayward third of your kin to their true calling. Your ability to convince self-taught or accidental magicians to undertake formal schooling in their powers is something beyond a way with words. It is as if your presence forces them to realize how much they cannot learn on their own.
"
435,,200,Word to the Wise ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The path of the Hierophant requires discipline, wisdom, and most of all, time. Of course, men have short lifespans, and so it is just as wise to seek out one’s elders for information. Now you will find that your elders and superiors are more willing than they might otherwise have been to answer your questions on everything from the nature of magic to how to treat horrible burns. Even those known for keeping important secrets might just part with them in your presence."
436,,200,A Modest Treatise on the Nature of Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"Penned by Magister Patriarch Gotthilf Puchta of the Gold Order a century ago, this educational tome contains no spells, but rather a deep examination of magical theory and occult minutiae, including the workings of the Eight Winds, the nature of their flow, the nature of the Realm of Chaos from which they enter this world, and the process by which they are put to use to create spells. Careful study of this massive book will certainly grant you insights you would not ordinarily have into the working of your Lore of Magic, as well as how it relates to the others overall. As your adventures continue, you may make similar discoveries on the workings of other forms of magic - and oddly enough this copy of the Treatise will record your future findings as if Puchta himself had penned them. This will ensure that your breakthroughs in magical theory are recorded in a manner that may be used as an effective teaching aid if copied and distributed, just as copies of the original are used by many Magisters in the more theoretical instruction of their Apprentices.
"
437,,200,Scroll of Incarnate Elemental ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"This scroll contains information long coveted by the most desperate or ambitious of wizards. Information that would be useless even to them, save during a Storm of Magic. In such times, when the Winds of Magic blow strongest, a Wizard may conjure forth a being of true might from the essence of his Wind. Not only will study of this scroll teach you the rituals and materials necessary to craft an Incarnate Elemental of your Wind of Magic, it will also provide you with a path to perhaps doing so at any time - even when the Winds blow weakly. Unleashing such a horror upon your enemies is satisfying, is it not? Ah, perhaps there is some confusion. It is true that the ritual Teclis may or may not soon perform has a similar name and even a similar function, but this is not that. I offer my sincerest condolences.

438,,200,Tome of Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Lore,"This journal looks completely unassuming at first glance, but when one looks inside they will find that no matter how many pages they turn, the journal will simply have more pages available, the texts on those pages perfectly preserved regardless of the conditions. This will make an excellent place to write down information you keep to keep but also remain private, for if any who are not welcome attempt to take or open the book will be on the receiving end of a powerful blast of magic that will likely take off their hands and arms. The book will also magically notify you that an intruder is attempting to steal your precious secrets.
"
439,,200,Guerilla Futurism​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"The future is coming and you intend to be on the right side when it arrives. And now, so will all of your social media followers. You are masterfully expert at engineering campaigns of social media, public awareness and crowd­sourced fundraising. With covert use of your magic, you may use just about any information distributive method at your disposal to disseminate any information that you desire. The only limitation on how far and how wide this information will spread is how long you actively focus on keeping the campaign running. You could reach normal kickstarter goals in hours or ensure that everyone on the planet has seen a celebrity photo. Perhaps with a year of covert efforts and preparations, you could manufacture the next “Gangnam Style.” I suppose you could use it to make and spread your own memes as well, but really that is a waste of your talents."
440,,200,Stitched lips​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"An ever present danger in the world of espionage is that should an agent be captured, they will be tortured, interrogated and coerced, likely divulging sensitive information in the process. You have been trained in anti­-interrogation techniques as well as meditations that will prevent your thoughts from being detected by outside interference. It is likely that you will be able to shrug off just about any torture, drug, mind probe, mystical lasso of truth or any other technique that would make you divulge information against your will. This does not mean however that you will be able to escape the consequences for resisting (they may still try to kill, or torture you more if you don’t divulge information).
"
441,,200,Grimoire Hunter ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"Grimoires are one of the most prized possessions a mage can acquire. Within them are insights on the nature of the supernal realm, spells that have been lost to the ages, and a means of casting extant spells more easily. While these tomes are frequently rare and hard to find, you have a combination of insight, talent, and luck that will invariably lead you to discovering these grimoires where others might have failed. Be warned that finding these tomes of power is only the first step, deciphering their meaning and understanding them is a challenge all its own. (In future jumps, this ability extends to any tome or document of rare mystical and/or forgotten knowledge.)
"
442,,200,Purah’s Notes ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Lore,"The elder Sheikah Purah had once attempted to program a rune to make them physically younger, and to some extent even succeeded! However, it was too effective - the formerly hundreds-year old Sheikah had become nearly a child with a single mishap! The same kind of effect being used on even an old man by Hylian standards could easily fall into a grisly fate, so...using these notes to replicate the Rune without any adjustments is a dangerous proposition. Still, you at least have the opportunity to adjust it as you need.
"
443,,200,The Legends of Hyrule ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Lore,"The land of Hyrule has its esoteric lore - mystical phenomena, ancient history, and hidden palaces. You now hold this knowledge in your mind, of all those things - though the details may be somewhat blurred by the fog of ages. What’s more, a similar knowledge of myth and mystery will always follow you from world to world.
"
444,,200,Swordsman Scrolls ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Lore,"You’d think that these would be only mildly useful to an engineer due to them being, you know, and engineer, but you’ve managed to get your hands on them anyways. These two scrolls detail the usages of two sword techniques that are incredibly hard to find teachers for. The first is sword beams, the ability to shoot ‘cutting wind’ type attacks from the edge of your blade. Sadly, an ordinary blade won’t be enough - there needs to be a level of magic to it in order to power the beam. The second scroll details the great spin attack, a much easier technique to use. Additionally, you can rewrite these scrolls, turning them into two techniques of your own choosing. But, why mess with the classics?
"
445,,200,Swordsman's Scroll ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Lore,"This simple blue scroll might often be mistaken for a map, but inside it lies a powerful sword technique. The great spin attack, though you may also know it as the hurricane spin. Well, I suppose a more strict explanation is that it teaches you how to add in magical energy to your attacks, something that causes the spin attack to evolve into the hurricane spin. I’m sure you can create other techniques with a bit of effort, though that's up to you."
446,,200,Hearthfire - Vast Library ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"For those of a more academic persuasion, this large library is a great addition to your home. Large shelves that contain a large number of books, ranging from children's fiction to history. It also contains a fair amount of spell books that make learning the spells within much easier than they otherwise would be. There are also instructions on how to make more of them, some with your own custom spells.(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
447,,200,Speaks Draconic ,The Dragon Prince,Lore,"The other part of Primal Magic is speaking an incantation in the Draconic tongue. Fortunately, you are now fluent, and as a bonus, you can now easily speak backwards as Dark Mages do when casting."
448,,200,Soft Stick ,World Seed,Lore,"One of the technological staples in Neolife, these special devices are basically CDs for magic. Each Soft Stick is capable of holding a single program that can be erased or replaced as needed. Once a program is uploaded, the aura of the Soft Stick will shift to match it, making it an easy matter to convert any software you might write into a magical formation or enchantment with the same effect, and even doing things such as transferring an AI to an enchantment wouldn’t be much trouble. Furthermore, since the companion bracelet is a suitable terminal to upload software to and from, you wouldn’t even need any other equipment. With this purchase, you gain an endless supply of these useful little things, working with any code or software you might write, no matter how obscure or complicated."
449,,200,Holy Symbol ,Konosuba,Lore,"Faith is quite important to the job of a priest, though who that faith is directed to matters quite a bit less. Instead of directing your prayers towards any of the Goddesses that already exist in this world, you have a holy symbol and books that are suited to a more personal faith, perhaps even one about yourself. They work just as well as any holy symbols would and can be used to channel priestly magic quite well. The books even include a range of holy arts and magic to teach you or any you give the book to. "
450,,300,Library of Ohara,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Lore,"The Library of Ohara is the semblance belonging to Nico Robin. This is a simple, but
useful ability. The Library of Ohara enhances the user’s ability to process and retain
information. Nico claimed that while utilizing her Semblance she would be able to find a
single eel within the ocean. Another use would be memorizing an entire library in mere
days rather than the months if not years most people would take."
451,,300,Talented,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Lore,"There are many individuals with great intellect, but this doesn’t necessarily mean they’re
actually smart. You may or may not be intelligent, but you certainly are talented. This is
a skill possessed by those with enhanced learning speeds. It multiples the speed at
which you learn anything a dozen times over and it stacks with any other similar boost
you possess. This will allow you to learn any skill, including unique skills, though you can't copy innate physical traits like strength or the Sharingan, for instance."
452,,300,The Nature of Magic,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"There are also those who hold the opinion that magic is another Science. To acquire magic is to acquire knowledge. The essence of this philosophy is progress, development, change, and constant movement. You now understand that there are few if any limits to what can be accomplished by your hands. You are not bound to a rigid magic system nor do you have a limit to the quality of the spells that you possess. You can develop better versions and original magical effects, weave life itself into strange forms, and make wonders that may immortalize your name as one of the greatest mages in the world. Now please, do not waste time, you have so much more to learn and discover.

Note: Requires The Art."
453,,300,Native Speaker of Body Language,DC Comics,Lore,"Human body language - gestures, movements, the subtle signs that all play out to precede and
follow through on actions and behavior - is unbelievably complicated, but in essence predictable
if you can understand the patterns behind it. Like speaking a vocal language. Theoretically, if
one were to be raised in total isolation of linguistic stimuli, and had their exposure to body
language tightly regulated and measured, they would develop in such a way as to ‘speak’ it as
fluently as one would speak their native tongue. Following the success of his daughter
Cassandra, David Cain raised another child under similar procedures.
That child was you. Your early life, from even before you could walk, has been violence and
little else. Hundreds of martial arts forms, the use of blades, guns, and the environment to kill,
even the thousands of little movements made before a punch is thrown, you can understand it
as easily as you would a spoken language due to the language center of your brain learning to
interpret movement instead of sound. Look at a person, and see how to kill them, just like that.
See what a room of trained fighters will do before they do it, predict and counter their every
motion, and deliver the killing blow, all as intuitively as simply listening and understanding. You
could weave through a storm of bullets, punch through solid concrete and steel, and even knock
out Batman or Lady Shiva in a fight, your aptitude having far surpassed what any training could
accomplish alone.
However, this comes at a steep cost. Due to your upbringing you can’t speak any true
languages, and any you did speak before will be removed from your memory in order to make
room for this new comprehension. Understanding them when spoken to you, that’s different,
but it’ll be one-way. You could sacrifice a portion of your skill to learn to speak again,
decreasing your fighting ability to Batman’s level, or resign yourself to only communicating
silently with others that share your intuitive understanding by allowing them to read your
movements. This drawback is remedied by perks enhancing cognitive ability."
454,,300,Born to Fight,DC Comics,Lore,"Combat is literally in your blood, written into your very DNA. Everyone’s got ceilings to their
skills, points where training simply can’t take them any further, and although you’re no exception
yours are some of the highest ever seen. Fighting feels natural for you even without training or
experience, and you pick up combat-related skills much faster than most. You can master
martial arts and other forms of combat in years to a degree others couldn’t hope to reach in a
lifetime, as well as train your body beyond what’s normally considered to be the peak of human
potential. If taken with either purchase of Natural Adept At Aptitudes, you’re a rival in sheer skill
to the likes of Richard Dragon and Lady Shiva."
455,,300,Been Around The Block,High School DxD,Lore,"Originally, it was assumed you were a relative newcomer to the supernatural stage - whether from old blood, dabbling, or just bad luck. But as it stands, you’ve been around for a while, one way or another. For non-Humans, you are a living veteran of the Great War, someone who survived and perhaps even thrived in the apocalyptic war of old. You have mastery of your Magic System of choice, any Sacred Gear or Holy Sword you own with its Balance Breaker and at least one Sub-Species unlocked for the former, as well as magical combat. You are likely a high-ranking member of your Faction, if you have any. These green and wet-behind-the-ears high school students may as well be flies to you, though the strongest members of the Factions and a practiced Longinus user can still be a challenge to you. Obviously, you’re several millennia older than a high school student, as a result. If you have no background memories or prefer to be a young prodigy, this experience and power appears ex nihilo, though your Faction is likely to hold you in high esteem as they realize your skill.

For Humans, you are instead the Reincarnation of a human (or hybrid) hero of myth who passed away many years ago. You started as an ordinary person, but you began to remember your old life and skills related to that mythological life began to surface to you in visions and dreams. A reincarnation of Lancelot would turn into a master swordsman overnight, a reincarnation of Hercules would be a master of wrestling and unarmed combat as well as incredibly strong. You require practice to unlock your old self’s full potential, but it takes nowhere near as long as it would if you were an ordinary person. Your soul’s strength will also let you quickly unlock and master the powers of a Sacred Gear or Holy Sword, particularly if they were a weapon or had an ability linked to your legend somehow."
456,,300,Weapons of War,God Of War (2018),Lore,"How do you even use that? You have a great deal of skill when using unusual weapons such as the Blades of Chaos (swords attached to chains which are wrapped around your arms). This perk grants you an expert's skill in any new weapon you pick up, no matter how unusual or magical they are. For example you have a weapon that can return to you if you throw it, now you will be able to always catch it without fumbling."
457,,300,Suckin’ at something…,Adventure Time,Lore,...is the first step towards being sort of good at something. You find that you learn new skills quickly. While this doesn’t mean you’ll master something faster it does make the step between being a beginner and being capable a great deal shorter. 
458,,300,Beyond Limits,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"There is a presumed limit that will be reached. That once you have the ability to strike at your opponent three or four times before they can attack you once, or once you’ve reached the third level of a spell, that such is the end. Not at all. Your talent can be refined and practiced again and again, whereupon even the most basic spells can reach cataclysmic levels, or your weapon skill surpass logic and explanation."
459,,300,Train the Basics,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"There are those that will find that their skills, their understandings, their power seems to struggle to increase once a certain point has been reached. You are not those. Even repeating the most basic of training will increase your skills. Form practice with your blade every morning, even after you’ve mastered the forms? You’ll continue to increase in your skill as if it were all new to you, without limitations."
460,,300,The Book of Eternity ,Hellblazer,Lore,"On top of being the true history of the world, as written by Merlin, this book will teach you potent spells, though not as quickly as the necronomicon."
461,,300,Necronomicon ,Hellblazer,Lore,"A book containing the darkest rituals imaginable. It will quickly teach you powerful spells, but it will corrupt you if you are not strong of will."
462,,300,Spark of Genius,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Lore,"Like a Thunderbolt in the night enlightens your Genius the World. Nikola Tesla, one of the brightest and most genius man in humanities history, is the only one you can call equal. Your intelligence is simply above your peers, as it takes little to envision incredibly works of technology to advance humanity into a new age. The truth of the universes just wait for you to reach out to them as you can understand them eventually if you dedicate yourself and all you would need are the resources to have the things your mind develops be made realized. Beware those jealous of mind like your own though."
463,,300,Man of Many Skills ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Lore,"The doctor in Del Mar is a remarkably skilled individual. In addition to his medical duties he also functions as the town Barber, Veterinarian, Dentist, and Shaman/Witch Hunter. Perhaps he trained you or you were forced to take up an equal amount of positions. You can be considered a true master of five different fields. Though if you pick similar fields they may be able to synergize allowing you to pull off even more impressive feats. Post jump you may choose an additional five fields to gain an equal level of skill in. The mastery you receive will however, depend on the setting. For example, a doctor in this setting would not be as advanced as one from a more modern setting. You might however gain knowledge of fantasy and mystical healing methods unavailable in a sci-fi setting."
464,,300,Shepherd’s Journal,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Lore,"This book bears the symbol of the Atlantean language’s “a”, and details the explorations of a shepherd named Aziz that led him to discover Atlantis thousands of years ago. Written in the Atlantean language, it might be considered useless to anyone with an inability to read it- however, a proper understanding of ancient languages including Latin, Babylonian, and Thessalonian- in addition to Nordic runes- should give you enough to read it like a native Atlantean could thousands of years ago. And what does the book reveal? The path to Atlantis, of course- any Atlantis, so long as it’s been hidden or lost to time. Failing that, the book will also lead you to the remnants of any other lost civilizations in the future- Camelot, El Dorado, the Lost City of Z, Y’s, Iram of the Pillars- even the unnamed cities that used to belong to Lemuria, Mu, and Shangri-La!"
465,,300,Grimoire,A Certain Magical Index,Lore,"A completely identical copy of a grimoire of your choosing. Although it might drive you into insanity if you don’t have the training or will to handle its malevolent influence, it provides you with a lot of power if you’re magically inclined. Yes, this list includes the Necrominicon. Hold on, I’ll go get it. Ah, here it is. List here: http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Grimoire"
466,,300,Ancestor’s Portrait,Darkest Dungeon,Lore,"A portrait that probably isn’t meant to depict the Ancestor. Easily carried in one’s cloak, jacket, or bag, the portrait has the strange effect of increasing the “experience” one earns by half-again; letting one learn more from their time in battle or exploration."
467,,300,I'm Not Rusty,Shovel Knight,Lore,"No matter how long you go without practice and exercise, you will stay just as skilled."
468,,300,Supported skills,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,"As you practice a skill, you find that related skills also improve by a tiny degree. Swing a sword for a month, and you won't have to worry about injuring yourself with that flail you've never used before. Spend a jump as a cook and find that chemistry makes a little more sense to you. You cannot master a new skill through this method, but it will greatly accelerate the learning process when you do start fighting with that flail or working with chemistry. "
469,,300,HUD,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,"Your mind is now shared with a non-sapient entity that acts as a PDA. It is able to sort through your memories and senses to perfectly recall anything you know or have experienced. The HUD cannot use any of your powers, relies upon your senses and has no initiative or willpower of its own, but can be easily 'programmed' with complex instructions, providing reminders or pop-ups in your field of view. Besides acting as an excellent mapping tool, it also gives you a perfect internal clock."
470,,300,Roman Manuscripts,King Arthur ,Lore,"You've come into possession of a series of books detailing the process of constructing large man-made beasts. Unfortunately the books are encoded and you can't understand them yet. Though from the drawings you can tell they are made from stone and wood, some even look to have several functions. One looks as if it's breathing fire, another seem to be capable of flight all in all they seem to be kinda mundane. There is one however that seems, strange compared to the others. Where all the others were shaped after an animal or a mythical beast this one looks humanoid. Modeled after a knight it's right hand holds a sword and the right hand holds a shield. Both have strange symbols on it. Several other images seem to show their effects. The sword is cleaving a mountain with a seemingly glowing sword. And another image is showing the knight holding its shield up with a orb around the knight blocking a dragon's fiery breath. Maybe there's even more secrets in these books that you can find after cracking the code."
471,,300,Consummate Rules-Lawyer,The Dresden Files,Lore,"There's three types of people in the world: Those who don't deal with the Fae, those who get really good at navigating the confusing maze of faerie law, and those who get dragged screaming from the world. Since the first isn't an option, you've gone to the second camp. You now understand every paragraph of the Unseelie accords by instinct, and can tie loops in others using it while slipping similar knots yourself. It's also given you quite the perspective on quaint mortal legal systems, and after dealing with Winter Fae, mortal bureaucrats or lawyers just seem adorable."
472,,300,"""Magical Attunement""",Dark Souls 3,Lore,"Focus in battle is a necessity; without focus, both knights and sorcerers can find themselves on the wrong end of a sword. In the heat of battle or the darkest of circumstances, you are able to find this focus and harness it. With this, your mind has become a bit sharper, and more suited towards memorization. This has two main effects; the first is that you naturally possess a larger pool of magical energy, or ‘focus’, which allows you to cast spells of all types, as well as unleash any special abilities inherent to the weapons you can find here. The second effect is that you’ll be able to memorize more spells, allowing you to have a wider arsenal when going into battle. Finally, you’ll also find that your mind is more suited towards casting the spells of this land, letting you learn to cast the more powerful ones a bit more easily."
473,,300,"""Sorcery""",Dark Souls 3,Lore,"A refined school of magic pursued by scholars, the gifted and this inquisitive. Sorcerers wield magical catalysts such as staves to pull upon the essence of the soul in order to perform various spells, each empowered by the caster's mind. You are well versed in the complex art, able to perform a variety of the more common spells such as Soul Arrow and its counterparts to attack from afar, or Magic Weapon and Magic Shield to temporarily empower your equipment if danger is close. While your repertoire isn't expansive, yet, there are numerous opportunities to add to it in these churning lands wrought with secrets. Despite that, a modest increase in intelligence and training in the art has granted you great magical potency, as well as resistance to magic. Both of these traits can grow higher yet with study and opening your mind."
474,,300,“The Hermit”,Dark Souls 1,Lore,"On purchase, a place is formed somewhere out in the world. A place you are guided too by instinct, but remains hard to find and secretive even then. Travelling far to some mysterious land is often required, but you will eventually find what you seek. A hermit of some kind, secluded within a strange place unlike most sights you may find. They’re ancient, worldly, with knowledge appropriate of their age. They could be anything from a centuries old withered king, to the last of an extinct race such as a dragon, but usually something thematic of what you’re currently seeking in life. The hermit may be wise, they might even be great and powerful, but now they simply sit in solitude for reasons unknown. You may potentially learn an incredible amount from this hermit, but there is a problem that crops up no matter which world you find them in. Each hermit you locate is varying degrees of mad, eccentric or possibly even unresponsive as they sit in a single spot, unmoving but alive. It will be a great task to pull it free, but their knowledge is almost always a reward worth earning."
475,,300,“Rite of Kindling” ,Dark Souls 1,Lore,"A lost tome containing instructions to old methods of kindling bonfires. This tome allows you to create larger bonfires that many more may rest and heal beside. What’s perhaps a more important ability however is a ceremony found within that can allow others to become firekeepers. This is not a ceremony or role to be taken lightly however. Those who become firekeepers will gain the power to kindle a bonfire and obtain souls that attract humanity used to keep it kindled. Those who cannot handle the rush of darkness may be driven despair. Unlike you, most firekeepers will only be able to keep one fire at a time. Still, spread throughout your allies, many more points of respite can be made than you by yourself."
476,,300,Runesmith,Bloodborne,Lore,"“Runesmith Caryll of Byrgenwerth was a scholar like many who studied beside them, and yet, they were privy to a special sort of knowledge. Inhuman mutterings behind the walls of mundanity gnawed at their consciousness, and the only thing they could do was write them. 

Whatever Caryll heard, whatever skill they developed with transcribing words that humans could not possibly fully fathom, they have once again manifested within you. While you aren’t any better at speaking the language of the Great Ones, you may now write their words, which maintain that power. 

These incredible runes may be emblazoned straight upon one’s mind with the proper tools, conveying their abilities, each unique and relating to the word they represent. Take care, as the unenlightened human can’t handle too many words, meaning only three or so could be benefited from by most. 

Greater perception, insight into the abnormalities in one’s surroundings, will let one better pick up the murmurs of Great Ones, allowing one access to writing more runes.”"
477,,300,Acolyte’s Knowledge,Demon's Souls,Lore,"​You’re not a fool dabbling in magic, no not at all. Whereas some amateur might remember to cast a spell or two you are well-versed in magic. It seems that your constant studies has improved the damage of your spells."
478,,300,Sorcerous Adept ,Elden Ring,Lore,"Intellect, abstract reasoning and all the other scholastic arts are those most treasured by the sorcerers of Raya Lucaria-all talents you have in spades. Not only is your mind powerful enough to withstand the scholastic rigours needed to comprehend, grasp and properly execute various sorceries beyond the common ken of most of your kind, but you are also a gifted wielder of sorceries by the standards of your kin. Some weapons in this world are also more effective in your hands, and perhaps due to your grasp of the underlying principles it seems your sorcerous learnings have made it harder for you to be damaged by hostile sorcery. Naturally this comes with a great deal of knowledge about history, studies about the traditions inherited from sorcerer to sorcerer and insight into the history of this world-but surely the power to blast away your enemies with a barrage of falling glintstone stars is more relevant here?"
479,,300,Old-Fashioned,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Lore,"Living as long as you have, the things that were fashionable in your youth... simply aren't anymore. On top of just generally wearing suits well, you've got a collection of ancient spells in your arsenal - not necessarily powerful ones, but they're obscure, which immediately gives you the advantage of surprise. In the future, you'll always be able to readily discover some older forms of magic, if you care to look."
480,,300,Signum Linguistics,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"Also called Symbol Magic. It’s one of China Sorrows’ specialties. Harnesses a magical language to produce a wide variety of effects. Fairly unique in that it can be learned by anyone, even if they’ve already chosen their discipline. As such, this magic can be purchased regardless of how many others you’ve bought already, even without Multidisciplinary Magic.

Boosted: Sorrows: Your talent is equal to that of China Sorrows, the world's most well-known user of this discipline. With this, you have become capable of producing greater effects than before. From producing waves of energy to masquerading as another, you can do it all. You can even carve sigils into your very body without a single worry of a mistake. Using this power, you could even seal others’ True Names, provided they meet the requirements for doing so, of course. What you can do now is virtually limitless, as long as you know the right runes. And if the runes you want don’t exist, you can always just invent your own.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
481,,300,The Blade of Ma'at ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"This ordinary-appearing dagger is actually a powerful magical artifact of an ancient Egyptian goddess of truth. The magic of this knife prevents it from physically cutting any living being. Instead, when the dagger is plunged into the heart of a being, they are bound to truth so long as it remains in place. They may still lie, but if they do so, the full divine power of the goddess will be delivered upon them, either simply destroying or driving mad all but the most powerful beings.

Of course, the dagger takes a lawyer's view of the truth. Careful wording will allow the effects to be sidestepped and as the dagger doesn't compel them to speak, they can simply choose to either say nothing or only give part of the story.
"
482,,300,Sorcerer Savant ,Young Justice,Lore,"Your understanding of the mechanisms involved in casting spells now let you copy the techniques of other magical users, so long as you have the capability to cast the type of magic that they’re using. This effectively allows you to learn a spell after seeing someone else cast it, though you’ll still need to master it to cast it reliably.
"
483,,300,Gift of Bi­-Sheng ,Libriomancer,Lore,"A gift from the students of Bi­-Sheng. This plain white book made from rice paper allows you to transcribe your thoughts, memories and personality into it. It will serve as a metaphysical anchoring point, allowing you to maintain your identity and cohesion in spite of whatever trauma you may face or attempts to alter your identity/wipe you from existence.
"
484,,300,Rainbow Notes ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Lore,"While mermaids are superior singers, humans invented the art of song to begin with. You are now gifted in the art of music composition, and can creatively piece together the notes and lyrics for new songs effortlessly. In fact, your songs are good enough such that, when sung or played by a magical being such as a mermaid, or someone with magical music like a fantasy bard, they have magical powers of their own. And the greatest thing about music is that it is a treasure that can be shared with anyone. You can teach your songs, even magical ones, to companions and other pupils willing to learn. Please also note that the perk also applies to other musical forms outside of singing, such as the piano, as well as other things such as dancing, prayers, and spell chants.
"
485,,300,Renaissance Girl/Boy ,Lyrical Nanoha,Lore,"But why stop at one field? Why not...all of them? The benefits to this perk are twofold. First, you learn new disciplines and skills quickly. While this can be applied to combat or mundane abilities, it is most effective when you’re learning new sciences or ‘systems’, letting you pick up a new field of study within weeks as opposed to months, or months instead of years. Secondly, your mind is now able to calculate mathematics as quickly as a computer or calculator, able to work out complicated equations in your head within seconds. You could potentially program a spell using these calculations alone without the help of an AI in your Device, if you really put your mind to it."
486,,300,Techniques to Doguu Making ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"The majority of these clay figurines are ancient, detailing animals or small humanoids, and to date, it’s still unclear why they were made in the first place. This short primer teaches one how to faithfully reproduce these artefacts, even with modern materials. However, with a bit of extra magic, you’ll be able to bring them to life – though this is where the primer seems to become a bit unclear.

Doguu and Haniwa are distinctly different objects – though they may be visually similar in some cases. The primer goes to indicate however that these doguu you create can serve the same function as a haniwa would, acting as a container for the souls of the dead. In time, you’ll be able to animate the figurine and bring back fragments of the dead soul as well...

I’m not so sure they would be happy to find themselves stuck in a clay figurine, and that’s assuming that the Doguu captures their soul intact. You may alternatively choose to insert a soul into the figurine, though it is best if you have some expertise in manipulating souls and spirits before you do so.
"
487,,300,Munechika’s Legacy to Future Smiths ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"These are the notes of one Munechika Sanjou – one of the blacksmiths who forged the five swords under heaven – blades of renown in this land. Though his notes are rather tattered and sparse, they still possess a wealth of information for any aspiring blacksmith.

Any piece you create is far more likely to become a recognized masterpiece, and should you inscribe a signature onto a piece, you can weave an ability into the weapon to empower them. Any who read these notes can perform such a task, but the quality of their work will be dependent on their own skill.
"
488,,300,Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Lore,"A limitless magical scroll that can accommodate as many spells as the user wishes to inscribe upon it. This scroll can automatically recite chants or undergo rituals in place of the user, and being a magical item, will not function for anybody except for its rightful owner.
"
489,,400,Magical Genius,Baldur's Gate 3,Lore,"Are you a chosen of Mystra may haps? Because your talent and potential for all things
related to spellcasting is simply prodigious. It is asif you are one of the Weave’s favorite casters.
At its base this perk grants you improved talent for learning and casting any kind of spellcraft,
be they divine or arcane in nature. Comprehending and deciphering long lost spell formulas or
understanding completely unique arcane devices and magical effects are second nature to you.
If you are a spellcaster that prepares spells, like clerics or druids, you can double to
amount of spell memorization slots you have. If you are a spontaneous caster that learn spells
and always has them prepared, like bards or sorcerers, you double the number of spells you get
to learn. If you are a wizard, not only you get double memorization slots, but you also get an
additional spell each time you level up.
When performing a ritual or casting a spell, miscasts or accidents are guaranteed to not
occur for you. You get a talent for creating new spells from scratch or modifying already
existing spell formulas. Last of all while all spellcaster can scribe scrolls with time and resource
investment, you only require half the time and resources needed to create those scrolls."
490,,400,Dimensional Arts,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"The mystics of a now-lost nation developed techniques
to manipulate and control space, with such art having even been used by an team of
engineers to create the Teigu, Shambhala, and to enhance others, like Incursio and
Grand Chariot, that began to be stored in smaller sword-like containers. The art of
space manipulation, like the other techniques used in the creation of the Teigu, was
also presumably lost, however you managed to recover it by studying the notes left
behind by that team of engineers. You’ve learned how to build devices capable of
manipulating and controlling space in different forms, like containers that are bigger
on the inside, portals to distant locations and even personal teleportation devices. Of
course, something on par with Shambhala is still out of your capacity for now, unless
you manage to combine this art with the knowledge to craft Teigu-like weapons."
491,,400,Prosthetic Enhancements,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"One of your fields of expertise as one of the
Empire’s doctors (or alchemists) is military technology, more precisely in the area of
producing and implanting fully functional prosthetic limbs and even a few kinds of
artificial organs, like a mechanical heart for example. The prostheses you’re able to
produce are at least on par with their organic counterparts, so even a General that
lost one of their limbs wouldn't mind having one of your prosthetic limbs attached to
them to replace the lost one. You also have the skills and knowledge to alter these
prosthetic limbs to also include some special functions into them like more simple
ones such as hidden guns and blades or even something more complex such as a
hand that launches out and can be reeled in."
492,,400,The Strong Dominates the Weak,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"Dominating others isn’t just related to
breaking people, but also on rebuilding them as you want. In addition to being skilled
in finding the best ways to break someone’s will and sanity, you’re also very well
versed in brainwashing and mental conditioning techniques, being an expert on
techniques that implants powerful mental suggestions into others and that ensure a
broken individual will be “rebuilt” as a loyal servant of yours, usually through a
combination of torture, hypnosis and/or even chemical substances in some cases.
Some examples of the possibilities brought by such techniques include being able to
implant mental suggestions on people so powerful that they cause severe pangs of
pain on those that attempt to go against them and even turning a powerful and
prideful hero into your loyal “pet” after breaking their will.
Of course, just keep in mind that the stronger an individual’s will is, the harder it’ll be
to effectively control through such methods.
Furthermore, as a specialist in domination and a hunter, you learned more than
merely hunting Danger Beasts and dominating your fellow humans, but also
developed all the needed skills to train and tame practically any wild beasts by using
their natural instincts to find a way to dominate them, with the stronger and/or more
rebellious beasts taking more time to train. For example, the ordinary animals would
be a child’s play for you to tame while the legendary Super Class Danger Beasts
may take months until they’re properly tamed. Post-jump, this perk can also be used
to tame any other similarly irrational creatures instead of being restricted to this
world’s beasts."
493,,400,Xeno-Anthropologist,A Mage of Sorothustra,Lore,"Xeno-Psychology works best when it comes to individual
interactions or small group interactions, but Xeno-Anthropologist grants those who possess it
a similar level of skill when it comes to making sense of cultural mores, norms, and beliefs. You
also gain a considerable learning booster when it comes to learning history and lore, and a
small but noticeable luck boost when it comes to finding secrets, discovering the truth behind
mysteries, and finding lost artifacts. You are also practically prescient when it comes to cultures
you’ve studied extensively, able to predict what sorts of mass-scale actions they’ll make barring
something like unexpected natural disasters or unnatural foreign influence. This, of course, can
easily translate over and become a boost to your ability to manipulate state (or higher) level
actors."
494,,400,Student of the Supernatural,A Mage of Sorothustra,Lore,"Like all good Sorothustrans you spent your early years
receiving some sort of education. The education given to Sorothustrans is not a universal thing,
but the result of extensive tutoring, decades-long apprenticeships, and much individualized,
self-driven scholarship. You truly excelled in whatever education you received and now have an
inner repository of automatically updating knowledge regarding the supernatural that will always
let you know at least commonly known myths and legends, even in settings without actual
supernatural beings (exempting you and your cohorts, of course), and gives you even more
knowledge in settings where the supernatural concretely exists. You also have the equivalent of
a few years of training with any supernatural abilities you gain."
495,,400,Powered Prodigy,A Mage of Sorothustra,Lore,"You are a once-in-a-generation genius when it comes to learning
and mastering magic. This extends to the other schools of Sorothustran sorcery, but also to all
sorts of other schools of magic as well, allowing you to take and apply your magical perks from
other jumps to your Sorothustran magic and take these perks and apply them to other forms of
magic with ease. You are even capable of teaching others magic, though unless they are a
Sorothustran or otherwise possess an incredible amount of magical energy and an indomitable
will they will not match you in terms of your sheer scale. Still, you can teach them magic that is
as strong as their souls happen to be, and most lifeforms possess some level of magical energy."
496,,400,Let's See If I Still Got It,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Lore,"Psychic and magical violence is distressingly
common in Academy City, but most people don’t really know what they’re doing. You’re not like
them. A potent cocktail of experience, training, talent, and instincts make you a hell of a fighter.
Your actual powers aren’t any stronger, but you’re good at coming up with combat-effective
applications for them, no matter how useless they seem, and you’re effectively one tier stronger
than your powers imply. This applies to all powers you buy in this jump. If you haven’t purchased
any, you’re still a natural fighter, but you’ll have to find training and experience for yourself."
497,,400,Blessing of Athena,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Lore,"The blessings of wisdom come not just in
an improvement of your capacity to think, but also in an improvement in how you think. You gain
several boosts to your mental capacity, including a photographic and encyclopedic memory, as
well as large increases in processing power and speed. You also gain a boost in creativity and
lateral thinking, improving your ability to come up with inventive solutions for problems. Your
mental abilities are approaching those possessed by the Isu themselves, allowing for the
calculation and mental simulation of potential futures stretching out for decades, if not centuries.
If you're an Isu Hybrid, this blessing will boost the power of their Eagle Vision, pushing it to the realm
of Eagle Sense, which can allow them to determine the path an enemy will take or release a
pulse that grants them temporary perfect awareness of the contents of their surroundings."
498,,400,Crystallized Mind,Worm: Endbringer,Lore,"Your center of consciousness is not made up of the gray flesh
that humans possess, but rather an advanced crystalline substance that few could
match, and it certainly shows. With such processing power, such rapid speed of
thought, your mind would be the equivalent of a quantum supercomputer the size of
Europe. Figuring out new solutions in attoseconds, or having hundreds of trains of
thought is as easy to you as breathing is to a human."
499,,400,Ancient Tongue,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Lore,"Somehow, through an accident or fate, you encountered one of the ancient tongues of the world,
maybe the Celestial or Infernal, or something similar. This has changed you, and made you...
better, in certain ways.
First, you have a ridiculous aptitude for all languages, mortal, immortal, divine or demonic.
Simply by encountering them once you can learn how to read and speak the language flawlessly
and fluently, no matter if it’s just a dialect of a language you already speak or the language The
World Was Written In.
In addition, you become an absolute master of fuuinjutsu, capable of doing things with it even
the greatest master would gawk in awe at. This carries over to similar skills, anything to do with
inscriptions or runes like warding and enchanting or cursing in the future too. Not only do you
learn the skills reserved to mortals in such fields, but even the stuff of heavenly or hellish
libraries is not beyond you now."
500,,400,Brilliant Mind,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Lore,"You are a genius, in the true sense of the word. Your IQ is in excess of 200 and your mental
processes are optimized to where you have a truly perfect memory; unlimited storage, perfect
indexing, instant recall, fully retroactive, all the perks.
Furthermore, your intelligence is so boosted that you can easily detect any attempts at genjutsu
or other methods of tampering with your thoughts, memories, or perceptions, and can block
them with trivial effort. Simply put, you’re immune to any attacks that target your mind in any
way, shape or form. It doesn’t matter if they’re magical attacks, mind control or some
semi-mythical doujutsu technique, they bounce off of your mind without leaving any mark at all.
Also, if you didn’t have it already you now have perfect chakra control."
501,,400,Innovator,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Lore,"It’s a pain, isn’t it? Seeing all these people who just don’t seem to realize how much they can do
with their incredible powers. Well, that’s not something you need to worry about, at least. You
have an incredible imagination, coupled with a ridiculous degree of technical capability. You’re
able to come up with new uses for practically anything and everything you see, from jutsu to
seals. Whatever it is, you just seem to ‘know’ how to apply them in all sorts of clever, innovative
ways to achieve great results.
This is only a side-advantage though. Your real skill lies in playing around with the techniques
and abilities themselves. You have a ridiculously great ability to modify, break down and
recreate any and all techniques, be they Taijutsu, Genjutsu, Ninjutsu or even specific bloodline
applications. You don’t actually learn them any faster but once you have learned them your mind
unleashes a veritable flood of ideas for improving them, applying them in ways no one has ever
thought of, boosting their power or broadness though simple tricks, merging disparate
techniques, lifting principles and elements from one and applying them to the other, coming up
with new variants... and these are just a few examples of what you can do to them.
If it still needs to be said, this also massively advances your ability to come up with new tricks
and techniques, and lets you easily combo any already-compatible skills and abilities for
maximum synergy."
502,,400,Hakuda Mastery,Bleach,Lore,"With all the swords being swung around, it might not be surprising to see how limited in knowledge
many are with martial arts. Even the Hollows tend to abandon these skills, despite how brutally
effective they can be. You’ve gained a mastery of multiple such arts, leaving you equivalent in skill to
Yoruichi or Sui-Feng in the ways of beating the shit out of everyone with bare hands and feet. Your mastery of Hakuda makes you a deadly combatant, with a variety of techniques involved. From straightforward offense moves that increase your direct power to a variety of utility techniques for
enhanced mobility or endurance. Your martial arts are particularly suited for taking on multiple foes
at once, letting you largely negate the advantages by slipping between and playing them against
each other. You might not win a fight you otherwise couldn’t but it can let one Captain safely drag
out a battle with several other Captain or Vice-Captain level opponents. Lastly, as is rather needed
given the ubiquity of swords, you excel at working around armed opponents. Disarming them or just
using that unwieldy weapon to their disadvantage, you pretty much nullify the benefit they’d
normally claim from being armed while you are not. For Two Thousand Years- 400"
503,,400,This is My New Bankai,Bleach,Lore,"So many powers, so many forms. It’s rather common to find yourself suddenly using a new kind of blade mid-battle or to have taken on some monstrous new shape. There’s no better way to grow than conflict. The challenge just comes from not screwing up with these new powers you’re unfamiliar with. But if they’re all coming from your soul and potential, would it be that odd if you were already capable? Immediate adaption and adjustment to new abilities just happens for you. The sudden release of your Shikai is wielded with competent, though not masterful, hands despite it likely being a weapon you’ve never used before. A new spell just figured out is useful in combat, rather than needing hours more to learn the right timing. Even abilities copied from others are not unfamiliar. With a few moments to get a feel of things, you’re able to adapt with instinctual knowledge to use things relating to combat at a competent level. If these things happen to build on what you’ve already learned well, like a Bankai to your mastered Shikai or a new spell in the repertoire of a Kido Master, you’ll see this instinctual skill greatly increase. You still won’t know everything but you’ll be able to fight as an expert or even a master despite only just attaining this new level."
504,,400,Master of Biology,Naruto,Lore,"Say what you will about Orochimaru, you cannot deny his skill in the science of biology. Utilising near-modern technology, Orochimaru and later Kabuto were able to perfectly comprehend and even reproduce others’ abilities. With only a scrap of DNA, he was able to perfectly reproduce Kekkei Genkai, create artificial limbs and organs, and even create near identical clones of the original. You too possess this knowledge and skill able to rival that homicidal maniac in the biological sciences. With time and practise, all it will take is a single cell for you to unlock everything about a being."
505,,400,Jutsu,Naruto,Lore,"The world of Naruto contains a multitude of jutsu that can do just about anything from raising the dead to teleportation. While here, you’re guaranteed to encounter situations where you can learn some of these amazing feats, but this perk will ensure that you’ve got something special right out of the gate. You may learn any E-rank jutsu for free. For 50CP, you know a D-rank jutsu like the body flicker technique. For 100CP, you know a C-rank jutsu like Lee’s drunken fist technique. For 200CP, you know a B-rank jutsu like Kurenai’s tree-binding genjutsu. For 300CP, you know an A-rank jutsu like Chidori. And for 400CP you know an S-rank jutsu like the Hiraishin. 
If you purchase an advanced jutsu that is derived from another jutsu, you receive the parent jutsu and its variants for free provided that they are of equal or lesser rank/mastery to the purchased jutsu. For example, if you purchase Kirin, you gain Chidori for free along with Chidori variants like Chidori Stream and Chidori Katana. However, in order to purchase a jutsu, all prerequisites of that jutsu must be purchased first, such as purchasing the Eight Gates prior to purchasing Night Guy or purchasing Lightning nature before purchasing the Chidori. If you purchase a Hiden jutsu belonging to a clan, you may optionally choose to become a member of that clan as well as gain any additional clan-specific jutsu for free. 

You are also able to ‘over-purchase’ a technique in order to increase mastery. For example, instead of paying 50CP for the D-rank Body Flicker technique, you instead choose to pay 300CP to increase your mastery of the jutsu to Shisui’s level of proficiency. Alternatively, you can pay 400CP to gain speed surpassing even the Raikage. 

A jutsu with no associated rank can instead be purchased using mastery with D-rank equalling new Academy graduate levels of ability while S-rank equals Kage-level ability.

Over-purchasing an S-rank technique increases the price to 500CP, and turns it into an S+ rank technique. This provides total mastery of a jutsu and allows you to ignore certain detriments or requirements. For example, purchasing the One's Own Life Reincarnation technique for 500CP removes the lethal aspect of the jutsu, allowing you to use it without dying. 

If you have a specialization, you may discount any one jutsu within your specialization’s category. If you choose to discount a 50CP D-rank jutsu, you can get that jutsu for free. Those who have purchased the World’s Greatest Medic-nin perk can opt to receive all Medical Ninjutsu, Regeneration Techniques, and Reincarnation Ninjutsu used exclusively for healing for free to reflect their unique mastery. These techniques can be individually upgraded to S+ rank techniques for a cost of 100CP.

One discount per specialization."
506,,300,Careless Carrie and the Galette de Rois ,Ib,Lore,"A (literally) animated picture book depicting the cute and bloody tale of how a girl retrieved her lost key and opened the door. When the full tale is read aloud, the conclusion of the door being opened is applied to reality as well, so that if you are in front of a locked door, the door will inexplicably unlock itself. Be careful, though; the storybook’s haphazard coloring made it a little difficult transferring the effect into the reality. If the book is not read in the right way (you automatically know how), reality might glitch; do not attempt to glitch the world unless you feel really lucky.
"
507,,300,Crow ,Neverland: The RPG,Lore,"Like Peter himself, you are a clever mimic. Not only are you good at imitating voices, you can successfully mimic (and cast) vocal spells and powers you have heard. However, you can only memorize one spell to mimic at a time, and must rehear a spell you have forgotten in order to cast it once you’ve shifted to mimicking a different spell. Also, mimicking a spell costs (MP, energy, etc.) twice as much as it would if normally cast (even if the normal spell had no costs, the vocal mimicry will still get an extra cost attached).
"
508,,300,Magister Professor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"You were an apprentice once, taken in by the Magisters of your Order. While they taught you much of magic, it is through your own observations that you learned the art of teaching. You now have a grasp of everything a teacher in an academic setting needs - the construction of lesson plans, the ability to command respect and attention from your students, and the use of visual aids in the classroom. If you have an Apprentice of your own, they will be more than grateful to study under your wing. For another 200 Aethyric Humors in addition to the base price, you may notice a strange thing happening. Should you take someone under your wing who is neither of this world nor in possession of native aptitude for magic, your Wind might blow upon them so that they can learn more properly from you. Use this provision for the continued advancement of the magical arts wisely. Should you fail to impart upon your student the importance of controlling that power, you will have only yourself to blame.
"
509,,300,Magic Ring Identification ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Lore,"The land of Labrynna has an odd number of magical rings. One assumes that there is someone crafting all of these, but they’re nowhere to be seen. Under normal circumstances, you would need to take the rings to Vasu Jewelers in order to find out what they do, maybe get a curse or two neutralized, before you actually wear them. You on the other hand don’t need to do that, if only because Vasu himself trained you to be able to do so as well. Identifying unknown magic, curses, and spells of all sorts is now well within your talents. Just remember, rings do nothing unless worn.
"
510,,400,Master of Your Own Style,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"In the same way as Syura, during your travels,
you learned numerous different martial arts of various countries and incorporated all
of them into your own unique fighting style with the best aspects of each one of
them, becoming an extremely strong martial art master capable of matching a true
master of the Imperial Fist, and thus capable of similar physical feats, or even
surpassing one thanks to your style’s unpredictability and adaptability. Additionally,
you’re also extremely skilled in incorporating any other martial art you know or will
learn into your unique fighting style, allowing you to gradually perfect it more and
more."
511,,400,Master of the Imperial Fist,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"You’ve been rigorously trained in the temple
considered the best school of martial arts in the Empire and, as a result, you become
an extremely skilled practitioner of the Imperial Fist, essentially already having
achieved the rank of master. Through your mastery over this martial art, you’re
already able of feats such as dodging bullets by predicting their trajectories and
moving accordingly, stopping blades with your bare hands and even briefly
overpower a prominent hand-to-hand fighter who possess a strength-enhancing
Teigu, all of this without having a superhuman physiology and thus limited as a
regular human, so, if you had access to means to enhance yourself, you could reach
even further levels of strength. Additionally, you’re also pretty skilled when it comes
to teaching the Imperial Fist, as you could even make someone of average potential
to achieve the rank of master in less than a decade of training, a feat that normally
could take their entire lifetime to achieve."
512,,400,I Have Prep Time,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Lore,"Batman is undoubtedly one of the most infamous individuals in this world. He may be a
normal human, but his grasp of strategy makes him one of the most feared heroes.
Though it appears that he now has a worthy rival. You have the insane preparation skills
people think Batman has. Your preparation skills are nothing short of legendary,
allowing you to anticipate and plan for nearly any scenario. Identifying weaknesses,
devising contingencies, and creating comprehensive back-up plans are second nature
to you. Given enough time to prepare, you can turn the tide of virtually any battle,
outthink cunning adversaries, and activate dozens of backup plans. Of course just
remember that you still need a good understanding of your foes."
513,,400,Spirit Manipulator,Bleach,Lore,"In a world where spirit particles are the basis of reality and power, it should be no surprise that the
tools to manipulate those particles are most important. While the science to do with the soul itself
directly is beyond you yet, your specialty lies in creating tools that manipulate, expand or empower
souls and spirit particles. Gigai or objects to contain souls, the Tenshintai that allows rapid Bankai
unlocking even in rookie Shinigami, methods to fuse souls and physical objects together, Reiatsu
amplifiers and more are just the start. To look into Reishi itself, you know how to create artificial
senkaimon or dangai barriers, even weapons that focus and expel spiritual energy on their own. You
won’t be changing the nature of a soul or creating new ones from nothing but you are a master at
creating technology powered by spiritual energy or souls, as well as devices that can enhance or
control them. Much of this knowledge is already available to you but you have the talent to
continuously push it to greater heights, with the right resources. "
514,,400,Life Sciences,Bleach,Lore,"Some believe that each species is but a component of a greater whole, that hybrids who draw on multiple sources of power ascend to a higher dimension of existence. How true that is may be unclear but the concepts behind the mixing of the races pays worthy dividends. You’re well versed in the science of species, from simply biological knowledge to a wide variety of ways to combine or infuse their unique powers. The science behind the various methods involved as well as the technology to make it happen feels natural to you, allowing you to rapidly make progress in the field. You’re able to successfully cross-breed entirely separate species even despite biological incompatibilities. Adding the spiritual nature or make-up of a Hollow into a Shinigami, or vice versa, is a complicated but quite possible process. Analysing and understanding the unique abilities of a newly discovered race is simple, while you even have the potential to find ways to bind unique racial abilities into devices or consumable items. A pill to temporarily hollowify a Shinigami for anti-Quincy combat, perhaps? The potential of life is limitless, when you have such varieties of life to draw on. Countermeasure Development- 600"
515,,400,Combat Science,Bleach,Lore,"There’s a place for science outside of a lab, for those quick enough to put it to proper use. You’re
able to easily apply your knowledge and mental skills in combat to stunning effect, depending on
what exact scientific disciplines you focused on. Whatever you know, you’re able to figure out how
things work in relation to that and how to use that information to destroy. A Reiatsu specialist could analyse spiritual techniques mid combat, being able to dispel them with
their bare hands and own energy once they understand the technique. A doctor could do similar to
enemy bodies, finding the most vulnerable points and turning normal cuts into crippling injuries. A
psychologist could turn this to hostile mind’s, predicting every move an opponent makes after a
short period of study. Your knowledge becomes a weapon to wield. "
516,,400,Bringer of Life,Bleach,Lore,"The doctors of the Fourth Division can save even someone with truly horrendous injuries, if they get there in time. But you? As long as they had a pulse a few seconds earlier, you can bring them to fighting fitness. From Kirinji’s training, as Unohana’s apprentice or your own self study, you’ve reached a similar level of medical mastery. Your mixture of mundane medicine and comprehensive knowledge of healing Kido allows for you to effortlessly restore even the most mangled of forms. Both raw damage and a stunning variety of ill effects can be removed with your attention, as well as easily organising the transfer of Reiryoku to reinforce tired warriors. Your techniques will often rely on your personal Reiryoku to sustain, though you still possess inhuman skill with ordinary medicine to complement and make up for the absence of power. If you had quite the amount of power yourself, it wouldn’t be impossible to restore someone to healthyfitness immediately after you melted every scrap of flesh from their bones, over and over again. So long as it’s short of actual death, or at least swiftly after death, you might as well be able to heal anyone you can get your hands on."
517,,400,Black​ ​Knowledge​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Lore,"You know the basics of either the Lore of Chaos, Lore of Contamination, or the Lore of Violation. By the end of your time in this jump, you will have mastered this one bit Earthbound Lore without requiring a teacher or having to eat any Earthbound demons. In future jumps you will find more opportunities to seize and learn forbidden magic."

This ancient slate has the instructions to create a serum that will make its drinker younger. It’s surprisingly easy to read, though the inscribed hieroglyphics translate to chemical formulae instead of any words. Just remember that it deaged Silvermane into oblivion when he drank it (though he came back afterwards because it’s a comic book series. He showed up again in Daredevil #122.). If you make a zombie drink it, who knows what might happen?"

This site contains a wealth of information on some of the worst and most dangerous people in the world, the criminals who possess supernatural powers. Brief summaries of most of their powers, some knowledge on their history, personality and common tactics. It doesn’t reveal everything but even knowing this for some can be a leg up. Through this site, very high reward bounties are offered for these people, which can be an intensely lucrative trade if you have the power yourself. A similar website or at least shop will be available in future worlds, listing information and bounties on all the worst criminals in the world, focusing on the supernatural ones. "
522,,400,Passing Down the Teachings,The God of High School Jump,Lore,"A rugged little handbook you got here. It’s blank for now but that’s just because you’ve not gotten anyone to use it yet. This book is able to copy all of a martial artist’s knowledge on one style of fighting and encode it into the book. When someone reads the book, not only will they have access to all that knowledge but a little piece of the spirit of the teacher who imbued it there will appear to teach them what they need to know just as well as the master would have done themselves. You can put your own martial knowledge into this book if you like or find a Master willing to put their knowledge into this form for you. All that needs to be done is to place your hand, or the hand of another willing Master, and will it to be so, thus the knowledge will encode itself into the book. You can update that knowledge or overwrite it with a new style but it can only store one style at once."
523,,400,Fight On!,The God of High School Jump,Lore,"Losing a limb can be a fatal sentence for a Martial Artist. The innumerable problems such as lacking a limb and the permanent change in balance would retire all but the best Martial Artists and even those prodigal talents would find themselves severely hampered by that loss. Some learn how to deal with this loss and you’re the best among them. You are able to instantly adjust your fighting style to any sort of damage or loss of body part, never losing effectiveness until you are completely immobilised. Even having a single limb left would let you fight as if you had all four. Having all your arms and legs off might stop you...until a few seconds later when you figure how to fling yourself around with your hips and smash your foes to death with your head. And over time, you may even learn to turn these losses to an advantage, discovering ways to cut down on inefficiencies and strengthen your style after losing the crutches that others call limbs."
524,,400,Peerless Instructor,The Games We Play,Lore,"You are simply a very, very good teacher. You have a deep, wide grasp of techniques,
and know just how to teach anything you know to others. Under your tutelage,
people improve by leaps and bounds, shattering limits and defying expectations left

Simply put, you’re capable of imparting months and years’ worth of knowledge in
mere days and weeks, and that’s if you take things lightly. You also have an instinctive
understanding of just what the best way to teach anyone is, an idea of a person’s
potential, and most importantly, how to go about making them grow beyond it.
Under your care even the weakest sparks can grow into blazing infernos, so long as
you pay even the slightest attention."
525,,400,Seen Stranger Things,The Games We Play,Lore,"You’ve been around the block many, many times and naturally you’ve picked up a lot.
Sparring with other Hunters has gotten you used to searching for even the slightest
sign of an ability, because there are some strange fucking Semblances out there, and
the less said about the shit Grimm can get up to the better.

All this means you’ve a preternatural skill for ferreting out the details of someone’s
supernatural abilities, martial arts and other such things. Simply with a glance at
someone using their abilities you can tell the ins and outs of it, and with a bit of
studying you could probably spot things they themselves haven’t noticed.
This covers all aspects of whatever skills you observe, by the way. You can see the
weaknesses and room for improvement in the skills you’re observing, while at the
same time noticing what alternate uses it could be put to, how it could be really made
better, all at the same time."
526,,400,Rusted Knight,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Lore,"To think the former Vomit Boy could be a Hero from a literal Fairytale. This Perk gives you the kind of battle skills Jaune has developed during his time in the Ever After. In addition to that you are clever and brave, always knowing how to protect something or someone. You also have a remarkable resistance to poison."
527,,400,"Guts, Sweat, and Dedication",Final Fantasy X,Lore,"It takes years of practice to become truly great at something, and often that dedication can lead to a fair amount of tunnel vision. After all, when you become an expert in one field, you might end up walking into the pitfall of sacrificing your expertise in other fields.

Thankfully being aware of that, you can mitigate this risk somewhat. You can still train as intensively as you like, focused on a single aspect as much as you want, but at the same time, you’ll see other relevant skills to the one that you’re training return improvements as well. The more dedicated you are to training a single skill or aspect, the greater the improvement you’ll find to other skills. 

It’ll never reach the level of returns of what you gain from the skill you intended to train of course, but it will keep you from becoming a one trick pony."
528,,400,Call Me Master,Chainsaw Man,Lore,"When it comes to taking apprentices you’re simply unmatched. Any efforts to teach someone will go over much easier, especially if it’s related to combat and the methods are a bit brutal. People are safer and happier under your tutelage. After a training session ends, your students enter an enhanced period of reflection and recovery with a duration depending on how effective the session was. All studying, healing, and introspection will be multiplied in effect during this period. Your students will quickly learn to rely on you and come to appreciate your company, as well. Finally, when someone “graduates” your training and you’ve taught them enough to strike out on their own they gain a greatly weakened version of all your teaching perks, a pinch of plot armor, and a much easier time progressing onwards from there."
529,,400,Grail Grimoires,Fate/Stay Night,Lore,"A series of journals, notes, documents, books and other piles of paper have been delivered to you. This vast mass of information was the starting work of the Three Founders and Zelretch Kischur Schweinorg, the 4 Magi who created the Holy Grail and the accompanying system of war. Nowhere near the complete documentation of the build process, this trove of information still contains years of work that would propel anyone beyond any competition in recreating the Grail System if they had obtained the necessary abilities to even start and even if they lack those, the sheafs and sheafs of paper contain many hints and tricks to manipulate the Grail System as is, though you'd need a way to access the Grail first. "
530,,400,I Am the Bone of My Sword        ,Fate/Stay Night,Lore,"One thing. The very core of your being. Something to base your whole life around. For Shirou Emiya, it was Swords. For you? Perhaps something else. You'll find yourself innately understanding the idea you choose, even letting you understand other concepts a bit easier if you can frame it in the context of what you chose. More importantly, you're an absolute genius when it comes to magic based around this one thing. Shirou Emiya, an otherwise poor quality Magus, was able to use magic that approached the level of True Magic when relating to swords. It took him being in a rather unique situation, where usually it would still take years to achieve, but he did what would have been impossible for most Magi. You are on the same level with your chosen idea. When related to that idea, your magic will be many times stronger, many times easier to use and many times easier to learn or create, though the broader the concept is from 'Sword' the lesser the effect will be. Careful to not lose yourself in your own ideal."
531,,400,Trove of Knowledge        ,Elantris,Lore,"Every scholar needs a library just as every wizard needs a workshop. This small treasure in texts contains shelves and shelves of books, covering a wide range of topics. Some contain historical treaties of the world, while others contain scientific and political journals, but the most powerful tomes contain the details of AonDor itself! Granted, these aren’t instructional guides; they’re more like dictionaries written in a programming language. To the uninitiated, these books will be intimidating and information-dense. All that said, careful study will slowly uncover the worth locked in these pages. With a commitment of many months, or perhaps the Opening the Dor perk, one could use the titles within these walls to teach yourself the intricacies of AonDor.

By default, this space is contained within a cosy, weatherproofed basement attached to your domicile. In future jumps, this property may be imported normally. See the Notes section for additional details."
532,,400,Ozymandias,RWBY,Lore,"Ozpin might be the greatest human who ever lived. In no small part because of his LONG life. You could in many ways be considered a worthy rival to Ozpin as you have the same knack for recruiting influential people to your cause, all the while remaining secretive to the public at large. Why you could even with enough time redact and alter information available to the public. When you have the desire to change the world into a different manner you even have a greater learning speed regarding skills that let you do so. Finally... you receive the faintest capacity for magic. Nothing like a Maiden and very much atrophied but enough to amplify your speed and reflexed and to form energy barriers."
533,,400,Magic Stone Methodology,Final Fantasy IX,Lore,"Maybe methodology isn’t really the right word for this, but there are some folks out there who have studied into the art of learning things through rocks. Considering most of us learn things through books or experience, we decided that it had to be a methodology most magical.

Different stones will teach you different abilities, usually related to a corresponding element of some sort. With that said however, once you master this...”school”, you’ll be able to polish your skills to the point that you could make magic stones of your own! You’ll have moved onto teaching with rocks! But of course, others without your fundamental understanding of

Assisted Rock Learning will take a longer time in order to grasp these skills, and the more complex the skill is the longer it will take on top of that. From trial and error, we’ve figured out that skills which act passively tend to work best with this method. A stone really doesn’t help demonstrate complex casting and so forth."
534,,400,Savior of the Programming Department ,Knight’s and Magic,Lore,"Like out resident programmer you now have an incredible prowess in coding in a world where magic works like a programming language you are on your way to becoming an archmage. In a modern world, this allows you to remake an operating system in a single night even make one from scratch with the same time. In this magical world, this allows you to create and modify existing spells to your liking even reverse-engineer a spell to run into the magic system that you know even rewriting the Magius Engine is also possible. This also allows you to break an entire magic system like codes to remove the drawbacks and leave the nice one alone."
535,,400,True Anarchist's Cookbook,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Lore,"An ever-updating book that never seems to get any thicker, it has instructions on how to construct basically any bomb. It upgrades to knowing everything in the local jump. It’d even let you steal something like Bakuda from Worm’s explosive designs if you wanted to...even her...odd ones."
536,,400,Teaching Prodigy,Final Fantasy VIII,Lore,"You're one of the youngest, if not the youngest teacher at your school, and there's a very good reason for that. You're an amazing teaching genius, capable of getting even the densest student to learn something, and even get straight A's. There's almost nothing you can't teach, as long as it's knowledge based. Math, science, history, combat, magic, FTL space travel, as long as it simply relies on knowing your stuff, you've perfected a method of expressing it to your students. It's almost miraculous how you can improve a student's potential, even outstripping most restrictions caused by intelligence or injury, to impart knowledge and skill beyond what they would be capable of alone. This includes, of course, the ability to make schedules, plans, and demonstrations that will optimize the learning process."
537,,400,Literacy Magic        ,Bibliomania,Lore,"A powerful form of magic based entirely on books and words. Unlike Sealing magic which is focused on the written form and has an indirect and powerful application, this one is focused on a more direct approach of using books as a medium of magic or speech to cause effect. It takes a little preperation as the speaking method takes at least a sentence to invoke a spell while using a book would see you involve a passage to create an effect reflected in the book and as such typically works best with fiction, science and history books. Due to this magic this way is fairly draining but also capable of many great things. As an example this form of magic could when used with the right books even revive the dead. Using a book medium uses roughly 25% of the energy required for a speech-only version of this magic though the book method is more rigid and restricted to what's written. A normal human would only be able to endure 5 speech spells or 20 Book spells due to the energy consumption per day, though the strength of your body and souls enhance it."
538,,400,Informational Ozmosis,Bibliomania,Lore,"An incredibly powerful ability being that as long as you are within 5 meters of a source of information you can tag it with this power and start copying and absorbing all recorded information and understanding stored in the information medium at a rate 100 times your reading rate. This gives you not only complete memorization but understanding of the material to the level of the writer's understanding at minimum since you could possibly understand to higher levels. This effectively allows you to learn just by being near some source material and at an absurd rate. More interestingly since you would have complete knowledge you could recite verbatim from any point in the information source as easy as saying your own name. This has an interesting effect with supernatural books and as such when used on any supernatural book that has an effect, you won’t harm or affect the book but can gain all information and powers from them without negatives such as the powers of skill books without using them up, The spells Weiss has from Neir or all the magic and knowledge of Moloch without being possessed or freeing him from the book in Buffy The Vampire Slayer he’s sealed in."
539,,400,Ultimate Multitasking ,Final Fantasy VII,Lore,"Being an executive in a company or someone in a leadership position can be stressful, to put it mildly. Especially if you're trying to juggle things like an adventuring career or secretly spying on a group of interest on top of all your regular duties. At least for anyone who isn't you, that is. Your ability to split your attention between two or more simultaneous tasks reaches the realm of the improbable, letting you effortlessly remote control a drone on the other side of the world with your mind while carrying out the busy schedule of a corporate executive without any break in personality or actions each and every day. Certain high-stress events might make you slip up, but otherwise don't expect anyone to suspect you and that strange talking robot might actually be the same person."
540,,400,"Teach me, Master",Legends of Runeterra,Lore,"There are dozens of temples, monasteries and dojos scattered all around Ionia, and student-master relationships are extremely important. You will never have problems finding a teacher, and in fact it seems like they’re eager to guide you . You’ll also learn at an increased speed when under the guidance of a teacher, and you’ll be able to discern the secret of their techniques just by seeing them perform them once. Considering what powerful martial arts are present in Ionia, you better put the effort to search for the legendary masters of this land."
541,,400,League Material ,Legends of Runeterra,Lore,"You’re a legend, Jumper... or at least, you have a good start for becoming one. This Perk increases the effect of all other Perks you buy in this document and improves your race physical and magical abilities. Furthermore, it makes improving all your abilities and skills far faster, it protects you from freak accidents and random disasters that could stop you from reaching your full potential. It will not help against direct, malicious harm, but it will save you from simple misfortune."
542,,400,Rank Up! ,Fairy Fencer F,Lore,Not all Fairies are created equal and that’s a fact. Because of this they’ve been divided into specific Ranks. Higher Ranked Fairies are capable of more than lower Ranked. It’s just that simple. With this Perk you find it easier to advance in Ranks faster. This provides a Discount in the Fury Section when purchasing Fairy Ranks.
543,,400,Star of Altria,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Lore,"Swords must be honed to become truly sharp. Though you have all the potential to be a holy blade worthy of the Saber name, you’ve hardly been refined at all. Your inexperience shows in every skill, power and even Noble Phantasm. But fear not. Among Sabers, your potential is a shining star, developing at an astonishing rate. A few lessons from a proper Saber could get you most of the way there to maturity, similar to how a week learning from a master swordsman could take you from a beginner to an expert wielder of the blade. While it’s not as fast by far, you’re also able to manually develop your abilities and connected items like Noble Phantasms, slowly growing in power and versatility as you use them more and more. The better they get, the slower it’ll become. 

They might often be naive but that boundless idealism can be just as fetching as any worldliness. These Sabers tend to be on the younger side, not yet having completed their journeys, and they’ve still got a lot to learn. Eager to find any teachers to help them out."
544,,400,Impossible Capabilities,Honkai Impact 3rd,Lore,"Dr. MEI was supremely intelligent, and KEVIN Kaslana was one of the finest and strongest warriors in the world. The fact of the matter is that the Old World produced many great people. People that are incomparable in quality to the people of the current era. It appears that you seem to have inherited the best of all of the people of your era, as you are as intelligent as Dr. MEI, as good of a warrior as Kevin Kaslana, and have all of your capabilities at the peak of what the Old World could reach. Ah, but these are only raw attributes and talents, not skills, so you aren’t a supremely skilled warrior like KEVIN, only talented enough to reach his level in a decade or so. You also aren’t a supremely skilled scientist like Dr. MEI, you’re just intelligent enough to become one if you put a decade or so of effort into it."
545,,400,Book of Many Locations,God Of War (2018),Lore,"While having the appearance of an average notebook, in truth this book contains a list of several locations and where their general location is. These locations can be anything from natural wonders to ancient ruins, yet the book has enough paper to cover all of the locations which are not properly shielded from scrying. Furthermore each time you enter a new world, the book will provide a new section with new locations to visit."
546,,400,Excellence of a Prince,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Lore,"Your veins are filled with royal blood, and excellence is your birthright. How could you not live up to it? You learn incredibly quickly, now, able to bring a mundane skill to complete mastery in 7 months, and accomplish minor supernatural feats with such things too, such as a musician being able to pacify a whole forest with their song. With just this it’s unlikely you’d be able to take the skill further, for what possible way could you improve if you are already a little beyond the top? But still, with less than a year of unbroken and passionate study there will be very little you cannot accomplish. Of course, this doesn’t help when it comes to enlightenment (AKA character development), but who cares about the Heavenly palaces when you have a perfectly good kingdom down on earth, am I right?"
547,,400,"The Teach, But Actually This Time",DxD Universe,Lore,"You're a pretty awesome teacher now, being able to quickly make your students grow and unlock new talents that they didn't know they had, you can also unlock the mana from DxD into people who lack that."
548,,400,SPELLBOOK(Ashcroft),CthulhuTech,Lore,"Pick one of the following books. You get a copy of it. Each contains four appropriate rituals to study and four more in each future world that has rituals.
• Book of Dzyan - a book on occult symbology and history
• Book of Five Shadows - a book on summoning extradimensional creatures
• The Breath of R'lyeh - a book on Endless Ones and Old Ones
• The Roanoke Transcript - a book on the colony's disappearance
• The Mysteries Within - a book on the power of non-Euclidean dimensions"
549,,400,SPELLBOOK(Eldritch Society),CthulhuTech,Lore,"Pick one of the following books. You get a copy of it. Each contains four appropriate rituals to study and four more in each future world that has rituals.
• Book of Eibon - a book on the history of magic
• Cultes des Goules - a book on European ghoul cults
• De Vermiis Mysteriis - a book on middle eastern creatures and traditions
• Pnakotic Manuscripts - a book on the history of the Great Race and the Elder Race
• Unausprechlichen Kulten - a book on secret societies and cults"
550,,400,SUPPORT STAFF,CthulhuTech,Lore,"The Eldritch Society isn't just a bunch of Tagers that hunt Dhoanoids. Every murder of Tagers has a small support staff usually consisting of a sorcerer, a loremaster, an operator, and sometimes a trainer. With this perk, you get a large amount of skill at hacking, research, occult lore, and physical training."
551,,400,Pointing Fingers,Library of Ruina,Lore,"The Five Fingers are the peak of what a Syndicate can be. Each is a force of nature unto itself with every lesser Syndicate dreaming of joining one, as almost none could be hubristic enough to hope for more than incorporation. A reputation of such magnitude requires elites of suitable skill to uphold it, and you are undoubtedly worthy of being considered among their number. Like a Proxy of the Index you could consistently hit bullets out of the air with swordswings and execute those who let their guard down for even a second. Like a Capo of the Thumb you could juggle several different types of exotic ammunition without confusion, using each at the most tactically opportune time with uncanny accuracy even when blanketing your opponents in hails of lead. Your skills make you practically synonymous with the strength of entire organizations, particularly with your skills in negotiations, intimidation, and crafting whatever weapon your finger favors. Let all show you the respect you deserve."
552,,400,Office of Hopping,Library of Ruina,Lore,"Few Fixers work alone if they can help it. After all, other than the illustrious Colors each and every Fixer is tied to an Office, it would be foolish not to leverage the professional contacts that come with such an affiliation. Yet there is a problem, as even in the unlikely event your Office is filled with Fixers nearly as skilled as yourself - they’ll eventually have to be replaced with significantly less experienced newcomers. Luckily you have a way around this, finding it easier to train those under you to fulfill higher standards than they would otherwise reach. But this is not individualized mentoring alone, no you could train entire groups of newbie Fixers at once in a fraction of the time, even the most flatfooted among them absorbing enough in the way of combat techniques and principles of coordination to send them up a few Grades. Those to experience your training also find themselves acting more professional, regardless of how uncouth or reckless they may have been prior. However, keep in mind that your training works at its best if standardized, as the more varied the curriculum the more you’ll have to adjust for individual differences when you could instead be refining what you already have. "
553,,400,Mentor,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"A talent such as yours will need to be cultivated, and as such, you have often found that there are many that are willing to teach you. Of course, while your natural talent pushes well beyond their skill, you do manage to learn from their experience. You’re always able to find someone to teach you in a particular skill, even if it’s outside of your prodigious talents. The more common the skill (wood carving, magic in a medieval fantasy setting) the more likely you are to find a mentor that can teach you something. But the less common, the harder this task will be."
554,,400,Natural Mage,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"Magic comes naturally to you, as common as breathing. Due to this, efforts to understand, develop and teach new magical systems are several times easier for you. Whether it's the simplicities of black and white magic, or systems of magic you've never heard of, the principles resonate with you immediately."
555,,400,Mímisbrunnr,HighSchool DxD,Lore,"The famed left eye of Odin, capable of granting the user unparalleled insight of all kinds of magic. Even the ones from foreign or exclusive magic systems aren’t exempt from the insight granted by this artifact. Comes from a well located beneath one of three roots of the world tree Yggdrasil, containing so much wisdom, even Odin himself couldn’t just take a sip without losing something first. A must-have if you’re planning to become a master of the arcane arts."
556,,400,Endless Night Party,HighSchool DxD,Lore,"It’s finally your turn, your time to shine on the bright stage of the world. The wind is beginning to shift towards a new era. Never too late, as one can’t be expected to rely on old relics or the innate power of old bloodlines or Sacred Gears to do everything. You have become a formless master, a student warrior with a staunch body and spirit. To put it in other ways, you’re a genius, almost a savant when it comes to picking up fighting styles and mastering them with a little focus and time. Techniques are your game, where each practice, each fight, each hardship or even defeat does nothing but honing yourself even further and getting you closer to a perfected technique. Of course, this not only makes you the king of growth and turnaround in fighting, but in anything that can be said to be methodical or technique-based at its core."
557,,400,Guiding Light,Final Fantasy III,Lore,"The light of courage, kindness, affection, determination. These are how the heroes of this land are described. You are a mentor to heroes, able to guide them in such a way as to nurture their greatest traits. A student under you would find their positive personality traits growing stronger, their negative ones growing weaker, and will in general improve themselves at a quicker pace."
558,,400,Lord El-Melloi’s Protegee,Fate/Strange Fake,Lore,"Along the history of the Clock Tower, there have been few emerging forces as disruptive as the one that the classroom that Waver Velvet took over after his return to the Clock Tower under the El-Melloi name. Whether you were part of this class, or received an equally excellent tutelage in your young years, it’s up to you. What matters is what you received from his teachings: whatever you had before, it was simply incomplete. It wasn’t until you received that tutelage that you were able to reach your true potential. Whatever mystical abilities you have gained in this jump, are now increased in some way. Perhaps this schooling helped you to drastically increase your energy efficiency, or perhaps you discovered a powerful hidden ability from your powerset.

Not only that, but your schooling years also left you on friendly terms with several of equally bright young magi. As part of the Lord El-Melloi’s classroom, you have powerful
contacts and allies all around the world, which you can always call from some favor (and that also includes your own teacher). In future worlds, you may also share similar amicable connections with similar young rising stars from that world.

Also, thanks to having been part of the Modern Magecraft department during your schooling years, you also seem to have a way more informed view of technology than most magi, as well as some talent in mixing magecraft and modern technology."
559,,400,The Final Roster,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Lore,"You can not plan your next step, or look forward to the next fight if you don’t know who is it that is fighting. This Scroll may solve such a mystery for you from now on. Just by looking into this Scroll and applying it to a Battle or Tournament you may find out the names or everyone who is fighting. For an additional 200 CP you even gain a summary of their abilities. No matter the version the Scroll will always cover every combatant from every side."
560,,400,Bargaining Books,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Lore,"A collection of books bound in red leather emblazoned with a pentagram on the spine and a unique image on the cover. Comes in an ebony chest with iron decorations and lock. While the chest is always cold to the touch, the books are warm.

Each book contains forbidden knowledge, as well as a bargain to be made. By reading one of the books you will receive its blessing, as well as a mark on a part of your body you can easily see. The blessing conferred by the book will grant you a boon, at a cost. With a few seconds of reading you can determine the exact trade that you will be making without accepting the trade. These boons and costs can affect almost anything about you, and will generally have a stronger boon than its cost. The costs will always be relevant and commensurate to the boon offered to you. Over the next few days the mark will fade, as will knowledge contained within the books. The blessing, however, will only fade once the knowledge and mark have completely disappeared.

It takes around seven minutes to read one of the books completely. The mark you receive will match the image on the cover of the book. The books within the chest periodically change, with undesired books rotating out. You can only receive the benefits of three books before the newest blessing, knowledge, and mark overwrites the oldest.

Of the books there is one unique book, the only one that seems to have been written by another hand, emblazoned with a flame on the cover. This book will improve your elemental abilities, without any kind of downside."
561,,400,A Little Goes A Long Way ,Final Fantasy I,Lore,"Alright, so maybe you spread yourself a little bit thin with your wide variety of skills and powers. That’s no problem, you just know how to make the most of it! You now have an instinctive knowledge of your capabilities and limitations, and how to use your abilities to their best effect in a given situation. It won’t guarantee success, but it will guarantee efficiency in whatever you have available. It also helpfully reminds you of some simple solutions you may have forgotten about, such a spell that easily fixes your current predicament that you just hadn’t considered using. This only works if you have such skills or powers available in the first place, of course - and sometimes the most efficient solution isn’t necessarily the best one."
562,,400,Sorcerer’s Library,Disney’s Aladdin,Lore,"A sorcerer’s power means precious little without the knowledge to go with it. Which is why this is a tremendous advantage

You have a truly vast library to learn from, Jumper. It holds books, scrolls, clay tablets and whatever about a huge, immense variety of magic styles, thousands upon thousands of spells and rituals, some of them among the rarest in the world,and who knows what else.

Nor is magic the only thing covered. History, Philosophy, fiction, potions recipes and artefact designs... if a text has at least two copies in the world, odds are, there’s a third here. It’s enough to make you one of the absolute most skilled and knowledgeable sorcerers in the world, let’s just say.

It updates with an equivalent level of knowledge in all future worlds you go to."
563,,400,Gaze Upon The Primeval Current,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Lore,"Many who have gazed upon the Primeval Current have lost their sanity in return for the arcane insight they have gained. Such a thing would ordinarily happen to even the most educated of scholars, but there is something different about you. Once per Jump, when you gaze into the sky above and catch a glimpse of the Current and learn a potent spell on par with Comet Azur or Stars of Ruin."
564,,400,Magical Codex,The Road to El Dorado,Lore,"Well now, I’m sure Tzekel-Kan would be very interested as to how you got your hands on this. In his many religious pursuits and studies, along with that of his forebears, this codex has been compiled over countless generations. While it appears to simply be a collection of clay tiles, this codex contains powerful magic rituals capable of shifting the fate of El Dorado, all approved by the gods of course."
565,,400,Lost Library   ,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Lore,"Ivan the Terrible had a surprising interest in literature and knowledge. Containing long gone philosophies, magic grimoires and other thought provoking articles, he would no doubt rage about the intellectuals of later times misplacing these archives, rendering them lost to time. But for an enthusiastic connoisseur of magic and art like yourself this library must have been made for right? You gain a perfect copy of the library as it was in its prime, holding knowledge from all over the world within and updating with matching grimoires, tomes, documentaries and any other sort of literary record for every Jump you visit. Furthermore it doubles as a workshop, nay a Temple, for those who wish to further hone their mystical arts."
566,,400,Innovation,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Lore,"​Magic is not a new phenomenon. It has been around for ages, and contrary
to what you might tend to believe, its users are not idiots, any more than normal people are. But
for all that, it still doesn’t measure up to you! You’re able to come up with several innovations
and ideas when presented with any magical field of study, no matter how well-studied or
researched it might already be.
And these are not just low key, barely noticeable changes, either. Unless you want to focus on
the small stuff, you’re capable of sudden insights and ideas that can dramatically change the way
the field is studied, discover unbelievable new uses for ordinary spells or potions, come up with
entirely unique tricks... anything is possible."
567,,400,Magick Moste Evile,Wizarding World,Lore,"Magic holds many secrets and there are those who would say that there are some secrets that are so dark that they should never again see the light of day. You are not one of those fools. Instead, you have chosen to delve deep into the mystic arts, to tread into depths that so very few have borne witness to, let alone mastered them.

Written by Godelot, a former wielder of the Elder Wand, Magick Moste Evile is, as the name suggests, a tome detailing all the wonders and power that the Dark Arts can grant to someone like you. Such a treasure trove is already quite invaluable on its own, but the book has one more special property to it. Infused with some ethereal form of dark magic, the book has a way of taking in information from the world around it. And every so often, the book shall be rewritten with new spells, rituals and potions making their way inside for every new world you find yourself within."
568,,400,Conjuration Spellcrafts,Wizarding World,Lore,"Conjuration is an interesting branch of magic and a very useful one. After all, there are many uses to being able to conjure up objects from little more than thin air. But it is also one of the most complex and difficult branches of magic out there. And such difficulty only grows the more complex and the magical the things you choose to conjure become. Which is why you’ve taken steps to alleviate that difficulty with spellcrafts.

What are spellcrafts, you ask? It would be best to think of them as something similar to recipes. Combined with moonstone, a special type of crystallized stone that glows much like the full moon, spellcrafts can allow even a novice in the mystic arts to conjure truly wondrous things.

For now, you have spellcrafts that will allow you and other magical folks to conjure up simple but entirely non-magical things. If you wish to change this fact, the book you will receive alongside your new recipes shall help you along. This book details how you can create new spellcrafts. But be warned. Like conjuration itself, the creation of new spellcrafts can and will be an arduous task, especially if you wish to have any hope of recreating the greatest works of wizards and witches."
569,,400,Book of Potions,Wizarding World,Lore,"As a rule, young students tend not to see the appeal of potions. After all, when you can create fire with a wave of your wand and make objects float with but a word, something like potions can seem a bit... boring. But for those who can appreciate its subtle science, its exact art, potions can be the key to bottling fame, brewing glory, and far, far more.

Written by the famed Potioneer Zygmunt Budge, this book is perfect for anyone willing to delve into the great art of potions. And as most things are in this world, this book is far more than it appears to be. Through methods unknown, to assure his place in history, a part of Zygmunt Budge’s soul has been infused into this book. But you do not need to fear him. Zygmunt wants only to spread the glory of potions everywhere and you represent his best shot at it.

Not only is the book filled with recipes of just about every potion that was ever made public, you will have the guidance of Zygmunt himself who will gladly guide and instruct on the best ways to brew a proper potion. And in other worlds, if you ever come across an unfamiliar potion, the guidance of Zygmunt shall be enough to help you decipher.

Strangely, there seems to be pages haphazardly placed within the book. If you ask Zygmunt, you’ll find him to be unaware of it entirely. But it seems to be a cipher of some sort. To what you do not know. The only thing translated so far are the words All Potential written atop each and every single one of the strange pages."
570,,400,Wizard’s Field Guide,Wizarding World,Lore,"The witches and wizards in this world live and breathe magic. They carry with them years, even decades of experience in the mystic arts. If you’re going to be dropping into this wide and dangerous world, you’re going to want quite an ace up your sleeves, especially if you want to do more than just keep up with the folks around here. Enter the Wizard’s Field Guide. Devised by the Ministry of Magic, the Wizard’s Field Guide is the perfect tool for any witch or wizard seeking to grow their potential and witness them realized. Enchanted with all manners of spells and charms, the Field Guide first and foremost serves as a repository of all the knowledge you’ve ever accumulated. So long as you know it, you can find it in the book. 

Second of all, the book will, every so often, provide you with a list of tasks for it to do. By accomplishing these tasks, you will be gifted with a modest boost to your capabilities. It may not be the largest of training enhancements out there but with it, it should be enough for even a late student to catch up to their peers. And finally, it is time to move on to perhaps the most intriguing part of the book. By casting the Revelio, you may occasionally find pages flying in the sky or floating in front of certain places and things. Take these pages and you will find quite a bit of information about them. And for every page you collect, you’ll receive a small and miniscule boost to your magical capabilities."
571,,400,Yet Another Half-Blood Prince,Wizarding World,Lore,"The pure-bloods live and breathe magic but sometimes, it takes an outsider to see what else can be done. Or perhaps in your case, merely someone who has a foot in both worlds. Whether it be magical or mundane, you have a natural talent for discovering or implementing new shortcuts or innovations into them. You could discover shortcuts for making potions, better ways to cast spells, or, in terms of craftsmanship, realize the potential of materials gone unnoticed by many. 

With this, you could certainly make a fine name for yourself. And if you’re willing, perhaps the world can be made far better with the secrets and innovations you can discover. Don’t be stingy like the original Half-Blood Prince."
572,,400,Master of the Art,Wizarding World,Lore,"With age comes experience and with experience comes wisdom. You may or may not have noticed it before, but many of the foremost experts in their craft have been academics, seeking to expand young minds with the knowledge they possess. Just look at Hogwarts for example. Many of their teachers have been heralded as some of the finest witches and wizards of their day. And while you may not be a Hogwarts teacher, you are certainly one of the best in your chosen field.

You have five options to choose from. If you know your books well, you’ll recognize these options to be the five subjects most desired by those seeking to become Aurors. By choosing one of these subjects, you will possess not only a prodigious affinity for said subject but your knowledge and experience with the matter will be heavily enhanced. Even if you were nothing more than simple student at the start, your knowledge in the subject will now be so broad and expansive that none can deny your mastery.

So long as it is tangentially related to your chosen subject, you have, at bare minimum, an expert’s knowledge on it. This doesn’t even tie into your magical skills with said subject. If you chose potions for example, the efficiency of your potions is magnified to such an extent that even Severus Snape would be impressed. If you choose one of the more magical subjects, spells of that nature will be a magnitude greater, and you’ll be heaps more knowledgeable on how to use it in a duel.

You have the ability to split your mind in twain to concentrate on more than one thing at a time. In the beginning you would be limited to dividing your mind into 10 different streams of thought, each of which has the full processing power of your entire mind. Given time however, something on the scale of decades, you will be able to split your mind exponentially more, giving you enough subdivisions to run the world, control an army, and a police force of millions of separate robot suits all the while manipulating global politics. Given even more time, who knows how far you could take this."

And others yet still find other methods, making pacts with dark beings or taking extreme risks to gain power now.

This method takes the form of a ritual in which the one seeking power speaks ancient words of power and drinks the still-burning blood of a dragon.

Gaining several hundred pounds of muscle mass and several feet of height, their skin turns as black as night and their eyes glow red like burning coals.

When you pick up a weapon, you become infused with its power. In addition to automatically gaining skill based on what you wield, you will gain power.

More than mere magical skill and talent, though, this grants you the ability to keep your magic powers working while under the pressure of combat. It is not grant works of arcane ritual that you excel at, instead you are an expert at the quick and dirty invocations and spells that can be thrown around in the few instants of combat.

Your true ability is to combine existing magic systems into one magic system  that you can access that has all advantages of the magic systems that you know and discarding their weaknesses and this process is automatic and also applies to your various energy pools that you have.

What you may lack in power compared to a Murim warrior, you can more than make up for in sheer versatility.

So much bad news they had to kill him at least twice to make it stick, his books on necromancy are still considered the definitive primer for anyone who really wants to get their head chopped off by the Wardens. You've now come by his three-volume primer, which contains more than enough real necromancy to make you into a seriously scary customer. It doesn't include his fourth book, which had a much more limited printing, but if you study real hard you might be able to join the race for it in a year or two."
608,,400,Taking Advantage ,Dark Souls 2,Lore,"“You’ve stepped foot in one of the most dangerous places in this world when you came to Drangleic and its surrounding lands. If you wish to survive long, you’re going to have to wizen up and properly prepare for the threat you’ll inevitably face. Whatever foe you encounter, whatever enemy you face, you can read them like an open book. For you it’s easy to pick up on the quirks, capabilities, limitations and, most importantly, weaknesses. Not just easy, but natural as breathing. As you continue to study your enemies, you gain a clearer picture on how you can fight them with the skills, abilities and means you have available. How to crush weak but tedious faceless threats, how to compensate for those greater in skill or power than yourself, it will all come in time.”"

Much like the Memory of Ashina, these are memetic recreations ranging from easiest to hardest that you can access in your sleep. These memories specifically train your versatility, adaptiveness, stealth, resourcefulness, and mastery of all your techniques and tools. These training memories will strips you to only your Body Mod, but you’re guaranteed to improve greatly after each session.

611,,400,Shadow Style,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Lore,"There was a shinobi who once asked, “Why do we need to know swordsmanship if we’ll never fight anyone directly?” That shinobi is now dead. It was a violent one. While not as potent as the Ashina school of swordsmanship, the Shadow Style of the ninja serves them well whenever a ninja must directly confront a foe. It primarily focuses on unbalancing the enemy and breaking through their guard, usually by parrying and countering their attacks. Because of this, it could be seen as a primarily defensive combat style intended more for duels rather than war. You are now the master of such a style, able to ascertain the weaknesses of your foe’s stance and how to best exploit it by creating window of opportunities for “Deathblows”. Deathblows are the decisive single strike that put an end to your opponent."

Your capacity to improve on spells and innovate on existing magical theory is phenomenal, such that if your talent was proven and displayed your work could earn you the tittle of conspectus-first and greatest of a whole new school of sorcery. With the resources and knowledge base of an academy, within a few days you could innovate on barrier magic to heights those in this world would deem impossible-even deflecting the magical projectiles of divine beings. It’s such a shame that far-fetched talents such as your breed scepticism in many."

In your diligence and your faith, you find yourself capable of wringing out advancements and might beyond what you think are your limits. A noble knight dedicated to the general he idolises could master and recreate his gravity magics-even if that general is separated from him by the gulf of demigodhood. Even if it is a concept you devote yourself to rather than a person all skill, abilities and competencies you train yourself in advance in leaps and bounds beyond all but the greatest legends of this world to emulate it-and in a battle directly opposed to it, your prowess will drive you on where lesser men succumb to lack of focus or exhaustion.

This determination has greatly influenced your history in this world, enhancing your experiences and skillset. Like the Redmane Knight Ogha, you too may have studied gravity magic in emulation of Radahn’s fearsome prowess.

614,,400,Coveted Jewel,MtG - Ixalan,Lore,"A powerful artifact, created as a source of mana for the construction of Orazca. It acts as a small archive of a number of the spells and construction techniques used for the creation of crystalline mana amplifiers, and studying it is likely to get you a great amount of insight - what’s more, it in itself can amplify the mana ambient to a land to much greater than its usual output, though as a consequence, this disruption and surge of mana is easily felt by any magic users who are within the lands being tapped into for power - the jewel has often changed hands due to this, though with proper vigilance, one could easily hold onto it and wield its power with impunity - surely, nothing could challenge your might. "
615,,400,Folio Of Fancies,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"Story and song are vital to the spirit of the Realm and Eldraine - from tales of noble knights to campfire tales of grisly demise to the simple sonnets of young love, these shape the paths of those who walk the Realm, giving them guidance. However, stories are etched into the very soul of the world - animals performing fables, fae enacting courtly romance even far from castles. This book not only contains a set of the stories only Chulane could amass, but as you travel will ‘read’ the world’s heart and communicate its legends and tales to you in a flavorful manner, befitting a tome of Eldraine - allowing you to understand the magic and mystery of the world around you."

Curse-breaking, returning transformed people and creatures to their former selves, and undoing fae contracts and oaths are your specialty, allowing you to ascertain uncomfortably permanent magical detriments and undo them...though it isn’t always simple or easy. Some are as complex and involved as members of certain family lines feeding one another peaches while an old lullaby is sung, or some are even potentially lethal cures.

As a knight of Vantress, you are well acquainted with Eldraine, it’s history, its secrets, and the various facets of its life both in the Wilds and the realm...and your capabilities of both researching and winning battles of wits are remarkable."
618,,400,Adapted To Change,MtG - Zendikar,Lore,"The academic in you will not allow any less than total understanding of any magic that you use; understanding of the mechanics and components being as important to you as the ability to cast the spells. This, along with some mental gymnastics, has given you the rather useful skill to invert said magics in a similar manner to the creation of Roilmages by Noyan Dar. This process involves identifying the mechanics by which a spell or system works, and then doing the opposite: ritually breaking something would need to be replaced with repair, lighting a candle with extinguishing one etc. The new inverted spell will do the opposite of the base spell. Healing spells would cause rot or disease, a fire spell would rapidly cool the area, and a ritual to summon a demon could be inverted to banish it. Do note that constructive purposes are generally harder to achieve than destructive ones, and will take far greater investment to achieve. "
619,,400,Wizard Councillor ,MtG - Homelands,Lore,"The Wizard's Council is an advisory board made of the eight most powerful mages on the Island, usually the teachers and residing masters. The ninth member of the council is the Wizard Savant, who maintains absolute final say on any matter, though they are obligated to listen to any argument from the Council and may be challenged for the title.

While you’d have to challenge the current Savant yourself if you want that position, you certainly have the skills of a proper councilmember. You are a master of manipulation and subterfuge, along with well-practised skill in sorcery, wizardry, research, astronomy, alchemy, and the other magical arts. Your magic allows you control over the wind and the waters of the Homelands, and lets you study the aether beyond the bounds of the world.

If bought along with the Artificer perk, you may combine your skills in magic and artifice to call forth mana and shape it into temporary artifacts. Fully composed of mana, these artifacts only exist for as long as you keep the magic up, but can be invaluable in battle and when you otherwise don’t have the time or inclination to create a permanent artifact."
620,,400,The So Called “Clan Umezawa”,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"Deep in the undercity of Towashi and the spires of Otawara there are rumors. People who whisper about entire groups of Ninja that may or may not frequent a specific place, not just the ones and twos that may or may not be on contract to a greedy crime boss or a less than moral researcher. Though they do not know it, they are right. You are now the inheritor to a small clan of ninja, probably no more than a hundred people all together, and only a fraction of those being fully trained as compared to mildly competent servants. The real treasure is the estate itself, a well hidden manor home that can comfortably house the clans current numbers several times over, and the generations of scrolls and manuals detailing not only ninjutsu techniques, but the most efficient ways to teach them… and the most efficient ways to gain or force the loyalty of those you might consider teaching."
621,,400,The Way Of The Knife,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"Allow me to tell you a truth of the universe - there is never just one ninja, and if you think you have found them all you probably haven’t. Such is their signature ability of ninjutsu, a series of smaller techniques that they use to disguise themselves, hide all trace of their passage, reduce their own presence until even Kyodai themself would have trouble sending them, and otherwise be a pain in the ass to anyone who wants to find them. It’s ironic then, that the Ninja’s greatest power lies in breaking this concealment, because when properly added together these spells can be used as the building blocks to others - perhaps the broken forms and “waste” mana from your disguise will allow you to temporarily steal some life energy from your foes, or if you were skilled enough you could even summon a duplicate of one of your allies for a brief moment. "
622,,400,Yet Another Holding Action,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"The world is dividing itself and drawing hard lines in the sand, the Emperor is missing and has been for over a decade, and unknown forces lurk in the background just waiting to take a bite out of Kamigawa. And yet, for all that the plane is slowly falling apart at the seams, well, it’s falling apart slowly rather than quickly. You have everything a ruler would want in a regent, an understanding of politics that surpassed dozens of other advisors, the skill and talent to forge and force alliances into being and then hold them accountable for their breaks of faith, and even a level of skill at magic born from dabbling in various arts- nothing outright dangerous, but you can make yourself very irritating in a fight if you need to. The schools of magic you likely have access to are many and varied, but something like enhancing the Samurai likely to be guarding you, copying the spells of empowerment they would use on themselves, or simply being able to heal both yourself and them would all be excellent techniques to learn, though you are not limited to just those things."
623,,400,Gauging Pressure,MtG - Kamigawa,Lore,"Patience like the Clam Sea that eroded the mighty cliffs is something you embody. You could take five to ten years observing the same person to learn their habits and never once feel the grating sensation of impatience. In addition to this immunity to the mundane foe known as boredom you can, with repeated battles, learn more and more about a foe simply by being in close contact, the foe need not think of you as an enemy for this to work on them."
624,,400,Geralf’s notes,MtG - Innistrad,Lore,"Everything from the most basic of Skaabs to Mindcrushers, and even Grimgrin himself. Detailed notes on the creation of each and every one of Geralf’s creations."
625,,400,Arcane Encyclopedia,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"This is a curious book, it appears to contain ancient knowledge. It contains a treasure trove of information, strangely enough related to the schools of magic that you specialize in. From the appearance of it, the books seems to come from a time before the Mending and has been penned by a millenia old Planeswalker who practiced magic similar to your own. This could greatly accelerate your learning from what is penned within. Remember, knowledge itself is neither good nor evil. Just as the wrong book in the wrong hands could doom all existence, the same book in the right hands could save it."
626,,400,Secret Hunter ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"The Planes contain secrets harder to uncover than those found in the deepest ocean. There are many such things hidden away in myth, rumors, legends. Artifacts of great power, long lost spells, bits of history lost to knowing minds possibly forever. This is unacceptable. You are a seeker of such secrets, and an experienced one at that. You can discern truth from legend, find out what rumors hold merit or are mere folktale when you hear or read them. Once you know about such gaps in knowledge, you can be sure you won’t lose the lead you have once you start pursuing it. You may not be up to the trials involved with finding such secrets but you will never be at a loss for what to do next. However, you are not merely good at finding, you are also lucky when it comes to stumbling into rumors and legends of interest to you."
627,,400,Great Teacher ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"Knowledge that you hoard for yourself is valuable, knowledge that you share is priceless. You possess all the qualities of a great teacher. It is difficult to understand the level of complexity a student can handle at any one time. You are skilled at conveying information to others as well, it would be easy to explain advanced intellectual concepts through charades without saying a word. It would not be difficult to write a book concisely summarising your ideas and publish such a thesis for others to read, after which it leads talented students to you. With these skills it would be easy to start a magical college of your own, from which you can gather power and allies as scholars and wizards bring knowledge to you. This is especially true to those you teach directly under a direct apprenticeship as such individuals would learn three times as fast from you and will even come to respect you greatly despite any eccentricities."
628,,400,Research Notes,Warbreaker,Lore,"Absolutely everything ever written about Awakening in generations of exploration and research, from Vo’s widow, to the Five Scholars to more contemporary works. Scathing footnotes applied to old misconceptions. In future Jumps, this updates to include the local magic system, if one exists."
629,,400,Experience,Warbreaker,Lore,"A Returned is ageless, and you didn’t Return recently. You have a century of lived experience waiting when you insert. Choose a craft, skill or art and you will receive memories of years or decades, however long you chose, dedicating yourself to it’s practice. This may be applied to multiple fields, of course. In each future Jump, you receive the same boon when inserting."
630,,400,Well of Memory ,Warbreaker,Lore,"It turns out, you remember everything. Your memory and consciousness cannot be altered or tampered with by any means. A perfect memory just happens to come as a side benefit."
631,,400,Creativity,Warbreaker,Lore,"If you stick your Breath in your belt, or shoe, only a couple of the highest heightened Awakeners could know. If you give someone a lot of Breath, they’ll jerk about and go into a trance for a few moments, perfect time for stabbing, Lifeless animals make fine scouts or messengers. These and other tricks seem really obvious in hindsight, you’re just that good at devising creative, lateral thinking uses and tricks for any powers or skills you may have."
632,,400,Will Of The Jumper,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"This is a version of a very powerful spell created by three Elders of the Irish Sanctuary to protect the Book of Names. This spell prevented anyone from approaching the book by a very simple means; the closer you were to getting it, the less you wanted it. Ordinarily, this spell was tied to the lives of the Elders, but this version has been retrofitted to get the same power when only bound to your own life. By placing this spell over an item, you ensure no one will be able to take it as the closer they get to it, the less they desire it. Not ‘closer’ as in physically closer, but ‘closer’ as in ‘closer to obtaining it’. This protection can be placed over more than one item, but the more items you place it on, the less effective it becomes. You can also choose to bind the protection to the life of another person. Unlike the Elders’ version, you are immune to its effects, so you will always be able to access the items you have protected."
633,,400,Library of Sorrow,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"China Sorrows is many things, but above all else, she is a collector of all things magical. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her library, a home to many lost and obscure magical tomes. Now, it seems you have come to possess a library of your own, equally massive and chock full of rare, obscure, and lost magical knowledge. In future Jumps, this library will update and expand to encompass the vast majority of that world’s historical magical knowledge, barring tomes that are one-of-a-kind. You’ll need to get those yourself."
634,,400,Prodigy ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"Damn, what are you? With this perk, you have become a prodigy, able to learn various martial arts and other mundane skills terrifyingly quickly. You are now equal to Valkyrie Cain in terms of your learning rate, able to go from a total novice to being able to beat a room of fairly trained full grown men in less than a year. This applies to all skills that don’t have to do with magic (Consider this a mundane version of Second Coming in terms of growth rate boosts)."
635,,400,Second Coming,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"Lord Vile to Necromancy, Mevolent to Elemental magic, China Sorrows to Signum Linguistics, you to your discipline. Every once in a while there comes a person that changes everything about what others thought about that discipline either through their great control or the abilities they manifested that no one knew existed. Now, you are one of them, whether your specialty is Elemental, Necromancy, Signum Linguistics, or one of the many other types of magic offered here. What this does is increase the speed at which you learn your discipline. What would normally take a sorcerer decades to create takes you mere months. Where one one sorcerer would take eleven months of constant torture in a barren dimension in order to advance and create new and improved moves, you can achieve similar results without trying in a year or five months with actual effort. (If you manage to get access to more than one magic this applies to them as well and you don’t have to buy it again)."
636,,400,Book of The Pagan Heroes,Campione,Lore,"One of the few Grimoires written by human hands and that possess written spells and magic inside. It contains spells strong enough to harm Gods and Campiones, although mastering them may take a while. It was based in the myths and records of several god-slaying beings in pagan religions."
637,,400,Slipping Chains,Campione,Lore,"The greatest power in this world have conditions to their use. Anything from standing in sunlight to being at death’s door to fight back depending on which Authority you hold. Often times just setting things up to begin fighting could leave you dead on the ground if everything doesn’t line up just right. In your case the chains that bind have been coated in grease. Sunlight could be replaced by electronic lights in great enough quantity, or perhaps a ludicrously sized fireball. Defending a fair maiden could become defending anyone, and one the verge of death could become grievously wounded. The core idea remains the same, but achieving them becomes far easier. You’ll find this slippery nature applying to any conditional otherworldly abilities you come to possess, should you have them at all."
638,,400,Records And Matrixes,Fate/Extra CCC,Lore,"One of the most fundamental operations of the Moon Cell is the processing and manifestation of data. However it is that you did it, you have become able to replicate this function. To begin with, your memory is perfect and endless, very useful for recording everything that you witness, although you should be wary of cognitohazards or other pieces of knowledge that are inherently dangerous to process. By focusing on something that you can remember, you can also manifest the information stored within your mind outside of you, to conjure objects, tools, infrastructure, and perhaps even intelligent beings.

To actually manifest them, you'll have to invest an appropriate amount of energy plus an additional tenth of it. For example, for truly powerful Servants, an equally and slightly greater amount of energy will be required. That said, you can choose to use less energy than you would normally require, if you don't mind not manifesting whatever it is you're conjuring in its full glory. Gathering information to build up a library of records to manifest is completely on you."
639,,400,Four Legged Scholar,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Few monsters are bound to a human lifespan. Most are outright immortal, if not incredibly long lived, and that can often be seen in the sheer breadth of experience most intelligent non-humans possess. But even among immortal beings, you’re a stand out example of a life well learned. You hold very
broad knowledge of almost all things in this world. Different magic styles, countless combat
techniques, medicine, science, the use of many different weapons and implements, almost any skill
that can be named without being unique to an individual or being a special power instead of a skill
anyone can learn, as well as having to exist in the time that you take this. While many might consider
you a master of these things, you cannot compare to true specialists. While you skill in varying forms
of magic is broad and deep, legendary witches like Medea would greatly overshadow you. Your
talent for combat with fists and weapons is that of a master to most but only that of a journeyman
compared to Achilles or Heracles. If an ordinary master were a ten and these legendary heroes were
a hundred with their specialties, you’d be something like a fifty.
 
However, your true blessing lies in your ability to pass on that which you know. You are a teacher of
near-supernatural excellence and should you allow others to learn from you, will be the one to
create numerous legendary heroes, very much the equal of Chiron himself in this field. Bringing
others to your level of skill, even training their abilities and bodies beyond normal human limits, is
quite easy even within just a few years, but you also find yourself able to awaken potential in your
students that lets them grow beyond what you can teach with ease, especially once they begin to
adventure on their own. Your students, even the rowdiest, find themselves easily falling into the
perfect mindset to learn from you and can even retain any natural anger they might have while you
teach the. "
640,,400,Spartan Bred,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Sparta breeds them strong, they do. Those bronzed bodies, built like they were cast by the gods in
the greatest refineries. By natural birth or a similar upbringing, you’ve got a body and the physical
potential to match the legendary Spartans. You can make cities quake with a stomp and sprint across
the country in a few minutes, enough to match even moderately powerful demigods and
phantasmal beasts. You don’t yet have the comprehensive and intense training of the Spartans
themselves but in their place, you find you have incredible potential for learning new combat or war
related skills and improving those skills at a massive rate. Even if you started as a child, you’d quickly
surpass men with decades of experience after a few months of learning. However, while your
starting potential is great and will only grow, you only show your true power when at a disadvantage. The worse off you are in battle, the more you’ll find your powers, raw statistics and skills improve for
both you and close allies you have nearby. Facing some notably stronger than yourself might see a decent boost to your own strength but taking just three hundred of your best friends to block the
passage of one of the largest and most powerful nation’s greatest army, vastly outnumbering and
overpowering yourselves? They’ll be talking about the feats you accomplish two thousand years on
from that day."
641,,400,Wisdom of the Haunting Ground,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"These long, long centuries have not been idly spent by you. You devoted yourself in your life until
now to mastering all that you could get your hands on. And master you did, for you possess
seemingly supernatural ability in hundreds, if not thousands of different skills and fields of
knowledge. So long as the skill or knowledge existed before the first or second century AD, you have
already learned it to the point that you can pull off supernatural feats with it. Your skills with horse
riding, for example, are such that horses are driven to move at speeds far greater than physically
possible and become able to ride up walls as if they were flat land. You could create poultices from
plants that heal with magical efficiency. However, while your wisdom is vast, it is limited in the fields
of combat or magic. Perhaps you neglected those areas of study in your long life, for you have no
more skill in things relating to those fields than any other person. "
642,,400,Angel of the Battlefield,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Lore,"Just being a leading star in the medical field isn’t enough to change the world, not when you have to
do it from the front of a battlefield too. While you are most certainly at the front of the pack in
terms of medical skill and knowledge of your time, at least as far as Nightingale’s time, your talents
are more notable than that. A superb instinct for all things relating to medicine, it allows you to
easily master techniques and technology even centuries advanced from your time if you can gain
access. Even without access, advancing medical knowledge comes smoothly and quickly to you, accelerating the speed of new discoveries greatly.

Medicine becomes widely applicable in your hands, in some ways superhumanly so. Your knowledge
makes you a lethal combatant even with limited combat training, innately understanding the most
efficient ways to move your own body, the most vulnerable vital points to strike and how to greatly
reduce damage with the right block. Your treatments become applicable on all targets, even against
what seems like common sense, as you can stitch up the wounds of spiritual beings with no more
difficulty than a flesh and blood human. Even non-humans take only a small time to study before you
can effectively understand and begin treatment. While this talent does not directly boost the power
of healing magecraft, your knowledge and the skill it lets you use those spells with make you a far
superior wielder to most."
643,,400,Sovereign,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Lore,"Every thing under the sun is destined to come under your rule, in your mind, and thus there is no
possession that should be excluded from your use. You have a great blessing in regards to items of
power where their use comes to you as naturally as if you were moving your own fingers. Any
magical item works with you as you hold it. You realise how to use these items as you hold them, their functions and attributes becoming clear in your mind. The arcane objects do not harm you as
you hold them and even bow before your right to use them, allowing you to bypass any restrictions
on their use.

As you hold them, you will see that you quickly master their use as well, taking only a few days
before you can use them as an expert would, in almost any situation. This skill can often be applied
outside of the magical tool as well, as mastering the use of a magical blade in combat could surely
apply at least somewhat to an ordinary sword as well."
644,,400,Body Hopper,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"You didn’t achieve immortality because of being a lucky fool, you earned it the hard way. Yours is a
genius that is rarely matched, a mind like that of the intellectual giants of history, and the extensive
studies you’ve done on many fields of both science as well as many more mundane non-combat
skills, as well as a more mundane approach to magic, are the proof. While you are not a caster of
spells, you have an extensive knowledge of many arcane subjects such as demons, the metaphysics
of the world and the textures that make it up, even about the human soul. Combined with your
natural genius, you even found a way to extend your own life. By projecting your very soul into the form of another person, you can initiate a contest of wills, magical power and spiritual skill that if won, allows you to take over their body. Empty forms, such
as homunculi without spirits, can be taken over freely. Failure would either rebound your spirit into
your last body or leave you without a body, as something like a ghost. Not a pleasant long term
situation. You retain your perks and powers as normal, though non-perk traits like implanted organs
will not transfer, as common sense goes. Unlike many other forms, your soul will not degrade over
time due to this practice or age, as well as retaining your memories in perfect condition despite your
age. In fact, you may even choose to have been doing this for a long time till now, giving you several
decades to several centuries of experience. Perhaps an easy explanation for the wide knowledge
base you have here. You may choose to continue this longer history and wide skill set in future
worlds."
645,,400,Unleashed Will,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"Yours is a mind that cannot ever be contained and a body that can never be imprisoned. A spirit that
can never be chained and a heart that will always be free. You possess a will like a wall of diamond, unbreakable and ever-lasting. Your mind, while not necessarily more educated than before, races
ahead and beyond almost any other. You possess Super High Speed Thought naturally, letting you
think at hundreds of times the pace of any other being when desired to make plans on the fly even
when in a fight. This thought can, through significant stress on your body, even briefly cross over to
the actions of your body, letting you move so fast that it briefly appears that time is stopped for you. The desire for freedom has a final benefit, a heart’s desire that allows you a conceptual advantage in
escaping any prison or maze. Even one made from warped space and bent time is not inescapable to
you, not with enough time, as your advantages render any impossible escape into something
possible."
646,,400,Atlas of Dreams ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"An occult journal that maps the dark side of the world. This atlas can guide anyone to anywhere, even places outside of reality, provided the user has a destination in mind. Do remember that some places are harder to reach than others."
647,,400,Galactic Imperialism,DC Comics,Lore,"Ruling, some say, is hard. But with how many spacefaring powers spring up overnight only to
fall the next day, you’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise. Like the well-trained members of such
societies, you have a keen education in the grand strategy, logistics and administration required
to build empires spanning multiple planets. So too do you have the military discipline and
training needed to function within a well-oiled war machine capable of defending or expanding
the above seamlessly. The mind-boggling command chain that lets a starfleet coordinate across
lightyears while simultaneously accounting for the population you’ve subjugated’s continued
survival and obedience is old hat to you. Your ways are the old ways of empire building,
elevated into the space age but no less disciplined."
648,,400,Soultaker ,DC Occult,Lore,"A well crafted sword, enchanted with potent dark magic. As implied by the name, it devours the souls of those killed by it or any spiritual beings slain and allows the wielder access to their knowledge and skills, though not any supernatural ability you would not have already been able to access. Very useful for the lazy and the lacking in scruples.

If any soul is freed from the blade outside of the jump it was trapped in, it will immediately return to the jump in which it was trapped.
"
649,,400,Prodigal Sorcerer ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Learning spells has never been difficult for you. With nothing more than bare-bones instructions, you can easily piece together what you need to cast a difficult spell. Hell, even just seeing a spell once would be enough for you to recreate it, or come pretty damn close. But your talent extends farther than just learning old spells. You have a natural ability to create new pieces of magic of surprising complexity and potency – the types of rituals spells you’d expect to find in ancient tomes and millennia-old scrolls. There’s a very good chance you could go down in magical history as a genius of the Art.
"
650,,400,Arcane Expertise ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"You’re very knowledgeable all sorts of things on the spooky side. Off the top of your, you can name two dozen types of spirits, rattle off twice a dozen regional tales of folklore, and identify the minute differences in two magical circle traps that could mean the difference in escaping them and ending up with your soul strewn in the aether. In fact, you’re one of the world’s foremost experts on the arcane. Any number of people or organizations would be willing to pay handsomely to have you on payroll.

And that’s not all. This also means it is much easier for you to learn more information of a similar vein, whether in this world or any other, and any intuitive leaps made while studying magic or the like tends to be far more accurate than it otherwise would be.
"
651,,400,Flawless Recall ,Libriomancer,Lore,"You have a flawless memory, able to recall instances that happened years ago as if only a few seconds had passed. While this photographic function will not let you “know” something automatically, you may go back and review your memories as though they were photographs or videos with perfect recollection of how things really happened. You are also gifted with superb mental organization, never getting lost in your memories and always able to summon up the correct thought or series of thoughts without fear of your mind wandering.
"
652,,400,Spell recollection ,Libriomancer,Lore,"Somehow you have expanded the bounds of magic beyond what should be possible. You are able to perfectly memorize a spell to such a degree that you can reproduce it simply by taking the same actions as the initial caster. While this effect is significantly decreased in power from the original, you may recreate literally any spell you see cast before you with only moderate effort. As this is a reproduction of the prior spell, you do not need to understand the principles behind it, only reproduce it. You will still need to learn the principles behind if you wish to truly cast it or bring it up to its original efficaciousness. Furthermore, you may still purchase and utilize this ability even if you chose the inhuman background."
653,,400,Grimoire Azul ,Drakengard and Nier,Lore,"Weiss, Noir and Rubrum weren’t the only Grimoires made during Project Gestalt. Many young people were experimented on and turned into talking, magical books. Azul is one of them. Colored blue in case you couldn’t tell, this Grimoire has similar abilities to the others, being a deep reservoir of knowledge and capable of powerful spells. Capable, in the sense that when you first obtain her, Azul will only know Dark Blast. More spells will need to be obtained via finding Sealed Verses or recording spells you discover in other jumps. And if you’re wondering why Azul costs double what the Pod perk does when all that is basically the same, the answer is, of course, power. While the standard uses of Sealed Verses are similar to pod programs, Weiss was capable of creating super-powered versions of the spells, such as giant-sized Dark Hands the size of buildings. And apparently he was only using a portion of the power of the Sealed Verses. Any spell recorded in Azul will be able to be enhanced far beyond its normal limits, creating truly ridiculous spells. 

Personality wise, Grimoire Azul starts off very reticent, almost robotic. Due to her trauma at getting turned into a Grimoire and sealed away for a thousand years, her personality has been repressed somewhat. But as you travel with her and grow closer, you’ll find her old personality re-emerging. Who knows what sort of person you might discover underneath that trauma. A refined, humble lady? A cheerful genki girl? A over-protective yandere? Just know that she won’t be anything like one of the three other Grimoires, so she won’t be an prideful gentlewoman, arrogant egomaniac or, uh, just plain crazy. 
"
654,,400,Fast Learner ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You’re a quick learner and an even quicker improviser. Lose the majority of your magical power and not be able to blast through with sheer power and you could immediately come up with a spell that focuses your magical blast into a blade with high cutting power and low cost. Gain the ability of flight and adjust to three-dimensional combat like you were born to it.
"
655,,400,Fast Learner ,Dog Days,Lore,"You learn skills incredibly quickly through practical work. It may take you a week to learn the theory behind a spell, but once you start practicing it you’ll have it down within hours. This can apply even to things you might not expect. Some field work in archeology may really drill in your head the best way to locate ancient sites and treasures.
"
656,,400,Exposition Truck ,Generic MG,Lore,"Bringing a magical girl up to speed on the monsters she’s about to fight is tricky. Fortunately, you can condense infodumps by a factor of a dozen, somehow conveying all that information into a mind much faster than the brain can handle.

In addition, you know pretty much all of your faction’s history. Even the bits lost to time. Even the incidents buried under countless lies. Even the facts that couldn’t have written down because the person who knew them was killed right after they learned them. All included. Make sure your magical girl is never caught off guard.

This doesn’t give you enough detailed knowledge about all of your enemies’ abilities unless your faction was able to figure them all out. It doesn’t give details of lost technology or lost magics either. It would let you know that such things are possible, though it would be up to you to figure them out again.
"
657,,400,Secrets of the Land* ,Peter Pan,Lore,"Your tribe has been on the island longer than anyone can remember, but unlike the other groups, the tribal records have kept your history alive. As a result, you know countless secrets about the island, from the physiology of different plants to hidden caves and forgotten shrines. Furthermore, trees have ears, and by simply examining minute clues in the wild you can learn the secrets of anyone who has passed through the area. By simply putting your ear to the ground, you can hear a dry leaf crinkle and immediately identify who stepped on it. After the jump, you gain an intimate knowledge of the history of natural environments, and also any secrets unwittingly revealed by people who have recently traveled through the habitat.
"
658,,400,Fascinated With the World Where the Dream Continues ,Ib,Lore,"You have traveled through dark and beautiful realms, and even questioned the nature of your home and reality, but the experiences have only sharpened your mind and imagination. You have found a balance between logic and fantasy that allows you to draw upon both of them without any conflict. You are an expert at solving puzzles and will not allow illusions to lead you astray, but neither will you reject the validity of dreams and wonder, and you can hold onto your sense of magic in a world of reality and rationality. This is an outlook that few people manage to fully attain, not even artists. You will never lose heart in your journey and will not give up, coming back and rewriting fate again and again until you push forward to the true, happiest ending for everyone."
659,,400,Liber Bubonicus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Lore,"A book of foul things, the book is part holy tome of Nurgle, part treatise on the creation of plague, part record of all the diseases that have swept the world and part grimoire of foul and pestilent magics, even the books presence will cause outbreaks of terrible diseases.
"
660,,400,Magic Arms & Armor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"You have come upon a tome filled with the teachings of how to craft the more common magical weapons and armor that can be bought. While these teachings will not teach you how to make weapons that are unique to a single person in this world, if there have been more than two of that weapon this information would be able help you craft something like it. Too bad that the resources and time needed for such delicate workings are beyond most Greenskins.
"
661,,400,Key of Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The Key of Secrets is one of the most powerful symbols of your order, as the vast knowledge any Wizard must acquire is the key to power. With that said, surely power could be a key to further knowledge? Your fire magics now have a peculiarity to them - no matter how aggressively you assault a bastion or person with flame, you will never accidentally destroy any records or information contained within the structure or on the person’s person. The Bright Order is impulsive, but it is not wasteful.

662,,400,Conspiracy Sniffer​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"There are many secrets in this world, and many of them need to be gathered up and buried in deep dark hole. You have been trained in a series of mystical techniques and spells that allow you to find those secrets, embarking on supernatural investigation trails. So long as you know what the information in question is, you may mystically detect whether or not a person knows the information. Summarily, you can trace the memetic spread of this information from them, who they told it to, and who told them. With enough time and appropriately placed spells, you may trace an entire web of conspiracy...and when the time comes, may begin splitting its threads.
"
663,,400,High Speech ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"Broken fragments and twisted syllables are all that remain of the once mighty Atlantean language. So broken is this system that the words can no longer be transcribed, only passed along orally from one mage to the next. Sleepers are unable to comprehend it at all, instead perceiving it as indistinct noise. All mages of the pentacle orders are trained in high speech to some degree, as its sympathetic connection to the supernal realms allows them to empower their spells by speaking the correct corresponding words. You however have taken this to another level, as all of your spells significantly increase in power, effectiveness and duration whenever you incorporate Atlantean into the casting. Be warned as while this may increase your spells power, if there are sleepers around it has an increased chance of also invoking disbelief. Post-­jump this high­-speech will still invoke disbelief in those not of a supernatural persuasion.
"
664,,400,Personal Grimoire​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"This grimoire contains the sum total of your mystical knowledge. Every spell, every rote, every shortcut, technique and secret you have uncovered in regards to magic rests within this grimoire. As you continue to grow in the mystic arts, so will the grimoire, filling in its pages with more information, or perhaps even splitting off into a second volume. With a great deal of time and effort it could be copied and mystically circulated for a significant profit, perhaps even enhancing Awakened society as a whole. Or, you could simply use it as a black­box should your mind be tampered with, forcing you to lose any mystical knowledge you had acquired. For now however, it remains well warded and in a safe but accessible place of your choosing.
"
665,,400,Heroic Aptitude ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Lore,"When Link's adventure started, he was like an egg, waiting to hatch into a proper hero. It was through the tests of courage put forth by the Great Fairies that he was able to become a true hero, and through his storming of the Palace of Winds, defeating of Vaati, and rescuing of Zelda that he became the greatest of heroes. Like him, you also grow from adversity and challenge. Even if you were but a simple lad, a young boy who only barely counted as a knight, you could find yourself growing far more skilled and deadly as you conquer the challenges set before you. From simple skill with the sword to the complicated use of various items such as bombs and boomerangs, from clever use of the mind to conquer puzzles and leading a team to having what most might consider a gifted skill with a mystical weapon, you shall find yourself rapidly advancing in all these and more as you face challenges that test you to your limits. The harder the challenge, the greater the gain, and should you find yourself on a quest such as Link's, facing tests of courage in dangerous locations against hordes of monsters to prepare you to rescue your love from a mighty and ancient demon lord...you could go from unknown zero to legendary hero in no time at all. All you have to do is survive the path ahead.
"
666,,400,Inheritor of the Arts ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Lore,"Perhaps it is an open mind, or a simple necessity of living on the move for so long, but you are an extremely good student. You can easily pick up and learn a new skill, combat technique, or spell within an hour or so of training by a master, and make the lessons stick - though this has to be a technique by technique basis, not learning an entire style in a single hour with just this. Another example of your great potential, is it not?
"
667,,400,Personal Library ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"Every magic user, sorcerer or mage, needs somewhere to write down his spells. Here’s yours. A modest library detailing your form of magic, with extra, blank books for you to record new findings in. Can be added onto your warehouse or imported into each new setting post-jump.
"
668,,400,Experimentation and Research,TES V - Skyrim,Lore,"Being able to pulverise fools who oppose you with a fireball is all well and good, but the real
meat in the study of magicka is in discovering and learning new spells to play with, as well as
creating new effects within your school of specialty. You are quite adept at both of these, finding
that learning new spells in the school you specialize in is quite easy compared to how your peers
would find it, and the internal logic required to use your school of magic comes as easy as
breathing for you, making creating new effects within your specialty to be as simple as designing
it. While you may still have difficulty when mastering spells you already know, you find that
building wide rather than tall is a simple task, which is undoubtedly going to make you into a
legendary figure with a decade or two of work."
669,,400,Chosen Teacher,TES: Dovah,Lore,"When you look upon mortals, you just can't help but feel pity for
them. Their lives finite, their forms frail, their Voices weak. Luckily for them, you are
capable of teaching any mortal the ancient art of the Thu'um in a fraction of the time it
would take, allowing them to learn a full shout in a month. This is an even more fantastic
ability then you might first think, as you can even teach those who originate from worlds
completely devoid of any magic.

Requires Thu'um to purchase."
670,,400,Black Books ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"Created by Hermeous Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, these seven books are tomes of esoteric knowledge with a special property to them. By reading them, you will be taken to an island within the realm of Apocrypha, and subjected to a test. What this test is differs from book to book, ranging from complex puzzles to a gauntlet of combat. If you die in the books, you will be returned to the real world unharmed, but should you succeed you will be granted powerful abilities."
671,,400,Butterscotch-Cinnamon Pie Recipe ,Undertale,Lore,"This is a recipe for home-made pie- Quite possibly the best pie ever made. If made using monster cooking techniques, a single slice of this is delicious enough to fully restore the consumer's vitality. However, the ingredients are rather specific, and to bring out its true potential, the pie must be home- cooked with fire magic. But the results... You simply can't argue."
672,,400,But teach a man to fish... ,World Seed,Lore,"Skills in the system are created through the memory and repetition of using them (or in the case of Quest rewards, simply put into your mind). What this means is that having a skill is not always a permanent thing. Say you learn Archery at the start of your journey, but soon switch to using more advanced plasma weapons, and don’t really need or use bows anymore. Because you never studied archery enough to develop habits and didn't keep practicing, your skill proficiency would slowly drop over time, until eventually you might lose the skill entirely.

Of course, there is nothing stopping you from simply learning archery again, but it’d still be a hassle. Thankfully, it’s one you’ll never have to deal with. Any skills you learn and any memories you make will stay with you forever. Never forget how to use that obscure spell you really need right now ever again! You could sit on your ass for a few decades, but when an enemy shows up you need to defeat, you’d still be the combat monster you’ve been in your prime. Or rather, you ARE in your prime. After all, for you it never ended in the first place. This also means that no matter how many memories you might accumulate, you’ll be able to recall any of them in an instant."
673,,400,This is What We’d Call Two-Timing ,Ajin,Lore,"“It’s Study Time?” The way you describe things can be...odd, but that doesn’t mean you are any less valid in teaching other people about things they do not understand. By purchasing this perk, any method of teaching others is just as effective as investing everything into making the lessons clear, so long as you have a good understanding of what you are trying to teach and that your methods actually have something to do with teaching no matter how unorthodox."
674,,500,Sage,The Witcher Novels,Lore,"Over the years people have simplified the term, not understanding that being Sage is more than being powerful or knowledgeable. Equating a Sage with a common practitioner of magic is akin to considering a newly-drafted private, hay sticking out of his breeches, to be a witcher's equal simply because both wield swords. While a Sage does wield magic, and does so with greater skill than even the most accomplished human mages, the great renown and regard in which they are held does not come from this skill but from the other truly rare abilities they possess. Nothing is a secret for an elven sage, for they see both past and future as easily as the present. They have mastery over all the arcana of magic and every domain of scholarship as well as the only ones who understand the nature and operation of the so-called Elder Blood. And now you share this legacy, but be warned that this skill is contingent on your own ability and practice.

Note: Requires The Nature of Magic."
675,,500,"""Hollow Bible""",Dark Souls 3,Lore ,"What appears to be a Divine Tomb of the Way of White, when opened up it reveals a cavity has been cut out of the pages and a little black book has been tucked away inside. This Hollow Bible within a “hollow bible” reveals information that, wish some degree of practice and study, can allow the reader to harness the powers of darkness. Basic lessons inside teach you how to project heavy, dark projectiles of various types at enemies. More advanced lessons focus on different curses and spreading the influence of the Abyss. You could drive weakened enemies mad by gripping their heart in darkness, empowering them but also driving them mad, prone to attack whatever is around them, including allies. You could also empower allies with darkness if you’re careful to inhibit the “madness” part. Either form of this Abyssal Touch is easily visible due to the corrupted individual’s “glowing red eyes”. On top of unique lessons, having prior knowledge of Miracles, Sorcery or Pyromancy (as well as the necessary casting implements) can allow one to learn dark variants of tales and spells from those disciplines befitting of a hollow."
676,,500,Prime-r Merlinean,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Lore ,"Somewhere deep in your family history, no matter how small, comes from the same lineage that Merlin did. Even if only a sliver, it means that you are destined to become an extraordinarily powerful sorcerer one day, to the point that the power within you is so great you no longer need a focus to cast magic. This applies to all of your magic as well- not necessarily making you anymore powerful, but freeing you of the need to use any sort of focus to cast. It also means that in future jumps, just like in this one, you will be distantly related to a magic user of major importance, like Merlin."
677,,600,Necromantic Archives,Baldur's Gate 3,Lore,"This is the wet dream of a wizard, specifically a necromancer. You get two magical
grimoires that contain some of the most profound and/or forbidden mysteries ever created
within the forgotten realms setting, in the area of necromancy.
The first book you get is named Necromancy of Thay. This book contains various secrets
and vile arts that is ever created in the school of necromancy. Normally you’d have read through
the pages of this book, whilst enduring the pure necromantic curse that is radiating from it.
Since you paid for it, this is no longer the case for this version of the book. You can simply read
it like a bedtime story, and it is pretty easy to understand too. When you finish reading this
book, you find that you can converse with spirits of the dead as much as you want. Some rules
though: you need a corpse with an intact head to ask questions, you can only ask five questions
per corpse, you cannot speak to the same corpse until a week passes, and the corpse may refuse
to answer your questions, if you are the cause of their untimely demise (unless you are disguised
of course). This is the only powers you get from this book normally in game. However, with
this item, you find that your necromancy spells are more potent than they were before, around
%50 of increased potency we are talking about. Also, undead minions you raise, if you have the
power to do so, has increased physical stats and mental acumen to follow your orders better.
Second book you get is named Tharciate Codex. This book on its own doesn’t grant you
anything. However, it contains the secrets of deciphering hidden meanings within the
Necromancy in Thay. If you read this book and then the first book you gained from this item
purchase again, you get the ability to conjure powerful undead servants that are fully under your
command. With but a thought and a gesture you could conjure either: twenty skeletons, ten
ghouls, five mummies or three wraiths. Each of them also gains the ability to explode in a burst
of necrotic energy upon death or at your command. You’ll notice that these options are
significantly stronger than the ones you get in game. You paid for them after all. These minions
stay at your command until they are destroyed or dismissed by you. You can issue command to
each of them mentally and they follow it best to their capabilities. You can only use this power
once per day, and if you attempt to summon more minions or change the type of minions you
have active, the previous ones are automatically dismissed as they turn into dust.
Both books can also act as a spellbook for the use of wizards. They can hold an infinite
number of spells and rituals, if you want to scribe spells into them."
678,,600,Astral Knowledge,Baldur's Gate 3,Lore,"Your tadpole must have accidently connected to an illithid hive-mind... it must have.
Otherwise, nothing can explain the eternal wealth of knowledge that is deeply rooted in your
mind. All of the biotechnology, psionic techniques and skills of the illithid civilization are
downloaded straight into your mind. Don’t worry, your mind will be capable of handling this
massive data package and you each important aspect of this data package cannot be forgotten
by you.
You know how to create illithid colonies, recipe of the caustic solutions that used for
incubating brine pools, how to breed and raise your own illithid tadpoles, create new species
that are like infamous intellect devourers, how to replicate the designs for their infamous bio-
pods, restoration chambers, bio-computers and so much more. You even have a perfect blueprint
for an illithid nautioloid vessel in your mind. Be careful of how you preserve this knowledge
as even the illithids have long lost the knowledge to design of such ships.
Also, if you have any psychic abilities or when you possess one, you’ll find that you are
noticeably more talented with their use. Creating new maneuvers, improving on existing
techniques and using them in an inspired ways are quite easy for you. This psychic secrets also
reduce the burden these kinds of psychic abilities place on your mind by half.
Now jumper you have all the necessary things to understand the Grand Design. Will you
be its last remnant in history or its catalyst?"
679,,600,Freelancer's Talents,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Lore,"Your skill range is so eclectic, that you’ve found picking up
more is simplicity itself. You learn skills in a fraction of the time it’d take someone else, and can
quickly raise yourself to the level of an average professional with only a small amount of effort.
After that point, your growth will return to normal, but with as many skills as you can learn, you’ll
find that combining them can get you far."
680,,600,NU Graduate,Amphibia,Lore,"Congratulations jumper you’ve gone through and graduated
form the prestigious Newtopia University! You’ve learned almost everything there
is to know about the science, culture, and politics of Newtopia and somehow
come out of the university with your personality still intact. Going through a
rigorous university program has left you with some very useful skills including
being able to read tomes at an extreme speed in order to pull those much
needed all-nighters. On top of this you’ll become more creative and a faster
thinker in accordance with the amount of notes you take. Just try to remember
that there’s more to life than school."
681,,600,Biological Engineering,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"The Empire’s science and the foreign alchemy
has various differences in both applications and fundamentals, however, their feats
and capacities tend to be basically equals when it comes to modifying the bodies of
living beings into something better and you, my friend, became a master in this area,
one comparable to Stylish and Dorothea, the Empire’s greatest scientist and a world
class alchemist respectively. Your knowledge of living bodies and Danger Beasts is
incredible and, combined with your knowledge of alchemy/science, medicine and
maybe even with a bit of magic, you’re able to easily enhance and/or alter people or
monsters into other forms by manipulating their biologies, allowing for feats such as
enhancing humans to give them superhuman attributes, modify their body parts to
enhance them (like modifying their eyes to give them superhuman vision or grant
extra limbs to a person) or even literally turning people into Danger Beast-like
monsters, which will usually be the top of what you can do with your skills. While the
flesh of living beings will usually be almost clay in your hands, keep in mind that
most of what you can make will tend to be dependent upon and greatly enhanced by
the quality of the tools and raw materials you have access to, with the best possible
materials usually being subjects with great potential/unusual abilities, interesting
genetic samples and powerful monsters."
682,,600,Forger of Imperial Arms,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"The methods and knowledge to create the Teigu
were thought to be long lost, however, by extensively studying the archaic
annotations and records left by the engineers, scientists and alchemists hired by the
First Emperor, as well as studying some of the Teigu that were available to you
during your formation, you managed to finally uncover the main knowledge and
process used on the craft of the Teigu: the art of creating weapons and items from
organic materials taken from living beings that keep their special properties and
abilities, on a level even above that of Wakoku’s blacksmiths capable of creating
Meihou, allowing you to actually create weapons on par with the Teigu in terms of
utility and power. While a few types of Teigu such as Lionel and the Demon’s Extract
are still beyond your current capacity due to their creation requiring more complex
techniques, creating weapons and items of the other types of Teigu are completely
within your capacity as long as you can put your hands on high quality materials, like
the bodies of Super Class Danger Beasts for example. However, keep in mind that
there are few limitations, as compatibility will be a factor to the Teigu-like weapons
you create and some beings’ will might be too powerful to influence the users of the
weapons made using their bodies. Additionally, if you have the knowledge of the
Dimensional Arts of manipulating space itself, you’re now able to craft tools and
weapons on par with Shambhala. Lastly, you also have all the needed skills to repair
Teigu, Shingu, Meihou and other similar items from near destruction."
683,,600,Sorothustran Scholarship,A Mage of Sorothustra,Lore,"You have a small handheld device that contains the
complete details of every quest or feat that led to a Sorothustran becoming an elder, as well as
chronicles your quest or feat. Additionally, this device contains the details of every spell or
sorcery devised by a Sorothustran, as well as their contributions to biology, thaumaturgical
studies, and countless other fields of study. This is an unparalleled repository of information
worth countless fortunes. If you lose this device or if it is destroyed somehow it will appear in
your staff’s pocket space inventory in an hour, completely restored. You must have The Sorothustran Set-Up to utilize spells."
684,,600,Coffin Technician,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Lore,"You are very good at combining technology and
magic, and tend to get more out of it than most. You can safely use magic inside an AIM field,
and teach others to do the same, even indirectly. Furthermore, you know the technological and
magical principles behind Hishigata’s “coffins,” which are mecha which can tap into and boost a
dead esper’s psychic powers. You can relatively easily adapt these weapons to other
superhumans, but you also know everything necessary to run your own Power Curriculum
Program, though your knowledge is slightly truncated, such that attempts to create espers as
devastating as Shundan Kimi will simply fail."
685,,600,Genetic Wonders,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Lore,"Mr. Sinister is arguably one of the greatest geneticists to ever live. His skill in
manipulating genes made him one of the world's most dangerous individuals despite
lacking innate powers. You are a rare genius who can match the mad doctor. Perhaps
you were his student or simply were blessed with a similar talent. Your capabilities
include creating perfect clones, isolating genetic factors that grant powers, and
transferring them to yourself or allies.
Additionally, you are a master physician with centuries of medical expertise. For
example, you could discover a new species and gain a complete understanding of their
genes within a few weeks by studying a small number of specimens. Your greatest
ability, however, lies in evolutionary projects and biological advancements. Much like
Sinister's ambition to advance humanity, you can propel species through millennia of
progress in a few years, creating wonders that push the boundaries of genetic potential."
686,,600,Comic Genius,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Lore,"Comic Worlds are home to some of the most intelligent minds in fiction. This world holds
a particularly large number of them given its composite nature. Luckily, you are one of
these intellectual savants. Your intellect rivals that of Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Doctor Doom,
and Valeria Richards. You are capable of mastering entire scientific fields in a single
day, an intellectual savant of the highest order. At present, you are an absolute master
of three specific fields. For instance, you could emulate Tony Stark's expertise by
choosing nanotechnology, energy production, and artificial intelligence."
687,,600,"Jumper, the Eternal Blade",Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Lore,"After his grueling adventures through the Soulsborne series, Mikael became a true
master of combat, honing his skills through centuries of battle and slaying any who
dared stand against him. Even without his supernatural powers, he could easily best
legendary warriors like Scathach, Wonder Woman, and Malenia. This extraordinary
prowess now extends to you. Your mastery of combat encompasses all forms of
weaponry, martial arts, and any techniques that fall under the banner of warfare. You
possess an uncanny ability to adapt to any fighting style, seamlessly switching between
weapons and combat forms as the situation demands. Honestly, you could probably be
counted as one of the top five deadliest warriors in your whole multiverse."
688,,600,The General,The Wheel of Time Jump,Lore,"You are equal in skill to Matrim Cauthon, a peerless tactician. Your
tactical acumen is such that no army under your command will
ever suffer a defeat, no matter what the odds seem to be. You are
able to lead them to victory without thought, capable of doing it
almost on instinct, knowing exactly what to do. You also have all
the experience and knowledge Mat gained from his additional
memories, without the memory disassociation he experienced."
689,,600,True Genius,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Lore,"Oh, wow. There’s geniuses, there’s legends... then there’s you. Not only do you have vast
potential in just about every Ninja Art out there, but your ability to master new skills, arts,
techniques, or anything else is utterly absurd. You pick up the basics of new things almost
immediately and improve from there at dazzling speed; a year of hard training would give you
the sort of gains that an average ninja would spend a lifetime trying to achieve.
This works for everything learnable or trainable, in this world or any other. Physical
development, chakra capacity, you name it. And you never need to waste time laboriously
practicing or re-conditioning what you have already learned; your skills and abilities will remain
razor-sharp no matter how long they are left unused.
Better still, what real genius ever needs to rely on others? You could teach yourself how to
become a seal master just from reading the textbook, learn advanced jutsu from half-legible
scrolls fished out of the garbage, and master new taijutsu styles by secretly watching other
ninjas perform their daily kata. You are always your own best teacher, and you never reach a
‘bottleneck’ in your studies. The only limitation on your ability to learn new skills, techniques,
or abilities is that you cannot create new information from nothing or train in powers or special
abilities that you don’t have the capacity to use.

Lastly, the very first lesson you learned was that genius is wasted without the proper
application. Your work ethic is excellent and you not only have the dedication to keep grinding
away for prolonged periods of time but actually enjoy doing so."
690,,600,Death Wizard,Bleach,Lore,"There’s no messing around anymore. Why even bother with a Shikai when you can outperform many
Captains with Kido alone? You stand up with the legends of the arts with this, the likes of Tessai
Tsukabishi and other outstanding leaders of the Kido Corps, as you’ve fully completed your training in the arts. You possess knowledge of all Hado and Bakudo spells, from #1 to #99, as well as dozens of spells from the Kaido, Sealing/Ward and other such categories. Each spell has been honed to a
fine degree of skill, if not mastered outright, that allows you to routinely express much greater
effects without the energy costs increasing to match. Even with a few dregs of spiritual energy and
serious bodily wounds, you remain a dangerous combatant. A few whispered words from you could
bring a torrent of elemental destruction or a set of sealing spells down on your opponent. As befits what is surely a leading light in the Kido Corps, you have a particular talent for creating new
Kido. The differing formations, sequences, chants and methods of Reiryoku use are all well known to
you, allowing you to create new effects within this magical system. Inventing a new Kido is still a
lengthy process, meaning any boasts of making obsolete others’ Zanpakuto are best kept quiet. But
where others might take years, if they have any hope of it at all, you can likely create even a high
level spell in a few months of steady research.

Note: Requires Kido Training."
691,,600,Intellectual Titan,Bleach,Lore,"With the right foundation, maybe there’s not as much need to specialise. Ever since you were born, you felt different from all the other kids. You understood things more easily, everyone felt slow in comparison. You only realised later that it was the signs of genius, the sort of intellect to match Aizen or Urahara. While this does not innately grant any knowledge or skill of it’s own, your now thoroughly incredible mind will make up for that in short order. Comprehension comes easily, even complicated concepts being easily understood in short order, and you see that it’s simple to innovate and improve on existing ideas. A new skill or discipline
progresses swiftly once you focus, able to rapidly progress to levels that would take ordinary souls
many years to reach. Spending the decades that most Shinigami or Quincy take to make their own
breakthroughs would see you reach the utter mastery of a field expressed by people like Kurotsuchi
or Urahara. Your mind is particularly well suited to breaking new ground where few have
approached before, discoveries and progress becoming far easier to reach if you are one of the
earliest to research a subject. The combination of Shinigami and Hollow may be taboo but just look
at what Kisuke and Aizen accomplished on their own."
692,,600,Evolution of the Soul,Bleach,Lore,"At the heart of all things is the soul, the holy grail from which the world can be manipulated and
controlled. To create and alter the soul, and life in general, could be said to be the highest and most
worthy form of science. Your knowledge of alteration and even creation of souls or biological life is a
match for the greats, men like Urahara and Kurotsuchi. Provided you have the tools, it is entirely
possible for you to craft new beings from spirit particles, designed to your specifications down to the
molecular level. Such a project is grand even for you, meaning that lesser modifications or enhancements are quite simple. Giving someone the ability to melt into liquid and reform in a safe location? Rudimentary. Altering the appearance of a Zanpakuto Spirit or potentially even it’s abilities? Possible, enough to offer it as a paid service. New species entirely, such as the Gikon or the Bount, would never be
accidental creations but the results of purposeful development in your lab. You’re not all that good
at fixing the injured compared to a healer of your level but you’re very much able to make people
into terrifyingly powerful bio-spiritual monsters, if they’re not too squeamish. Though beyond you now, the potential lies even for you to discover the secrets of resurrection, resuscitating lost or mostly destroyed souls and lives even hours after they have passed on.
Interfering with the cycle in such a form may bring trouble your way but...the science of the soul
calls to you and what greater expression can there be? It’s only natural to progress, as your existing
mastery is complemented with the sort of incredible talent that got you here in the first place. Who
knows what sort of grand spirits or monsters you might create in time."
693,,600,Sword Goddess,Bleach,Lore,"It’s easy to think that every Kenpachi is a violent brute. They all favour sheer power and strength, even those that have some technique or intelligence in battle prefer to channel it into using their natural power. But it didn’t start that way. The very first of this line relied not on furious power but on graceful skill. Graceful, terrifying, murderous skill. The countless styles of swordsmanship that Unohana Yachiru mastered in pursuit of the perfection of dealing death were passed down to you, maybe from the woman herself, rendering you her equal in Zanjutsu at least. The myriad styles have endless applications and intended uses, from barbaric greatswords to precise rapiers. Styles to allow the effortless counter-attacks to almost any blow, turning the enemy’s strength against them, or to cut away at the spiritual components of the enemy. Your skill is hardly limited to just what a mortal human would see as physically possible and the techniques you’re aware of make you capable of easily laying low those more powerful than yourself. Unohana, even centuries after she put down her blade, still easily killed the mighty Zaraki many times over despite his physical advantages. If desired, you can exchange this talent in swordsmanship for similar skill for another armed weapon form. Spears or hammers or axes or some of the wilder tools the Shinigami employ. Unarmed combat is unavailable as a choice but otherwise you’ll attain the same vast breadth and depth of skill with your chosen weapon form."
694,,600,Preptime Ploys,DC Comics,Lore,"Fools rush in, but you know better. You’re a methodical planner, and a meticulous plotter on par
with the Dark Knight himself that has long since learned how to set up a contingency for virtually
any circumstance. Through a combination of strategy, war games, rigorous mental exercise,
training and experience you are extremely skilled at setting up a process flow which uses
information you already know to carry out plans successful enough to thwart powerful
metahumans and disarm worldending weapons. The more information you have-any information
at all-and the better your resources on hand are, the more successful your plans will be. Fields
of study conventionally thought of as separate, such as forensic investigations and mechanical
engineering, can be integrated in order to great effect; this is the adaptability that let Batman
design many of his custom-tailored gadgets. With “merely” access to mundane wealth and
some analytics of past foes, you could conceivably construct a system similar to Brother Eye.
With the support of loyal and extremely powerful metahumans, you could construct armour
systems like the Hellbat that integrate the forces and natural resources they field into an artifact
capable of fighting on par with a god-albeit at extraordinary cost to your wellbeing. A strong
mind and body will hone your capacity to organize information, to manipulate and delegate and
prepare, in order to overcome odds normally far beyond your grasp."
695,,600,Perceptive Tactician,DC Comics,Lore,"Is it paranoia if there’s really someone out to get you? Regardless, you’ll be ready for any
threats coming your way. You’ve learned to never let your guard down, not unless you make
the conscious decision to relax. Even in situations as foreign as infiltrating an ancient temple or
spelunking in the Greek Underworld, you remain keenly aware of vantage points, hiding places
and the like to better take advantage of when the chips are down. You’re a master of fighting
with improvised weapons and guerilla warfare and could write a book about all the dirty tricks
you know. You’re always as focused and careful as you are at your best, and you don’t get
overconfident or lose your edge when you’re winning a fight, dealing with low level nobodies, or
have hung up the cowl for the day. Blindsiding you at your worst won’t be any easier than when
you’re alert and focused, because you’re always alert and focused. And while you may not
necessarily be the most social of heroes, one thing you’re good at is teaching others the tricks
of your trade. From how to throw a sharp implement to how to fight in cramped spaces, you’re
an expert at crime fighting tutelage."
696,,600,Celestial Genius,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Lore,"Many brilliant geniuses have already lived, currently live
or will still be born in this world depending on when you arrived here. We’ve seem
genius like Orochimaru, which combined his mad science and forbidden jutsu to
push the limits of knowledge and make both wonders and horrors, and Amado,
which originally was already a specialist on the field of cloning and genetic
engineering but made several technological advancements on other fields after
joining Kara, but, in the end, these two geniuses are ultimately human. As a celestial
being, your intellect is now compared to both of them combined, having a
generalized understanding of several academics and scientific disciplines and a
talent in working with mundane technologies and with technologies that utilizes
supernatural energies like mechanisms powered by chakra, as well as having a
specialization on a field of your choice. If you choose robotics as your specialization,
you could make war machines powerful as a Tailed Beast with the right materials
and enough effort for example. With time and effort, you could make several
discoveries and advancements even outside your specialization, like discovering
how to give biological immortality to living beings, actually transferring minds through
scientific means, artificially replicate existing dōjutsu or even create your own
customized ones, a feat that even Amado would classify as belonging to the realms
of the gods, but, after all, you’re basically a divine being yourself."
697,,600,A Decade Ahead,Naruto,Lore,"A mind that comes along once in a lifetime is one of things that people will one day call you, a pioneer in the art of science. You possess an intellect that can push the boundaries of science and technology and create things that can push society forward by decades if not centuries. In just a few years of work, you could push society from the time of swords and horse drawn carriages to trains, TVs and movies. It’s now less on what you can learn and more on how much you can fit in a week."
698,,600,World's Greatest Medic-nin,Naruto,Lore,"A title given to only one other, the future Godaime Hokage Tsunade herself. Like her, your ability as a medic is legendary, with you being able to identify injuries and other ailments with just a glance and treat conditions others have deemed impossible. For example, your skills in the medical arts are such that you could heal the necrosis caused by the Dead Demon Consuming Seal or the psychological torture inflicted by Tsukuyomi, easily create cures for the poisons of the great Chiyo, and even heal yourself after being cut in half. There is nothing you cannot heal given time. Obviously, this comes with all the medical knowledge one would expect for a medic of your calibre; one example of this is your knowledge of the cellular structure, for if you were to perform an autopsy you could easily detect damage at the cellular level and immediately tell what could have caused it and what exactly happened. Of course, to keep your title you can’t just coast by on what you know. So now and in all future jumps, all attempts to increase knowledge to do with medicine and healing will be learnt 10x faster than every other so-called medic."
699,,600,Kami no Shinobi,Naruto,Lore,"The raw intellect of Minato and Orochimaru; the almost supernatural inclination towards ninja arts and combat Itachi and Hiruzen possess. The talent of these ninjas is in no way superior to your own, and, in fact, likely worse. You could master in days what would take others months, and what would take others lifetimes would take no more than half a decade. You make impossible advancements in mind, body, and chakra, far quicker than was ever thought possible. Your sheer overwhelming talent and natural skill in the ninja arts all but guarantees you a place in history alongside those known as the gods of shinobi."
700,,600,The Necronomicon,Marvel Zombies,Lore ,"And we’re going back to Evil Dead. This is the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, the Naturom Demonto. The big evil book of the dead. Or at least, a copy of that book, made of skin and written in blood. It’s up to you whether your edition of the book is sentient or not. It’s got various spells and incantations written down, namely on the summoning of various hellish creatures. The book will add more pages about necromancy, summoning, and dark magic as you travel to new universes. There’s no Kandarian demon involved in the process, but the book does have the power to raise an army of the dead. At your command, it can raise thousands of deadites - and these zombies are completely subservient to you. It can also be used to travel between dimensions, but once and only once. The book has a limited amount of magical energy, so you can either raise the deadite horde or get out while the going’s still good - you can’t do both. Lastly, the book has the gift of prophecy. It can tell you the future to an extent. If there are any prophecies in a universe you’re currently in, the book will have it. It’ll also warn you a few days ahead of time if a cataclysmic event is due to happen."
701,,600,Salmon-Flavored Thumb,Irish Mythology,Lore ,"Like the redoubtable Fionn, you burned your thumb cooking the Salmon of Knowledge- which thumb is up to you. Who ate of that fish was to learn everything. Your gift, alas is more limited. While sucking your thumb you may learn the answer to any question, if it concerns not the future nor any immaterial, unwitnessed thing. In some versions Fionn had to bite down to the bone and suck the marrow from his thumb, but since you’re paying points we’ll skip that."
702,,600,Malkuth Theory,The Games We Play,Lore,"You possess the greatest power of all, that of the human mind, ever seeking
knowledge and understanding. Your mind, scientific ability and sheer talent are like
something out of a legend, and a terrifying one at that.
You’re a genius on a level that leaves the greatest of geniuses despairing at their
unworthiness. Forget the greatest minds of this age, the very Archangels and their
creators would have found themselves jealous of the sheer ease with which sciences of
all kinds and colors come to you, nature almost eager to reveal its secrets.
You start out at the limit of this era’s understanding of science, with what amounts to
a degree in everything, but worry not, the vast and wondrous creations of the Angels
and Archangels are far from being beyond your reach, with it being only a matter of
time before you reach the same levels in them.

After this world you don’t get any knowledge ex-nihilo, but your skills translate
perfectly to all branches of study you ever encounter, providing you equal talent and
potential."

This Perks makes it so you any power or ability you have, even newly acquired once, will be as if you had them for a lifetime. You will immediately know how to use them and this also boosts the effect of Gift of the Gods making you an equal to Ozma in his prime. Of course when you take up tasks needing these skills and succeed, your legend will grow till one day all the World will know your name as a Hero."
704,,600,Laugh of Shantotto,Final Fantasy XI,Lore ,"So you are a mage, maybe you can shoot lightning bolts, throw fireballs, or summon blocks of ice with nothing more than a bit of mana and a short chant. But that seems a little boring doesnt it? Well that is ok, with a bit of experimentation you can do all manner of other stuff! Take a single use portal spell and study it long enough and you could make a spell for hopping to alternate side dimensions to the world you are in. Study a fireball spell long enough, figure out what does what, and you can one day create a spell to drop flaming meteors from the sky at your enemies. This perk allows you to study spells you already know and with a bit of hard work create your own spells from what you have learned. So what if becoming a mage caused your life to take a turn for the worse causing your parents to get divorced, your house to be destroyed, and you dog to drink a shrinking potion. You will be the best mage ever one day no matter what stands in your way! (Sudden urge to speak in rhyme optional)"
705,,600,Born With It Baby,Dies Irae,Lore ,"Some people find that they get good at things faster than anyone else. Others like yourself, don’t even need to bother getting good. You’ve got natural talent for everything you try, almost as if you’d already been doing whatever you start doing for a whole decade. Whether it be picking up a strange magical weapon, trying out a new martial arts move or even just trying to study for exams, you’ll find you’re just as good as if you’d already had ten years’ worth of regular practice. This won’t give you any knowledge out of the blue, just increase your innate skill in a subject as if you had years of training. Deciding to study how firearms are made won’t suddenly give you all the knowledge you’d obtain through ten years of studying how firearms are made but it will give you ten years of experience in studying and, once you try out those firearm making techniques, ten years of experience in each technique. "
706,,600,Beast of Possibility,Dies Irae,Lore ,"You may not be the most suited to gathering souls in slaughter but you might just find you no longer have need to grow strong. You have a soul with a vast amount of potential, something that allows you to not only grow at a rate that turns days of time into decades of progress but also lets you progress in power without the usually required materials. Despite normally needing you to eat a certain number of souls, you are able to progress through the stages of Ewigkeit just through time, constant fighting and training and self-reflection. You are able to do this with other sorts of powers as well, progressing even when lacking the usually required resources and simply using time, battle and self-understanding in place of them. "
707,,600,I Am Entering Your Memories,80s Sword and Sorcery,Lore ,"You possess the ability to forcibly reach into the minds of others in search of their memories, knowledge, and skills and rip them from inside of them. This requires you to grasp their head, holding it in place as you stare into their face, pushing your mind within theirs and with the strength of your will ripping free facets of their mind. This is a painful experience for the victim, and damaging to their mind, growing worse the deeper you go. You could extract a few surface thoughts, or some specific information without inflicting permanent harm to another’s mind, but if you were to extract, for example, a wide base of general knowledge about the modern world from someone’s mind it’d probably kill them; and somewhere in between lies permanent memory loss and even brain damage. You can learn skills this way, though this level of extraction will damage your victim’s mind permanently, at minimum ripping that skill from them and likely doing more harm. Learning skills this way will not necessarily give you the necessary capabilities to use them; this can give you a master’s skill at swordplay but not their muscles, or a sorcerer’s knowledge and skill in magic, but not their innate talent of mystical energy."
708,,600,Martial Memory Adaptation,The God of High School Jump,Lore ,"You were born with a talent for Martial Arts and an even greater talent for copying off of others. All it takes is a single instance of a martial arts technique being performed in front of your eyes for you to not only learn how to do it, but also understand the principles behind it. That kick you saw isn’t just a way to move the muscles in your body but a way to control your opponent’s momentum as well and to lead up to a new attack leading on. This isn’t just for mundane martial arts. Even forms of fighting that involve magic or supernatural elements can be instantly understood by you. It has to be Martial Arts, not just an attack spell or power that buffs the user, but you can instantly copy and understand any sort of Ki attack or special martial skill that you see. Of course, if you don’t have the necessary qualities to perform what you copy, you won’t be able to use it, but you’ll still gain a deep understanding of how the technique works.

Boosted: Just a single technique is quite small scale for you. You understand the technique and the ideas behind it, it's not hard to expand that knowledge in an instant. You don't just copy singular techniques anymore, you're able to draw out entire sets at once when you see a fighting technique. See someone perform a kick technique? You'll be able to figure out, understand and be able to expertly perform a large section of that entire fighting style just by extrapolating from that kick. You won't take in everything but anything that could be related to what you copied will appear in your mind.

709,,600,Genuine Genius,The God of High School Jump,Lore ,"More matters in a fight then brawn or skill. Having a canny and brilliant mind can allow you to triumph over those with more power or talent then you any day of the week. In fact, you not only possess a merely brilliant mind but one that surpasses all but one other human in its ingenuity and acumen. Your only peer, Baek Seung-Chul, had learnt nine languages fluently and had mastered physics, chemistry and mathematics by age nine, adding mastery of many western and eastern philosophies by age eleven and mastering both medicine and countless forms of modern sport by age thirteen. Not only is your learning rate a match for this genius but so too is your analytical skill. You can easily pick out all the strengths and weaknesses of a martial art, just from witnessing a single serious fight involving a practitioner of it and thus develop countermeasures against that Martial Art to destroy that martial artist.

Boosted: The wise learn from their mistakes, the brilliant plan ahead to avoid mistakes before they've even made them. Your planning capability is second to none, at least in terms of how you are able to simulate almost any situation at all purely in your mind. With an above 99% accuracy, you're able to predict how almost any event will go so long as you have at least a handful or two of information about it. You'll never lose a bet on a horse race or fight unless something genuinely miraculous occurs or someone purposefully throws a fight. You can simulate long sequences of events or distant things in your mind too, greatly assisting long term planning. Who needs fortune tellers?

710,,600,A New Era of Martial Arts,The God of High School Jump,Lore ,"And a new phase of human evolution. Through sheer effort and talent, you managed to bypass a part of the Taboo that seals Humanity’s potential away from them. This has not granted you increase power, rather it has unlocked the potential you have to grow. When it comes to training, you are tenfold the speed of any other human. Training, in this case, is not useless book learning or the memorisation of martial techniques. Training is the improvement of your physical muscles and the growth of your life energy, things which can only be improved by putting in the work, regardless of how clever one might be. With the speed at which your power now grows, the idea of reaching the level of the Gods seems far less far-fetched now.

Boosted: There's nothing like a good War to kick-start the development of new technologies. Both the sort you buy in a store and the sort you learn in a dojo. Martial Arts is every bit a science as weapons manufacturing in this respect. When a great conflict approaches or is happening around you, you'll start to train even faster. The bigger the conflict? The bigger the boost you get. A street fight with your best friend set up a week in advance? There'll be something but it won't be much. A fast approaching war with a entire world of immensely powerful Gods that will cover the entire world? You'd be stuffing years of growth into days of training.

711,,600,Key to the Cosmos,Chainsaw Man,Lore ,"A warehouse attachment that contains a pocket dimension wherein a large cylindrical library with infinite descending levels of books containing all of the knowledge in each universe you visit lies. Each Jump a new “pillar” is added (as is one for every previous Jump before this) which contains all the knowledge in that Jump’s universe. Each floor/level contains a different ‘clearance’ of books, with the first level being immediately accessible and containing only a small amount of books on surface-level common knowledge within the verse. To unlock further levels you will have to complete increasingly difficult tasks as well as know and understand the majority of knowledge contained on the previous levels. There is no way to bypass this process. The shape this library takes besides these rules is generally up to you, as anything from Victorian to empty space with books materializing when you want them is fine. The knowledge in any level you have “conquered” is within your full reach and you will never forget it regardless of outside influence or the passage of time. Furthermore, you can impose parts of or the whole of this knowledge onto those in your line of sight, eventually being able to overload minds once you’ve gathered a great amount of knowledge. Upon obtaining your Spark, you will gain a final pillar that contains information on your Benefactor, the Spark, and the Jumpchain itself as well as an access card that allows you to pass to any levels in your other pillars. However, if you fail your Chain or opt to discontinue it you will never be able to reach another level again. Who can say what kind of secrets you will find in this final and greatest pillar?"
712,,600,Time Bleed,Fate/Stay Night,Lore ,"When a being meets its future self, the two will contradict each other. This contradiction causes the lines between the timelines of each of them to blur and the past self will begin to take on the memories and skills of its future self when in each other's direct presence. An impossibly rare phenomenon...until you came along. Perhaps not as strong but nevertheless, somehow you can cause contradictions with any single being at a time. You are able to choose one being at a time to copy skills, knowledge and memories, while in that beings presence. You leech one hour of memories or skills worth for every two hours which you spend in your chosen beings presence. Active interaction, whether that be a pitched battle or intimate combat, could speed this up to triple its usual speeds. Fair warning, just knowing something doesn't necessarily mean you have the ability to use it and beings will eventually become aware of what you are doing, instantly so with physical contact. 

Boosted: Time Bleed has now grown so that your abilities in causing temporal contradictions have morphed into a way to protect yourself from such temporal anomalies. Unlike the original use of this ability, which is focused on a single other entity, the effect is now centred on you. When active, this anti- contradiction effect prevents any ability or effect relating to the manipulation of time within a range of ten metres. Attempts to slow, stop, accelerate or time travel within this range fail, even if the intended target is not you. While not directly related to time, this field also prevents certain effects from altering the relationship of cause and effect, though this only applies to effects that would swap the place in time of either cause or effect.

And a weapon has no need for petty things such as likes or dislikes or quirks. All that you needed was the ability to adapt to any situation and to understand your targets. Learning new concepts, such as skills or languages or entire cultures, is as easy as breathing to you. You did in a day what took others five, no matter the subject. And when they became jealous of your speed, it was not something you could not understand. Your incredible understanding of emotions and people letting you know what a man felt just by what his face looked like, with only the most tightly controlled being able to mask their emotions from your eyes. This attention to detail assists you in other endeavours too, from near instantly sweeping a room for anything that could be used as a weapon to picking out individuals from crowds of thousands, your skills of perception lie unmatched.

Boosted: Hollow Vessel now allows you to apply your own increased learning rate to any students you take up and, much like your own teachers trained you, you have a particular skill with teaching anything related to assassination. The empathy you gained has also increased to the point that you are able to sense the emotions of those around you, whether you can see their faces or not. Only people with enough control to prevent themselves from feeling emotion at all will be able to hide their feelings from you.

The Reod and subsequent fall of Elantris meant the near obliteration of almost all knowledge of AonDor, the glyphs that produced the city’s magical wonders. With the city in ruins and all former practitioners dead or insane, it fell to one hopeful prince to resurrect the nearly dead language of Elantrian magic. Like Raoden, you are now a luminary of all things Investiture and have a talent for uncovering lost knowledge. With just the briefest exposure to an Invested Art or other system of magic, you could begin to deduce the methods and rules that govern its use. Given proper resources, you could delve deeply into the secrets of the Cosmere. With enough time, you’ll revolutionize the magical systems you practice."

The hard drive before you has the collected research, notes and findings on every piece of technology and magic utilised by the Chaldea organisation.

One much like yourself. You have incredible natural talent in everything you do, whether that be painting or casting spells, fighting or creating artificial homunculi bodies. This natural talent not only allows you to start with a shocking amount of skill in anything you try your hand at, as if you’d already been practising for months, but it allows you to learn even more in any subject you put your mind to than any other, progressing at several times the speed of any of your peers. You could accomplish in just a month what takes other scientist’s years and move on to learn even more disciplines on top of that one. 

Boosted: The progress of science gets faster and faster as time goes on and you, as one of those at the forefront of mankind’s evolution, are no different. The more you learn, the faster you’ll learn more. The more knowledge you obtain, the easier it is to obtain more knowledge.

Yet here you are, having earned your spot in the ranks of mankind’s legends. How? You got so damn good that you made the mundane become magical.

Now while their full power is lost alongside L Corp’s singularity, you can still make use of them by using the abnormalities’ books like you would those of random City dwellers. However due to their unstable state, you can only use their power for a short while instead of constantly like back in L Corp, and also they require charging after each use which is done by heightening your emotional tension, similar to how it was described in Emotions, Quantified. You get access to all abnormalities available within the Library(doesn’t include Great Split: Horizontal/Vertical, Pú Láo, Yá Zì, or Tāo Tiè) at its peak, as well as from any abnormalities not shown there, including yourself if you were one in L Corp.

The phrases will be specifically about whatever the target is doing at the time, so using it in a fight will have different results than if they’re filing their taxes or something. The notebooks will also state the target’s name, affiliation, and what they’re doing when it was used on them, when the notebook is full it will erase the first half of its pages and when filled up again it will erase the latter half.

This vial is an amazing prize since drinking it will give a short lived migraine as you gain the equivalent of 1 years dedicated research into any subject you desire as if using all the resources you could possibly access without help. Most importantly is that it takes into consideration all of your intellect perks and any information resources you have and does the research as if you have each relevant part at your fingertips so it's as if you move from book to book learning and understanding what you research as if you never stop and are flawlessly memorizing and comprehending what you study. Obviously it's better if you have access to more resources and this is amazingly useful for experimentation since you can conduct as many experiments within a year as if you always have your max amount of resources while making the most of the time as possible.

That isn’t what makes you abnormal even with your flawless memory and frankly unreal learning rate. No, what makes your mind abnormal is how your mind can subconsciously piece together information expanding your understanding of absolutely everything you know and allow you to use your knowledge to further expand your own knowledge. With the knowledge of this world the only other person who had a mind like this was fully capable of going from a highly crippled princess to a world renown genius mage and scientist and eventually the literal source of the apocalypse. Due to this your mind is extremely rigid to the point that you could defend mental attacks from groups of world class psychics without hassle and your mind is so tough, extremely durable and dangerous things for the mind to even know simply can’t harm you unless the knowledge would damage even eldritch gods minds(memorize the necronomicon for all I care it can’t harm you just cause you know it now)."

This is a lesson you have internalized, in both body and spirit - your training in both combat and mental ability is greatly increased. You will quickly become competent and then a savant of a fighting style you focus on, and any mistakes or hardships you endure quickly become experience that gives you perfect clarity on what to avoid doing on a second encounter. Not only are you a master of growth and turnabout, but you’re especially good at passing down these skills and advancement to your peers and minions, letting them operate not in your shadow but by your side. With the right time and lessons, you can topple a foe who relied too hard on innate power with nothing but determination and cleverness in a fight."
726,,600,Just That Good ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Lore ,"In the 80s and before, the power of sorcerers and cursed spirits was roughly balanced, or perhaps tipped slightly in the favour of the latter. Then, in 1989, Satoru Gojo was born, and the balance of power was forever shifted. Some of this was due to the sorcerer possessing both the Limitless technique and Six Eyes, but that was not all. He was also a natural innovator, someone who broke the limits of what was considered possible, to the point that even the King of Curses was surprised by the things he could pull off.

While you may lack in raw power, proficiency with cursed energy is something you have in excess. You have a great understand of not just any cursed technique you might have, but all of your supernatural powers. You’re fully aware of their limits and capabilities, allowing you to push them to their limits and pull off feats with them few others would expect. Your skill is at the level that for you, the rules of any power system or ability you use seem to be that bit looser. For instance, while normally one’s cursed technique is ‘burned out’ after using a Domain Expansion, making it unusable for a good while, you’d be able to figure out a way to heal your brain and regain your technique in a fraction of the time, something considered impossible by anyone else. Similarly, while some might only be able to fire an ability in a straight line, you’d be able to figure out how to make it curve around corners or even home in on your foes, and a technique that cuts things at range could be made to cut through space itself. You won’t be able to completely change the technique or power into something else, but so long as it’s still recognisably the original and doesn’t provide a direct increase in power, it’ll probably be possible."

Such a statement may ring hollow in a world such as this, where certain beings are born with the innate ability to directly manifest the very concept of infinity in reality in order to warp space or increase their own mass to the point that they become a black hole, but there is still some truth to it. After all, while one may have a cursed technique from birth, this does not come with mastery of it, and a bit of intelligence can go a long way in this matter.

You’ve got an incredible intellect, enough that those around you would quite rightly consider you a genius. Learning new things comes easily to you, able to figure out the basics in no time at all, and reaching mastery in far less time than most others. Even if you were completely unaware of cursed energy’s very existence, upon becoming a sorcerer it wouldn’t even take you two weeks to become equal in power to a grade 1 sorcerer, just by figuring out its rules and the best ways to use it. For context, most sorcerers sit at grade 3 and will never even reach grade 2, and those with great levels of talent would usually take many years to achieve the level of mastery of their cursed technique needed for grade 1. Your intelligence undeniably lets you push your abilities to greater heights than most, coming up with uses for your techniques that would never have occurred to others. Who knows how far you could get in a few years of practice?

Naturally, your speed of learning also applies to mundane subjects, as well as other supernatural power systems you may come into possession of."
728,,600,Against All Odds,Final Fantasy VII,Lore ,"Are you noticing a theme with some of these yet? When you and a group of people work together long enough, you will find not only do they mesh surprisingly well despite conflicting personalities or history, but their abilities all synergize with each other despite vast differences between them. But going beyond that, you will find that those who work with you for a long period of time quickly find their natural growth and experience skyrocketing considerably, as if racing to meet your own level. So long as they have the capability to, those who are less experienced, skilled, or powerful than you will quickly grow to meet you at your own level all while their teamwork abilities with each other improves in turn. This also tends to increase their personal loyalty and fondness to you as time goes on. Let your bonds elevate them."
729,,600,Imperial Privilege,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Lore ,"The quality possessed by any true emperor, a title which has not eluded some Sabers. The majesty and, some say, the authority of your position allows you to lay claim to things that you shouldn’t. You can instantly develop new Servant Skills, up to three at a time of notable strength, so long as you can vaguely justify some reason you may have developed such things in the past. Even magical powers or biological alterations, such as gaining Divinity, are possible to achieve. While such powers do remain accessible as long as one desires, mental damage or shakeups can cause you to forget them and lose access to your choices for a few hours, though you can choose something else too. A psychic attack or a terrible migraine is all it can take to shake your hold. 

An Emperor Saber is, in almost all cases, a proud thing. Of themselves and their nation, they have the highest opinion and many will not even see a difference between the two entities. Whether they’re a saint or a tyrant, they tend to have a great deal of self love. "
730,,600,Invincible Sword,Honkai Impact 3rd,Lore ,"In all of Schicksal’s history, few have reached the heights of their ranks so much as Bianka Ataegina, codenamed “Durandal”. At the mere age of twelve, she managed to fully investigate and even absorb a bubble universe into herself, and today is considered the organisation’s strongest operative, bar none.

But despite what went on behind the scenes, the plans that surrounded her and charted her path, ultimately her greatest strength isn’t just the sheer talent she possessed, but the will to train herself even beyond what most would consider ‘normal’, or even ‘expected’. To put it bluntly, when she was expected to put in ten times the effort to reach S-Rank, she instead went for a hundred times.

You may not have a bubble universe backing you, but you have what it takes to step into the halls of history yourself. From a mere B-rank you could ascend to stand up to Durandal herself, if only for a relatively short amount of time, with only a few months of training. But where this excels is when you are truly in conflict, as your capacity for learning skyrockets past even what was possible before. Perhaps you could truly match the Invincible Sword someday.

This isn’t just combat techniques, either; literature, science, you do possess a somewhat lesser talent for just about anything a Valkyrie should know...even one that’s gone rogue for whatever reason. Hmm...something tells me she has a lot in common with another girl...

Boosted: Your will now physically manifests as talent. The longer and the more intensely you train, the faster and more easily you get stronger. This is a recursive loop. The more you train, the easier it gets, and the easier it gets, the more you can gain by putting in the same amount of effort. In conflict, you are able to learn and master skills a thousandfold faster, being able to learn and master entire styles of fighting in only a few clashes with a user of said styles.

But there are those who are not talented enough to reach the highest levels of martial arts. Some suffer from a twist in their soul, a lust for power that perverts their ability to learn the mental state necessary to climb higher. Others simply are not suited for the path they trod so eagerly. These scrolls offer a solution to those who wish to learn the secrets of Blitz, but are not capable of learning the abilities for one reason or another. When used in conjunction with instruction from a person who already knows the art, the student will be imbued with the magic necessary to perform Blitz techniques. Even custom techniques using Blitz that were created by the master can be taught with this scroll."
732,,600,The Great Forge Book,God Of War (2018),Lore ,"This book is a rather simple looking book, however it contains great knowledge. This book will show you how to create any item that you have heard of or seen from not only this Jump but any previous Jumps. This includes things like divine items or objects like Mjolnir, though there are limits. The limits are less on the book and more on its users abilities. For instance there are some things that you simply won’t be able to replicate, no matter your skill, like the Deathly Hallows making one the “Master of Death”. While this can be overcome with great power, it would be easier to simply gather the Hallows by yourself. Furthermore, the more powerful the object the greater the materials will need to be to recreate the object at its full power."

With this perk you can quickly learn new techniques that are related to a craft that you have mastered, an example would be a master blacksmith from the Nine Realms could go to Japan and just by seeing the process or analyzing a blade they could instantly understand the techniques used to create the blade and how to use them for their own works as long as the technique is below their skill level."

Not only can you process information faster, allowing you to comprehend what is happening around you at a faster rate than most and letting you break down information at a faster rate, but you also have a great talent for teaching others lessons from events that have happened in the past. Additionally you have a great gift for coming up with rapid responses without panicking. Your king angrily demands why your advice failed him? You know just what to do that would leave you blameless and either cool his rage or at least direct it elsewhere. Finally, any world you enter you will know the true history of it, knowing who really ruled that kingdom, how that person really died, etc. The only downside is that you cannot know a being’s fatal weakness, for instance if they needed to be struck by silver under the full moon to be rendered killable you would not be able to learn of it with this perk until you yourself found the weakness."

Your ability to learn new magic has been tripled and no magic is impossible for you to learn, though it can be very difficult at times. For example if it was a magic that anyone could theoretically learn, and wasn't particularly strong by itself, then you would be able to learn the basics in a matter of hours if you dedicated yourself to it, but if it was a magic that required a specific bloodline or affinity to use then you would have to spend a few weeks figuring out how to get around the requirements before you would be able to learn the magic itself. Similarly the more powerful the magic itself is the longer it would take for you to learn how to use it."
737,,600,God of War,God Of War (2018),Lore ,"You find that your combat prowess seem to grow endlessly, though they seem to grow the fastest when in combat. Whether it be your reaction time, your reflexes, your martial prowess and skill, how you use magic in fights, or even just how to dodge while making minimal movements you will always find that you can go further. Keep in mind that you grow slower if you vastly outmatch your opponents, not growing any faster than if you were training alone. If you fought your equal then your growth rate would triple and if you fought a challenge like an army or your superior in combat? Your growth would accelerate to give you the skills you need to fight on equal footing with them."

But take a closer look: These are the personal effects of a Magician, the left- behind comprehensive research about how to use one of the True Magics as well as the reagents and artifacts needed to channel it as a professional magus would magecraft. It will take time and diligent study for even many of the greater mages, but with enough determination it might just be possible to unlock the power detailed here; a mediocre magus might take six or so generations to make that breakthrough. And if you know True Magic already? This trove is pretty much like having a mentor walking alongside you."
743,,600,The Eye Facing the Fear; Breaking the Cycle,Library of Ruina,Lore ,"Ah, but this has been keeping you too long, hasn’t it? You want the main draw of the Library, the appeal which draws in every poor soul destined to become a tome for cheap perusal: The very books they’ll become. 

Upon slaying a being capable of an independent existence, you may choose for them to not quite die, but for their being to become a book that lands at your feet. These books can be read to find out anything the former individual knew, though it might be a bit of a chore, allowing you to form your own grand repository of knowledge. However, perhaps more importantly (particularly for your kind), these books can be torn apart for pitiless plunder of their users’ skills. You see, hidden within each book amongst every thought and memory is the key page, a record of one's more fundamental being and passive abilities, and a smattering of combat pages representing their techniques. If you were to rip them from their bindings, you would find that they can be absorbed by yourself or those who otherwise obtain them, obtaining a facsimile of their abilities. Though, this is not to be confused with a perfect copy: You may find that those truly above you in stature may have certain limits they lacked before, or be missing their most horrifying abilities. 

But a lack of perfect mimicry can also be to your benefit: You may find, if you’re further willing to deface your new literature, that a limited number of abilities may be torn from key pages you have no intention to put into your soldiers, and combined with those you do to bolster them. Meanwhile, combat pages are generally interchangeable, though on occasion either may be so unique as to be inseparable from their original source. 

Fortunately for your Books loved ones, or perhaps your conscience, this isn’t necessarily a permanent state. While holding a book, you can revert all attributions, returning it to a clean slate, and from there you can return them to human form. Alternatively, you may fight them again to return from your past battlefield with a more comprehensive table of contents, repeating their strife to highlight new combat pages or interesting trivia. As long as the competition was a fair choice, who cares what you do with your spoils?

Boosted: Your EGO has taken upon itself the traits of a Bucket, though to be clear, not one for drawing water so much as ferrying pieces of the collective unconscious into reality in the form of Abnormalities. As you accumulate books and grow in power, your own psyche will reach out to commonalities between itself and the shelves of books you have made, creating monsters or strange objects based upon your perception, your flaws, and your virtues taken to their logical extremes. Some may even form from metaphors for particularly momentous events. Almost all of them will be monstrous and rowdy, but at least decently under your control as their originator and an effect of your ego. Perhaps your might not be able to direct the ever paranoid and watchful beast formed from a companion betraying you to not investigate anyone, but you can ensure it only goes for those you wish dead when it inevitably finds proof of them working against you, or just refuse to manifest it when you have no use for it.

These monsters can also be manifested partially, allowing invocations of their essence through your EGO to grant particular traits of them to yourself. For instance the aforementioned beast of betrayal might grant you its ever vigilant eyes, or make your attacks strike harder the more you focus on a single target. In the event you also possess Those Who Are Faithful and Trustworthy, this can be taken to an extreme, yourself and an abnormality fusing together briefly for one grand attack bringing to bear the totality of the Abnormality’s essence against your foes. Or, perhaps, a more lasting union, with enough light…?

Learn swordsmanship from Okita Souji and Lancelot du Lac, get started in magic with the advice of Odin, Ajuka, or Merlin, learn how to get swole like Strada, etc. Thinking on something you want to archive with automatically open the relevant pages.

This is the ‘Kankara Formula’, once the precious and exclusive magic of Ajuka, and now something that you as well possess. With it you can easily take over the magic attacks of your opponents, copy their powers, redirect them, mess with the natural occurrences of the world and more. Beyond that, you’re also his intellectual equal, and able to pull the same inventions he has created, provided you can obtain access to similar resources.

748,,600,Shifting Tactics ,Hades,Lore ,"Being dead does have a few benefits. After all, one cannot die a second time. The loss of a fight is no longer the end. And there are few that disagree with the idea that losing is always a learning experience. Combined this with the fact that, as a warrior of theHouse ofHades, you have access to most of the greatest combatants who have ever died and even the most talented of warriors could improve beyond what they thought possible.

The benefits you gain from this combination of fortunes are threefold. First, your combat abilities will never become dull simply because they are not used. A weapon as finely honed as your skills will never rust simply because it is left in its sheath for an extended period of time. Secondly, you gain a keen insight into the tactics of your opponents and are able to learn something from every bout with them. Win or lose, you will discover a new insight that will allow you to come closer to defeating them each time. Finally, should you eventually find your way back to the world of the living, some of your experience returning from death so frequently will remain with you. Once each decade, when a blow would normally strike you down, you will instead rise to stand tall and once again almost instantly. Your wounds will be healed and your vigor for battle fully restored."

From how to create your own Lesser Holy Grail and Greater Holy Grail, to how to modify some of the rules of the rituals, like allowing for more Servants to be summoned and Extra classes to join. While the knowledge is here, you probably will need the help of many experts in several areas, or just to steal from others in order to get this running on your own. However, with this alone you will likely not be able to recreate Heaven's Feel, as that is a secret closely guarded by the Einzbern. Yet, both Servant summoning and creating your own Wish Granter device are on the table.

In future jumps, you will have these plans adapted to somehow function into the land you find yourself in, provided you can fuel the huge amount of magical energy needed to start up the Holy Grail."
750,,600,The Great Detective,Fate/Strange Fake,Lore ,"In a world of living tales and closely guarded mysteries, those who are able to bring light are hated and feared regardless of their actual power. And you got the makings of one of the most feared enemies of Mystery: a detective. A genius with few peers when it comes to how quick your mind can make connections and solve problems.

Not only that, but your knowledge of myths, history, and popular culture around the world is near flawless. You carry within your mind an extensive library of tales and facts of any place you visit, a resource that you draw upon to make sense of any mystery and puzzle you encounter. And even when you visit a truly unknown place, you quickly gather a similar trove of knowledge. Your understanding of these narratives enables you to identify the threads of influence they have on the world around you, and you can weave these threads into your own investigations and deductions. If you were to be the protagonist of a mystery novel, it is almost certain that no crime that is presented to you would go unsolved.

However, this has its most potent effect in the world of Magi. Even the most arcane enigmas unravel under your gaze, and even the inner works of Magecraft can be deduced from the scantest of evidence, even when it comes to second hand tellings. Your understanding is so profound that you can dissect and dismantle the Mysteries of other magi, decreasing the value of their mysteries, and opening a path to bring them down. This makes you a formidable foe to any who would seek to oppose you with Magecraft, and a valuable ally to those who respect your abilities.

Despite potentially lacking in powerful Magecraft or boasting average magic circuits, your ability to unravel Mysteries makes you both feared and revered in the world of magus. Finally, as a detective, it also seems that you seem to be constantly attracted to the most bizarre situations, where your intellect is put to the test and new mysteries are presented to you."

This won’t let you become a true ‘Ace’ in said abilities or skills instantly, but you’ll quickly build a foundation into the road to becoming an expert, so long as you take the time to learn more. In addition, you know how to properly use your skills and powers in conjunction with each other, creating your own personalized fighting styles or scientific practices.

756,,600,Sygaldry,The Owl House,Lore ,"Every spell starts with a circle. For most Witches and Demons, the physical process ends there. But magic is woven into the very fabric of the Demon Realm, and even the most unlikely of spellcasters can tap into the magic around them. Like Luz Noceda, you have discovered this long-lost form of magic. By drawing a complete spell circle and its accompanying runes on a surface, you can create constructs of elemental magic. The bigger the circle, the bigger the effect.

Unlike the typical spells used by modern Witches and Demons, Sygaldry draws on the magical energy in the environment, not the caster. This allows anyone to perform magic so long as they know the proper glyphs and enough energy exists in their immediate environment. This does mean that Sygaldry will fail in the Human World, where there is no ambient magic.

You start out knowing two of the basic glyphs, allowing you to produce simple constructs made of two of the following elements: light, ice, plants, and fire. You can discover the remaining two basic glyphs by observing your natural surroundings, and different combinations of these glyphs can be linked to create complex effects. A few weeks of experimentation might let you create a cloud of mist with paired fire and ice glyphs, but study long enough and complex effects like invisibility and even teleportation can be achieved.

This is not the simple finger waving of modern Witches and Demons. This is a more complex and difficult way, but it may be all you have. Even still, there’s lots of potential here for eager and creative minds.

To use Sygaldry, ambient magic must be an explicitly stated quality of your current world or dimension. For example, Roshar of the Stormlight Archives, both the Mortal and Spirit Realms of the Dresden Files setting, and Mekka of Twokinds all have magic that exists in the environment before being drawn in and used by spellcasters. Sygaldry would not function in settings where magic is an innate ability, such as the Wizarding World of Harry Potter or any other world where magic is something you’re born with. You can bypass this restriction by packaging your runes with a “battery” or attached magical power supply, but this will require some experimentation."
757,,600,Illuminating,The Owl House,Lore ,"The Demon Realm is a magical place, and thanks to the efforts of a certain authority figure, not even the finest witches know all the secrets their magic holds. Maybe all they need is an outside perspective. You have an inquisitive mind perfectly suited to deciphering the intricacies of the magic that surrounds you. Your research could set new limits on what your coven is capable of, or even uncover the root source of magic on the Boiling Isles. In future worlds, you’ll decode new systems of magic with similar ease. If there really is a way for humans to use magic, your curiosity ensures that you’ll be the one to uncover it."

This massive library is a repository of a large array of knowledge, from natural sciences to the arcane. It currently houses all the knowledge that Seath would have accumulated right before the Chosen Undead made their way to him, but that is not the end. For each world you visit, and have already visited, the library will gain new sections and new books containing all known magical lore from the world in question."
759,,600,Chosen Undead,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore ,"In a time yet to come, a certain undead would fulfill an ancient prophecy, but it would raise a certain question; did they succeed because they were always meant to be the Chosen Undead, or did they become chosen because they managed to succeed? Regardless as to the specifics, you share a few similarities with that future figure, namely in your incredible luck, as well as the ability to quickly learn and master any skills you try your hand at. You could go from a novice to a master swordsman in a fraction of the time typically needed.

Not only do you become aware of the strengths, weaknesses and best strategies to battle monsters here, it becomes simple to gather such knowledge in future worlds on anything known as a ‘monster’. 

Through a mixture of skills, charisma and often incredible luck, you find yourself easily gathering the tools and allies needed to help you take on the monster you currently hunt. And this good fortune is only magnified during the final battle itself, with you and your allies able to conquer over what should be impossible odds. A small group of well educated and well armed humans laying low the No-Life King, for example."
762,,600,Astronomer’s Diary,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales,Lore ,"Galileo Galilei spent his life searching for the Trident of Poseidon. Eventually he succeeded and recorded his findings in a diary for future explorers. This gem-encrusted journal is a copy of the very same, which followed diligently, will lead you to Poseidon’s Tomb. Should you ever reach the Tomb, you will find that the ruby embedded in the cover is key to acquiring the Trident, so be sure not to lose it. For each jump you visit after this, you will discover a similar set of notes in your possessions. Whatever form it takes, each will lead you to a powerful treasure or set of treasures thought to be lost, long faded into legend. Mysteriously, other factions may start taking such legends more seriously as you begin your journey."
763,,600,Madman’s Library,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales,Lore ,"Anything an aspiring occultist could ask for, this is a huge collection of pamphlets, diaries, novels and just about anything else regarding supernatural and mysterious occurrences in this world, all stored in a library attached to your Warehouse or another property you own. Notes, private journals, and articles, just about the only thing that can’t be found here is information which is inherently useful or supernatural, such as maps to hidden treasure or books containing magical rituals. It still has everything you’d need to start investigating such things, and though not all of this information is perfectly accurate, a small grain of truth can be found in any that you care to read. This collection will update in future worlds to include copies of any information regarding myths, urban legends, mysteries, cryptids and anything else of similar flavor that’s even slightly true. The only condition is that “private” and “secret” information must be in circulation somewhere around the world. Nothing found in these halls will have been actively guarded or hidden."
764,,600,Smarty Pants ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Lore ,"Let us be honest, there is always going to be someone more knowledgeable than you... well at least that would be the case if you were not wearing these pants. Wearing these pants gives the wearer superior knowledge on everything there is to know."
765,,600,The Smart One,Wizards of Waverly Place,Lore ,"Justin Russo has shown a genius level intellect throughout the series. Not only was he valedictorian, a robotics expert, and presumably the youngest headmaster of WizTech, he was also intelligent enough to create water engines and even merge science and technology to create life. And now, you possess an intellect on par with Justin Russo. Furthermore, if you did purchase the Magic Perk, you start on par with a 15 year old Justin, and are skilled at combining magic, and science."
766,,600,Can’t Make A Bomb Without Oregano,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Lore ,"It’s not enough to just be knowledgeable, or to just be good with your hands- anyone could be one or the other, but it takes someone with true talent to apply their mind and body towards their craft; not just to build on what others have taught them, but to make their own discoveries and inventions in the pursuit of greater mastery. You are one such person- you might not be a “genius” as far as most university professors would call it, but you are certainly one of the better engineers and inventors that this world has to offer. Your talents truly shine when you are working on something that belongs to a field you are truly passionate about- take Gaetan ""Mole"" Molière, for instance, who had patents on over 59 independent mining and excavation related tools or vehicles before he reached his forty years of age, having started his tinkering at the ripe age of fifteen. Not only that, but his works were truly beyond his time- microscopic goggles that could see germs and burrowing machines capable of digging through volcanic rock among them. So long as you hold the same passion for your work as he does for dirt, you’ll find that breakthroughs and inventions that beggar belief are well within your area of expertise. "
767,,600,You And That Little Book,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Lore ,"Like a sponge, a person absorbs knowledge over the course of their life. You’d think that an ordinary person would be at a distinct disadvantage when compared to an Atlantean, who has had hundreds or even thousands of years to learn and grow. But then again, considering Atlantis’s current state you’d be wrong- but it helps that the rate at which you learn is, frankly, astonishing. Furthermore, you have a habit of stumbling upon lost or forbidden knowledge- the stuff of cultures long since past, or even the secrets that their own people have forgotten about. Knowledge of the esoteric, the scientifically advanced, and the magical all seem to end up in your hands at one point or another. Finally, you find it much easier to disseminate this knowledge to others- a quick demonstration of how to control a vehicle is enough to make someone who’s never driven before a passable pilot, and a few months could see you rebuilding an entire civilization from the ground up; elevating them from a tribal society to one with a much more modern culture."
768,,600,Trainer of Heroes,Disney’s Hercules,Lore ,"Not for you to take the center-stage in smiting monsters and rescuing damsels. Rather, your skills lie more in what comes before. You are a truly unbelievably skilled teacher and trainer of people. You have a grasp on the finer point of the art of passing information on to other people that would be the envy of even the likes of Philoctetes and Chiron, let alone ordinary teachers.

Any subject, skill, technique or ability you know, you know how to teach to others several times as fast as normally possible, to the extent that you can cover decades worth of material in months, years at the most.

The curious part about this is that this is not limited to things that can conventionally be taught. Even techniques or abilities that require specific biological or magical factors can be taught thus, as you can pass on inferior copies of your own abilities to your students. It takes time for them for these copies to grow into proper abilities and potential, but it happens far more quickly than one would think."
769,,600,Zero to Hero,Disney Villains Victorious,Lore ,"What it takes to be a real hero is to stare danger in the face, grin with a fire in your eyes and come out on top. You’ve got an amazing potential in any skill you can pick up normally, as a sword swinger and fighter your name can go down in legend, as a wizard you could be a peer with Yen Sid and Merlin...all it takes is a little pressure and heat to turn you into a diamond. With training, dedication and overcoming hardship you basically can go from a somewhat scrawny nobody to a herculean force to be reckoned with in record time, especially when you’re put in fly or die situations...just don’t forget that the latter bit is on the table if you’re too reckless.

Of course, you must actually experience these moments of epiphany and actively demonstrate them in that moment to gain any benefit. They’re not limited to moral lessons, either - Machiavellian experiences are available for you villainous or pragmatic types. A show of hypocrisy or weakness after the fact won’t take your skills away...but it is a poor practice to play with your own heart like that, you know?"
770,,600,Someday Out of the Blue,Disney Villains Victorious,Lore ,"I guess ‘ol Aesop was on to something, huh? It’s about the journey, not the destination. The lessons and morals you internalize from the stories of your own travels are more important than locking yourself in your room and practicing the same sword swings. When you complete a significant personal objective, you will have an opportunity to internalize a new ‘moral’ or ‘lesson’ the experience had taught you the same way you would training and mundane experience. Simple things or techniques like ‘stick ‘em with the pointy end’ or ‘keep a cool head’ will make you just a bit better at something, while grand lessons like ‘friendship is worth more than power’ or ‘being a leader isn’t about doing what you want, but what your people need’ will see a meteoric rise in your skills or abilities that have room for growth - especially skills relevant to that lesson or the moment it is called for."
771,,600,Quick Learner,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Lore ,You can easily pick up new skills and adjust to new powers and abilities. You’ll be able to learn new things in about half the time it’d normally take you.

WIth this perk, you can take on a combination of knowledge and genius to rival Carol herself. Even as you face the gods themselves, do not let them underestimate your alchemy."
773,,600,Sorcerer Supreme,Dial,Lore ,"With this perk, you attain the powers of the Sorcerer Supreme, just like Doctor Strange. You gain access to an extensive array of mystical abilities and spells, allowing you to manipulate the fundamental forces of the universe. You can conjure magical shields for protection, project energy blasts, manipulate matter and energy, and even bend reality to your will. Your mastery over the mystic arts grants you the ability to traverse dimensions, communicate with otherworldly beings, and tap into ancient sources of magical energy. Your knowledge of spells and enchantments allows you to heal injuries, ward off supernatural threats, and manipulate time and space. With the powers of the Sorcerer Supreme, you become a formidable sorcerer, capable of wielding the very fabric of reality to defend the world from mystical threats."
774,,600,The Mystic Arts,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Lore ,"You now have the same tremendous potential for the mystic arts as Doctor Strange, being ""born for the mystic arts"". You also receive the same amount of skill and knowledge as Doctor Strange."
775,,600,Tomes of Power,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Lore ,"In all of time and space, two tomes inspire fear beyond even the gods themselves. The first, the Darkhold, is by far the best known. Containing profane information compared to blasting the universe’s deepest thoughts into a reader’s unsuspecting eyes, the countless spells and formulae within also translate to building machines that can harness energy from other worlds-or even coding. Horrifically corruptive, it’s malign influence can even drive artificial beings to evil while inflicting even signs of physical taint-and yet it’s addictive properties are not completely unfounded, for on top of everything the books serves as such a powerful amplifier for magical spells that a normal witch could briefly stand against the Scarlet Witch herself. As an example, the secret of dreamwalking (possessing an alternate universe variant) as well as forcibly taming and binding the souls of the damned who would punish such an act is gainable through mystic mastery of the Darkhold. While that same Scarlet Witch could use the tome as a focus to summon powerful demonic minions and unleash her full potential rapidly-even destroying every version of a target across the multiverse. By purchasing the Darkhold here, it will be bonded to you as it was to the Scarlet Witch-still heavily tempting, but no longer to the point of distorting you in ways you do not wish to be or driving you to self-destruction. Woe unto others who dare tamper with it’s pages.

The other tome is the Book of the Vishanti. Of it, only two things are known: It is the antithesis of the Darkhold, and it can grant a sorcerer anything they need to defeat a specific enemy-at least, a specific enemy from this universe. Assuming the sorcerer has time to read it and discover the answer, at least.

776,,600,"They’re Two Completely Different Powers, Actually",Loki,Lore ,"You’re no petty sorcerer messing with powers you don’t understand, you were actually paying attention when you were being taught. You have extensive knowledge of magic and can very easily explain even the most complex features of it to even the dullest and least interested audience. Though this is more if an in-depth academic understanding than genuine skill at doing it, you will quickly be able to understand even unfamiliar other forms of magic through brief observation or explanation. Even if you have no interest in being a teacher or scholar this could be useful for the ambitious. After all, understanding something is the first step to being able to manipulate it...

Boosted: Technicalities are wonderful when they’re on your side. For example, while being within the TVA supposedly supresses the use of any magical powers, preventing the use of illusions, conjuration, magical blasts or mind control through magical means, it doesn’t seem to universally remove or negate effects that were put in place outside of the TVA and brought inside. Otherwise, a Frost Giant that took on the appearance of an Asgardian while outside of the TVA would shift back to their natural form when taken inside the TVA. You’ll find that there will always be similar ways around effects that would supress or otherwise affect you or a power you have, such as being able to use something that’s technically not magic despite being very similar when magic is being blocked, or just creating a passive magical effect outside the anti-magic area and being able to retain it while inside. Perhaps you could even find a way to use a magical effect inside yourself and thus not technically within the area that the effect is prevented from working in. Unless the preventative effect was specifically put in place to stop what you’re doing and covers every conceivable approach to using it, you’re bound to find a way around it.

777,,600,Darkhold,Marvel Midnight Suns,Lore ,"Created by Cthon this book is the greatest literary piece on dark magic for this world. The item is the complete book including the Parchment of Power. Usually, it would be highly corruptible but as you are paying CP you could read the thing cover to cover and be totally sane. There is an untold number of spells within its pages based on sacrifice, offence and control."
778,,600,Lost Library of Cagliostro,Marvel: What If...?,Lore ,"Any Master of the Mystic Arts understands that the true gateway to power is knowledge. It is for this reason that the wise Cagliostro hid his library away from the world. Thankfully, you have a backdoor key. Protected by magical enchantments that gave even Dr. Strange pause, this library contains hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of books on the arcane arts. Even forbidden tomes and texts thought lost to time are all protected within this expansive stone structure. From now on, you may access the library at any time, conjuring a doorway to the mysterious jungle that hides this place from prying eyes. Even as you travel to future worlds the library will expand, allowing you to find all manner of magical texts and literature here."
779,,600,ONE SECOND HAS PASSED,Helltaker,Lore ,"When in a situation that requires careful planning or is any kind of Puzzle, you get an infinite amount of time to think. Be careful though, if ‘playing’ against someone, they also get infinite time to think their actions through. This can be turned on/off at will."
780,,600,Darkhold,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore ,"The Darkhold, also known as the Book of Sins, was a book of spells created by Chthon the First Demon. This book has two main powers. First the book is said to contain infinite knowledge. Spells, formula, advanced technology and numerous other examples of invaluable knowledge are within this book. Second, the book amplifies the user's magic. While using the book Scarlet Witch was capable of easily overpowering Strange and a number of other sorcerers at the same time. Since you are paying CP for this you will be immune to its corruptive effects and gain access to the entirety of its knowledge as soon as you acquire it. You may also gain a third eye like Dr. Strange to represent the boosted power you have obtained."
781,,600,Book of Vishanti ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore ,"The Book of Vishanti, known as the antithesis of the Darkhold, was an ancient book of knowledge and power that could be used by sorcerers. The book is supposedly capable of granting anything that is needed to defeat their foes. Little is known of the book's exact capabilities. We were however told that the book was used to stop an incursion between two universes. The book was capable of allowing Dr. Strange to resist Wanda’s magic while he possessed as well."
782,,600,Master of the Mystic Arts,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore ,The depths of magic are truly limitless and we have only seen a fraction of what this world is capable of. This perk makes you a true master of the mystical arts. You become a Sorcerer on par with Dr. Strange and the Ancient One. The amount of beings that surpass you in the mystical arts can be counted on one hand. This also boosts your talent in all magical fields. You could go from a complete novice in a field to a master in only a few months. Should you have a qualified teacher and ready sources of knowledge this time could be greatly shortened.
783,,600,Top Ten Brains,Avengers Vs X-Men,Lore ,"Right up there with the top ten now, aren’t you? You’ve become so smart that all the guys obsessed with such lists put you on the top ten smartest people on Earth list. It’s possible that the list guys are just your new peers. Whatever the case, you’re a bonafide genius now and there’s very few that can really hope to match up. You’ve got the raw intelligence, creativity and adaptability to keep pace with Stark, Parker and Banner as well as the very broad knowledge base expected of a super smart superhero or supervillain. You don’t know everything these smart guys know but you are extremely well versed in most sciences and academic areas, with a speciality in one field of your choice, from radiation to robotics to a more supernatural study like magic or cosmic energy."
784,,600,Seasoned and Powerful,Marvel Cosmic,Lore ,"You’ve been around the block. You have decades if not centuries of experience in exerting your will across the multiverse. All of your abilities are at the level of someone with decades of experience in that ability. You also have a complete and total knowledge and understanding of your capabilities and how to leverage them to their maximum capacity, especially when using them in tandem. You know how to use any allies or minions to their fullest and tend to know the capabilities of all of your enemies. As an added bonus, every person knows your name as one they should be afraid of if you so choose."
785,,600,Supreme Mind,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Lore ,"Your mind is one of the greatest in the world; like a super computer in its ability to process and store information. This means you have perfect memory, down to the minutest details, as well as a greater ability to process information on the fly. Your enhanced mind gives near instantaneous calculative abilities, as well as greatly increased resistance to unwanted mental effects, such as mind control, insanity, and memory alteration. Furthermore, your mind has infinite “memory”, as well as the ability to handle having infinite memory without being detrimental to your health. Finally, you can remove unwanted memories and information, in case you want to do some spring cleaning or remove potentially hazardous information."
786,,600,Teacher of Gifted Youngsters,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Lore ,"You’ve got a natural knack for teaching others about... pretty much anything, actually. From math to magic, you have the know-how to pass on pretty much any knowledge or skill that you’ve learned to others. It’ll take longer the more complex the subject is, but given enough time you can bring just about anyone up to your level of experience. "
787,,600,Innovative,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Lore ,"You're a true genius, the kind who can launch an industrial revolution single-handedly. You can easily come up with fantastic new concepts for solving almost any problem, and adapt existing ideas you've come up with to work using any resources available. While you might not be able to make a steam engine with stone age tools, that'll only be a problem for as long as it takes you to design the tools you need - which won't be long. This mindset isn't just limited to technology, either - you'll come up with novel strategies, fighting styles, and Bending moves just as easily."
788,,600,Summoning Handbook,Fate/Zero,Lore ,"This small handbook is a lot more valuable than it might immediately appear to be. Wrapped in human skin, and rather smelly because of it, this book describes a wide variety of summoning rituals and the methods and components needed to perform them. From various imps, ghouls and familiars, to the details for the Servant summoning ritual for sue during a Grail War, to even theoretical research on how to summon a True Demon, though there are no details on binding or control methods in this book. It will update in future jumps to detail new summoning rituals. This can be imported into."
789,,600,A Purpose or Lack Thereof   ,Fate/Zero,Lore ,"To some, the reason children learn so much faster than adults is that they have not yet experienced life, being like empty books to ascribe knowledge onto. Whilst you are no longer a child, you have an emptiness within you. The only thing that fills this empty space is knowledge. With this ability, you may focus it on one subject at a time. A particular style of combat or magecraft, a single discipline of academia or a single sport are examples of such subjects. You learn this subject in a tenth the time you would normally take to do so, racing through all the stages of skill and knowledge involved with it. However, just as you reach the verge of mastery, this chosen skill will become unaffected by this ability, leaving you to choose another target. The void within you desires purpose, but it is flighty and will seek variety, even if you desire otherwise.

Boosted: The purpose you have found is not limited to one subject. Rather, it is knowledge itself. Whilst the increased learning speed will still leave you just before you reach mastery in any skill or knowledge field, you are no longer limited to one specific task or area at a time.

790,,600,Library of Knowledge ,Toaruverse,Lore ,Having a library full of topics from mundane books to magic books of eldritch knowledge would be awesome but would be a hassle to protect and relocate. With this you gain the power of a certain index giving you an encyclopedic knowledge of all one hundred three thousand magic books of eldritch knowledge along with perfect indexing of your memories and knowledge that gives you perfect memory and allows you to retrieve information from your mind easily. You also gain a sub-consciousness that analyzes and gathers information or data that you encounter from all of your five senses and when you encounter problems or questions your consciousness would cross reference it from your knowledge and memories and give you the right answer with frightening accuracy. The resistance that you have for mental poisoning even from the grimoires have increased massively that mental poisoning from the grimoires are now negligible or a minor annoyance and the same can be said when facing eldritch horrors. This also makes you resistant to insanity giving creatures and events. This encyclopedic knowledge also updates every jump giving you the knowledge and information from all magic and science related books ever existed no matter how rare or one of a kind it is.
791,,600,Shorthand ,A Certain Magical Index,Lore ,"You can now create temporary, small, and imperfect grimoires with your knowledge of astrology by mixing the different symbols and colours of the four elements onto a sheet of paper. Despite the fact that no knowledge can be passed on with this method, it allows you to store and create a vast variety of spells of different levels of complexity. By writing symbols down in different ink colours and in different angles, you can create spells that range from repelling bystanders, fireballs, blades coming out from the ground, communication, or even counter attacking a person when he uses magic nearly instantaneously. However, you do need to bite down on the sheet of paper to activate the spell, and the spells disintegrate after an hour (less if your handwriting sucks, more if you have great penmanship). Nevertheless, being able to cast spells that would ordinarily require anything from long, large rituals, many magic circles, or a simple incantation at a bite is pretty damn amazing. Hope you can write fast and see threats coming. This technique is not found in any grimoire."
792,,600,Index,A Certain Magical Index,Lore ,"What people might start calling you very soon. You have a memory on par with that of a Certain Magical Index. In other words, you have a perfect memory, total recall, and extremely efficient memory indexing. Your analytical skills are also increased to boot, helping you use your knowledge a lot better. In addition, you have a vastly increased resistance to mental poisoning, and nigh- complete immunity to the form of mental poisoning a grimoire uses. A grimoire, or even 103,000 of them, won’t poison your mind any more, though reading that many grimoires will still be bad for your sanity unless you spread your reading out. However, you’d still be hard pressed to defend an assault from, say, a monster from the Cthulu Mythos or a Greater Daemon of Slaanesh, and even a perfect memory can be deceived. Still, it might be time to go on a quest as you “gotta [read] ‘em all”!"
793,,600,Knowledge Through Disintegration,League of Legends,Lore,"The best way to figure out how something works is to take it apart and look at it that way. The most efficient way to do this? Magic, of course! You gain a magical ability to disintegrate objects, machinery, and living beings in order to figure out how they work. You cannot glean the contents of an information-storage medium (such as a book, a USB, or a human brain) by disintegrating it, but you can learn how it works and possibly how to recreate it. This ability is difficult to use in combat- Your disintegration magic requires concentration and time to use most effectively, and using it with haste will not let you learn nearly as much information as if you'd spent the time to examine your subject properly. Bust enough heads, though, and I'm sure you'll get the jist eventually."
794,,600,In the Air Tonight,Super Dragon Sword,Lore,"It is not enough to hunt alone. The world must change if it wishes freedom: A change you can herald. You may spend a week giving someone your full attention to induct a person as a Godhunter, granting them the “Will of One”, “Keep Quiet”, “No Easy Way Out”, and “Light up the Night” perks. They do not start with a Job Stone, but may use yours to learn Jobs you know."
795,,600,Some Kind of Prodigy ,Ben 10,Lore,"Unlike some blockheads in the world, you understand how important it is to use your brain and learn things without just throwing yourself at a problem and thinking things will things work out. While you’re not necessarily a super genius like Azmuth or one of those mad science types, what you are is an incredibly fast learner when it comes to things using your noggin. You can pick up and breeze through college level textbooks at age ten and only go up from there, quickly memorizing and internalizing any information you wish with photographic clarity. That’s not the only thing, however! If you start learning a supernatural ability that depends on things like study, knowledge, formulas...like magic, for instance, you pick it up like a pro. You could go from an ordinary bookworm to a capable sorcerer in just a few days. Who knows what you could do with a few years?"
796,,600,Library Dweller ,Dracula Untold,Lore,"​Ancient scrolls and books are your bread and butter. You have tremendous skill when it comes to ferreting out ancient information, or even information that was deliberately hidden. You are a top-notch researcher, eminently capable of digging up even the most obscure lore or stories. Whenever faced with something you don’t know, you get a sort of instinct as to where you should look, and these pay off just about every time. Not only can you look up the details of even the most obscure, rare monsters, you can also dig up details of how to fight them, or contain them so they become harmless. Finally, you can also extend this research to any and all kinds of information. You’re an expert investigator, and you could find long-lost magical or scientific knowledge that others have been looking for centuries in days."
797,,600,Quick Learning,Dracula Untold,Lore,"When thrown in an entirely new situation, with strange powers and abilities, damaging and painful limits and problems, most would be lost. Not you, though. You can surprisingly always land at your feet in such situations, and more, you are always able to figure out the details of any and all powers and abilities you have at a truly unbelievable pace. The speed at which you learn to control them, to find new and powerful uses for existing things, or to recombine them in incredible ways is easily an order of magnitude faster than anyone else, if not more."
798,,600,Denarian,Dresden Files,Lore,"Oh boy. Where did you find one of these? ‘This’, in question, being the coin of a Denarian. But as if that wasn’t rare enough, this is rather more than that. While unlikely to be any more moral or righteous than their fellows, this Denarian is utterly unique in that they don’t want you to fall to the Hells and/or be their puppet. Instead, they’re content to be an impossibly knowledgeable advisor, sounding board and teacher, while letting you go about doing whatever you want entirely free of their influence. It seems like they’re giddy with the opportunity to actually get out of this universe with you at the end of this jump. For those not in the know, this is one of the Fallen Angels trapped in the Thirty pieces of Silver paid to Judas, a member of the Order of the Blackened Denarius. A being quite literally as old as the universe, the depth and breadth of what they know is beyond mortal (and most immortals') comprehension. And this isn’t one of the rank and file either, the Angel this coin holds is second only to Anduriel in terms of power and knowledge, not to mention having their own unique power that you get to define, that’s on the same level as being able to use any shadow in the world as a listening device. Any shadow, but not every shadow, mind you. An important difference. Alternatively, you can have them be any of the other angels you’re partial to… for whatever asinine reasons it might be. They do become a true ally in all the ways mentioned above."
799,,600,Archive,Dresden Files,Lore,"One of the most powerful beings in this world, for all that she’s a small child right now, is the latest of a long bloodline of women who have the power to know, instinctively and completely, every piece of knowledge and wisdom in the world. That’s a power you now have, too. You have access to... well, a Mental Archive that holds a real time, self-updating record of every single thing ever put to text, typed into a word processor, or otherwise documented/known. Every book, every homework assignment, every scrawl on every wall, the whole shebang. All that is now at your fingertips. Naturally, the magical knowledge this gives you is just about limitless, but more than that it makes you privy to a lot of immensely dangerous secrets. So much so that this perk comes with a bundled-in immunity to all Memetic threats and a ‘below the radar’ effect that makes it so you don’t count in any magical reckoning of such, so you won’t be dooming yourself and the world just by knowing some of this stuff. But seriously, the Archive is the lynchpin of a war against monsters sneaking into reality to destroy it, and unlike her you have no neutrality obligations. Do be careful. In future jumps this naturally updates accordingly. "
800,,600,Eternal Memories ,Dark Souls 2,Lore,"“The Curse, it afflicts all undead. It hangs over them as something more maliciously terrifying than death itself, as death cannot take them. Worse yet, they lose themselves, piece by piece until their old identity is gone, nothing but a hollow corpse remaining. You no longer have the flaw of ‘accidentally forgetting’ anything. If you desire to remember something, it will never leave your mind again. This even extends to memories of exactly how you felt when a specific thought crossed your mind, or a special moment happened. If you wish to relive the invigoration or sorrow of some past experience, it is simply a whim away. Your mastery over remembering is not excluded to your own memories however. Find something of meaning, the corpse of someone or something with unfinished business, relics of someone who left an impact on many. Once you have, you gain the capacity to travel into such memories, rather, the ages where those memories represent. Although the past can’t be changed, your walk through memory lane isn’t a fabrication. It really is as if you’re physically incarnating in those eras for a fleeting time, and what you do there can be brought back with you. Even if that’s stealing the soul of a giant, or falling to one’s hand.”"
801,,600,“Willing Pawn” ,Dark Souls 1,Lore,"It is a sad truth known to few, but there is no such thing as a Chosen Undead. In fact, all these prophecies, trials and tribulations testing the undead and leading them to linking the flame are the machinations of a Primordial Serpent and abandoned God. So what though? Following their lead, while abhorrently perilous, freed you, showed the way to great power, knowledge, treasures, experiences and ultimately left you with the ability to undermine them in spectacular fashion. By purchasing this perk, you now fit snugly into massive schemes laid out by others that’ll deliver you to all sorts of advantageous or dangerous places and events in a swirling storm of activity. You are an incredibly important peace to the plan that needs to be prepared after all. You have a sense of when this has started and what path you’re being guided towards. This allows you to decide in the moment whether you want to go with the flow as a ram on rails, or diverge from the path set before you to potentially ruin the carefully laid plans of mice and men. If taken with Backstabbing Bastard, you’ll be especially adept at figuring out how to overturn the incredibly complex plots that surround you to destroy them and the ones who were plotting in grand, spectacular fashion."
802,,600,Sword Saint ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Lore,"Ashina Isshin had retaken this realm for the sake of his family and for the sake of the land. It wasn’t all simply for the sake of the fight, even if he enjoyed it immensely. But as the years waned, Isshin had grown old, like any human. When he finally retired his blade to allow his grandson to take over, a new sword saint had emerged, and that saint was you. You are this generation’s newest sword saint. You have ridden across the lands, conquered the battlefield, and left behind no one but the slain. A testament to your swordsmanship said to be divinely gifted. Perhaps you even rode with Isshin himself, or was mentored by him, but regardless, you are now unparalleled under the heavens with no equal except for Isshin in his prime, or another sword saint."
803,,600,Command Tower,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"The Tower has a special place in the Wilds, a powerful symbol of expertise in magic and the arcane. This forgotten wizard’s tower is filled with all manner of secrets and knowledge, giving laboratories andarchives to study and learn the magics of “Seasonal Spellcraft”, “Witch’s Vengeance”, “Frogify”, and “Hypnotic Sprite”...though it would take a brilliant mind unto an Archmage to break the ciphers and wards on all this knowledge. Beyond that, it is a magically protected tower that holds all that is needed to plumb the Arcane."
804,,600,Arcane Signet,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"Once a simple drop of water, it became something much greater due to the power of the Magic Mirror. This signet ring has an echo of the Mirror’s power, giving it a nascent intelligence that can perfectly recall and even create knowledge through induction and deduction...a brilliant keen mind that only asks for more data to gain further wisdom. In addition, the Signet is capable of creating Mirrormade constructs, using mana to ‘mimic’ spells and creatures it sees, though the verisimilitude of these constructs requires more mana to ensure they’re good copies - mana it can gather over time from the ambient energy of the land around you."
805,,600,Perfection Through Logic,MtG - New Phyrexia,Lore ,"You’ve attained perfection as part of the eternal process of improvement, understanding it not as a goal in itself, but as part of the greater picture. Your mind has been improved greatly, granting you photographic memory and perfect recall, ensuring that nothing you see will vanish from your mind when you need it the most. Your capacity for calculation has likewise been improved, becoming able to perform even the most complex of equations in the blink of an eye. The effects of “Research Matters”, if you have it, have likewise been boosted, your ability to combine fields of research normally considered opposite or incompatible into working creations, and having the end result benefit from the strong points of each, while reducing the drawbacks that come with them- You could animate a corpse with power stolen from angels, use pyromancy to steal heat from devices and keep them cooled- the applications limited only by your knowledge and creativity."
806,,600,Teachings From A Golden Tail ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore ,"Though the respect for the land and its creatures that a druid ought to hold is something of a dying dream in the eyes of many, that doesn’t mean it’s entirely gone. And the proof of that lies with you, for you remember the days before the Futurists even existed. And yes, that does make you rather absurdly old. So old in fact that you might even have been trained by Golden-Tail himself, whose teachings define what it is to be a Samurai to this day. This would mean that you are perfectly competent in their arts, and would likely be offered a job in a heartbeat for your sheer skill, able to not only cut with a sword, but heal with one as well. Of course, by that same metric you possess an excess of talent in all arts, not just those of the Monk or the Samurai, and could very likely get such an offer from almost anyone. Lastly, you have begun to transcend your mortality by becoming just as much the idea of yourself as you are flesh and blood. This has weaknesses, but removes any such concerns as “old age” or growing weaker as you do."
807,,600,To Take And Never Give ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore ,"The Reckoners are not a Ninja clan, though one of their more powerful and well connected leaders is the scion of one. And so, it seems, are you. In fact, not only are you a scion of one such clan, but a prodigy of their arts as well - you can easily teach someone a handful of disguise and stealth techniques inside of a couple of hours, or perhaps a bit longer for a more personalized set of spells that will culminate in the highly useful Ninjutsu. Given even a few days of effort, you could stand a very real chance of teaching each and every member of your particular branch of The Reckoners - or Saiba, or even Jukai, what do I know? - the basic skill set of a Ninja. But of course, it doesn’t end there. These techniques are poisoned in a way, forcing their users to tithe a small portion of their magical energy to you. Not enough to power anything special, and often stripped of their color, but the nature of that energy as something that you have stolen means that it works quite nicely with a specific set of techniques. Ones that you, as a prodigy, also happen to know. Isn’t it funny how things work out like that?"
808,,600,What Dreams Are Made From,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore ,"A scientist's greatest dream should be to make something new. Not a better version of something that exists, a bigger mech to replace a smaller one, a energy sword to replace a steel one, but something properly new that has never been seen before. To that end, I offer you two boons. The first is a simple and yet absurd amount of knowledge on everything Otawara has to offer, which is itself an impressive amount. Everything from spells made from code, code made from spells, mechs and robots aplenty, and far more can be found here. The second is not so impressive, but infinitely more valuable - an opportunity. There are more wonders in Kamigawa than can be dreamed of, and beyond the Blind Eternities there are even more. You now have a talent, a tendency, the stroke of luck needed to stumble across things not of this world. Perhaps a scientist from another plane will approach you with an offer… or perhaps a madman from another plane will kidnap you for your resources. It will be something of a balancing act, but the rewards are more than worth the risk."
809,,600,Seedguide Sage ,MtG - Lorwyn,Lore ,"Treefolk are born from seeds and grow into mundane trees, but some of these trees awaken into sentient, mobile treefolk through a process called the Rising. As a sage of the treefolk, you are a master seedguide. One of those treefolk elders who prepare the seedlings, tend to the saplings, and educate the youthful treefolk in the wisdom and oral history of their elders.

Until finally, these treefolk decide to pull up their roots and wander the world. This is a long process, one that takes years, maybe decades, before a tree becomes conscious. And then decades more before they are ready to leave their birth-grove and choose a name for themselves. With your mastery of root lore though, this need not be the case. With the appropriate spells, a seedling could grow into a six foot tall sapling within mere days, and open its eyes several seasons too early. But while such saplings could dredge their roots out of their planting beds quickly, they would remain dangerously naive without the benefit of the decades of wisdom and teachings normally provided to them. 

Additionally, you are adept at teaching the shorter-lived races your magic. No matter if it is the magic of your species of tree, the nurturing path of the seedguide, or something stranger still, you will be able to make even the least interested students learn. If they’re not as eager to work with you as the elven seedguides the treefolk sometimes take on, they can even figure out inventive ways to adapt the magic to their own occupation and goals. More importantly, such mentorship forges a strong empathic connection to your students. You gain a vague sense of where your students are and what they are doing, and may contact them telepathically at any time. They too may speak to you through this connection, though they don’t learn anything else, and may even ask for your aid in their spellwork. Calling on the arcane power and knowledge of a treefolk sage is a great boon for many here."
810,,600,A Bargain Made In Bad Faith,MtG - Innistrad,Lore ,"HAH! Even demons should shy away from your deals, you filthy liar. Should. It eludes me why anyone would broker with you, and yet they still do. Even seeking you out, only to be betrayed like the last dozen fools. I will not weep for cheating demons in their magical bargains and the extra wriggle room you always seem to get slight breaches of the deal not retracting whatever blessings they bestowed and outright keeping the things they gave you and your soul when you manage to kill them. But just so you know, reclaiming your soul by killing those demons doesn’t make it any less unclean. Your never ending youth as much a sign of that as your new vanity, and their foolishness. May your soul be denied the eternal rest."
811,,600,Speaking to Sphinxes ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore ,"The hunt for knowledge is never ending, when needs must be met it is prudent to search for the best sources of such knowledge. Sphinxes are the hosts of ancient knowledge and often hold many decades, centuries or millennia of knowledge. You have an affinity for such wise beings, they sense you are a worthy vassal for which they share their knowledge. To form friendships with Sphinxes would be easy for you and they are more than willing to fight for your side by offering them knowledge or riddles they have yet to learn.

In addition to this you are granted additional boons. You are a master at solving riddles and puzzles, can discern lies from truth, and can discern truth from honesty through inference. Not only this but your words and thoughts have an innate weight to them. Like a sphinx your voice can become a symphony and this symphony conveys the amount of knowledge you possess giving you an air of authority. This knowledge also aids your mental defenses as the information you understand becomes a maze in which telepaths can get lost in from which they can easily escape but find near impossible to enter. After centuries of learning, it would take a prodigious telepath of the highest quality knowing you personally and multiple attempts to actually breach your mental defenses. Post-Jump you will be able to encounter sphinxes with form and ancient knowledge appropriate to the setting, though you would need to conduct a dedicated search and they are few in number. The more fantastical the setting the more numerous they shall be."
812,,600,Go With The Flow ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore ,"The triumph of those Planeswalker’s who embrace Blue, is not outhinking their opponents, having more knowledge than their opponent or having more power than them. What truly sets them apart, is seeing through the illusion, understanding and coming to the truth of the situation. An insurmountable obstacle, an unattainable dream, an impossible goal. There is no such thing, the more “absolute” something appears to be, you can see the flaws clear as day given time to figure it out. 

A master plan that an enemy lays out that makes it so that all roads lead to their victory will always have a way out where you pull ahead. Likewise, while you might fail to solve an impossibly complex spell formula, the knowledge you gain in the attempt will always benefit you, not being a waste in the long run. Even if you are stranded on a plane without your memories, resources, or allies. You can always piece together a course of action through a lead you stumble into to regain yourself. That doesn’t mean anything will ever be easy, you will need to take the initiative, and it might even seem downright herculean. But if you go with the flow you will always be heading the right way."
813,,600,Elder ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore ,"You're not some low-level mage working the usual nine-to-five anymore. You worked and worked until you were recognized for your skill and elected to the position of Elder of your local Sanctuary. This gives you an incredible amount of political influence on the national scale, and quite a lot of pull on the international stage as well. Of course, all that influence wouldn’t do you much good without the skill to wield it properly, so you’ve also gained an unfathomable degree of competence in all fields relating to running a country of mages; politics, economics, resource distribution, the works. Not only that, but you have a special sense, passively informing you of the country’s needs. You’re also a fair bit stronger in terms of your magical power. This is less a benefit of raw power and more a case of your tremendous familiarity with your own powers. Your magic simply requires less effort to cast than it did before, with spells taxing your reserves far less than they would other practitioners of your discipline. Be warned though: Elders tend to die quite often around here. If you buy this perk with an Origin other than Sanctuary Worker, check the Notes section for suggestions on how it might work.

Boosted: You aren’t just an Elder, you’re your country’s Grand Mage. This means you hold complete and uncontested control over your country’s government. You have a direct line to any of the country’s resources, and can requisition them for personal use with very few questions asked, if any at all. Your preternatural awareness of your country’s condition is heightened as well, acting as a kind of danger sense that warns you of acts against the nation as a whole, whether that might be foreign invasion, infiltration by spies, or a terrorist attack. Additionally, your magical skill is even greater than before. Where before you could cast a spell with half the effort it would take a lesser mage, now you can cast it with one twentieth the effort. In future Jumps, you may choose to gain a similarly high-ranking position of power in either your starting location or a location suitable to your race/origin.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
814,,600,Elder Jumper,Magi: Alma Torran,Lore ,"The average member of the Orthodox Church is, to be honest, little more than a brainwashed fanatic, wholeheartedly convinced by the warped dogma concocted by Elder David and more than willing to martyr themselves to further his divine agenda. While you’re fortunately likely to be a fair bit more rational than the rank-and-file, your current position might leave a lot to be desired, as those low on the totem pole tend not to have very much actual power.

You’re not some low-ranking member of the Orthodox Church anymore, but someone much more important – you’re a member of the Council of Elders, the governing body of the Orthodox Church, and among them your status is second only to Elder David himself. As the Orthodox serves as both a religion and a theocratic empire, this naturally gives you a great deal of power over matters both spiritual and secular, allowing you to influence policies towards you own ends and guide the daily lives of those who follow you. You’ll also gain access to a not insignificant number of secrets, both of a magical and metaphysical nature, known only to the leaders of the Orthodox, and so long as you don’t do anything monumentally stupid, you’ll be pretty widely beloved by your faithful subjects, too.

In future worlds you visit, you’ll possess a similar position to this, becoming a leading figure in one of the world’s major religions."
815,,600,Wise Dragon,Magi: Alma Torran,Lore ,"Among all those who live on Alma Torran, the greatest of them all could be said to be the Origin Dragons, a species of such might that even the powerful mind-breaking magic of the Magicians bounced right off them. Little is known about them, however, as not only do they live at the bottom of the Continental Rift, the inhospitable black void between landmasses, but also, for reasons unknown, there is only one left. That survivor, known only as Mother Dragon, is incredibly wise and knowledgeable thanks to being millennia older than any other living creature, and serves as a mentor and advisor to Solomon.

Much like Mother Dragon is to Solomon, in each world you too will know an ancient being which sees itself as a mentor figure to you. Their form, personality, and history will be different in each world you go to, but a few things will remain the same: They will always have an almost parental fondness for you and, though they may not always be the most capable combatants, they’ll always be incredibly knowledgeable in almost all matters, with very few subjects being beyond their grasp. They’ll use their vast knowledge to answer any questions you bring before them, and even if they don’t know something, they’ll likely still be able to guide you in the right direction to find the answer for yourself.

Another thing these mentors will have in common is that they’ll always seem to take up residence in extremely isolated areas. Perhaps most won’t end up living in somewhere as desolate as an empty void in reality, but they’ll always be somewhere rather out of the way and difficult to reach for most, maybe living atop a tall, perilous mountain or something similar."
816,,600,Magic Otaku,Magi: Alma Torran,Lore ,"It has been said that the greatest Magician of all time was not David, who created the Gunuds and tore open a hole between dimensions that let him intrude on the realm of God itself, or even his son Solomon, who could rewrite the laws of physics with a flick of his hand or usurp God’s control over destiny, but a man named Uraltugo Noi Nueph, or Ugo for short. He didn’t have the greatest natural aptitude for magic and was almost useless in combat situations, but Ugo had one thing going for him that no other had: He was unparalleled when it came to the theory and inner workings of magic. At least, he was, as he now has an equal – you.

While this perk doesn’t grant any increase to your skills at wielding magic or a direct boost to your spells’ power, when it comes to the knowledge and theory of magic, you are a genius above all others. Impossibly complex arcane formulae which would take centuries for any normal Magician to decode would take only about fifteen minutes for you, maybe less if you keep a cool head. Fields of magic that would take many years to become proficient could be learned by you in days and later revolutionised in the following months. You may even end  up developing new types of magic altogether based on your theories, like the vector magic used by Solomon (and later Aladdin), or come up with arcane theories that would forever change how magic is understood, such as Ugo’s theories on higher dimensions and later discovery of the Rukh.

Your understanding of all things magical also makes you a master of creating all kinds of magic tools. Not just small items like flying carpets or lightning-shooting guns, but artefacts on a far larger scale too, such as mobile fortresses the size of a city or the Gunuds, those towers which can control the minds of any non-humans within many miles and acts as an intermediary to help Magicians wield magic with greater ease. Maybe you’ll even be able to replicate the Divine Staffs gifted to humanity by Ill Ilah or use them as the basis for something else, like the Metal Vessels found in a certain future world."
817,,600,A Million Ways,Campione,Lore ,"Slavatore Doni, a heretic genius capable of matching any Great Knight with swordsmanship alone. Luo Cuilian, an absolute master of martial arts and Daoist Arts. They are grand warriors who faced gods with nothing but their honed skills, perfected to an inhuman degree, and came out winning the battle. Now, you join their ranks as the great master in one skill of your choice. Take blacksmithing and start forging weapons that can hold their ground against Authorities or Divination and start spoiling the hell of all those shows that are yet to finish. Sure, you could also choose swordsmanship and become the only decent practice buddy for Salvatore. In any case, you also gain a small boost in learning other skills directly tied to the one you choose."
818,,600,Imperial Privilege,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore ,"The greatest Roman Emperors all shared one trait above all else. It’s not their similar majesty, their
incredible charisma and beauty, not even how everyone from each corner of the world could not
help but love and admire them all. It was a singular ability of particular potence, known as the
Imperial Privilege.

Your Imperial Privilege allows you to claim new skills and powers for yourself, ones you wouldn’t
normally have, provided you can provide even a weak justification for why it might now be so. Become a supernaturally skilled rider of all vehicles because you once spent a few years racing
chariots. Gain powerful magical abilities that let you control flame and heat due to working as a
smith in your younger years. Even become a notable divinity for a short time because your kingdom
worships you as a divine figure. So long as the gained capability is not more powerful than what you
might currently have in other areas, you can grant yourself anything that can be poorly justified, even abilities that alter your body.

However, these powers are temporary. At most, they last for a few hours before being sapped away
and remaining inaccessible for a day or two. It is also possible that severe mental disturbance, such
as intense migraines or enormous emotional shocks, could force you to lose hold on your abilities. You can use your Privilege to take up to three separate abilities at once. Additionally, beyond your
three slots to use to gain, you can also use your privilege to partially or fully suppress any ability or
skill that you already have, such as returning to mortality from being a divine being."
819,,600,Herculean Skill,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Were you raised alongside Heracles, learning the arts of war with your cousin Demigod? It might be
one of the few situations that explain your outrageous skill with all forms of combat. Be it sword, bow, spear, wrestling or any other weapon that can be found in this time, you hold divine levels of
skill with them. Even warriors that are many times stronger and faster than you can find themselves
hopeless against your arts of combat. It’s possible to find people that manage to surpass you, somewhat, but they are few and far between, such as comparing your archery to that of Atalanta’s. 

Still, while you may not be outright perfect in skill, you have a special benefit that no one else but
Heracles seems to have. You can create martial techniques that act like spells, drawing on your
stamina in order to use weapons to accomplish supernatural things. Using your knowledge of the
bow to create a combat move that allows you to shoot a hundred arrows in a single motion, which
will endlessly kill anything it strikes down even once to completely counteract most forms of
regeneration and immortality, like what Heracles used against the Hydra. Once you’ve done these, you can effortlessly adapt the technique to other weapons or even the use of magic or your own
body. It may lose in effectiveness, such as your hundred bow shots becoming nine slashes of the
sword or nine beams of energy, but this adaptation is instant, compared to the several days of
practice your techniques usually require, and the new forms of techniques can even be made suited
to specific kinds of foes in minutes of focus."
820,,600,"Omnipotence, So They Say",Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"A natural born genius, with a mind like Da Vinci, possessing unparalleled intelligence and talent at all
things, even when you seem to lack the necessary traits to really ascend to the top. Not only are you
able to effortlessly unlock most puzzles and solve most problems, you can absorb entire fields of
academic study into your mind in just weeks of study or master multiple systems of magecraft, such
as alchemy or elemental magecraft, in a few years, even should you be a completely ordinary first
generation magus with just a few ordinary circuits. Whether it be a skill or an ability, you simply
possess an overwhelming talent for it that when combined with your own breathtaking genius, allows you to quickly become world class and then surpass what is thought possible by almost
anyone else, despite being a normal person. You’re incredibly smart, are incredibly talented in all
you do and can take these skills far higher than normally possible for ordinary people."
821,,600,Sturdy Spear,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Lore,"A humble weapon, with none of the status of the sword, is the spear. But to those that devote
themselves to this versatile tool, they discover a depth few weapons possess. You’ve gone quite a
few steps further. The spear became the target of a religious obsession, a fanatical drive to master it
to the utmost. It paid off with a mastery that verges on the realm of godliness, such pure skill with
the spear that it has changed your very being. If it weren’t for their lesser reputation, you’d be
remembered alongside the likes of Musashi and Munetori for your military talents. The divine nature
of your skill greatly increases your physical power, smashing down whole dojo buildings in a single
swing of your staff is a great way to teach these sword using brats a thing or two. The focus you’ve
achieved when wielding a spear allows you to ignore most attempts at interfering with your mind, the bloodthirst of your foes being so evident to your purified mind that it allows you to move before
most of them can finish the thought of attacking you. 

Nothing else demonstrates your mastery more than your ability to respond to any enemy or
technique however. Even on your first encounter, you can adapt your style to whatever you
encounter with a few moments consideration, letting you counter even truly bizarre things that
should not be matched with a simple spear. Cutting apart magical spells, piercing a spirit’s core, turning aside the three thousand bullets of your foe. While your ability to create martial arts to
respond to any challenge is impressive, and possible to expand beyond the realm of a spear with
some work, it can require enough power to keep up with your foe to some degree. Too far beyond you and even all your skill will falter. Additionally, these techniques are often partially effective at
first, requiring time to hone to full mastery before you can fully negate or counter their intended
target.

You may optionally exchange the parts of this perk that focus on spears with another fairly specific
weapon type. You can’t have it for all swords or anything you do while unarmed but longswords, halberds, nunchuks or a specific martial art style can all work. "
822,,600,Fish Oil,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"Through a miracle of breaking the rules, Fionn was not the only boy to get the first bite of the
legendary Salmon of Knowledge, the fish that contained all the world’s wisdom. You found yourself
with a replica of the fish and ate it whole, from head to toe for yourself too. Thus, you gained all the
wisdom of the world, even if it is concentrated in your thumb. By biting your thumb, you are able to
connect your mind to a seemingly endless repository of knowledge, containing all the information
that exists in this world. Like a mental library, you can search through it just by thinking but also like
a library, it takes time to find information and time to read through it as well, plus you will not
automatically memorize what you see there. But with the patience of a good lord, you can find out
anything you wish, within the limits of this world."
823,,600,Magician of the Early Ages,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Lore,"A magician is nothing without his magic and like many in this divine age, you’re quite the caster of
spells. You’re an experienced magic caster, both in a range of half a dozen or so scholarly disciplines
and in how to put your magic to use in combat, even against entire squadrons of soldiers at once. Certainly, this basic command of magic that you have would seem unbelievable to people in the
Common Era, much less Modern Times.

What’s better, you have a natural gift for interfacing with the world directly and find that spells that
communicate with or otherwise directly interact with the world are significantly better in your hands. You also find that you are generally quite skilled when it comes to riddles and word games with
others, rarely meeting your match.

If you are instead willing to pay 600CP, 300CP for those with the Sorceror origin, you can upgrade
your training and power. You will come to match the Queen of Sheba in your magical prowess, standing near the top of the world in skill. Circe and Medea would be other names talked about in
the same way as yours. The disciplines you focused on in the base perk are brought to much greater
heights. Bounded fields to seal powerful demons away, alchemy to create army slaying golems and
monsters, elementalism that can whip up natural disasters to wipe away whole cities and more are
possible. You cannot come near the strength or skill of Solomon but you remain one of the greatest
in history."
824,,600,King Maker,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Lore,"Your place is not at the forefront of this story but behind the curtain. Yours is the hand that guides
the heroes to success, raising farm girls to be kings and serving boys to slay dragons. You are the
maker of kings and bringer of heroes and this is only too apparent in how you can guide others. Even
should you lack knowledge of the specific path your proteges may wish to pursue, your constant
presence and tutelage brings out vastly more potential than should be possible for your students. People discover brand new powers and levels of strength that they did not believe they had and may
very well truly lacked before you took charge. Lessons and study that should take half a lifetime can
be compressed to just days for even a dull brat to digest. The ones who call you mentor and master
are almost assured of becoming legends that are known throughout the world and will continue to
be remembered for centuries after they pass. Of course, they also develop a loyal affection for you, even if you are a strange, oft annoying and troublesome teacher to have."
825,,600,Man of Gun,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Lore,"It was the gun that tamed the west and it was your hand that tamed the very concept of the gun. So long as there is a firearm in your hand, there’s little you cannot do, as your mastery of the gun has reached the very peak. Every bullet always hits it’s target short of intense magical interference, even bending through the air or warping space to strike through nothing but the fact of your skill. Bullets split into fragments to strike multiple targets, fly ten times further than should be possible or ignore the weather entirely when you fire. Conceptually perfect marksmanship, some might say, though you can pull off some pretty perfect quick draws and fancy tricks with your guns too. You’ve got the potential to do this for stuff beyond guns too. You can reach this sort of ‘perfect’ level of skill with pretty much any kind of skill, though some might take longer than others. Helps that you learn pretty quick though, as you reached your current proficiency with firearms in about half a decade of regular use."
826,,600,Magical Genius,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You are a prodigy when it comes to magecraft, both in theory and in
practice. You can learn and develop spells in a fraction of the time it takes your peers,
and end up much more skilled than them. You are the kind of genius that’s seen only
once or twice a century, the sort of mage that will reach beyond ordinary magecraft and
be recognized as an exceptional magus by the entire Mage’s Association. In fact, you either will or already have learned or developed a rare or totally unique mystery, or set
thereof, whether that means your fire spells can consume normally unburnable things
like magical energies, spiritual bodies, and otherwise inflammable materials or that you
have created a cheap knockoff of Kischur Zeltrech’s Kaleidosword - or if you’re really
crazy, one of his Kaleidosticks. Unfortunately, this has limits, and they are such that
nothing produced here can compare to an actual True Magic or sorcery from the Age of
Gods, so don’t expect to project Noble Phantasms or create an almost perfect copy of
yourself. You also get a free purchase of Magecraft or Mastery, and further purchases of
both are discounted."
827,,600,Visualizing How to Run,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"Regardless of your practical skills with thaumaturgy, you
are a master at instructing others. It seems to be connected to your superb visualization
skills, which are indeed quite impressive. Even if you are only an average magus, your
students could be some of the best in the Clocktower, if not the whole Mage’s
Association. Such is your skill that you could have single handedly revolutionized
magical education - if Lord El-Melloi II hadn’t beaten you to it, anyway. In fact, this skill
helps you teach any and all of your supernatural powers, so long as they are teachable at
all. You are also very skilled at figuring out unconventional and more efficient
applications of magecraft, including those involving modern technology."
828,,600,Risen Legend ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"There is a poisonous fetishism at the heart of magus society, an obsession with the old and the mysterious. A toxic belief that all that we have now is just a pale imitation of what came before. Age is power, an old family serves a magus better, we must reach the origin of it all. That’s just so much shit. Magecraft may lack the raw power and direct use of systems from earlier in history but the idea that it is useless is the thought of someone without the will to persevere. A true magus would not stop, not until they tear open a path beyond their limits.

You’re living proof of the idea that magecraft being an inferior system is not necessarily as true as much of the Clocktower thinks. Whatever your own innate power, you have taken a chosen specialty of magecraft to obscene heights, the likes of which is only matched within magecraft by things like Aozaki Touko’s doll making styles or the impossible Bounded Fields of Araya Souren. Whatever your chosen field of study is, you’re certainly one of the greatest users in many generations, if not centuries outright. Your spells within that field are stronger, cheaper, faster and far more skillfully controlled than any hopeful peers. Your knowledge and skill is near total, at least in regards to existing knowledge on the field, and you have the sheer talent to continually push the limits and learn impossible spells and actions, like discovering how to make Bounded Fields mobile around a person. It’s far easier than normal, almost springing into your mind, to discover ways to combine other magic and magecraft you know into your chosen field to expand and empower it even further. As a finishing touch, whatever path you choose has revealed to you a method of immortality, a way to make yourself not just unaging but outright harder to kill in general. Touko’s famous immortality puppet network as a sterling example.

In future worlds, you’ll find anything similar enough to your chosen specialty will receive all the same effects. A brilliant alchemist here will be one in the future too. You may also buy this perk multiple times.

829,,600,Magic​ ​Mirror​ ​,Sailor Moon,Lore,"This mirror is as clear and still as a pool of water. Within its depths lies the wisdom of the past. One may gaze upon it and have general questions answered from information that isn’t a closely-guarded secret. This Magic Mirror will also see past any illusions or disguises reflected inside it.​ ​If someone is a reincarnation and they gaze within the mirror, you may see who they were in a past life and gain a vague feeling as to who they were.​ ​If someone was a mighty warrior, for example gazing into the mirror may conjure feelings of adrenaline and power within someone. You may gaze upon someone you share a bond with in this mirror, and teleport yourself to them if you must at any time with the spoken command “submarine mirror”. It may only teleport the holder with this ability. It can also produce a forceful torrent of water, like the might of a raging storm.
"
830,,600,Entombed Priest ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Lore,"Within your body was entombed another being entirely. A High Priest of the Mortuary Cult was buried within your body, in full or only his skull in the case of smaller beings taking this option. His spirit was reawakened along with your own, though his body remains unfortunately inert. He seems rather unbothered by this fact, quite happy to be able to laze around and watch what you do. He has a wealth of magical knowledge and knowledge of the lore and rituals of this country, all of which he is happy to share or give advice with. He lived for centuries through many dynasties and wars, even the time of Nagash’s rule was experienced by this Priest. Doubtless he has much wisdom to dispense. At the end of the jump, you may remove his body from your own, though his spirit may remain with you if you wish instead of going with his body.
"
831,,600,Magical Prodigy ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You have an increased talent for all fields of magic, learning in a day what would take others a week. This also increases the abilities of certain other perks:

Basic Magical Skills: You have knowledge of how to perform the Shared Pain curse, a symbol that when painted on someone with blood will cause them to feel any pain the person the blood came from endures. The symbol will require extensive magical skill to remove without your permission.

Hypnosis: Now allows you to implant knowledge into others minds.

Mirror world Transfer: The mirror world can now encompass an area as large as a modern city and be increased with further training.

Counter Magic: You now know how to make restraints that could hold entities on the level of an average Heroic Spirit and prevent them from moving or using their abilities.

Gravity Magic: Can now be applied to work on a large area the size of a football field, increasing the strength of gravity by a hundred times for example.

Jewel Magecraft: You now know how to create a magic amplifier circuit that greatly increases the power of magic used in combination with it. Jewel magic can also be used to store spells from any other magic you have from other worlds.
"
832,,600,Zelretch’s Notes ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You have the collected notes of Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg detailing the construction of the Kaleidosticks. These notes will allow the creation of a mystic code capable of the Multi-Dimensional Refraction phenomenon allowing them to draw in unlimited magical energy. As such a mystic code constructed with this knowledge would be able to refill a magus’s magical reserves instantly. If you also have Zelretch’s Student then with time you may be able to create existences like the Kaleidostick.

833,,600,Unfinished Symphonies ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Lore,"A collection of a dozen musical compositions, that in the right hands could be modified into magical songs that anyone can learn.
"
834,,600,Encyclopedia of Paranormal Phenomena ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Lore,"An expansive tome of mystical lore compiled by mermaids over the centuries. Covers everything from special magic rituals to enchanted artifacts, many of which you may never learn about otherwise. Naturally, the book is waterproof. The book updates with new information in new jumps, either with knowledge held by mermaids in the jump or, in the absence of mermaids or other intelligent sea creatures, general secrets found in the oceans.
"
835,,600,Power Studying ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You too are capable of learning ways to copy the natural abilities of your enemies, though you can never exactly copy abilities you lack the physical equipment to perform. Fortunately, you are equally skilled at designing workarounds for your lack of bodily support; should you wish to ape fire breath you will never breathe fire yourself but will certainly find ways to project something similar outside your body, perhaps by turning a magical focus into a flamethrower.
"
836,,600,Scientific Magic ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"Magicians in Gensokyo are similar to scientists in the outside world. Magic is conducted through trial and error, when one magician makes a breakthrough others find it relatively easy to copy it. This includes you; for you can easily find ways to duplicate any spell you know exists, even translating it from different magic systems into ones you know. This includes magic to extend your life indefinitely, and indeed is part of why in recent years mages have achieved immortality younger than ever before.
"
837,,600,The Night Parade Scroll ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You have the Night Parade Scroll, an extremely evil but potent source of youkai energy that can animate a seemingly endless amount of goods into tsukumogami slaves for you, or power fantastic youkai works. Fortunately, you do not need to worry about your body being hijacked by the oni of the scroll, but you do need to be worried about the kind of attention merely possessing this scroll will bring you.
"
838,,600,Cordon Bleu ,Wonderland No More,Lore,"Whenever you’ve fully mastered a recipe, ritual, alchemical formula, or spell, you are now able to easily prepare it practically anywhere, regardless of the scarcity of necessary ingredients/tools or the state of the facilities. You will suffer no penalties for the preparation and will only mess things up if there is a critical failure. Please note that you must show that you have a solid understanding and mastery of the given recipe/ritual.
"
839,,600,Thinking Cap ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"Some wizard left this fancy cap lying around and now it’s yours. Whilst wearing this cap you become a basic mage of a random lore suddenly before every conflict. In later worlds this will expand to randomly allowing you access into the various magic systems of the worlds that you go to. This is only a temporary boost and after battle your understanding of the various systems fades into obscurity, but with this Thinking Cap a cunning boss could do some pretty odds stuff.
"
840,,600,A Cap that Thinks ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"An ornate helm that grants powers beyond the kin of those who have it. It is a horned thing formed in such a way that it rests upon the head of a human snugly. After donning the helm the wearer will find their minds opened to the True Dhar. This allows them to grasp the particularities of both Necromancy as well as countermagic, the True Dhar being a mixture of the various Winds of Magic which allows none of them to retain identity, with greater alacrity than even the masters of the arts among the Dead. This power and knowledge, while great, fades quickly from body, spirit, and mind once the helm is taken off.

This helm also holds a voice within it. A man or woman who followed a dark master and learned arts far beyond their kin during the long tutelage. Amiable enough to teach what is artificially given by the helm this voice has only one objective. To leave the cursed world behind. Would you deal with this millennia old voice?
"
841,,600,One’s Classified Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"A Warlock-Engineer’s secrets are his life. Discoveries, inventions, and creations are the measuring stick by which he expresses superiority to the sadrats that are his “peers.” But as such, a Skryre rat’s secrets must be preserved. Hidden behind locks, concealed under layers of code, scrambled between numerous blueprints without rhyme or reason.

Or perhaps, you could just use this book. A grand tome bound with the skin of stormvermin, stitched with bronze wire, ink messily strewn and slung about. But this book is a perfect one for a mad, inventive mind such as yours. For not only are all of Skryre’s inventions kept within, but any discoveries or inventions you make, be they scientific, mechanical, or magical, will be automatically recorded within this book’s pages. Right down to the most miniscule detail regarding that which you’ve so painstakingly cracked. The pages will automatically, via clues within the text and notes, also indicate which other discoveries and creations can be linked or may be improved by studying in tandem. And to top it all off, this book is bound to your claws only. Should any other eyes try to pry its secrets, they’ll be stumped two-fold: The first, the book will spontaneously rewrite its secrets in such a thick and foul code that a determined cracker would need decades to break it. The second, the reader will contract a skaven-devised curse, being randomly stricken with bolts of warp-lightning.
"
842,,600,The Lore of The East ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"Before they journeyed to the Land of the Celestial Dragon, Eshin were just like any other clan of ratmen. The secrets they found there in Imperial Cathay, and the deadly shadows they learned from in misty Nippon, changed them as certainly as Lord Tsien-Tsin and Chi’an Chi the Great Conspirator change the world. These secrets were brought back when Eshin returned to their people, and since those days have remained as deadly as the ninja-assassins of the east.

You have a set of five mist-billowing scrolls, covered in the flowing and elegant script of Cathay - standing out starkly from their verminous surroundings. Within these scrolls is carried all the knowledge and secrets that allow Eshin to turn fidgety, cowardly clanrats into cold-blooded, disciplined assassins and orchestrators of disaster. They also contain the magicks to the Lore of Stealth, causing any one rat or person who handles the scrolls to gain potential within that shadowy magick of Eshin Sorcerers. If one simply reads from these scrolls, and practices, they will swiftly rise in skill to become a dreaded assassin within weeks - with your aid, even days.
"
843,,600,Liber Bubonicus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"Ah, the Book of Woe. The holy book of Clan Pestilens, wielded by their scion Lord Skrolk. The hidden and unknown lore of Plague Magic is contained within these pages, as well as the alchemical and magical knowledge of every disease, pestilence, and plague in the whole world. Merely holding the book is enough to begin tainting the reader’s flesh and skin with pox, and reading the pages afflicts the fool or priest as surely as if they’d been exposed to a vector.

Originally, there was only one complete Book of Woe. Now there are two - the second within your grimy, diseased claws. Your copy of the Book of Woe contains every possible spell of the Lore of Plague, and method of creating every disease known to the world. As well, any new diseases and poxes you encounter or find will be recorded within the Liber Bubonicus - gaining its own page and the spell or alchemical formula to conjure it forth. Any who read this tome, unless they bear some magic to cleanse themselves or have some immunity, will be ravaged by every single pathogen wreathed into the mouldering pages.
"
844,,600,The Pride of Hoeth ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Lore,"Unsurprisingly, given their long lives Elves invariably stand head and shoulders above the ‘lesser races’ when it comes to magic. Just so, there are those that rise to the top of even such an auspicious heap, you in particular with this Perk. Like your Asur peer Teclis, you weave spells with such ease and power your enemies will feel like the gods themselves are smiting them. Additionally, as befitting one of the guardians of Order, you are also deeply talented at teaching others the ways of magic. So much so that you could induce a magical awakening in a society that before had no magic at all.
"
845,,600,Tiger Scrolls,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Lore,"Just as the Blade Brothers, you are skilled in the Art of War. Mastership of your swordsmanship can now allow you to channel your vitality or desperation into blade beams, shatter stone, and use a spinning slash that covers a distance beyond the range of your sword and hits everyone nearby. All of this culminates in a greater overall fitness and also makes you a single repetition learner, like Link you’ll only need to be shown how to do something once and you’ll be able to do it as long as you have the ability to.

In addition to this mastery of swordsmanship you have learned how to create Tiger Scrolls which allow you to pass on any of your physical arts to a willing student.

A student must dedicate around six hours of practice to what is written upon the Tiger Scroll every day, however the instructions are concise and within a week a weak version of the art should be learned with the full version being learned in around a year. Sadly you can only craft one of these Tiger Scrolls per year and it can only contain one 'move' of an entire art, so to learn a full martial arts style the master would have to break it down into separate pieces that together teach the entire style, The Tiger Scroll can’t teach magic or non-physical ‘moves’ but those moves that are largely composed of physical action with a magical or mystical component can be taught, such as the moves learned from the Blade Brother’s Spin Attack is done by channeling slight mystical energies into the sword before using the attack.

The Tiger Scrolls don't discriminate, however, so if someone you don't like picks one up they could learn as easily as anyone you like.
"
846,,600,Mimic,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Lore,"Whether you're fighting the ultimate foe or studying under a wise old mentor, you're able to understand the nature and method of any technique or spell performed before you--if you survive it. Afterwards, so long as you have the power, ability and resources necessary, you know how to replicate it. However, you do not get the muscle memory required to use it on the fly. That takes training.
"
847,,600,Understanding the Incromprehensible,TES V - Skyrim,Lore,"An unfortunate fact of the higher levels of magical studies and the workings of powerful artifacts
is that usually, they are wrapped in metaphors and systems too complex to properly explain to
other people. This can make preserving the discoveries and findings of legendary mages
frustrating, and the fact that they usually don’t even bother writing things down doesn’t help.
And let’s not even get into the more esoteric parts of magicka. After millenia of work, imperial
mages are still unable to properly describe what the Elder Scrolls do or even are, and the one
expert on the matter is a rambling madman, gone completely insane from his investigation of the
Elder Scrolls. These problems are not something you’ve ever encountered. Even the most opaque
and vague explanations and descriptions easily yield at least some useful information as you pour
over them, and active effort by other parties to communicate the intricacies of their work will let
you discern most of what you need to know after a few sessions. What’s more, you find that
inhumanly esoteric and complex subjects are about as hard for you to investigate as any other
mundane subject, and as damaging to your sanity as learning arithmetic might be. Your own
explanations may not make much sense to other people, but understanding the information
you’re trying to preserve makes the task easy."
848,,600,Lost Arts,TES: Magic,Lore,"Well now, it certainly seems as though you have broken free of the
preconceived limitations of the School System of magic. You may now count yourself as
an unequaled master--the best in history, in fact--of a long forgotten, or extremely rare, form of magic. Excepting Thu'um, it could be the Tonal Architecture of the Dwemer, capable of innumerable effects that seem fantastical and impossible. Or maybe Tonal Magic is not your style, instead following in Azra Nightwielder's footsteps, becoming a master of Shadow Magic. Weather magic, blood magic, auramancy, even time magic is possible. You can purchase this multiple times."
849,,600,Spell Crafter ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"The only thing that really holds magic back is the creativity of the caster. You can easily create new spells with a bit of effort, and if you were to see any new or unknown spell in action, you could recreate or mimic it through experimentation. No magic is beyond your reach."
850,,600,Elder Scroll ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"They have no known origin or author, and upon their divine parchment one may find archives of the past as well as auguries of the future. They are believed to be fragments of creation that are said to exist outside of time and space, extricated from the limits of the mortal realm. Upon reading this, the reader receives a portion of a fraction of its knowledge in return for blindness, but it may be possible to utilize its unique nature for other ends, should you be daring or foolhardy enough to try."
851,,600,Oghma Infinium ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"The Daedric Artifact of Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, this is an ancient tome of knowledge written by Xarxes, the wizard sage and scribe also known as ""The Ageless One."" Upon reading it, you gain the eldritch knowledge of one of the three paths of Magic, Might, or Shadows. Each person may only be affected by this artifact once, as more than that can and have driven men to madness."
852,,700,Grand Magic,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Lore,"Throughout the decades in the Soulsborne worlds Mikael would master each field of
magic. Not only would he learn every spell, blood arts, miracle, pyromancy, and
incantations but he would start to expand the fields. Like the powerful Undead you have
a true mastery of this universe’s magic. You can be considered a peer to the greats
such as Seath the Scaleless, the Witch of Izalith, and Rennala the Moon Queen.
Additionally, you have cultivated a powerful Pyromancy flame and forged your very body
into a catalyst. Unlike the average magic user you do not need a tool to perform your
magic. Though it would still help you by making the spells stronger."
853,,700,Book of Dawning Sky ,Lyrical Nanoha,Lore,"How on Earth did you get your hands on this?! It’s either a predecessor or an offshoot of the Book of Darkness, a legendary Lost Logia that collects both magical knowledge and energy, giving it a completely bottomless well of mana as well as knowledge of every spell from everyone world and individual it has absorbed. Problem: This white book is completely blank and tapped dry of any mana. While it can store as much energy as you can put into it, and copy as many spells as you can find a way to absorb into it, it has nothing within it right now. Still, if you had some way to do so, you could potentially gain a grimoire with an infinite supply of mana and an endless index of spells...if only you had some way to fill it. Maybe the book’s more-complete counterpart could give you some sort of clue? Once it has absorbed some mana and spells, it can be used in an identical way to a Unison Device.

Even if you’re not the ‘collect and fill’ type, this book has another program of note: The Guardian Knights program. It contains four AI programs designed specifically to protect the user, who begin without personality and or sentience beyond guarding the user of this - though some time and care can cause them to develop personalities and wills of their own, much like Hayate Yagami did for her Knights. They start with low magic capabilities and function similarly to Familiars, but could potentially use Devices of their own (if built) and eventually advance to as far as S-rank natural ability after some growth and training. They do not count as companions and can be resurrected by draining mana from the Book if slain, but can be imported as true companions in future jumps, where they follow all associated rules therein. You may also import four companions into this role for free to receive the same benefits, though they follow normal companion rules instead from the get-go.

Similarly, it contains a nascent control AI in the style of Reinforce, though like the Knights and Book itself, which is the primary subject of the Unison function. It starts off lacking personality or anything except base functions like a ‘Basic’ Intelligence, but will steadily grow to become Sapient as time goes on, particularly if you devote effort to educating it. It follows the same rules as the Guardian Knights in terms of companions, and is otherwise completely loyal to the Book’s user (you).

After the book has collected a significant amount of mana, it can even begin to form an ‘internal world’ that functions as a pocket dimension, which will grow along with the Book. Obviously, if the artifact is destroyed or damaged, things contained within that world go with it...so mind keeping this safe, if you can. If you took the Darkness bloodline, the Book automatically retains all spells you learn and copy without needing your direct input.

854,,800,Equations on Gematria,DC Comics,Lore,"Those who grasp true power in this world look not to cosmic forces or demonic artifacts, but the
very symbols by which mortals impose meaning on existence. Words of power, in this reality,
can be used to bind the power of gods into entire families of world-shaking champions like the
Marvel family. Mathematical formulae, recited by those who truly grasp their meaning, can be
used to manifest the Speed Force or bypass a solid wall like a bank of fog. And like some of the
most brilliant minds on Earth, you too have a phenomenal talent for grasping how language and
mathematics can be used to bend the laws of reality to your will. You must still construct
mathematical formulae that accurately reflect the concept of reality you wish to depict, like
proving a hypothesis in quantum physics, or discover which languages and words are
sufficiently meaningful to effect change on the cosmos-but some quirk of your biology makes
you much more talented than virtually all races out there. For 800 CP your grasp of
such phenomena is on par with the likes of Dr. Sivana or Metron-the heights of earthly and New
God talent with this skill, respectively. Even if your intellect and expertise in other areas is not
particularly high, you too understand the underlying principles between binding the fundamental
forces of the universe into a powerful transformation, or creating a sprite made of living
languages with virtually endless shapeshifting potential."
855,,800,Divine Skill,Bleach,Lore,"Every single Shinigami who has been raised to the vaunted heights of Squad Zero has accomplished
something incredible. Each one is a master of a skill to a level considered impossible to all others, taking something useful but mundane and making it akin to the work of a god. One is a swordsmith, whose works are the Zanpakuto that form the core of Shinigami power. One a seamstress whose
ordinarily clothes withstand attacks with ease from all but the greatest Captains. The oldest among
them is a monk who has given names to all things and controls the very names themselves, giving
great power over the world. While you may not necessarily have been offered a place yet, though also possessing sufficient
power may change this, you have mastered a certain skill or idea to a similar level as the current
members. Skills are obvious and described both above and below but ideas are also possible.
Ichibe’s title as the one who names others has allowed him to manipulate names as a concept, altering or controlling others through their names. In his sealed form, this is largely limited to an innate knowledge of all names, the ability to draw power from others speaking his name and to lay
notably powerful curses or other effects on names that activate when spoken. Whatever you pick allows for incredible uses and techniques just on it’s own, such as the above
techniques described. It’s almost certain that you have also created some great invention connected
to your chosen skill, which may have already spread through Soul Society and brought fame to your
name. A master of Kido who created stick-shaped implements that allow even a beginner to work
powerful magics, a swordmaster whose written lessons have revolutionised Zanjutsu by introducing
magical techniques not connected to release forms or kido, perhaps even something like an author
whose stories have inspired and directed the afterlife again and again. However your skill and the accompanying great invention appear, there is a second aspect to this
option. Whatever your skill or idea is, it is also linked directly to your Zanpakuto. Releasing your
Zanpakuto will greatly expand what you are able to accomplish with your skill. This works in concert
with it’s existing abilities, which may alter the form of the blade and the powers to complement each
other better. Ichibe’s Shikai, a large brush which could manipulate ink, allowed him to suppress and
erase others by covering them, and thus their names, in black ink. His Bankai grew this to the point
that he could directly change or give new names to beings, with the properties of their new name
becoming true. The most powerful warrior reduced to the strength of a helpless ant, as that is what
his name had become. Your Zanpakuto releases will likely be supercharged by this process, greatly
improving the existing powers as a result of them combining with such divine skill. It is also worth
remembering that these powers are not without limit. The released state of this skill will require
your spiritual energy to operate and some uses, though theoretically possible, may be of too great a
magnitude to actually work. Those without a Zanpakuto can eventually unlock independent release states that give access to two
increased levels of power with your chosen divine skill. These two release stages will drain your
energy similar to a Shikai and Bankai but at least allow access to your full potential."
856,,800,Book of the Vishanti/Darkhold ,Marvel Magic,Lore,"Now this, this is something else. You have come into possession of an incredibly valuable and powerful tome of eldritch knowledge – or at least a replica of one.

The Book of the Vishanti is the book of white magic. One of the oldest and most valuable magical artifacts in existence, the Book of the Vishanti contains within in it virtually every spell and counterspell known to white magic as well as general knowledge to advance one’s mastery of sorcery and vast amounts of mystical history. The book has an endless number of pages, periodically updating itself with new spells and will continue to do so in future worlds that you visit. However, the book contains no offensive magic within it, only that which can be used defensively or constructively.

On the other hand, we have the Darkhold. The Book of Sins, the Shiatra Book of Darkness. As you can probably tell, this is not a book of white magic. The equal and opposite of the Book of the Vishanti, this dark and terrible tome was created at the dawn of the earth when the Elder God Chthon first scribed spells onto its indestructible pages with dark fire. Everything that its brother book is to white magic, the Darkhold is to the dark arts. However, the evil tome has a malevolent will of its own and will attempt to corrupt the user if their will and discipline are not hardy enough to prevail.

857,,800,Sorcerer ,Marvel Comics - Exiles,Lore,"You are a talented sorcerer. You are ultimately more on the level of Selene, Magik, or Shaman than that of the Sorcerer Supreme, though Magik and Selene have at least been in consideration for the position and have the raw talent if not the skills or the trappings that can magnify their power. This magic provides you with a great variety of possible actions and abilities, though it will on occasion depend upon external sources of energy, or time and preparation."
858,,800,Peerless,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Lore,"The knights of Britain are renown for their skill, power and honour. The knights of the Round Table exemplify Britain’s virtues to an even greater extent. You? Lancelot at his height is the only one you can call a peer and he doesn’t remain there for long. Few men are as perfectly well rounded as you. Your physical abilities are enough that you could fight powerful adult dragons and demons to a draw with your bare hands or even win if you added a good weapon to your side. You’ve got unbelievable levels of martial skill in both offense and defense, across two dozen kinds of weapons, such that even without your physical abilities being so great you could slay armies. You have strategic and tactical abilities that let you lead small forces to crush far larger ones and can even make a good substitute for a king if your liege needs to spend a few months away at war, though you are far below the sort of king that can create a golden age. You have a high level of natural talent at any skill or ability you try your hand at and find it very easy to learn and train to become better at new things, quickly surpassing even the most venerable of warriors in their specialties. Of course, you would not be peerless if you did not also look the part. Among all the men in the world, only the divine could outmatch your physical splendour and even then, only by a touch. Your king might frown on the hordes of maidens that lust after you but you really can’t help it, as you gather admirers and love interests even when fully armoured and masked. Just something about you."
859,,800,Grand,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Lore,"The truth of magecraft is thus. It is not power that matters, not really. It is knowledge and skill and
talent that allows one to become unsurpassed in this field. A true master of the arts does not need
the power of a thousand magi to blow up a fortress. He just needs a spark of mana and the right
words to utilize it properly. And a master like that is far below you. Among all the magi in the world
and those from history long since past, you are something special. A magus with such skill and
knowledge that they have the potential to be a Grand Servant. There is little to no discipline of
magecraft that you have not mastered to such an extent that others think you are wielding True
Magic. Almost no spell you do not know as intimately as a husband knows his wife of several decades. No inch of your own magical circuits or energy that you do not exert absolute and total
mastery over. Merlin the Incubus, Solomon the King of Magic. The names of the only two other magi
to be your equal in knowledge and skill, though the matter of magical energy and power is
something different. Perhaps you could find a way to take that too?"
860,,800,High Libriomancy ,Libriomancer,Lore,"(Requires Libriomancy) Oh, oh my. You seem to have taken a step above the common libriomancer. You have grasped the true spellcasting potential of libriomancy, able to “read” the story of magic in all things living or magical. At a glance you may determine whether something is magical as well as any active spells or effects it might hold. Furthermore instead of drawing objects or energy out of books you may instead call upon supernatural or magical effects described therein, allowing you to cast spells and magical effects as though you were the proper caster (standard limits of libriomancy still apply). Perhaps the greatest application of all is that you may draw out spells and magical effects from multiple books, combining them into a new spell all its own with the best parts of all those described. Using this method, you could perhaps even create a stable portal from the earth to the moon. Whatever you do, you will likely be at the forefront of magical knowledge and research in this world. (Restrictions for regular libriomancy still apply)"
861,,1000,I Found It Beneath Me,Marvel Magic,Lore,"Humans are fragile, fleeting things. Here one day and gone the next. But in their mortality, there is a certain strength, a thirst to learn and grow. And in you, this burns more brightly than most any other. You are a paragon of man, a prodigy among geniuses. You will find that any task set before you is mastered far faster than otherwise. Be it sorcery, science, arts, or something else entirely. So long as it is something you can learn, you will be able to do so in a fraction of the time it would take others. Perhaps you would learn a language in a days or master a martial art in a week. Though, this is not absolute mastery. There are, perhaps, those who will be able to surpass you in individual fields, though these will be the greatest minds alive and what does it matter if you’ll never be the best at something when you’re the second best at everything?"
