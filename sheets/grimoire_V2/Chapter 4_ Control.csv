0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,Free,Servant/Master,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Control,"If you’re a master (any background that isn’t Servant), you gain a free servant. Refer to the Servant Addendum at the end of the jump for details. If you’re a servant, you gain a free master instead. Companions may be freely imported into the servant or master roles with the appropriate 1000 SP or 1000 CP granted to them as well (though they can not take drawbacks). Servants and masters become companions if they are willing at the end of your jump. Additionally, non-humanoid companions or pets can be imported as servants and will be granted a humanoid form (in addition to whatever level of humanity you wish for them to acquire)."
2,,Free,Command Seals,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Control,"If you’re a master, gain 3 command seals per servant. They don’t replenish, but they can force your servant to do whatever you want or give them a significant magical boost. It is possible for them to be resisted to some degree or another, but even the best can’t fully resist the power of the Command Seals. If you’re a servant, your master gets this instead. Outside of the jump, you (or your master) will get these command seals, 3 per servant, and they will replenish at a rate of 1 per week. They can no longer be used to force your servant to do anything, rather they can be used to give that servant access to your entire mana/magical pool/anything jump related or compatible without draining any of it from yourself. It will only give them a quick burst, no more than a couple minutes of access."
3,,Free,Omnidexterous,Overlord,Control,"You possess the innate talent to use all of your limbs as if they were
your primary limb, effectively allowing you to fight or operate with your limbs to whatever degree
you desire, and are physically capable of performing in, with no loss of control, skill, or strength.
This effect additionally carries over to your mind, allowing you to effortlessly mental-multitask on
as many different trains of thought as you desire. This doesn’t let you think faster, per-se, but
you would be surprised at how useful it is to be able to focus on every individual thing going on
in a battle at the same time."
4,,Free,Schrodinger's Asshole,Worm CYOA v17,Control,People will always believe you if you say a suggestion/joke/opinion of yours was a joke and/or not meant to be taken seriously. This doesn't work with physical actions.
5,,Free,Phantom Punches,Worm CYOA v17,Control,Punching and kicking empty air creates phantom limbs in the distance which will copy your movements. You can choose where they appear.
6,,Free,Mascot,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"You have the ability to create a projection that shares all five senses and you can speak through it. Its form can be anything you imagine, however, you can't swap form unless you release the projection first. It is not physically strong or powerful in any way, it is closer to a walking plush animal."
7,,Free,Geass,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"If a consensual contract is agreed upon, without coercion or Master effects involved, though bribery is fine, all parties must follow through. All parties must be aware of the power. This power works on you even if you're immune to Master powers, and won't work if another power is immune to it. You must be one of the involved parties, even if the contract just labels you as a witness or arbitrator. Be careful to look for loopholes. This power fails if the contract becomes impossible to fulfill."
8,,Free,Let the Feathers Fly,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"You have gained the ability to create a hundred diamond shaped “feathers” per minute, manifesting up to a maximum of five hundred at once. You have complete telekinetic control over these feathers and infinite multitasking in regards to doing so.

You can also bind and unbind the feathers to each other to exponentially strengthen them, or to yourself to grant you flight. Individually, each feather's speed, strength, and durability is slightly less than that those of an average human, which increases to a durability capable of taking punches from Alexandria and a speed and strength comparable to a bullet train when all of them are bound together."
9,,Free,Razorwire,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"You possess the ability to create thin but durable steel-like wires from your skin which can be telekinetically controlled, although the more you control at once, the worse your fine control, though a multitasking power would negate this drawback. With experience, this thread can even be formed into rudimentary constructs such as walls or blades."
10,,Free,Emotional Magnet,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"You are able to sense and perceive the predominant emotion that a sentient being is currently undergoing within your field of view. Furthermore, you can subtly influence and guide this emotional state towards a different direction, from anger to fear, hate to happiness, etc."
11,,Free,Summoner,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"These heretic mages have unlocked the secrets of the forbidden magic of Vana'diel by creating a pact with the Avatar known as Carbuncle. Through his suggestion, these mages have the choice to delve further into the craft and create pacts with more of the Avatars of Vana'diel after defeating them in battle to prove their worth. If accepted, Summoners are able to fight alongside them in order to bring peace to Vana'diel."
12,,Free,Dragoon,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"With their lances in hand and their faithful wyvern by their sides, Dragoons surprise their enemies with their extraordinary jumping abilities. Dragoons are melee fighters excelling at the use of the polearm. The wyvern is also a mainstay of the Dragoon job. The wyvern can provide many different kinds of breath attacks ranging from breaths that heal to those that harm."
13,,Free,Beastmaster,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"Based on their knowledge of beasts, Beastmasters can charm the beasts of Vana'diel to fight alongside them or obtain items that summon beasts called Familiars through their Call Beast ability. Beastmasters are often found fighting alone in the wilds with their pets, needing no partners, save their own tamed beasts."
14,,Free,Servant,Fate/Stay Night,Control,"You can't be a Master without a Servant. All players who choose any origin except the Servant origin gain a Servant for free. This Heroic Spirit, the being that will help you win the Grail War, is to be built using the connected Servant Supplement. They will gain 1000 Servant Points (SP) to use in that Supplement for free. CP can be converted into SP for your Servant at a 1:1 ratio, though only a maximum of 1600 extra SP can be gained through this method. Any new Servant companion, as in you are not the Servant in question, gains the Servant origin and 300cp to spend on the Servant perks found in the main jump. 

You may also choose to import a single companion into this option for free, as long as you have a Servant to import them into. They do not get anymore CP then described above and cannot be imported with the option below."
15,,Free,Command Seals,Fate/Stay Night,Control,"A set of 3 sigils forming a greater overall pattern. This is what marks you as a Master in the Holy Grail War and as the Master of your Servant. They represent the connection between the two of you, particularly the connection through which you supply the energy needed to maintain your Servant's existence. The reason the command seals are in 3 parts is because you can spend them to give absolute orders to your Servants. You could expend one to force them to kill themselves for instance. Or you could order a Servant to 'Win' and grant them a boost in power from expending the seal. You could even teleport them to you by telling them to come to your aid, no matter the distance. You only get 3 however, and once they are used up, the connection between you and your Servant will fade and they will soon disappear. Extraordinarily powerful Servants can resist or in very rare cases, even outright ignore Command Seal enforced orders if they desire, so you'd best be careful with your uses. "
16,,Free,Olga Marie Animusphere,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"Our ever tense leader here at Chaldea. In over her head and trying her best to save the world regardless, the white haired commander will manage to survive against all odds if you take this option and find herself joining whatever faction you yourself side with. She might appear unwilling but at her heart, she really does mean well and wish well for those around her. Olga is purely human through this option, a skilled magus with little talent as a Master, but lacking any unique traits that may be associated with her later on. "
17,,Free,Main Servant,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The Servant you summoned upon your entrance to this distortion and your main partner. Having acknowledged you as their Master, this is the Servant you’ll find is your most loyal and powerful ally. This companion is a Servant Type Origin and may gain either the 600CP Servant perk or the 100 and 300CP Servant perks but does not gain an Origin. Instead, they gain access to the Servant Supplement and 1000 Servant Points (SP) to spend on it. This can be used to create an existing Servant for you to companion or you may import an existing companion into this option for free, though they may not be imported in another option if so. You may transfer CP to this companion as SP at a 1:4 ratio, up to a maximum of 750 CP transferred into 3000 SP.

Requires Command Seals to Purchase"
18,,Free,Master,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The human ally who summoned you in this Grand Order. Your Master is a good ally to have, given the potential they have for boosting your combat ability and for the support they give personally. Not to mention that wonderful mana they supply with their connection to Chaldea. This new companion may be an existing companion to import into this role or an entirely new character of your own creation. They gain the Human Type, a free origin and all associated benefits as well as 1000CP to spend on perks. They may also transfer this CP to you as a Servant on a 1:1 basis. "
19,,Free,Command Seals,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The mark of a Master. Exclusive to those who are themselves Masters, these three red sigils represent the command you have over your Servants. Each one may be used in a variety of ways, from an absolute command to force a Servant to perform an action they would normally refuse to do to fully healing an injured Servant or ready their best attack for use. Your three Command Seals will work for any Servant that considers you their Master, you do not gain more for gaining more Servants. However, unlike the normal, these Command Seals regenerate at a rate of 1 per 24 hours, though 3 is the maximum that can be gained. "
20,,Free,Fury,Fairy Fencer F,Control,"Isn’t this what you’re here for? This is where you can craft your own Fury. Comes with a Fairy Companion for no additional cost! The Fairy has the benefits of I’ve Got No Strings, Special Gift, and Rank Up! You have a 400 FP starting budget and can exchange CP for FP at a rate of 1:1. Knock yourself out! This may be purchased multiple times.

Note: Power Build in Associated Jump Document."
21,,Free,Main Character,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"Every chosen hero needs their party of loyal side characters, love interests and comedic relief. It’s a grand sacrifice you’re making but Mysterious Heroine X will accept your aid on her quest. Accepting this option has you, somehow, roped into MHX’s quest to slay all Sabers and become the one true Saber. Even if she abandons the quest, somehow you’ll always get bound up in whatever madcap situation she’s in next. It’s usually dangerous and always silly. MHX appears quite fond of you and will even overlook any seemingly Saber-like qualities as just her imagination."
22,,Free,A Lost Voyager,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"This little fella is a long, long way from home. He crashed into your ship a little while after you woke up, spinning in from outer space. He says he’s some sort of satellite and came from Earth originally, though the blonde child seems to be a Servant like any denizen of the Sapphire Galaxy. He’d really like to get back to his homeworld though, so he can tell the kind people that created him about all the amazing space things he’s seen so far, but he has no idea how to get back. Until he can figure it out, he thinks it might be a good idea to stay with the nice person who picked him up. "
23,,Free,"I Am Fire, I Am Death",Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"...I am tiny? Somehow, you have a very small dragon on your hands, about the size of a house cat and approximately as dangerous as one – albeit one that could improvise a spray-can sized flamethrower. It’s very possessive of shiny things and quite fond of you. Feel free to use your new buddy to freak out a certain Homunculus or Saber, since it’ll look rather like the one they might recall. Before you ask, no, its blood does not have any useful properties – if you want that, track down the original Dragon."
24,,Free,Pale Lady,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"Not entirely sure where she came from, but this is a rather attractive albino in cleric-like robes of a peculiar design. She’s somewhat confused about this whole thing, not really useful in combat, but friendly enough and has a passable knowledge of Alchemy that she seems to have a knack for learning if you give her the opportunity. A variety of colourful flowers seem to grow around her if she’s in an area for any amount of time, but this is purely cosmetic, and she can shut this off if you like. Guaranteed to freak out a certain worm-based Magus, though he’s not around anymore in this timeline."
25,,Free,Master,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"Soldiers need a commander, and a Servant will need a source of power to stay around, though it’s possible that alternative batteries will be available. This is a figure intended to support your existence in this Great Grail War, and they’ll be getting a set of three magical marks on their skin that can give some very potent orders, so I hope you can get along. You can either pick a Canon Master, choose a Companion to take the position, or create someone entirely new. In the case of the latter, features such as how they look, what they’re like and what their background is can be your choice, but it’s not allowed to give any advantages that wouldn’t be present in the rest of their build. Speaking of, they can have 1000CP to spend, and can have any Origin with the applicable discounts and freebies. If you really need more power as a Servant, this CP can be converted into SP for your use, but this might leave them weaker and significantly less protected. As a Companion, they can join you at the end of the jump. If you like, you can import any Companion you have into this option for no cost, and they’ll gain the features described above."
26,,Free,Servant ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"If you’re actually getting involved in this mess, you’re probably going to need one of these. If you happen to be a Master, you can have one of these for free. They’re a Heroic Spirit, and you can pick their abilities using any Servant Supplement that you think is appropriate. They can have 1000 Servant Points to use in that Supplement for free, but if you think they need more you can pay CP for SP at equal value. Bear in mind that they can only have up to 1600 extra SP using this approach, for a total of 2600 SP. Any new Companions that are Servants gains the Servant origin, and they can have 300CP to spend on the Servant perks found in this jump. If you want to copy a certain blue-robed Caster of a different timeline and happen to be a Servant, you can pay 600CP for a Servant, following the same rules as already stated. They don’t share converted SP with you though. If you like, you can import a single Companion into this option for free, as long as you actually have a Servant of some sort for that purpose. They don’t get any more CP than already explained, and you aren’t allowed to use the Master option."
27,,Free,Servant Command Runes,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"3 special Seals that make a fancy pattern, usually found on the back of a hand but you can specify somewhere else as long as it’s on your body as well as their general appearance. Having these makes you a Master in the Great Holy Grail War, and means you have a Servant to command. These things connect you to what is essentially an incredibly powerful familiar, supplying energy to keep them existing. Each of the three parts of the seal can be expended to give a powerful order to your Servant, even ones they’d normally never agree to. Like killing themselves. Alternatively, you can use them to massively enhance your Servant, like ordering them to ‘Jump’ and letting them practically fly across a city at a ridiculous speed. However, once you use up your three Seals, that bond between you and your Servant will vanish, and they’ll run out of energy to sustain themselves and fade away. More powerful Servants might be able to resist one or even two of the orders you enforce on them, so spend them carefully. This is of course an optional acquisition, but if you came here why wouldn’t you want to get involved in the battle over the Grail?"
28,,Free,Your Dearest Friend,Library of Ruina,Control,"Huh! Where’d they come from? Well, probably not a big concern, really. This person is in a great position to become your best friend, or something more! Not like, supernaturally so. They’re just the kind of person you really get along with, pulled to you by destiny. Destiny. Nothing else. Just destiny. No issues here. Probably. Anyways, aside from being generally agreeable, they have the potential for EGO, an origin and 800cp to spend (with more transferable at a 1:2 ratio), and Iron Lotus for free. The Iron Lotus is a particularly good deal, insomuch as it seems to latch onto you particularly well, the results of their bottled emotions swelling greatly when directed towards you. This... might actually be a point of concern, but I’m sure you haven’t indirectly (or very directly) ruined any ones lives by accident, causing them to devote their lives to killing you, the cold fury boiling in their veins swelling to match you, even if you were to be a force as great as the Library (or greater). Probably.

...Don’t worry too hard about it? 

You can also import a pre-existing best friend."
29,,Free,Pegasus,God of War,Control,"Birthed from the neck stump of Medusa, few mounts are as graceful as Pegasus. This winged horse is fully trained, capable of all kinds of tricks and maneuvers, both on land and in the air. Additionally, it will always be faster than you, regardless of how fleet you become, though it strangely seems to teleport to your side when called."
30,,Free,Are You Serious?,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"It would fit for a deviant war to have an eccentricity such as this to be repeated. It seems that you have decided to use yourself as a catalyst to summon... None other than yourself! Or maybe it is that you are the one being summoned by a local version of yourself. Perhaps one that outlived your supposed death and record into the Throne of Heroes, if you are a Servant yourself.

This being is undoubtedly ‘you’, albeit they may not keep your full Jumper status. If you are a Master, they are now limited to the scale of a Servant container. While they may gain some abilities from this, they will also be ‘downscaled’ if they were powerful enough. If they are a Master, then they may be no greater than whatever you have purchased in this jump. Whatever their circumstances were, they seemed to be quite amused by the situation, and eager to partner with you.

Requires Recurring Immortal, Bloodsucker, Cursed Blessings Upon the World or I Saw That Too! To Purchase"
31,,Free,The Tools of A Master ,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"You have been selected by the Holy Grail, and thus you have been granted several privileges. First is the one the mark that signifies your right to summon, contract and command a Servant. The Command Seals. These manifest in the form of a tattoo-like three-parted sigil in a location and shape unique to you. Each of these is a powerful pre-stored spell-like effect that allows the Master to issue an absolute command to the Servant. This effect is normally inviolable for most Servants, provided that the order is specific enough, and even those with powerful egos and magic resistance will feel some pull with just one. They can also be used to boost the power of a Servant, or even allow small but powerful effects like teleportation. Being contracted with a Servant will draw a part of your magical energy, with the cost increasing the more powerful the Servant is, and the more of their power they are using at the time.

Along with this, you also have the ability “Master’s Perspective”, which allows you to easily identify information about Servants, both yours and those others, with just observing them. When it comes to just parameters, it is easy to identify most of them with just a glance unless they are under some powerful concealment spell or ability. However, skills and Noble Phantasms will require a closer examination when used, and even then the information may not be perfect. How this is visualized depends on the Master. Some may see this information as a videogame character sheet, while others may have more esoteric interpretation.

As a final note, as you have been recognized as a Master by the Holy Grail, it would be possible to once again participate in other Holy Grail Wars, such the opportunity presents itself. You also could contract even more than one Servant in this Holy Grail War, provided that you had the magical energy to spare, albeit not just summon them yourself just with this."
32,,Free,Brunhilde and Göll ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Control,"The two Valkyries who looked upon the whole Tournament with baited breath. If they are alive and humanity is victorious, you may take them with you..."
33,,Free,Your Einherjar,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Control,"The greatest examples of humanity. Be it their skill in battle, their leadership, their genius or their vileness. This is the previous option in reverse, allowing you to replace a Valkyrie and take the human you matched with as a companion for free and to be freely imported. For example being Adams Volund would get you Humanities father."
34,,Free,Your Valkyrie ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Control,"The Weapons and allies of humanity in the Tournament. You may choose to combined this with ‘Your Volund’ making the Valkyrie your personal weapon. Should you not have chosen to pair with a Companion you may take a canon Valkyrie as your Volund, the one of the fighter you replaced. For example replacing Kojiro would get you Hrist. They get the same boon that would go to a Companion, as in they can be imported free of charge."
35,,Free,Water Gun,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control,"The weapon is an actual water gun. By pumping the gun you can build pressure and fire streams of water from the attached tank. Water alone doesn't deal much damage, so as an additional part of this weapon, there is an enchanted pot that orbits you which has a violent magical plant planted within. By watering the plant it will fire out spores that can deal some damage. Though you will have little control of the orbiting pot, or of the plant's aim."
36,,Free,Animal Companion ,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Control,As a Disney Princess you can gain an animal companion who has a spiritual connection to you and near human intelligence. If you already have an animal companion who already has a spiritual connection and near human intelligence to you may import them for Free. You may only take this once and your animal companion is granted +600 CP to spend in this supplement as they wish.
37,,Free,Spirit Collection Book,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"Even if you are not an avid Spirit collector, simply by journeying around the World of Light and challenging Galeem you are likely to acquire hundreds of them. This odd tome allows you to store them all in one place.

Any willing Spirit may enter this book, appearing on one of its pages as a nice picture for you to look at. Should you have multiples of the same Spirit, you may decide whether they appear as separate pictures, or whether the picture has a nearby number to let you know just how many of it you have. You may pull a Spirit out whenever you need it. Companions possessing a Spirit form can also reside in the book, even whilst inactive. 

The book will be able to expand indefinitely, without appearing any bigger externally or getting any heavier. You will always be able to find whichever page it is you are looking for right away.  You may sort your Spirits in all sorts of ways (such as via series, via class, or via power), you may set ‘favourites’ to quickly find, and you may also set up pre-set teams, allowing you to quickly prepare for a fight.

The book cannot be destroyed, and will always be nearby when you need it. Under no circumstances may you enter this book yourself. At the end of each jump, any Spirits which are not also companions or followers will be automatically ejected from the book."
38,,Free,Spirit Tuner ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control,"A Tarnished noblewoman who, despite having never seen the guidance of grace, Roderika traveled to the Lands Between along with her companions. After arriving, those companions fell victim to Godrick, becoming subjects for his grafting, she found her talent for spirit tuning, which may be useful for you."
39,,Free,Grey Pup ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control,"Legends tell of how Artorias the Abysswalker had a grey wolf companion he raised since birth, one he trained in order to aid him in combat. Like him, you now have your own wolf pup, who will turn out to be easy to train, undyingly loyal to you, and eventually grow to the size of a building. Alternatively, this could be the Abysswalker’s trusted wolf herself."
40,,Free,The Countess        ,Hellsing,Control,"How strange to see him in this form, while he yet maintains another body. Do two counts now exist, one male and another female? If you choose to access this option, another version of Alucard will exist in this world, one much more fond of their female form. It may even be possible that this Alucard was originally female instead. They’ve taken a fair interest in you and what you get up to, finding you quite the interesting soul. For now, they’ll mostly stick to following you around and causing trouble in your area, leaving you to take part or clean up the messes. There’ll be plenty of chances to get to know this new vampire but there’s no guarantee they’ll remain interested in you. If you can forge a significant bond or remain a marvel to them, they’ll certainly come along with you as a companion at the end of your time here. If not, they’ll disappear into the night."
41,,Free,Laser Puppy,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Control,"One of Star’s first creations, a Labrador Retriever puppy that could shoot lasers from its eyes, fell into a black hole. It seems to have ended up in your possession. Right now, the lasers it shoots aren’t that powerful, and it’s untrained... but who knows what it might grow into, if you train it right?"
42,,Free,Grey Wolf,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control,"A loyal and mighty creature, with teeth like swords and hide like steel, easily the size of a house, perhaps larger.

She barely survived the fight against Hela, and spent the time since hiding on earth. While at a cafe, she met you by accidentally spilling coffee down your shirt. When she asked how she could apologize, you asked for a date. Flattered, she accepted. The first date went well, and she’s now waiting for the second one, her time with you being the first time she has enjoyed herself since she was with her Valkyrie sisters."
45,,Free,Hela,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Control,"The Asgardian goddess of death and former Executioner of Asgard. But when, her ambition outgrew Odin’s, he banished her, caging and locking her away like an animal, banishing her to the desolate wastes of Hel, condemned to rule an eternity. So imagine her surprise when you and her somehow managed to get a mental connection. Every night, while sleeping, you were projecting to Hela, and though she at first tried to get rid of you, then tried to ignore you when that didn’t work, you slowly managed to integrate yourself into her good graces. Having been lonely for a millennia with no one to talk to besides herself, she at first struggled with being social, but you slowly made her come out of her shell. Eventually, she came to long for the few hours when you where there with her, to have someone to talk with. As you two got to know each other, you took the role of a friend/psychologist, who she could unwind with and tell about all her woes with her father and what happened in the past, until she eventually came to terms with it. She is still a raging, impatient, volatile, and supremely ambitious personality masked by a casual confidence and appearance of friendliness, but she has realized that she is an effective and brutal wartime leader, but not a Queen fit for peace, at least not yet. And though she still doesn’t agree with her father, and is still angry at what he did, she also accepts that she had let her ambition and bloodlust grow too uncontrollable. And while talking and getting to know each other over time, she also realized she had begun to form an... attachment to you. Now that she has realized how deep this attachment is, she will let nothing stop her from having you, from protecting you, from... loving you. Her only hope is that you will love her back, and accept her in all her divine, beautiful and monstrous glory."

Once again, hello, I am Beelzebub, The Great Fly, The Crimson Lady, and now you’re trapped with me in the Abyss. Unless you have any way to leave this place? Worry not, if you happen to be unable to, I am quite confident in my ability to keep you entertained in the interim.

Beelzebub has a very useful ability (monstrous form), ‘Ancient,’ and ‘A Weird Piece Of Wood x3’"
50,,Free,Helltaker’s Harem,Helltaker,Control,"You get nine -nine!- beautiful Demon Girls! Well, really eight Demons and one Angel. Who are they? Well, if you go back to ‘Puzzles,’ the names of the puzzles are the girls’, with Azazel being the Angel. They all have ‘Demon Physiology,’ and ‘Beaut.’ I’ll tell you about my fellow demonkind (and angel):

-Azazel is a closet pervert and bicurious.
- She has a quirk (Angel), and Puzzle (2nd tier)

-Pandemonica is polite, socially awkward and archaic in demeanor but in an elegant way... when tired. If given coffee (which she’ll ask you to make), she’ll show her true colors: she’s a not-very-gentle sadist.
- She has a ‘Bad End Knife,’ Puzzle (1st tier), and a quirk (second personality)

Modeus is the most lustful of all demons, but she’s completely new to this ‘romance’ thing and finds it kinky; have fun seeing her blush at the mere mention of holding hands or kissing.
- She has a ‘Bad End Knife’ (Sledgehammer version), and Puzzle (first tier)

Judgement is secretly the kindest of demons but after taking the role of High Prosecutor she took an over-the-top fierce act and learned to enjoy it.
- She has ‘Hell’s High Prosecutor,’ a Puzzle (boosted third tier), and a ‘Bad End Knife’

Justice is the coolest demon of the bunch, second only to me of course, and she’s supportive of everything you do as long as it’s reasonable.
- She has an advantage (blind but completely functional nevertheless), ‘Hell’s High Prosecutor,’ and a Puzzle (2nd tier)

This intelligent, speaking bird of fire decided you’re the guy or gal it wants to hang with and spends it’s time with you. It’s not much of a fighter or a healer, it prefers to be called a lover, but it can scratch out eyes and heal minor wounds pretty fast. It’s also near impossible to kill. Listening to it’s advice and suggestions is probably a terrible idea but you’re almost always going to have a blast doing it anyway. Usually literal blasts from the massive fire explosions."

A particularly unique Counter Guardian from the far future, TOHSAKA has apparently been assigned by the Counter Force to watch over you, instead of her usual Grail hunting mission, and either help you do something or prevent you doing something. Apparently she forgot and, in all honesty, she probably wouldn’t have much success with either even if she knew. Despite her penchant for silly faces and careless collateral damage, she’s easy to convince to help out if you were trying to do good in the world and can’t help herself becoming friends with great guys like that. She also really likes anyone with a lot of money, though you’d be advised to not let her have access to all your funds. TOHSAKA’s past that led to her becoming a Guardian is a touchy subject but she would love to have a trusted friend to open up to about it in time. If you happened to stay friends and not kill each other by the end of the jump, she’ll be able to leave behind the Counter Guardian role and come with you as a companion. See notes for additional options. 

If you want, and can stand the certainly bizarre nature of it, you can change out TOHSAKA for another Counter Guardian based on a non-Servant character present in Fate Stay Night. The boring but effective EMIYA, the truly terrifying living grail MATOU, even a ferocious tiger known only as TAIGA"

She thinks of herself as a trained Hashashin even though she only knows simple knife fighting and
basic stealth. Her eyes roam around, checking for weak points and hiding places, even if she doesn’t
know what those are. Her cheeks get vibrantly red if you point this out and she will stomp slightly

in any sort of danger. They love to play around with gold and magic, bounding through the desert
sand unbothered by the sun. This one looks up to you like a parent, affectionately nuzzling you and

Normally, if harm came to one's Fylgja, harm would come directly to one's own self, but you will be exempt from this and any Fylgja will just disappear and be able to be re-summoned by you if harmed. Intrinsically they are part of your soul expressed into the physical world; able to freely enter dreams, realms of the dead, thoughts, or other esoteric conceptual spaces carrying messages and acting as heralds. It takes a great being to even have one, and each one represents a very slight growth in your luck and power. They are able to function and benefit in any way a familiar should and you can express your power through them. They are spirits and as such do not have mortal needs. You will gain one free for each hamr you possess, corresponding to that hamr, including your starting one, so everyone gets one free. Those purchased here can only be mundane animals. They can do anything a normal animal of its kind can do, they love you and are loyal because they are part of you  but they are still animals. If someone tried to read your mind or soul they would find a menagerie of beasts, having a Fylgja allows you to think as that animal and grows your hamingja. First purchase is free."

This ring comes preloaded with a companion monster. Pick one that would synergize with you. Like Mii, the fire-using mage,and Ignis, her phoenix companion. Feel free to customize their appearance now, instead of waiting for your guild crafter to makeyou the right item.

Your monster will have their own stats, level, and skills that you call upon in your adventures. If you have any training or learning boosters, they also apply to your pet, as do uncappers.

As a bonus for paying CP for your new friend (instead of waiting until floor seven,) your friend can manifest in a mundane, pet-friendly form in reality. (A phoenix would be a parrot or songbird, a mimic would be a snail, a bear would be a ferret or guinea pig or something else, etc.) Comes with all the pet accessories too, for your living space.

For each purchase of this option you will receive a miniaturized version of an existing monster in this setting. While their powers have been largely removed save for the most minor (such as a nymph still being able to float and fire drakes being warm to the touch) they’re quite cute and incredibly loyal. Did I mention that they’re great for snuggling? Just don’t show them off too much to others, some of these might be considered in slightly bad taste."

As your bond grows, you can call him to you and vice versa from further ranges. In actuality this cute animal is everything but low level, something you will come to discover very quickly on your adventures.

You cannot buy multiple pets, but each purchase beyond the first grants your pet another tier up from the first in Embodiment of Fear (five purchases total for a Primal Devil). At two purchases your pet gains Contract Creation, at three it gains Devil Consumption, at four it gains Implement of Fear, and at five it gains Hero of Hell. You cannot transfer CP to your pet and it counts as part of your being for the purposes of your chain. If you like, you can import it as a companion later without any loss to your connectivity.

Drawn in cartoonish style and lacking the powers and gear of their true self, at least in any effective manner, they’re a cute and humorous homage to the real deal.

Each time you pick this option, one existing servant is converted to become a Saberface. Not only do they share Arturia’s appearance, it’s quite likely that many of their abilities, items and their backstory will shift to fit an Arthurian angle. Or maybe something from Rome. Or France. Even their personality is not safe from the encroaching plague of Saberface. 

Taking this option ensures that, for whatever reason, the chosen Servant considers you their close ally or friend. They’re already willing to come with you to another world, if you ask. How conveniently priced! The only downside is that the more powerful the newly Saberised Servant, the more trouble they’ll draw towards you before your time here is up.

Beneath her idle demeanour beats the heart of a raging beast in human form. Beneath her seemingly plain build are rippling muscles and scared flesh from a lifetime of survival in the wild. High in the mountains there was once child raised by a cult of mad assassins as the vessel of a demon who embodied the “principles” of martial arts. Whether or not they succeeded will forever be a mystery. Using an esoteric technique to walk and breathe funny, she can seemingly go invisible and knock out men much bigger than her with one hand. With simple brute force, she can kick a man through the ceiling. And those double-pupiled mystic eyes of hers let her see through all combat moves well in advance.

As her old drinking buddy, naturally after you left the mountains she followed you hoping in the hopes of finding better beer and meat."

I can trap your enemies in dream worlds, and bolster you and your friends’ spirits so hard you can break your limits and unleash your special abilities like never before! Mostly I’m good at parties though. Or politics. Every word I say that comes out of my mouth soaked in insincerity. You uh, kind of suck by the way. You suck on ice, that’s how much you suck. Yeah. In fact, HAHAHA, if you’re willing to accept eternal slumber as a penalty I can promise you victory over nearly any foe! So lemme crash on your couch and make a mess and complain about random things. And if you’re lucky in life, you’ll never need anything more from me”

Once upon a time, there was a dire worm who dreamed of growing up to be a dragon. And who came first, I don’t know, and neither does anyone else. It’s all hot garbage anyway. I guess there’s no point lashing out if the children of the Crimson Moon are the dominant species here but listen. If life ever has you down.

It told you it was a magical shapeshifting book that thought you looked lonely and could use a friend. As you play together you’ll find it has several unique abilities. Shapeshifting versatile enough to function as a physical copy of you or gift itself attributes from fairytale monsters, the ability to loop time and an ability called a Reality Marble that overrides local reality with a magical wonderland where fantasy takes precedence over reality. In general her abilities resemble those of the greatest Ploy Kickshaws but she disapproves of using them in cynical, callous or “adult-like” ways, believing that the wonders of childhood should be used to put smiles on children’s faces.

Your book friend is generally childlike in an old-fashioned kind of way and always happy to see you happy, but sometimes melancholy about how as civilisation moves on more children are spending time with their phones and less with their picture books. It can replicate your form, or that of a small girl it claims to have met “somewhen soon, but far away”. Some mages might identify her as what’s known as a “Heroic Spirit” but she insists she’s simply a friendly guardian of whimsy and nothing more. Lately she’s been having dreams about a sea of ones and zeros into which both the young and young at heart escape from cruel reality into. A sign of the times to come, perhaps?"

Word on the street is that she’s somehow managed to inhale the lingering essence of a god, but that would be ridiculous r-right? Supposedly her family practices some sort of magecraft based around eating bits of Phantasmal Beasts to replicate their properties in their own bodies in the hopes of reaching the Root by distilling countless Phantasmal bloodlines into a new Prime Species superior to humanity but IT DOESN’T MATTER. Run from the sight of those bouncing curls because as a specialist in body reinforcement she’s about to cast SUPLEX.

Your rival is generally refined and patronisingly affable to everyone except you, who she keeps trying to say “hello” to by attempting to beat at everything. As a well-educated heiress your rival is also a font of good advice and ironclad camaraderie after she’s done establishing who among you is the dominant force. Also maintains a strong friendship with her Edelfelt relatives, the soot witch descendant May Riddell Archelot and several other rival-type characters.

With her black and curly hair, her gentle yet intense eyes and the kind of body that manages to make a nun’s habit look degradingly sensual while being on the svelte side your first impression is a compassionate and kind philanthropist with a saintlike talent for helping people through mental health challenges. Men AND women can’t help but ogle her curves, then feel bad about it trying to be their best selves.

Closer investigation still will reveal there is something wrong with the way she uses Sacraments. Oh, she can strike like a vicious serpent and with surprising strength for one so slim but instead of golden light her power resemble phantasmal hands reaching out of her shadow and gaping portals full of pink light that pull in souls and matter alike. Powers that a horrified mage might identify as a mangled attempt to replicate the Third Magic. Powers that frighten her own colleagues in the Church, yet have set her for rapid promotion despite only recently joining. While she truly does care for others, sometimes...sometimes seeing how little they appreciate what they do pains her. She’s started considering some sort of ritual she thinks will prove a point. Something she calls the Sabbath that she’s just waiting for the right partner to participate in with.

Someone like you."
103,,50,Monster Larvae,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"Larvae of a monster, which very well might be an Eidolon. It evolves one year into the Jump, and can be a juvenile monster or Eidolon of your choice. Note without Dragonspeak or Pact Magic (or similar), some creatures may be difficult to tame."

105,,50,Three-Headed Hound ,God of War,Control ,"The guard dog of Hades has had many children, many litters that all share core elements with that dreaded beast. All have three heads, and all of them require someone of at least demigod level strength to slay them. How fortunate then, that you find yourself as the newest owner of a three headed pup. Though they may be small now, they will grow to be second only to their legendary progenitor, and absolutely loyal to you."
106,,50,Pink Doctor,God of War,Control ,"Occasionally, there are moments when the gods make some questionable decisions, and this is one of them. After a night of passion between Apollo and a doe, this demigod was born, a demigod deer with a blue nose. His mind was bright, and he turned his gifts towards helping those around him, becoming a medical professional without peer. Still, he feels rather isolated, and would greatly treasure any companionship."
107,,50,Crimson Champion,God of War,Control ,"It is always strange when a girl trains to be a warrior, yet this daughter of Ares has chosen to do exactly that. Her natural abilities combined with harsh spartan training has turned her into a peerless fighter, often referred to as being an invincible warrior by her peers. And yet for all her skill in combat, her demeanor is kind and merciful, often willing to let her foes live to see another day."
108,,50,Blue Prince,God of War,Control ,"A young demigod child of Poseidon, wielding a sword of enchanted bronze. Though he may not be the brightest, nor the most cheerful, he is a determined lad who is as deadly in a fight as the sea is vast. He can surround himself in a miniature hurricane, possesses the ability to talk to horses and sea life, and will fight tooth and nail for those he considers friends. Strangely, he also prefers having his food the color blue."
109,,50,Bag of Little People,Adventure Time,Control ,A bag of miniature versions of you and those closest to you. They’re mostly simplistic copies of people but they interact with each other and you can influence them through prodding. They communicate with each other in a nonsensical language.

Working with that abnormality now produces your most desired results. After the jump, the abnormality's individual cell can be added to your warehouse as an extension. You can work with it in order to produce energy or bring it along with you as a companion (if it's capable of movement).

This particular chocobo is remarkably brilliant, with near human-like intelligence, able to learn and grasp concepts and understand (though not speak) your language."
112,,50,Chimera,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"A magical chimera, an artificial animal of your choosing with the capacity of using magic circuits, which has been crafted or purchased by you. Of course, the beast is not smart enough to know how to use them, but regardless it is quite smarter than other animals of his kind. It can be quite a loyal companion, but it may also be used for experiments or rituals. If killed, you may either have it resurrected in your next jump, or get a new one in a month."
113,,50,Lunar Shadow        ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Control ,"The Half-Wolf warrior who serves the Lunar Princess, Blaidd’s skill with the massive greatsword on his back is just as incredible as his sheer force of will. He would never do anything to betray his mistress, and now neither will he betray you and your goals. Even if the Greater Will forced his hand, he would never lay a hand on the one he calls a friend."
114,,50,Pet Armadillo,The Road to El Dorado,Control ,"This here is an adorable little pet armadillo that you can take with you on your travels. It's very friendly and cooperative with you and will try to help you anyway it can. In addition, its rubbery hide is great for petting! With some clever thinking, and your adorable pet’s assistance, it could easily serve as a rubber ball without getting harmed any more than such a ball could be. Of course it can move on its own while appearing to be a rubber ball, but you wouldn’t take advantage of that would you? In case you were wondering, it seems to have a taste for butterflies which it finds delectable."
115,,50,"Semhale, Errant of the Pavian Order        ",Godbound,Control ,"Until recently Semhale was a promising young squire, entranced by tales of Ancalia’s chivalrous past and earnestly hoping to bring peace to her land with her fellow knights at her side. A jolly, muscular farmgirl, her faith in chivalry has been shaken by her experiences as a newly anointed Godbound. While her communion with the Words Protection, Endurance and Sun have made her a promising champion, she has seen villages consumed by hordes of undead and worse-the callousness of some remaining civic figures towards refugees. In these dark times Semhale takes great comfort in the warmth and constancy of the sun itself, often manifesting miracles of its light to bolster the courage of her allies and cleanse them of any malign magics from their foes. She remains earnest in her belief that when you met at that campfire, you were destined to achieve great things at each other’s side but under her selfless confidence she’s beginning to doubt whether what’s left of the knightly orders can truly save Ancalia. "
116,,50,A Mystical Compact ,Godbound,Control ,"The arts of low magic sometimes include spells of invocations and summoning, from creatures of primal flame to building obedient golem-like drones. But why not secure a more permanent arrangement? The scroll you hold represents an agreement with a fairly substantial summoned being to come to your defence when called. From a being of clay and stone half as tall again as a man inscribed with the guttering sigils of dead gods to even the horrific Uncreated Unbidden in all its dreadful might, your investment here secures the loyalty of your summoned entity if it is at least somewhat capable of empathy in addition to the right to banish it to this world when you wish. And if it is a horror akin to the Uncreated, the bindings will be strengthened such that it won’t go rogue while in your presence at least."
117,,50,Puppet Fighter,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"With each purchase, you gain a single Puppet Fighter based on a Fighter appearing in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, as if you had created them yourself (if you choose to give yourself a background in this world, and possess the Puppet Master perk, this may well have been the case). Multiple characters in one, such as Pokémon Trainer or Banjo & Kazooie, can be treated as a single purchase if you wish. You may purchase a Puppet Fighter of the same Fighter multiple times if you wish.

By default, the Puppet Fighter appears the same as the Fighter chosen, but with darker clothing and glowing red eyes. You may change this if you wish, as long as you comply with the following rules:
• The Puppet Fighters are distinct enough from the original that anyone familiar with the original knows it’s a fake.
• The Puppet Fighters are close enough to the original that anyone familiar with the original would know what the copy is of.
• The distinction between the copies and originals is uniform across all of your Puppet Fighters. This includes both Puppet Fighters created with the Puppet Master perk, and ones you have purchased individually.

Puppet Fighters you purchase are absolutely loyal to you. They are capable of independent movement, but are by themselves very weak. Their true strength is drawn out when they are taken control of by a Spirit, bringing them only a step below the original. A single Spirit may control multiple Puppet Fighters, but the power of each is weakened for every additional Puppet Fighter beyond the first they control.

All Puppet Fighters you purchase are considered followers, and may continue on to future jumps with you.

118,,50,Puppet Fighter Template Statue,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"Perhaps you want to get hold of a Fighter right away, or you want to ensure you can always make a specific Puppet Fighter? Do you have an ethical issue with holding a Fighter against their will? Are you just lazy? If you answered yes to any of these questions, this is the option for you! With each purchase of this item, choose a Fighter that appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Multiple characters in one, such as Pokémon Trainer or Banjo & Kazooie, can be treated as a single purchase if you wish. You now have a life-sized statue of that Fighter, by default appearing in your Warehouse, though you may have it appear elsewhere if you want. If you have the Puppet Master perk, you may use this statue as a substitute for the real deal when creating Puppet Fighters, with no difference in the created Puppet Fighter.

If you don’t have the Puppet Master perk, then maybe that statue of Peach you have bought will serve as a good conversation piece?

119,,50,Spirit Lapras,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"An odd Spirit of Lapras that defies the conventional wisdom of Spirits. This Lapras, whilst still a Spirit, is able to adopt a physical form at will. It is able to ferry large numbers of people across water, but is as yet untrained and ill-suited for battling. The Lapras is absolutely loyal to you, and will join you in your journey as a follower."
120,,50,Spirit,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"Spirits are beings of energy, who lost their physical form when Galeem attacked. Spirits may be used to empower people, as well as control Puppet Fighters. With each purchase of this, choose 1 Spirit that appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. You gain a copy of this Spirit, who is absolutely loyal to you, and will join in in your journey as a follower. Spirits made up of multiple characters (such as Articuno, Zapdos, & Moltres) count as a single purchase, though you may elect to acquire a Spirit of only one of the characters if you would like. In this case, such a Spirit would lose any “enhanceability” they possessed (see On Enhanceable Spirits in the Notes section for details). You may purchase the same Spirit multiple times if you wish.

This option is for ordinary Spirits, and purchasing ‘Lapras’ here will result in a Lapras that functions as all other Spirits. If you want the odd Lapras that appears in the World of Light, the option below is for you.

126,,50,Princess of Sunlight ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"The second child and first-born daughter of the Lord of Sunlight, Gwynevere is a goddess who embodies the very best qualities of fire, charming all with her beauty and brilliance. With a mind for social maneuvering and the talent to pull it off, what she lacks in power she makes up for in ensuring stability."
127,,50,Crossbreed ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"A stark white, draconic crossbreed trapped inside the painted world of Ariamis, due to the gods’ fear of her lifehunt ability.

128,,50,Baskerville,Hellsing,Control ,"A famous hound indeed, one Alucard keeps as a pet in the castle within his soul. Perhaps the litter that produced the beast was more numerous than expected, as another shadowy beast rests at your side as a loyal companion. A hulking dog of shadow and blood, it has the ability to change size from that of a normal hunting dog to something large enough to easily swallow a man whole. With many tearing fangs, it’s quite the lethal ally, and it’s body heals from most wounds quite quickly. It also likes to play fetch, especially with bloody clumps of meat, and it’s favourite petting spots are the inside of each back leg and it’s chest. Just make sure to remind the hound of the Baskervilles that it is the best killing machine in the world, even if it does love a cuddle. "
129,,50,Control Art Restriction System,Hellsing,Control ,"Chained and bound like the bird of hermes, the alchemical processes and occult rituals that limit Alucard’s strength needn’t be only a mark of slavery.

You possess four levels of binding like Alucard but may control their releases on your own, as well as what abilities are sealed or weakened with each level of binding."
130,,50,Pet Toon,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Control ,"A Toon that isn’t quite sapient; although many Toons are, there are also plenty of animals that have been drawn or penned in to act as background scenery. They’re all about as smart as dogs, regardless of ‘species’- species being in quotes because such Toons can also be normally inanimate objects. Does not count as a companion unless imported, but they get ‘He’s A Toon!’ and ‘Make Em’ Laugh’ for free."

132,,50,Witch Beatrice        ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"This witch is one of the few sorcerers who did not learn from an institute of learning, like the Vinheim Dragon School, but that doesn’t mean she is to be underestimated. She is deadly from a range, and managed to make it all the way to the Abyss before succumbing. Maybe she’ll fare better with you by her side?"
133,,50,Princess Dusk ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"A princess far from her home, both in time and space. She hails from the kingdom of Oolacile, famous for its light sorceries.

He is highly knowledgeable about sorcery, and is willing to teach you what he knows."

139,,50,Morris ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Control ,"In Chinese mythology, the Hundun was a legendary faceless being and the embodiment of primordial chaos itself. The truth is...a little underwhelming. With six squat legs and four tiny yet somehow functional wings, this faceless dog-sized fuzzball is one of many. It’s purring and cooing is actually some sort of language that it can use to share complex information. This is definitely the time to say something inspirational and mysterious about Asian mythology, but the little guy just seems to like hanging around and wants the best for you.

Can be repurchased for more of Morris’ kind.

They signify the bond between you and your Servant, and can be used to command them three times. These commands can only be disobeyed by the strongest of Servants and can even be used to warp reality to limited extents. Ordering a Servant to come to you would teleport them to your location regardless of distance. They may also be used to increase the power of the Master for brief periods, serving as very short lived mana batteries, though such a thing expends their uses. While you receive 3 seals for free, you may pay 50CP to receive an extra seal, as many times as you can afford.

A pack of wolves a troupe of Albinaurics, a swarm of giant rats, a patch of maneating venomous Miranda sprouts. While typically seen as lowly and craven, such creatures often bring unusual advantages such as venom or high speed atypical from the average soldier.

traverse the skies on the back of a Shivan Dragon? Or perhaps you’d like to inspire the righteous by the side of a Serra Angel, or explore the ocean’s depths with a Lord Of Atlantis? Unlike a regular summoning spell, these followers are entirely real, and any restrictions normally incurred on their ‘cards’ such as mana costs for upkeep are waived entirely. They do not count as Companions (and consequently do not take up a Companion slot) but they can be made into Companions if you wish. Like the Arcane Allies option above, you may freely determine their personality and background (where applicable). They are unfailingly loyal to you, and if slain, they are restored to life within one week."
153,,50,Least God of Cuteness,MtG - Kamigawa,Control ,"An eight headed jade serpent with eyes like tiny stars, or some other little Kami has joined your journey. Whilst as smart as a fairly mature child this plush Kami’s nature is to be cute and adorable and thus it continues to do so. It can look like any of the known Kami for no extra cost, though they always seem to be plush and adorable by default."
154,,50,Royal Steed,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"Every king needs a proper horse to survey the battlefield from. It’d look pretty bad if you were
walking while you troops rode too. This beast here is one of exceptional quality and size, just not in
any divine sense. It’s a horse big enough to comfortably seat an eight foot tall man made of bulging
muscles, though it can easily adjust to smaller riders as well. It’s smart for a horse, though not at a
human level, and happily works with you to perform as best as it can. It’s certainly capable of
crushing ordinary soldiers without much trouble and can run as fast as most modern day cars too. "
155,,50,Legendary Mascot,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"Poor Orion, kept as a little teddy bear for Artemis. What a way to spend his years as a Servant. Surely

a animated soft toy, like a teddy bear or plush dolphin, and appear to lack their powers beyond very
minor, cosmetic uses. They’re still the same person, even if curiously lacking or unwilling when it
comes to teaching you any skills they might otherwise know, and could be someone to give sage
advice, inspire you when you’re feeling down or just make you laugh from being a goofy little bear
with the spirit of a hero in it. The little mascot does seem fond of you and, through some miracle, doesn’t appear to mind it’s fate at all. You can also take 2 more mascots for each 50 points you buy

With only one or two exceptions, they are nothing but a platform made out of wood or stone. So, when Link arrives, okay, that's all you really need. But when he leaves... The train is suddenly facing the other direction! How on earth does that work? It’s magic, right? It kind of has to be. Erm, anyways, you now have the useful but extremely niche power of being able to turn any vehicle around, simply by commanding it to do so.

160,,100,Summoner,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Control,"Mortals are not
the only bearers of power. You know this
well. Beyond the veil of mortality, past the
blinders that the Church has cast over
your eyes, there is something more.
Something you can summon, control, and
bind to objects. Beings that can change
the world where you cannot. And if they
prove to be... troublesome, you can
banish them, casting them away from this
world and back to their own. Of course,
this is not an art to use without
preparation, and you do not do so. You’ve
learned true names of three beings upon
whom you may call, each either a Being
from Between Worlds or a Spirit, and
each willing to heed your call and work
beside you without too much fuss."

162,,100,Spiritualist,Overlord,Control,"Dealing with the contracting, binding, and borrowing of power of the spirits of the
world the Spiritualist tends more towards indirect effects, subtlety, and supportive roles than
those of the other more traditional magic caster classes. This is not a branch of magic dealing
solely in summoning, per-se, but it does have more than its fair share of such things. Your spells
tend towards beckoning or influencing the ‘spirits’ within your surroundings in order to
accomplish tasks for you, and potentially even manifesting such spirits directly either as
summons or to empower yourself or others as a form of ‘buff’. Different from druidism which
deals directly with the manipulation of nature your approach tends to work through proxy in
order to manage such changes for you."
163,,100,Séancer,Overlord,Control,"You’ll start to branch off more solidly, focusing on changing the
‘spirits’ of a given area to impede enemies or aid yourself and allies, calling forth spirit servitors
in order to directly work for you, or calling forth spirits within yourself or others in order to
increase their abilities.

164,,100,Conjurer,TES: Magic,Control,"Conjuration mainly involves summoning creatures from other planes of
Oblivion, which doesn't appear in any other universes. Thankfully, you will retain your

entity under their command at a fraction of the cost. You also know every conjuration spell."
165,,100,Devouring Swarm,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Control,"A horde of rats bursts from the ground, rabidly
attacking anyone hostile and throwing the area into
chaos. At higher ranks, the swarm lingers in the area
before disappearing and follows your movements,
and you can even summon a pair of swarms for even
more chaos."
166,,100,Sticky Fingers,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"The Waifu Catalog is a fascinating company that allows individuals to experience their
greatest desires. Despite this ideal image, they are at their core an interdimensional
slave trade with a particularly focus on the more carnal aspects. So it shouldn’t be
surprising that this is one of the most desired skills that every contractor wants. This skill bestows a mastery of the sexual arts to a degree that's frankly dangerous. You are capable of giving any being an unforgettable experience. It isn’t an exaggeration to say that you could lay with a dozen sex goddesses at once and still come out on top. There is no being alive that won’t become putty once you get your hands on them, and, should you wish it, your touch will become more addicting than any drug.

167,,100,Mesmeric Call,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Your voice is a gift, capable of captivating even the coldest hearts. As one of the
greatest singers in the universe, your songs possess a mesmerizing quality, especially
when you sing about that which you care for. Much like how Priscilla’s song about
Blaidd was more meaningful due to the family's connection to the Half Wolf. This
captivating melody can also be used to entrance targets, though those with strong
willpower can resist if they try. Additionally, for beings without the ability to hear, you can
convey your message directly through emotions, allowing them to understand your
sentiments and intentions clearly."

Earth’s Ten-Tails when Hashirama managed to restrain it during the Climax of the
Fourth Shinobi World War. Somehow, you managed to tame a group of around fifty

another God Tree’s seedling or even created artificially by cloning the originals. In
terms of strength, these beings are as powerful as the average jōnin, but their forms

people to become your loyal worshipers."

193,,100,Cult of Mystery,Egyptian Mythology,Control ,"Not all cults of gods are spread far and wide, and in fact some are quite exclusive in who may join. You have a cult comprised of ten priests or priestesses who are devoted to your secrets and understanding.

You can decide on the structure and publicity of your Cult, whether they be a secret sisterhood who usher in only new members who are vetted, or an open and public sect of worship who welcome all to give prayers and offerings to you. You may define these initiated members as specifically as you like - left-handed bald eunuchs or maidens with a particular type of birthmark.

If you are not a Neter yourself, they either view you as a senior priest/priestess/oracle to a yet higher power, or perhaps they are delusional in their belief that you are an incarnation of a god.

Your Cult of Mystery grows with your worshipper base; for every 100 worshippers, your cult increases by one member, and the minor temples and secret meeting places in which they gather are as widespread as the prayers to you."

It just takes a blink of your eyes, and standing in front of you is a flaming horse. Actually it looks like it literally is made out of flames. It gallops at a pace substantially quicker than the pace you run at – well that’s to be expected, it’s a horse!

Firemane grows as it is fed fire in both height and overall size. It’ll let you ride it around and won’t burn you – but if it gets into a fight, best have a water hose ready to minimize the damage. So far, the biggest specimen we’ve seen was about a good sixteen feet tall. We had twenty odd mages tossing spells at it to keep it growing though.

100 – Firemane absorbs fire.
200 – Firemane absorbs both fire and water.
300 – Firemane can also turn invisible when it runs.
400 – Firemane gains the ability to discharge massive bolts of lightning.

One Tonberry is a soldier that likes to stab people with his knife and abuse his war cry. Another is a mage that likes to toss about Ardor spells like a pyromaniac. A third is a healer who has a disturbing talent for battlefield surgery.

They vanish once the battle is over. Only one set may be active at a time. They work together well, but generally ignore you and your companions – though they will not attack you and your companions either."

If you’ve met her as a Student, Counselor, or The Shadow you managed to strike up a friendship when you were younger but have since drifted apart until you met her back in Middle School and continued that friendship when you finally found her again, she seems to enjoy your company and so it shouldn’t be that hard to ask her to come with you when this is all over.

If you’re an Otherself, than you haven’t met Arata Kohata’s Incomplete Otherself, but when you do, you will be saving her from Black★Rock Shooter’s rampage and manage to get her away from there and thusly earn her thanks however silent it may be. Unlike Arata herself, her Otherself is a skittish, fearful sort, appearing as if ready to jump at her own shadow if she had one. Setting her up before she fully forms into a complete Otherself and makes her Territory will earn her eternal gratitude and aid in any future engagements, making convincing her to turn into a companion an easy task.

Arata has the two freebies of the Student origin and Masochistic Will, her Incomplete Otherself has the two freebies of the Otherself origin, and Allies of Convenience, and has all of the freebies of the Otherself Maker and any powers you choose for her are not gained until an hour later along with her Territory.

You can project an aura of palpable menace without changing anything about your expression or body, enough to horrify or unnerve those of strong will, this intimidation effect increasing when you do actually decide to use words and morph your face into a dead grin. So unsettling is this menace that you’re able to cause others to back off or not even dare approach those you consider ‘yours’ even if that something is a person. Of course, this effect isn’t unbeatable and some will be able to push through it but it will always have at least some effect, even if the thing you’re using this on is a soulless emotionless killing machine it will give them pause, if only momentarily... and that maybe is all that matters.

As a bonus you’re quite good at ventriloquism and throwing your voice, perfect for playing with dolls and such."

You do realize you're supposed to slay the Princess right? Not take on her powers? Not risk damning us all for the sake of your obsession with power? Thankfully for all involved, this one lacks any notable abilities beyond allowing you to charm and entice people with how...eugh...how endearing you are. A sort of ‘universal empathy’ radiates from you and makes others more likely to treat you with compassion, at the cost of you feeling the need to ensure their own happiness."

But it seems that, for whatever reason, you have the ability to hop from body-to-body - from prospective vessel to prospective vessel - and instill in them a sort of daring 'courage', a motivation to go out there and 'do something' in spite of all reason telling them otherwise.

While not quite as receptive to complicated orders as the Hunting Hound understands basic commands and will generally follow them.

221,,100,DROP PODS,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"To preserve the safety of Spira – and likely other worlds you venture to, for the most part your monsters will remain contained within their pens. Even if you trust your monsters to behave, you can’t expect others to believe the same – especially considering the opinion that most people hold of monsters. But it’s also understandable that you want to put your monsters to use – hence the use of these drop-pods.

Whenever you see fit, you can activate a drop pod, deploying a monster or a group of monsters from a pen. Smaller sized monsters will fit in greater numbers in a pod, though you naturally can’t deploy more than what you actually possess.

While a pod can be activated anywhere, appearing after a short wait period – after deployment it cannot be used again for a moderate period of time. You have 4 pods to begin with – though you can get additional pods at 1 pod per 50 CP.

While this does turn a chaotic battle into something that you can predict and gives you a bit of breathing room between each action you take, the same goes for your enemies as well...Any advantage you gain from this will likely be shared to them.

ATB Shift – A style that seems more suited for spell casting and those who like to use skills prolifically – while all of your skills seem to have a small fixed minimum cast time, this reduces the existing cast time of all your skills by a quarter so long as it remains active. You have to wonder who ever developed systems like these..."
228,,100,Makimain’t,Chainsaw Man,Control ,"An alternate version of Makima that joins along with you as a companion shortly after the Jump begins, this Makima is much more sane and human than her original counterpart. Her goal is to improve the world through more benign pursuits and she is very loyal to you. She was born and raised in Japan and has a personality in line with Makima’s persona. She is just as cunning, skilled, and intelligent, however. You can choose to make her a Hybrid instead of a human and buy her Embodiment of Fear at a discount (not stacking). If you want, you can design a few differences for her in appearance, way of speech, and other surface-level details so as to not confuse them or make it obvious when they meet each other. Either way, Makimain’t and Makima will get along fantastically and probably fall in love if you let them get too close."
229,,100,Student Number Two        ,Fate/Stay Night,Control ,"Taiga Dojo! Tired of seeing the same protagonist die over and over because they decided to take reasonable, sensible choices, the grandmaster of the Dojo has decided to take on a new subject. The Tiger chose you. At any time after you've failed at a task or goal, you can access the Taiga Dojo within your mind. Awaiting within will be Taiga Fujimura to tell you why you failed and give you hints as to how to proceed. At least, that's what she says she'll do. In reality, Taiga does little but make fun of your failure, your obvious stupidity for losing and will quickly descend into ranting. From time to time, other characters from your past may appear and help her with commentary or interact with her but I wouldn't expect any help from them either."
230,,100,Seon/Skaze,Elantris,Control ,"This is quite a gift, Jumper. These small, autonomous, melon-sized balls of light are less items and more splinters of the long-dead Shard Devotion. However, that doesn’t stop them from being very useful. These immortal magical beings are called Seons, and while they are fairly rare, you’re bound to see at least a few of them wherever important people gather. Seons can communicate instanteously with other Seons, allowing two parties to converse no matter the distance between them. Seons also make excellent scouts, due to their keen senses, ability to hover, perfect sense of direction, and control over their natural brightness. You could easily send a Seon on errands throughout the city and trust it to carry out your wishes, so long as only talking was involved.

You have now bonded a Seon of your own, and have its considerable resources at your disposal. Seons are fiercely loyal to their masters, and often serve a familial line across many generations. You may similarly pass your bond onto another, granting them the services of your Seon. You may customize your Seon’s name, personality, and even color.

Alternatively, you may instead receive a Skaze, a fragment of the Shard Dominion. Skazes function nearly-identically to Seons, however they tend to treat their masters with more sarcastically and abrasively.

Should you wish to create your own network of Seons, additional purchases of this item will be discounted. Send messages across the very cosmere itself with the help of your own loyal servant!

From now on, mindless creatures of destruction and evil like demons, zombies and... well Grimm see you as an ally. They will not attack you. Unless you were to attack them first that is, in which case the protection of this Perk will be for naught."

There is a time in between the card’s usage, and when the card will reform. Without the Tetra Master skill however, they will only project in solid construct form for a short time.

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Tantarian, Wyerd, Abomination cards. Bizarre monsters that attack in flocks when called forth by a Tetra Master. Each of these cards calls a pair of these monsters."

With the Tetra Master skill, the amount of time these cards stay manifested for is longer, and a secondary effect is triggered, based on the card group.

The Tiger Racket, Gargant, Namingway cards. The Tiger Racket is a bizarre weapon, better used as a back scratcher, but when an enemy is struck with it, it dispels standard magical effects. 

The Gargant is a mount, resembling an insectoid mole, but is about as large as a small car. Be careful that it is rather timid and does not react well to being spooked. Both of these manifest longer in the hands of a Tetra Master.

Namingway is an odd rabbit. He prefers to call himself a name rater. Called forth by a Tetra Master, he can rename objects on a fundamental basis, such that others will recognize the object by its new name – though this effect will fade after a substantial time."

236,,100,Chocograph,Final Fantasy IX,Control ,"Oh boy! Calling a Chocobo is no small feat! Or well...perhaps it is, because despite your efforts this Chocobo will run away from you when you call it. At least it is nice enough to stop and dig up stray items, miscellaneous things like native ores, healing items, and so forth as it is madly sprinting away. 

You can call it once a day, and once the Chocobo returns to whatever world it came from, a map will appear in your hands, with crude circles drawn to indicate where the Chocobo dug things up. Happy scavenging!"
237,,100,Students,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"A teacher is nothing without their students, and with this you have your own small team of three new or imported pupils eager to learn. They must collectively take either the SeeD or Soldier backgrounds for free, and will then receive all of the discounts and free perks of that background along with 200cp each to spend how they wish. Having already been members of your class, you and the students are well-acquainted and have a little experience fighting together. These students have been entrusted to your care for field studies, and both the faculty and the students themselves have great trust in you to give them the best training you can. If purchased again for 100cp, you can import or create up to eight companions."
238,,100,Chocobo,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"What amounts to a giant emu covered in yellow feathers. Your chocobo is very friendly, docile, and has already been saddle broken. It runs very quickly on foot and is an excellent jumper. While not trained for battle, this chocobo is fairly brave, and will not bolt unless it's being attacked directly, and has decent potential to be trained as a war mount."
239,,100,Intimidating,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"Just a glance from you can send a shiver up someone's spine, and not in a good way. You're surrounded by this vague aura of threat and unease when you wish to be, unnerving and embedding fear into the hearts of the weak willed and letting everyone know just how dangerous you are. The strong of mind may not be effected, but at the same time they will notice this effect and how it impacts others."
240,,100,Commander,Solo Leveling,Control ,"You have gained the service of an exceptional individual. Whoever they are and how you got to meet them, is up to you. This individual will be forever loyal to you and whatever cause you decide to follow, not leaving your side even before certain annihilation and impossible odds. They will have 800 CP to spend as they wish, and they either come with the free Monster Boss origin or a discounted rank purchase. You can import a preexisting companion for this role."
241,,100,Extra Servants,Fate/Grand Order,Control ,"But unlike other worlds, Masters here are not limited to a single Servant. For every 100CP you spend, you may gain another Servant as a companion in this jump. They gain access to the Servant Supplement and 1000SP to spend there, though they do not gain 300CP to spend on Servant Type perks. They may be a canon character if built properly or be an imported companion for free, with the same restrictions on imports elsewhere in this jump. However, Servants gained through this option do not have the same CP-SP exchange rate as your main Servant. Instead, Servants gained this way may be given extra SP at a 1:3 ratio, 100CP spent for every 300SP they gained. Servants must be given this individually and cannot gain more than 1200 extra SP this way.

242,,100,Puppy!        ,Fate/Grand Order,Control ,"Who’s that cute little thing on your lap? I’ve never seen a dog quite like that. Apparently it calls itself Cath Palug, no relation to another Cath Palug you may or may not know. It’s decided that you are its new friend/guide/servant and settled into your home. It’s awfully cute and fluffy but you get the feeling that it’s a little smarter than it lets on. But surely, animals can’t talk or anything right?"
243,,100,Brothers in Arms Across Worlds,Fate/Grand Order,Control ,"Myths are always getting changed and mixed up. A popular book series coming out in the modern day and becoming a worldwide sensation could radically alter how a Servant appears to be once summoned. You’re a little less alterable in this way. People remember you as you are, unaltered by popular stories and when it comes to specific people, they may even remember you if it’s not even them remembering you! If you’ve met and fought alongside King Arthur in your legend or in these coming battles here, you’ll find yourself remembered as a fighting partner by any version of King Arthur. This’ll never be enough to make them consider you an ally on the spot but these fond memories of you will make people you’ve met before quite a bit more amiable towards you."
244,,100,Furry Friend,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Control ,"Who’s this cutie? Maybe this is the family dog, a stray cat you’ve adopted, or even a sturdy chocobo. This animal is loyal, friendly, and sure to cheer you up on dreary days. This purchase comes with food, care instructions, and anything else you need to give it a good home."
245,,100,Witch of Chains,Kurohime,Control ,"As one of the bullet witches, the Witch of Chains faced abused as a child, with their magical powers being exploited by the Mate Clan, and were forced to face war with their own two eyes by the time they were old enough to walk. They were one of the survivors of Kurohime’s rampage through the Mate Clan’s army, and were amongst those who were incorporated into the Onimaru Gang afterwards. They aren’t too involved with the Onimaru Gang’s Kurohime-hunting activities, as they’re quietly grateful to her (if terrified to the point that they still have nightmares over the battle), but if they were they would prove a potent challenge even to the legendary witch. They can’t quite wield dragon magic, but they’ve mastered magic involving chains, ropes, and bindings to a degree that none other has approached, and their summoned constructs are strong enough to bind even someone boosted by a Hulk Bullet."
246,,100,Easy-Cozy Chair,Kurohime,Control ,"A chair that used to be a human being, it now obeys all your commands and will walk for you, allowing you to travel in comfort while your seat takes care of all the moving."
247,,100,Transfigured Humans,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"A paper bag full of misshapen, finger-sized lumps of flesh, all with hollow, eyeless, expressionless faces. These are transfigured humans created through Idle Transfiguration, compressed down to their smallest form. Simply holding one, willing it to grow, then throwing it will cause it to expand into a malformed, vaguely humanoid monster that’ll instinctively attack anything nearby except you. They’re not particularly strong – any decent sorcerer would have no trouble against them – but their aggression, horrific appearance, and uncanny babbling will make them a terrifying opponent for any regular human, as well as a decent distraction against a sorcerer. The bag refills its contents every month."
248,,100,Tsukamoto,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"A small cursed corpse, taking the form of a small stuffed doll bear with boxing gloves on its paws and a rather ugly face. Its main purpose is to help sorcerers learn how to use cursed energy. As long as it is supplied with a constant, steady stream of cursed energy, it will remain asleep, snoring peacefully. The moment that flow is interrupted, be it by giving it too much or too little, it will awaken and start punching those closest to it until it receives energy once again. The punches definitely hurt, but they aren’t strong enough to seriously injure anyone. Usually, it’s set to only require a low amount of cursed energy at first but will gradually increase its demand, training the user to maintain a higher output."
249,,100,HERITAGE,Final Fantasy VII,Control ,"Reproduction is the innate desire of all life from the tiniest bacteria to the everyday human being on Earth, to carry on one's genetic legacy. Yet whether by evolution, devolution, or just the pesky problems of free will, sometimes one's offspring can deviate a bit too far from their intended course or the act of reproduction can take too much time and resources devoted to other things. This is the foundation of ensuring proper administration. When you share a genetic link to someone or something that is among the living, whether your own offspring, a clone, or even someone you provided some sort of blood or fluid transfusion to, they 'inherit' a sample of your own cells. This provides no special benefit to them, but it allows you to use any abilities or magic you possess on these inheritors as though you had your hands on them, even if you're miles or even planets away from each other. You also have a weak telepathic link to these inheritors, able to suggest emotions and thoughts to them at your will...though this is mostly a mildly annoying nagging by itself, easily shut out by strong wills. At least, for now, it is."

251,,100,My Stallion,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"The most loyal of steeds, worthy for any Saberly king. Of golden mane and knight-crushing hoof, the magical stallion before you is a high class beast. It possesses the speed and agility to remain of use to it’s master, even be they a mighty Saber, and it can also turn into a rad-as-fuck motorcycle for when you want to blend in a little. The motorcycle is just as affectionate as the horse, however that works, and can even drive itself to attack people alongside you."
252,,100,Magical Medeator,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"One day, you came upon a pretty lake somewhere in Imperial Greek Space. A Goddess of the lake, who demanded you call her an idol, asked if you had dropped one of the two witches that were lying in her lake. Both are purple haired elven women who are obviously and inarguably among the top five best spellcasters ever, one much younger than the other.

If you say that either one is yours, the twintailed goddess idol picks her up and shoves her into your skull.  The spirit of the Caster that you chose is now stuck in your head as a mental guide and advisor, apparently enthusiastic about the role. The younger one is endlessly and sometimes scarily idealistic, sweet and kind. The older one is far more cynical, vengeful and cruel towards others. Each one will try to guide you towards their preferred actions, advise you when you ask for it and when you don’t, as well as provide some magical teaching if you make them happy. 

If you happened to say that neither witch is yours, the goddess gets frustrated and throws them both at you. You’re now stuck with both witches in your head, who often argue with each other and get sulky if you take sides."
253,,100,Reece Avenger,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"This scarred dolphin is a veteran of too many wars to count. Once the companion of a holy woman, he struck out on his own path when she met a tragic end. Using his powers of flight and water manipulation, he’s worked as a mercenary across the stars, searching without knowing for something to fill the hole in his heart. It wasn’t until he met you that his cold, hateful heart began to beat once more. Now, even if he doesn’t understand why, Reece has decided to stick with you and keep you safe."

Adam – One of the few male Valkyries. If you take him, he is an early student at St. Freya, learning to use a greatsword.

Carole – Not the most serious person, but very determined. If purchased, she was simply born earlier and attended St. Freya.

Seele – A ‘Quanta’ Valkyrie. Normally trapped in the Sea of Quanta, she’s mostly a normal Valkyrie, but her split personality has control of her powers. It can be a real pain to deal with sometimes... You might also get some questions about her presence.

Susannah – A B-Rank Valkyrie with her heart in the right place, and a hero worship of Durandal.

Cocolia – The Matron of the Orphanage, she has immense skills as a leader, though
minor combat abilities. Ex-Military.

The Vodka Sisters – “Hey, hey! You should totally pick us! We”re like, the best of the best!” “Da, Roza Idiotika is correct, you should definitely pick us.” “Lili! Stop that! We're trying to get hired here!” “Our chances are higher if you stay quiet in that case, Roza.” Buy one Vodka Sister now and get the second 50% off!

255,,100,Fanatical Loyalty,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control ,"All of your followers are fanatically loyal to you, and the Will of the Honkai. Why is that? Well, I don’t know what it is that they see in you, but anyone who agrees to cooperate with you, or work under you, becomes fanatically loyal to you for the duration of the cooperation or subordination. They will act like the most stalwart of comrades who have known each other for years, even if they were mortal enemies only minutes ago. Additionally, any monsters, Honkai Beasts, etc. are innately attracted to you and are also extremely obedient towards you if they are weaker than you (even if that is by an extremely small margin). Post-Jump, they’re not loyal to the Will Of The Honkai anymore."
256,,100,Agent of the Head,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control ,"Arbiter - Calm and quiet, this arbiter somehow lived for centuries and has seen many groups rise and fall. Has become something of a nihilist as a result. Somehow you're interesting, and they wish to observe your shenanigans. As an arbiter, you may find yourself under their tutelage.

Beholder - A government spy capable of remote viewing anywhere on the planet (although they brag they could perhaps go further). A bit of a voyeur, they prefer to sit back and do things from the comfort of their home. Are they a coward or just lazy?

Executioner - A high-tech soldier tasked with heavy duty eradications. If you want an organisation wiped out overnight, they will see it through. Although they are thorough and ensure no survivors when specified, they always delight in watching their targets struggle fruitlessly against their power."
257,,100,Fixer,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control ,"High Grade Fixer - Aloof, pessimistic and bitter. Despite this, they work hard and seriously consider the team. They secretly enjoy your company.

Optimistic Rookie - Young and beaming with life. Shows great potential and will innocently follow your lead. They are idealistic and will try to coerce people to do the right thing.

Informant - A master of disguise who likes to slip in and out of various groups. Doesn't like to talk about themselves, but likes trading information for your stories. Incidentally they love gossip."
258,,100,Distortion,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control ,"Abomination - Caught in a strange distortion, this weird lump of flesh and limbs suddenly appeared next to you. They may be simple minded and struggle to speak english, but treat them right and they'll protect you the best they can.

Experimental - Whether escaped by their own hand or rejected by their creators, this...""person"" is a mess of a human being. They might be stitched up like a puppet, or capable of weaponising their blood. They have trust issues but seem to be on the same wavelength as you.

Stable Distortion- A person who fell under the effects of the distortion effect and became a monster. After an encounter with you it seems to have calmed them down and allowed them to return to a human form...somewhat. They may be bipedal and have a human figure, but they clearly aren’t anymore. Confident you can keep them from rampaging again, they wish to stick by you."
259,,100,Magicite Shard ,Final Fantasy VI,Control ,"This small chunk of green crystal is only a small part of a full piece of Magicite and most of its magic has been lost. However, a sliver still remains. By channeling a touch of magic through it you can use the shard to perform a random summoning of an Esper. It’s impossible to tell what will come springing forth, but it will cost no mana. The shard will shatter into dust after a single use. However, a week after you have used it you will find a new one in your belongings."
260,,100,Gulltoppr,God Of War (2018),Control ,"Much like Heimdell of the Aesir, you have a mount that you can ride into battle. Gulltoppr takes the form of a lion-like creature with large horns, and is strong enough to cause Kratos himself some problems in terms of brute strength. Additionally should you have any abilities involving elemental damage or poison, Gulloppr will be able to channel those elements and control them as easily as you can. Should Gulltoppr die, they will return in three days."
261,,100,Ingrid,God Of War (2018),Control ,"During your travels you came across a sword that was able to fly on its own! It seems to have taken a liking to you and has since proven to be a powerful weapon. Able to fight on its own accord, the blade has a tendency to defend its wielder from nearby threats and is able to even keep up with Mjolnir blow for blow. Another of its powers is that it grants its wielder the ability to fly, as well as create shields by spinning in the air, though oddly the shields are able to grow larger then the blade itself. These shields are strong enough to even hold back a blow from Ragnarok itself for a short time, though it would ultimately fail to stop it forever."
262,,100,Minor Spirits,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control ,"Not all spirits are hermits. Some have groups of weaker spirits that follow them, whether out of fear, blood bonds, or something else. You’re no different, having a bunch of spirits under your command. Numbering in the few dozen, they aren’t trained in any particular skill, something you can amend with effort, and can be quite vicious if made to fight. The actual composition of this group is up to you, whether to have goblins, devils, ghosts, or some other kind of spirit, as long as their individual strength doesn’t surpass that of a normal human soldier. They’re quite loyal, but not exactly paragons of virtue, and if you don’t keep them on a tight leash they’re liable to cause much trouble and pranks. Still, if used properly they can be quite useful. Don’t be too mean to them, now."
263,,100,Magic Lamp,Final Fantasy V,Control ,"A lamp that seems to hold a great deal of summon magic. When used, summons Bahamut, and then progressively less powerful summoned monsters, until it has been recharged with magical energy."
264,,100,A Horse,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control ,"The horse Grani, the best of all horses, of Sleipnir's kin. It’s a big warhorse. It’s strong, smart, fast and already trained for war and will run at great speed for days. It won’t flinch at the sound of battle and readily charge a wall of flame at your command."
265,,100,Gohma Pet,Asura’s Wrath,Control ,"You have a loyal fragment of the earth’s ire by your side. This creature can be any animal known on earth, even extinct ones, except it is no more than 1 foot tall. It does not need food or water, and is intelligent enough to follow simple instructions."
266,,100,Spirit of the World,Asura’s Wrath,Control ,"You are considered a natural being or spirit connected to the world/planet you happen to be on, and are innately aware of it’s themes, biases and motives. You feel the joy and pain of the world in equal measure. You may communicate with local spirits, bypassing language barriers.

Impurity Level: 250"
267,,100,My Good Side,Witch on the Holy Night,Control ,"For some people, multiple personality disorder is a serious medical condition with grave implications for their daily life. But due to the quirks of mage ancestry, yours is more like a funny hat you can take off and put on basically at will. When you wear glasses you come across as nice, friendly and charming. You’re the belle of the ball, the kind of person who can talk a stranger into letting you into their house. When take off your glasses, your ruthlessness and passion can make their blood freeze. As for which one is your true personality-who knows? Not only does it not impede your life in any way, but it appears this comes with a buff to your academic skills that has already let you obtain several professional licenses from the modern world. 

It should go without saying that your elegant beauty is truly worthy of a wicked witch, ensnaring the hearts of men or making them freeze as you please. 

Rumour has it that wearing sunglasses will turn you into a cute weirdo with a nonsensical verbal tic.

...yes, you do need to wear or take off eyewear to perform the switch, for some reason."
268,,100,Pact Magic,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"Many think that the Callers of Mist have an innate connection with the beasts of Feymarch, but it is a respect that is earned, not given. You can speak with Monsters, and may be able to convince them to join your cause, allowing you to summon them to your aid, even if they are miles (or planes) apart from you."
269,,100,Fly Me To The Moon,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"This devilish young woman is your rival, ever since you meet you have been in a cat and mouse game where the roles are constantly changed. Who has better grades, who gets the coolest pet, who is better at magic, etc. An heiress to an old and respected, but still small, youkai clan. You’re pretty sure she’s totally in love with you, but far too prideful to admit it unless you confess first. A pointless struggle that makes it even more funny since she’s basically a bunnygirl. Still, few should underestimate the power of what amount to one of the greatest geniuses ever produced in the youkai faction."
270,,100,Hidden Dragon,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"You meet such interesting people, don’t you? This is a Dragon with aqua blue scales, and a matching hair color as well as a fit frame in their human form. They are a young but powerful member of their species, having the fiery ambition associated with their kind and a quiet fury in battle, though they’re calm and taciturn with others, and surprisingly warm towards you. Most peculiar of all, they claim to belong to a bloodline that research suggests never existed or is downright impossible, giving them the power far beyond someone their age would usually have, even for a dragon. They dodge questions about their identity but are steadfast and loyal to you regardless...and are a surprisingly talented martial artist and magician."
271,,100,Autonomous Marionette,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"What is a human? What is a soul? What makes us who we are? Those were the initial questions one of your teachers and seniors posed herself. The answer, rather than a book on philosophy or magic theory, was the creation of the most ‘complete’ homunculus to date, which was given to you as a graduation gift. She’s a bit of a blank slate, as instead of a philosopher’s stone she has a ‘Maiden Circuit’ instead, which gives her the ability to feel emotions, and develop free will. Sadly, it also come with a set of ‘premade archetype’ installed as a guide of sorts. In her case, she acts like the perfect mix between maid, assistant, and bodyguard. Always capable, always ready, always prepared, and able to fight at anytime. How she develops from there (if she ever does) depends on you. Comes with the knowledge on making more ‘maiden circuits’ for new homunculi, or just implant them in inanimate objects and watch them become sentient."
272,,100,Dozen Cakes,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"The Valkyries are the demi-gods closest to human warriors, the beautiful maidens that selected the greatest men, the lovers of true heroes. Thus, it’s not really a surprise how out of suitors they are nowadays. Seems that you, in pursuit of making sure no other faction got a hold of your powers, ended up reenacting a bunch of heroic deeds in a very classical manner – somehow surviving the ordeal and ending up all the better for it. Such sights were what these maidens had been waiting for, perhaps for far too long, as they got a bit ‘over-enthusiastic’ in pursing you. Well then, if you are familiar with the myths, then you just might know what to do, if not – enjoy having a dozen or so demi-gods stalking you. At least they’ll help in a fight."
273,,100,Crafting My Love,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Among the many Sacred Gears created, the ones related to crafting are rare, especially those as powerful as Real Scare, designated to bring temporary bring to life characters sufficiently written about. Too bad the current user didn’t realize it had activated against her wishes, or that she had developed a sub-species. As expected of a ‘hero’. Indeed, this black-haired girl that gives the impression of a scared cat, is the descendant and inheritor of certain famous writer. Sadly for her, she not only inherited quite a bit of his complexes and fears, but also her penchant for writing horror – specially based on the ‘apparitions’ she sometimes sees and scare the crap outta her, which has unknowingly feeding her SG, thus feeding her creative urges... you get the picture already. Shy, calm, kind, and quite a bit bigoted in the weirdest of ways. Her cat seems to hold secrets."
274,,100,Maiden of Blue Eyes,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Arrogant, smart, wicked, greedy, jerk. There are many words to describe this young tycoon, but no amount would truly do her justice. Orphaned at a young age, she didn’t waste time in self-pity, instead managing to get herself adopted by a couple running a medium-sized business, took it over and made into a billionaire corporation. She thought she was cursed to live an unfulfilling life in a world far too small for her... until she discovered her Sacred Gear: Wicked Trapper, which allows her to ‘seal’ spells, items, attacks, or even beings weaker than herself, into cards to unleash later. As you had been partially the reason of her awakening to the supernatural, you decided to take her under your wing for a bit. As fate would dictate, she quickly showed her natural genius at magic, and went far beyond when she found ways to mass produce more stable and permanent versions of her SG, even if somewhat degraded. She has decided to take the world by storm, and has decided that the first step is to surpass you."
275,,100,Double Cross ,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"As it usually happens, you were skeptical when some random (and admittedly very hot) woman appeared at your door claiming to be your guardian angel. Not only because your life had been pretty shitty so far, but also because she was a fallen angel. A sweetheart that makes you wonder if she’s really a fallen, constantly giving encouraging advice, offering kind words, and baking sweet pastries. Sadly, she’s also extremely violent with anyone that goes against you – which wouldn’t be that strange if she didn’t hang the corpses up for review. Less rare was her ‘sister’ a normal angel that also claims to be your actual guardian angel. Fan of cooking spicy dishes, preaching to random people with hours-long sermons until they too confused to disagree with her view, and known for her vocal disgust of most races outside yours and her own. Both are surprisingly shy to romantic gestures, despite the fact that their powers and number of wings show that they have probably been around since the Great War if not before. Also, their vast knowledge of the sacred gear system and how ancient ruins work is a bit suspicious..."
276,,100,Arme Vapula Heim,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"There’s strength in humanity, strength beyond any supernatural being – at least that’s this guy believes. A young man, but far stronger than he looks. He possesses no Sacred Gear, no fancy swords, renowned bloodline, nor any kind of exclusive powers... what he has is the hope of humanity itself in his heart. He’s a genius of peasants, capable of creating and mastering new martial arts in the middle of a battle, could make a new magic system from scratch that rivals even the devils or dragons’ own in versatility, or even lay out the blueprints for new weapons that would shake the world – and all such accomplishments can be easily taught and learnt by humans and humans alone. A natural born master that despises everything and everyone inhuman, his talents would allow him to push humankind into equal ground with other supernatural factions, if properly cultivated. Calculating, thoughtful and the greatest friend one could ask for, his eyes burn with a cold fury that won’t be ever laid to rest unless he exterminates all obstacles for human progress."
277,,100,Violent Posse        ,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"It helps to have a few phone numbers to call in a pinch. Your family has connections within connections, and access to a few unscrupulous sorts who will happily do any ‘cleaning’ work for you. That is, they’re a collection of hitmen and cleaners that will take care of the aftermath of your battles and sort out the less than legal details. Sweeping up evidence of any supernatural work or battles you’ve done with astonishing skill and in timing, making a city block being pulverized look like construction work or a movie being filmed. So long as your presence wasn’t openly advertised, they can wipe evidence of almost any suspicious doings on your part. You receive a new group of ‘cleaners’ for each jump, each retaining the skills of the last ones."
278,,100,Casual Conversation,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"This is a scroll depicting a lifetime contract for a single Devil - they’re not a ‘canon’ character and in fact are kind of the Hellish equivalent of a beleaguered intern - talentless at magic and combat, surprisingly good at domestic tasks. Anyways for a reasonable fee of magical energy, they’ll do any mundane task you can provide them, though they’ll cower or shirk at any potentially lethal jobs you give them. Should you take pity on this cowardly Devil, you may make them a full companion and they will take up a slot as normal - otherwise, they’re a follower that will miraculously survive lethal injuries and be good as new the following week."
279,,100,Unforgotten Nemesis,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Monster tamers are those that know how to bend the will of lesser monsters and even sentient ones, to make their bidding. Naturally, a powerful being telling a lesser one what to do is not what I’m talking about, but rather being a good hand at training less intelligent ones, such as Lamias, Yuki-onnas, and various other creatures, even when they are stronger than you in a direct fight. Perhaps with enough time and practice you will achieve the level of skill needed to bind powerful and intelligent creatures, such as Dragons, to you, but it will certainly require a lot of practice."
280,,100,Süßes Blut ,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Have you ever been told you smell really good? Well, get prepared because you’re going to be hearing that a lot from now on. Really lots. Seems that as a side-effect of your arrival to this world, your body gained a very special constitution, it has become something similar to catnip for supernatural beings, those with superhuman senses, and even humans with particularly strong noses or magically inclined. For them it’s like your body it’s an ambrosia, attracting them like an addict would be attracted to the fix that gives the greatest high. It makes supernatural beings just so more agreeable when dealing with you in general, Devils offer you a spot in their peerage just to have you around, while nekomatas might just start sneaking into your bed to enjoy the smell, and vampires... your blood has acquired a sweet scent that would draw the undivided attention of any vampire in a three-miles-radius, not to mention a heavenly taste that would have the most prideful of them in their knees begging for a sip."

283,,100,Princess of Moonlight,God of War,Control ,"A relatively young goddess from a far off land, it is not only her blue skin or four arms that make her stand out, but her mastery of magic that is second to none in these lands. She seeks the power needed to break free from her destiny, to shatter the fate forced upon her. She has decided to travel with you, possibly in the hope that you will bring her closer to her goals."
284,,100,Ghost of Sparta,God of War,Control ,"The Marked Warrior himself, a spartan general, a son of Zeus, God of War. Kratos. He is a skilled warrior, wielding his signature Blades of Chaos with a brutal efficiency as he tears his opponents apart bit by bit. Quick to temper, it is best not to get on his bad side, though with how often the world seems to turn on him, it's only a matter of time before you see the monster that is destined to destroy Olympus."
285,,100,Statue of the Divine ,God of War,Control ,"Many are the sculptures and statues that can be found around Greece, their Stony visage so intricate that you'd expect them to come to life any minute. Well, this one in particular was made to do exactly that. A marble statue made in your image, you can animate and channel your abilities through it, allowing you to effectively be in two places at once."
286,,100,Visage of Terror,God of War,Control ,"Few things are more terrifying to the common man then a beast ripped straight out of myth and legends running towards them, intent on destroying all before them without mercy. Such a feeling of fear and terror is one that you naturally exhude, making it so then the weak-willed run away at just the mere sight of you. Of course, if you want to converse with them, you can toggle this aura of and on at will."
287,,100,Ayiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyi!,Xena - Hercules,Control ,"You have a distinctive, personalized war-cry. While it may be fun to shout at every opportunity, it is most effective as you charge into battle. When you use it to herald your arrival, it is impossible for anyone to resist stopping whatever they are doing and giving their attention to the source of the sound, if only just for a moment."
288,,100,Strange Girl ,Fate/Apocrypha,Control ,"What a strange occurrence. For some reason or other, you’ve come across this blonde little girl, and she’s latched onto you. Her mannerisms are bizarre, as if she’s not very familiar with this world, and while she seems to be oddly talented at, well, everything, she doesn’t really seem to have bothered to learn how to do anything yet. Almost as if she had sacrificed her power and abilities to be in your world. She seems to only want your love and affection (being quite clingy in general), although she does seem to hide quite a monstrous side of herself from you, and seems to put a lot of trust in your abilities, always being certain that you’ll be able to surmount whatever is in your past and freely cheering you on if she can. Perhaps she harbors some kind of great secret?"
289,,100,Saintly Maiden,Fate/Apocrypha,Control ,"Do you like maidens? Do you like saints? If the answer to both of those questions is yes, well then you’re in luck, as a twist of fate has resulted in you meeting this particular young woman. They’re generally quite attractive and oddly reminiscent of one of the saintesses of this world (such as Jeanne, or Johanna), but she is very much a living girl of the modern age. They’re virtuous and generally innocent, and surprisingly, they’re very receptive to being a vessel to greater benevolent powers, such as Servants, particularly Servants who are saints. Additionally, they find your lifestyle and temperament to be oddly charming, which could easily bloom into love if you choose to pursue that path. They may also be male if you’re into men instead, should you wish, looking like one of the male saints instead, like St George for example."

291,,100,Stheno,Hades,Control ,"Dusa doesn’t like talking about her past and prefers to focus on the person she has become since dying.However, before her death she had a pair of sisters with a tale just as tragic as her own. Spurned by the Gods in a tale of jealousy and betrayal, they were transformed into their current forms. Stheno was the eldest sister and she was cursed with hands of brass and sharpened fangs along with the hair of snakes that she shares with her sisters. The legends speak of her beauty being transformed into hideous visages that transformed man to stone. However, her loyalty to her family won her some pity after her sister’s death. She was allowed her beauty but refused a return to her full humanity.

Understandably, Stheno hates the Olympian Gods one and all and is notmuch kinder to Chthonic divinities. Even at the best of times her personality would best be described as cool, with a venomous tongue. A life of betrayal has left its mark on her and it shows. Only when it comes to her sisters does a protective nature reveal itself in a heat as red hot as Hephaestus’ forge. Winning her favor will be a long process requiring a resistance to the biting of her tongue and her hair. Still, her loyalty once earned and given could never be questioned. And her skillin combat was only equaled by Perseus laden down with divine gifts."
292,,100,Serapis,Hades,Control ,"It’s not easy to find a sparring partner who can stand up to a divine being without being one themselves. Even the fabled heroes like Achilles can only achieve so much against their power. Serapis may just be a skeleton, but you would be hard pressed to find his equal when it comes to standing up to divine power. No Matter how terrible, how powerful, how earth-rending the blow, Serapis will still be standing in its aftermath. Oh, he won’t fight back, except with his cutting words and jabbing half-insults, but he will be smiling the whole time. He might even have a tip or two to improve your form once in a while."
293,,100,Subtly Terrifying,Hades,Control ,"The Chthonics exist closer to the void that predated creation than any others. Even the children of Nyx are touched by that eternal darkness more than any of the Olympian Gods. As one of those beings, an aura of night, of unending emptiness, hangs off of you. It tends to make those who without a similar tie nervous, anxious, as if they are staring into that great void itself."
294,,100,Piloting,Final Fantasy II,Control ,"Ships that sail in the water, or those that fly in the sky, or even other contraptions that would require some level of piloting skill doesn’t at all for you. You can handle them easily, performing feats in them that would normally take years of practice as it all comes to you naturally."
295,,100,Chocobo Training,Final Fantasy II,Control ,"You’re a master of Chocobo training, clear and simple. The big, feathery yellow birds just seem to love you, and you’ve always had a knack for getting them to do what’s needed. While they flee from most others after dismounting, they’ll stick around for you, fetch what you need, and allow you to form strong bonds with these creatures. Additionally all other avian creatures, flightless or not, will generally seem to like and trust you."
296,,100,Native Guide,Hellblazer,Control ,"You have a servant who exists in another plane, such as heaven, hell or faerie. The guide is knowledgable and powerful, but can not leave their home plane."
297,,100,Mesmerism,Hellblazer,Control ,You know the techniques to hypnotize and control the minds of others. Requires mana.
298,,100,Nun Squad,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"A group composed by four young girls, trained and raised as executors of the Holy Church and armed with several potent mystic codes for both combat, infiltration and recon purposes. For some reason, they have been assigned to you as subordinates, or reluctant caretakers in case you are something unrelated to the Holy Church (or even a heretical being). They are quite capable when it comes to managing trivial tasks, like tending to the needs of a modest church. However, their speciality lies in Dead Apostle hunting. While they are far from the level of the members of the Burial Agency, they work well together and integrate quickly with even the most eccentric of superiors."
299,,100,A Mana Battery,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"The person or being that dragged you into this world as part of the Holy Grail War ritual. They have the Master Origin, along with 600 CP for their build, and you may grant them more CP from your own budget. Optionally, you may replace this for taking a canon character that exists in this series as your Master. If they were already a Master, then their summoned Servant may end up being summoned by another, adding further chaos to this conflict.

At no cost, your relationship with your Master is quite neutral. They won’t go against your goals, but they also have their own agenda and your goals may diverge at some point in the war, leaving you to work things up. At least, given the number of Servants available in this Holy Grail War, they will not be inclined to force you to kill yourself with their Command Seals unless you prove yourself to be a threat to them. For an extra -100 CP, your relationship with your Master is quite excellent. You form the kind of bonds that are expected between the protagonists of a story, quickly becoming trusted friends, and perhaps even more in no time. It would take a lot of effort on your part for them to turn against you."
300,,100,Merely A Familiar ,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"What is a Master to do without a Servant to fight for them? Well, some of the monsters in this Holy Grail may be dangerous enough on their own. Whatever your case is, you have now summoned an Heroic Spirit, a manifested legend in one of the seven standard class containers of the Holy Grail War system. Whatever class you choose, you may choose to optionally take the summoning slot of another magus, thus removing a Servant from the competition. But their original Master will still be around in Snowfield, probably looking to participate.

They get the Servant Origin (at no cost), and a background of your choice. They also have 600 CP for their build, and you may grant them more CP from your own budget. Your Servant may be an existing one, or just any historical or legendary figure of this world that would fit through their chosen.

At no cost, your relationship with your Servant is quite decent. Even if they have a troublesome personality, they are at least set on trying to work with you in order to win, and won’t turn against you unless you actively annoy them or go against their core principles. For an extra 100 CP however, you will quickly become trusted allies and friends, and maybe even something more before this war finishes."
301,,100,Tiny Wanderer        ,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"Being quite a bit shorter than everyone around them, people tend to think they need protection, they do not. They are quite fleet footed and specialize in fighting large and powerful beings. They claim that they usually only need one shot, and back this up by only having a single, albeit large, arrow for their bow. When their arrow strikes an opponent a bolt of white and purple lightning strikes the target and has a decent chance of instantly killing them if the arrow strikes true. Their lightning is peculiar as most Elemental Spirits dislike or fear it. Other than their powerful weapon they are very agile, weaving through enemies as they call their slow to return arrow back to them.

Their soul, should you be able to sense it, is unusually powerful, and strangely formed. Almost as if there were multiple other powerful souls contained within.

Personality wise they seem to almost be a blank slate. They always seem to be staring a thousand miles away except in combat. They do however have a number of subtle ways they convey they care as they do seek out companionship, they just don't talk much."
302,,100,Bombastic Bodybuilder,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"This behemoth of a person has sculpted an impressive muscular physique and seems to have little shame in flaunting it. At some point in their youth, they became an Astrologer because they heard that stars explode and they thought that was awesome. Given how they act seems to be what they actually strive for in life, the intersection between awesome and explosions. They are quite foul mouthed and loud, but are a genuinely friendly person if you can put up with their peculiarities.

In combat, they wield two grenade launchers with cluster bombs. They have also maximized the number of rounds per shot. They back this up with their impressive skill in manifesting exploding stars. If you somehow fail to see them coming in combat, you will certainly feel or hear them."
303,,100,Beast Fang Charm,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"This fang from an unknown beast is strung on a leather cord. The charm bestows upon its wearer an improved ability to train and command allied creatures. While relatively minor at first, the benefits of training with the charm will compound over time for your companions."
304,,100,Wind Spirit,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"Instead of a simple blessing a Wind Elemental Spirit resides in the blade. In addition to making the wielder move faster, the Spirit will make the attacks from the sword sharper the faster the wielder is.

305,,100,An Accord,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"With how chaotic using the weapon is, it is important to at least be on good terms with the plant. This upgrade makes it so the plant will at least aim at your enemies and won't attack you, even if it is feeling cantankerous.

Requires Water Gun to Purchase"
306,,100,Army Points,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Control ,With this purchase you may choose any RTS system and are able to spawn the basic construction AI Units of that game. These units can be used to create facilities which in turn can create combat AI Units. These AI Units can appear to be human or other organic entities and can be given telepathic messages to direct them however unless specific AI Units are converted into companions they lack any form of sentience and disintegrate when killed. Through successful command actions you can gain AP which you can use to improve your AI Units capabilities.
307,,100,Minions,The Little Mermaid,Control ,"A pair of loyal creatures who will help you in your plans. They are strong and fast but their intelligence is fairly average. Very good at following instructions. They have a sixth sense for your location that helps them keep track of where you are. As a final note, they are highly protective of you and will sacrifice themselves to keep you safe. They gain merperson/human forms post-jump. Can become companions if desired."
308,,100,Chariot ,The Little Mermaid,Control ,"A fine, seahorse-drawn chariot when you need to get somewhere fast. As sturdy as it is ornate, the beauty of this little number is that your seahorses know exactly how to get to your destination without any input from you, so long as your destination is water-accessible. Obviously they can’t take you somewhere they can’t physically reach, like space or the middle of the Sahara, but they could get you from the California coast to the Queensland coast in less time than it takes a commercial airplane. When not in use they’ll hang around the nearest shore and wait for you."
309,,100,A Loyal Dog ,The Little Mermaid,Control ,"Man’s best friend. This dog is your loyal companion, and will stick with you through thick and thin. They may be any mundane breed, and if they die they will respawn within a day, albeit as a puppy. If you are in danger, they will do their best to help you (dragging you from the water if you can’t swim/are drowning, waking you when there’s danger, leading you out of burning buildings, etc). They also have a limited sense for evil and can see through glamours/disguises. They do not take a companion slot but they can change form to fit into future jumps (within reason)."
310,,100,Red Wolf ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Control ,"A giant wolf with red fur adorned with jewelry. They are an agile beast, capable of casting glintblade sorceries and can manifest a golden sword, which they grip with their jaws in order to perform slashing attacks. This one is fully trained to obey all of your commands to the best of their abilities, and would readily give up their life if it meant protecting you."
311,,100,Black Ringleader ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Control ,"On the Night of the Black Knives, Alecto and the Black Knife Assassins assassinated Godwyn the Golden using daggers imbued with a fragment of Destined Death stolen from its caretaker, Maliketh.

312,,100,Court Musician,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control ,"Who doesn’t want to enjoy the fine arts now and then? Maybe be lulled to sleep through an enchanting song? That is how a Tsar should rest and that is what this Item provides. A loyal and skilled Musician can be summoned at your whim, instinctively knowing what music you prefer to hear in the moment and playing it with a competence rivaling that of the greatest artists like Amadeus Mozart."
313,,100,"Altan Khan, Hero after a Long Journey",Godbound,Control ,"Altan Khan is one of the greatest avengers in Arcem, and the world will never know it because he was too good to be caught. A swarthy, lean young man with a hard gaze, tufts of his unruly hair cover his dark eyes when he is brooding on his responsibilities to clan and country. It has been almost a year since Altan shot dead the wicked lord who incurred his vengeance. With the Words Bow, Earth and Freedom at his command he has become a guardian to his clan on the Toban plains, erecting walls to secure them while wresting the loyalty of the lamas who dwell there for his people’s security. In his time Altan has also mastered the Strife of the Bitter Rival. Despite not binding Words of Command or War, Altan is also a natural leader and organiser-not to mention fearless in the face of insurmountable danger. While many of them reverse him as a guardian deity, despite his coolly confidant exterior Altan feels burdened by the expectations placed on him, and frets constantly about what new threat may come their way. Your chance encounter on the plains involved some mutual aid in fending off a roving gang of raiders, and Altan is thinking of broaching the question of what one must do to be both a good god and a good man. While he is quite happy about taking his revenge and removing one more wicked man from the world, he finds himself at a loss about where to go from here as he continues to hone his powers."
314,,100,"Maritsa, “Delicate Girl” ",Godbound,Control ,"Maritsa has come a long way from the slow-witted village girl she used to be. While she was once sweet, and lovely, and gentle yet so slow at learning her letters that after a year she had only blushes to show for it, the benefits of being Godbound have made her a force to reckon with, letters or no. The Words of Artifice, Sword and Passion have honed her into a thoughtful force of nature on the battlefield with a grudge against the foul brigades who tried to despoil her village. Worse for her enemies, she is a Peak Human through sheer force of will. In her quieter moments, Maritsa wishes she still had guidance from her family on the wider world beyond her village what but after an encounter with you at the tavern, she grew to trust you enough to count on your guidance as well. Maritsa continues to enjoy knitting and weaving in her spare time.

She lives quite the charmed life despite lacking a bond to the Word Luck, and more than once has come closer to seeking justice against the captain unlucky enough to piss off one of the greatest swordswomen among the Godbound to date seemingly by wandering in circles until she gave up and hopped on the first cart willing to take her out of town."
315,,100,A Toad,Wizarding World,Control ,"Among the three pets allowed at Hogwarts, toads are by far the least popular. In fact, they’ve very much gone out of style years ago. In fact, you likely won’t find more than a handful of toads as pets regardless of where you go. Still, that does not mean they do not have their uses. They make remarkable test subjects for magic, especially potions given that they can absorb the potions through their skin rather than having to drink it like people do."
316,,100,A Cat,Wizarding World,Control ,"Popular in both the Muggle and Wizarding world, cats are quite the common sight here. Not as much as owls but then again, few pets are. Regardless, cats are still useful, especially this particular one given that its half-kneazle, making it larger than ordinary household cats. And to differentiate between its lesser brethren even further, this one seems to have a knack for sniffing out untrustworthy fellows. It’s not perfect but then again, few things are."
317,,100,An Owl,Wizarding World,Control ,"The classic animal companion for witches and wizards everywhere. It’s only natural after all. With their natural affinity to magic, owls are perfect for delivering letters and parcels to other witches and wizards, especially when they can find them without even being given an address. Plus, they are rather intelligent as well, enough that they can understand other people without even needing to be trained for such a thing."
318,,100,Jumper’s Mark,Wizarding World,Control ,"You may have come into this world with little more than the clothes on your back and your wand, but that does not mean you must leave this world the same. Taking a few notes from a certain snake-faced dark lord, you’ve ensured that you can leave your mark in this world. By engraving a certain symbol of your own design into the skin of the willing, you may mark them, allowing you to call upon them so that they may stand by your side. Of course, these marks can also be used by their bearers to call upon their fellow bearers and, if you are willing to reciprocate, even you.

And finally, you now know a spell that allows you to conjure your symbol high in the sky, an aurora of magic that is well and truly yours. With such a thing, there shall be no mistaking who was responsible for your deeds."
319,,100,Rune Bear,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control ,"By far one of the deadliest animals found in the Lands Between, you have somehow gained the loyalty and obedience of this ursine beast. Easily as tall as a troll and just as hardy, one errant swipe of its paws can reduce a Tarnished into pulp."
320,,100,Grafted Scion,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control ,"One of the children of Godrick the Grafted, he changed her form in order to make her a deadly combatant, capable of facing many of the dangers that can be found in the Lands Between. It is unclear why Godfreya has joined your side, be it shared loyalty in her father, a rebellion against him, or simply because she finds in you as a trusted friend, you can be assured that she will never be a liability in battle."
321,,100,A Reliable Steed ,Disney’s Cinderella,Control ,"A horse that you can trust. Unlike most other horses. He knows all the shortcuts to cut your journey in half, and has a top speed of 140 kilometres per hour. He also understands physics so he can catapult you off through the air to land exactly where you need to be."
322,,100,Pet Griffin,Gummi Bears,Control ,"You have a pet griffin, a rather intelligent English-understanding six-limbed eagle-lion. These griffins are quite large and strong here, being about six foot “tall” and twelve feet “long”. They can easily fly with a few humans, a single ogre or a pack of Gummi Bears. If they should die another one will appear replacing them within 24 hours."
323,,100,Pet Boggles,Gummi Bears,Control ,"Small adorable magic shapeshifting creatures that seem to look a bit like squirrel-kangaroo-otters while in their natural forms. They are intelligent and have their own chittering language and can combine together to form larger items, creatures and things. They can move unnaturally while shapeshifted and even fly a little via some sort of telekinesis. You get a pack of them, enough to combine together to mimic a human. If one of the original ones should die another one will appear replacing them within 24 hours."
324,,100,Pan Pipes,Wizard 101,Control ,"A magical set of reed pipes, it attracts all manner of wildlife when played. When played well, it allows you to command the beasts to a limited extent. When played poorly, it sends wildlife into a frenzy. Life must be dealt with firmly yet gently, for it is Life’s way to run wild."
325,,100,Duelist ,Wizard 101,Control ,"Combat can be so... messy, in other Jumps, can’t it? Well, it needn’t be that way in our Spiral! Now, you are capable of calling out up to four foes and three allies, should they be present, to engage in a good, old-fashioned Wizard’s Duel! For 100 CP, you may keep this ability in future Jumps"

Who doesn’t want a fluffy friend?"
328,,100,Loyal Creature,The Owl House,Control ,"It seems you’ve won over some of the Boiling Isles’ unique fauna! This might be a large beast like Princess the Hand-Dragon, able to fly great distances and carry heavy loads.

331,,100,Footstool Dog,Beauty and the Beast,Control ,"This living footstool was formerly a dog, until it was changed by a magic spell. Unlike the one you may meet elsewhere in this world, this change is permanent, and unrelated to the spell affecting Beast’s Castle.

Naturally, the footstool still behaves like a dog, though it also enjoys being used as a footstool by you, and is quite comfortable to put your feet up on. It is completely loyal to you.

Should anything unfortunate happen to them, they’ll be back tomorrow, good as new! This is a Disney movie, after all."
332,,100,Sanctuary Guardian,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"A white winged creature that once acted as a watchkeeper in ancient Oolacile. It exhibits traits of several animals other than lions, suggesting that it is no ordinary beast, but rather closer to the beings known as Demons.

333,,100,Havel the Rock,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Once a friend of the Lord of Sunlight, as well as a powerful dragon hunter who wears armor carved from solid rock and wields a dragon tooth. He despises magic and was a sworn enemy of Seathe the Scaleless, going so far as to develop a miracle to counter the dragon’s sorcery."
334,,100,Giant Crow,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"The crow is a symbol of Velka, the Goddess of Sin, a black-haired and roguish deity who wields a great deal of influence, even amongst the gods. Whether or not she sent this bird to assist you does not matter, as an intelligent crow the size of a building is always helpful, whether it comes to fighting or traveling."
335,,100,Beast Tongue,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Many beasts inhabit these lands, both harmless and deadly. No matter their disposition, though, you are one of the few gifted with the ability to speak to them as though they were but another person. Animals seem to like you more in general, such that they would be willing to give you some help or information, provided you be kind to them, or offer up appropriate payment."
336,,100,Hypnotism,Walt Disney’s Robin Hood,Control ,"You can make your eyes dilate in a hypnotic fashion to implant ideas into your victim’s mind. For instance, you could convince a king to sally off into a suicidal war without worrying about the state of his kingdom. Once you have planted the suggestion, the effect will not go away until the subject has fulfilled the challenge you imposed. However, it is possible to resist the effects of the hypnotism when it is being implied; even weak- minded fools usually have enough cunning to break free if they are aware of the risk. Furthermore, you can only plant one suggestion into a victim at a time, and once the person has fulfilled and broken the directive of the hypnosis you cannot plant another one for a year."
337,,100,Dragon,Wizards of Waverly Place,Control ,"Dragons in this world can be enchanted to look like ordinary animals, and now, you can bring one of them with you.

He would eventually be stripped of his deific status, his name removed due to his consorting with the very dragons he was born to combat. He, along with the mighty storm drake, upon whom he would lead a lifetime of battle, has decided to follow you, perhaps seeing you as a Lord worth actually following."
339,,100,Knights of Gwyn,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"The four legendary knights of the Great Lord Gwyn, each one a true threat in their own right, but together are a force that few could surpass. Artorias the Abysswalker fights like a wild animal, whilst the Dragonslayer Ornstein rapidly strikes at foes with his spear.

342,,100,A Worthy Soul,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"Given his nature and the circumstances that bring him to others Death doesn’t actually have that many friends. The people that he gets to interact with are the souls of the dead who remain in the afterlife with him. You have somehow befriended one of these souls. Perhaps you visited them after talking to Death or you may have even known them in life. Either way this is an incredibly skilled individual standing at the peak of a field. Perhaps they were a legendary adventurer or they were a wizard of unparalleled skill. Death has allowed them to leave the afterlife and go with you. They will be willing to teach you all they know and assist you in any way possible. Though if you want to give them a body you are going to have to figure that out yourself. You may freely customize the appearance, personality, and species of this individual as well."

To prevent this from happening you have been given an advisor. They will do their best to guide you and prevent you from doing anything that will harm you. They could be a good person trying to change you for the better or they might be a competent minion wanting to safeguard their new master. You may freely customize the appearance, personality, and species of this individual as well.

She was adopted into a loving family that cared about her. Hearing this touched the hearts of both Goldi and Mama to the point that Mama wanted to keep Perrito. You seem to have won the metaphorical lottery as well and been blessed with an equally loving family. Each time you purchase this companion you may create three individuals and expand your family. By default you will receive parents and a sibling, but you may alter this if you wish to change the ratio. Perhaps you want a single parent and two siblings instead. Optionally if you don’t want to be the orphan then instead you may become the adoptee. You will instead become the caretaker of three young orphans.

345,,100,Someone I Can Trust,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"When kitty sought out the Wishing Star she hoped to wish for a companion that she could truly trust no matter what. This kind of relationship is difficult to come by and one that should be treasured when encountered. You have had the luck to end up acquiring one such relationship with this individual.

Just make sure to return this in kind. You may freely customize the appearance, personality, and species of this individual as well."
346,,100,I Love the Smell of Fear ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"Despite appearing in a DreamWorks movie Death is actually an incredibly terrifying villain. You share this ability allowing you to easily intimidate others. The shadows cling to you, your bloodlust leaks just enough to create an unsettling atmosphere, and everyone else gets put off foot enough for you to take advantage of it. This effect is amplified if your target is already afraid or if you actually try to be scary. Lastly, also grants you the ability to whistle perfectly should you wish to mimic Death’s haunting tune or make one of your own instead."
347,,100,Atlantean Pet         ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Control ,"Perhaps the fauna of Atlantis has changed and evolved with time and the exposure to the power of the Heart of Atlantis; or maybe Atlantis’s sinking opened it up to a whole new ecosystem of prehistoric creatures, locked away in the bowels of the earth. Whatever the case may be the Atlanteans have domesticated quite a few of the species down here, including blue and yellow dinosaur-esque creatures, lava dogs, and large lobsters with claws large enough to snip a man in two that some ride like horses. Or you might instead want a hive of Atlantean fireflies, which are commonly used as a source of lighting by the Atlantean people in lieu of sunlight? Whatever your choice may be your chosen creature(s) will be highly loyal, if lacking in intelligence depending on what you’ve chosen."
348,,100,Ongis        ,Raya and the Last Dragon,Control ,"You have befriended a trio of Ongis, monkey-like creatures with whiskers similar to that of a catfish.

These creatures have a near-human level of intelligence, but cannot speak. They are mischievous and have a large appetite, but are intensely loyal to you and are great with kids. On the topic of kids, these Ongis are actually quite good at taking on the role of surrogate parent or guardian for human children.

Should anything unfortunate happen to one of these Ongis, it’ll be back tomorrow, good as new! How curious."
349,,100,Ghost Dog,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Control ,"A loyal and friendly ghost of a dog. Has your best interests at heart, will begin to look distressed when it sees you making bad decisions. It has a nose that resembles a Jack-O-Lantern that can produce a great deal of light. Incorporeal but can still affect things when it wants to/play fetch. You can instead import an existing pet of your own granting them a ghost form."
350,,100,Skeletal Reindeer,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Control ,"Up to eight skeletal reindeer, each capable of flight and with a good sense of direction. You can ride them, use them to hold a sleigh aloft or just use them to ruin children’s Christmases."
351,,100,Dread Lord,Disney’s Hercules,Control ,"What is a villain who isn’t scary? Not you, at least. You have the ability, when you want, to be absolutely, mind-shatteringly terrifying to anyone weaker than you.

It takes the form of an aura of sorts, or perhaps an effect, but either way you can choose just who it affects, and the bigger the difference between yours and their strengths, the more this effects is boosted. A god would be feared by humans just like they would fear... well, a god."
352,,100,Pets or animal companions,Aladdin,Control ,"What kind of Disney setting wouldn’t offer you a pet? Some of these can be intelligent and know how to talk. This option even include the more unconventional pets, such as the clockwork beetle named Scooter. Even if they can talk they will not count as a companion unless you import them as one. You may import a previous pet in this slot."
353,,100,Clairsentience,Marvel Britain,Control ,"You are psychic, not in the way of most psychics but nevertheless you can reach into the minds of others. As a clairsentient you are able to telepathically enter into and control the minds of others, you can also passively pick up active thoughts in others minds.

With the Cainhurst Blood flowing through her veins as well as the inhuman skill she gained while under Gehrman’s tutelage, she is a foe that many would find difficult to surpass.

355,,100,Pet,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Control ,"Whether you want company or an evil minion, this strange little creature will serve as a loyal and friendly companion to you throughout your adventures. Flying lemurs, Fire ferrets and Iguana parrots are just a few examples of some of the many beasts that exist here.

He is a master of some form of martial arts, having been trained by an ancient order of monks, and possesses a great deal of occult knowledge – though little talent for the mystic arts.

This alien may look like a housecat of your choosing, but it's actually an alien Flerken that possesses a pocket dimension inside of them for storage purposes. Flerkens are known to be dangerous creatures in the galaxy, able to release massive tentacles from their mouths that could render a squad useless and possesses venomous claws that prevent wounds from healing.

358,,100,Familiar Spirit ,Marvel Primal,Control ,"A little immaterial helper who can sustain minor workings, help ease the load of more complex sorceries and advise and teach you. Also makes a fantastic spy."
359,,100,Animal Rider,Marvel Primal,Control ,"The people called him the Rider, because they had never seen a man astride a beast before. You are naturally highly skilled in befriending, training and riding animals of all sorts."
360,,100,Doctor Dolittling,Pet Avengers,Control ,"In this world animals can all speak together and be understood by each other, but not in most. Now you will retain the ability to speak with any animal and understand it as well as be understood."

362,,100,Black Cat 2099,Marvel 2099,Control ,"A Degen resulting from a genetic engineering experiment, she was considered a failure as she never demonstrated the desired superhuman qualities, merely minor physical mutations in the form of catlike eyes, retractable claws, and exaggerated canines. It was only when on her 19th birthday her corporate creators decided to scrap the experiment and clean it up, by killing her and incinerating the body, that her powers manifested. She possesses enhanced night vision and hearing, as well as low end superhuman agility and reflexes. The more important trait, however, is that she has the ability to passively warp probabilities to bring bad luck and misfortune to others. She’s not learned to fully control it yet. Currently she’s only able to use it instinctively when she considers someone an active threat, affecting quantum probabilities and warping reality on a small scale to cause events to go badly for them - throwing off their balance, slightly altering the speed of objects to make it so that they cannot dodge or miss a leap, causing their weapons to jam, etc. She’ll never be a large scale, or top tier reality warper, but she might be able to invoke this misfortune at will with time and practice. As a degen she has no legal rights, and is still under copyright."
363,,100,Familiar,Heroes Reborn,Control ,"This animal, no more dangerous than a house cat, is oddly intelligent. Maybe they were a human once cursed into this form, or maybe they’re just a magical animal. Either way they are loyal to you, possess intelligence which could be called human, and have absolutely no resistance to your magical abilities, making them particularly easy to transform or possess should you desire. Is a pet/follower not a companion until imported as one."
364,,100,Hertaker,Helltaker,Control ,"You plan on taking Helltaker’s harem but don’t want to make him go poof? Well guess what, you can have your cake and eat it! For a price of course. With this, you can have the Helltaker become a girl and join your harem! Or you could make him stay a guy; men are also welcome.

An adorable flying lemur, a sleek pygmy puma, a fierce iguana parrot, or something else entirely - as long as it's between the size of a mouse and a large dog when fully grown, you may pick any of the myriad hybrid critters in the Avatar world as your pet. Your pet will be healthy, happy, and hardy, with a personality that suits you, and is clever enough to learn a variety of commands - and sometimes even understand you without them."
367,,100,Familiar,Fate,Control ,"You gain a small animal, no larger than a cat or dog, which you can now share your senses with, seeing through their eyes and hearing through their ears. You may import any non-sapient animal you have to take this role for the same cost."
368,,100,Bayard,A Certain Magical Index,Control ,"A beautifully and exquisitely forged metal automaton in the shape of a horse capable of evading magical detection. While it is ordinarily folded up with its legs tucked under its body, stroking its neck makes it stand up, and tapping it makes it start moving. It can move on autopilot to a pre-set destination, and slip past & hide from magical searches. Completely undetectable by magical means, very, very safe and fit for a princess."
369,,100,Wyrm Familiar,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"You have bonded your soul to a Wyrm, a horse-sized draconic creature you can ride as a mount. It is not as powerful as its larger cousins, but it is extremely agile and quick. When slain, your Wyrm reincarnates into an egg-like stone that can be hatched by channeling a vast amount of mana back into it. This Wyrm is also capable of breathing a magical breath, starting out with a magical fire comparable to Fire 1. You are skilled with riding this Wyrm through the sky, and are able to cast Fire 1 while it is set to the Fire element."
370,,100,Earthspirit,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"You are capable using a moderate portion of mana to summon forth an Elemental of the Terrain you are currently in, with powers and an elemental affinity determined by that terrain as well. It’s reasonably durable and strong, but it lacks the wisdom or intelligence to do anything other than directly attack what it sees as an enemy."
371,,100,Beastly Aid,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"Your expertise with the beasts of the wild allows you to convince non-magical wild beasts such as hawks and wolves in droves to fight on your side, as well as being capable of speaking with them and getting additional aid such scouting or gathering supplies. While they’re not proper monsters such, they can do some damage even to Dragons if they gather in great numbers."
372,,100,We can Fight Together,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"Your understanding of your foes allows you to make them your friends. By observing an opponent for a moment, you can ascertain what it is that motivates them, allowing you to speak with them to get them to turn to your side. The stronger they are, the harder it will be for them to see you as worth listening to…but even so, failing to turn them will at least have them see you in a better light, potentially inflicting the Fascination status effect."
373,,100,Monster Rustler,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"You have a way of making yourself understood by unawakened and corrupted monsters. Chiefly, to understand who’s boss around here. You can use a show of strength to enter a contest of wills with it. In your success, the creature’s aggression will severely drop, reducing their offensive capabilities as they lose the will to fight. Tamed creatures may then be captured by further attempting to convince them to join your side, and any successful Charm effects on them will contribute to this."
374,,100,Elegant Manner,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"The overwhelming charisma of a Dynast is enough to even stop enemies in their tracks. You are able to use a disarming smile and kind word to inflict the Charm and Confuse status effects on weak-minded or foes that already have hesitations. Even if your words are wasted on aggressive swine, you still will inflict a Cowardly status effect on them."
375,,100,Wandering Light,Super Dragon Sword ,Control ,"You are capable of calling upon a Warrior Angel, an entity of Light. Doing so takes a moderate amount of Mana, and the Angel is an eager fighter. However, it is only capable of casting Holy 1, and is relatively fragile physically. But you can call on as many as you have mana to summon."
376,,100,Summoner ,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Control ,"Your spells are somewhat harder to resist and dispel, holding strong even at long ranges. You can summon a trio of common wolves capable of following simple commands."
377,,100,Blue Beetle,The Dresden Files,Control ,"Sturdy, surprisingly comfortable, and Hex resistant, this car is perfect for the Wizard on the go. Routine maintenance will keep it running through anything short of hostile enemy action, and unless they blow it up, a competent mechanic will be able to take care of that in no time. Oh, and wouldn't you know it, there's a card for one in the glove compartment. Anyway, the exact specs are up to you; it doesn't have to be blue, and it doesn't have to be a Beetle. It does have to be at least thirty years old, and no sports classics. Sorry, you've gotta pay real money for one of those."
378,,100,Jumpies ,Frozen,Control ,"Now who are these cute little guys? They look awfully like you. Teensy tiny yous, only about ankle height. They’re real mischievous and often get into trouble on their journey to find something fun to do. They’ll do their best to not cause any damage for you to clean up, unless they think you’d find it fun. They especially like it when you’re having fun so they’ll do their clumsy best to help that goal come about...when they’re not distracted by something fun themselves. There’s about a dozen jumpies in total and they’ll come back a few minutes after being killed, if anyone could be so heartless."
379,,100,"""Sulyvahn’s Beast Pup""",Dark Souls 3,Control ,"The rings created by the Pontiff Sulyvahn mutate those who stare into them into feral, cunning beasts, after drawing their wearers into frenzied battles to the death. It does beg the question, however: what would happen if someone who was already a beast stared into the ring? This pup answers that question; resembling one of the lightning-breathing guard dogs of the Pontiff in a much more manageable size, this dog has somehow retained its personality despite the hideous transformation that befell it- most likely because it was already an animal to begin with. Only a little larger than the largest undead hounds yet packing ten times the ferocity and teeth, it can leap large distances and breathe lightning. What more could a person want in a pet?"
380,,100,"""Salvation""",Dark Souls 3,Control ,"No one is without flaw, and these flaws lead to mistakes. Those in the Sable Church who make grievous mistakes are exiled, sent away from their home on accursed journeys that often come with violent ends. This perk doesn't prevent failure, but perhaps it will help you avoid such a gruesome fate. Upon purchase, you are now made acutely aware of opportunities as they present themselves to make people who have your loyalty or allegiance happy. Seizing these opportunities will always help at least somewhat with staying in the good graces of your allies, or getting back into them. Opportunities to appease those who you've earned the ire of will gain priority. This perk will not ping opportunities to make someone happy if you don't actually want their happiness or forgiveness."
381,,100,“Sunlight Maggots”,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control ,"Sunlight Maggots, loathsome demon parasites the size of bowling balls that glow with brilliant light. If they’re able to crawl onto someone’s head, they dig into their skull and turn them mad. If killed first, they can be used like an improvised shining helmet. Whenever one of your maggots is slain, a new one is born in your warehouse. Your parasites tend to stick near your side or sit still when left alone, at least if there’s no prey in the area. "
382,,100,Eyes of Fire,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control ,"Your eyes say much about who you are and what your intent is. Looking into your eyes gives others a sense of pressure, as if you’re trying to force them to kneel with your spirit alone. This has a direct relationship with your willpower. The greater your willpower, the stronger this effect is. You could even win fights without drawing your blade by convincing your opponent to submit."
383,,100,Messengers,Bloodborne,Control ,"“The Hunter’s Dream contains another secret, one only those connected to it are privy too. That secret is the existence of the Messengers; grotesque, infantile creatures that seek only to help the admired hunter on their blood swathed path. 

Within the Hunter’s Dream they are willing to part with various goods in return for strange currency, but in other worlds and realms they normally appear with messages. They’re just pieces of parchment relaying advice and directions in broken English, or other relevant language, but it’s helpful. 

Something about you draws a much greater interest from the Messengers though, allowing you to call upon them with a snap of your fingers. At your beckoning, they appear with a note relevant to your current surroundings, giving anything from vague warnings to hints at treasure.

If you’re feeling generous, you can also give them accessories, which they will wear after procuring enough duplicates for the whole bunch. It’s nothing you can benefit from, but they’re rather sweet, so you will reward them from time to time, right? They especially adore the color red.”"
384,,100,Royal Omen Bairn,Elden Ring,Control ,"Omen babies born of royalty are typically kept underground in extreme obscurity, imprisoned for all eternity in shame. This scraggly, vaguely horned memorial fetish was fashioned in secret. With a squeeze, you can release the wraiths of those tormented lives to assault your enemies. A bleak weapon for sure, but a reusable one that draws only from your mental focus."
385,,100,Ashes of a Fallen Warrior(100),Elden Ring,Control ,"What’s a good summoner without a spirit to summon? With each purchase here you gain the ashes of some fallen souls who at the ring of a spirit calling bell can come forth briefly to battle your foes.

For 100 CP instead, you may summon the more elite warriors of this land in numbers. Four mighty greatshield-hefting soldiers, the Redmane soldiers of General Radahn who wield fiery weapons, or the mighty shamanistic folk who worship the ancestral spirits-and are well-versed in both archery as well as the spiritual arts. This is also the tier at which you can summon champions of these lands who distinguished themselves in the demigods’ armies or achieved similar feats, and powerful beings on the level of Crystalians or mimics-a rare form of crystal tear capable of taking on the form of its summoner and replicating their form, equipment and powers (at least, those of mortal scale).

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
386,,100,Spectral Steed Whistle,Elden Ring,Control ,"This ring of delicate goldwork enables you to summon a spectral steed called Torrent in seconds. Having both the form of a horse as well as the horns and stocky bearing of a bull, Torrent is a hardy, swift and brave steed that will serve you faithfully-and though no conversationalist, is a surprisingly insightful animal in many matters. Even a novice horseman could quickly take to mounted combat upon his strong back. He is also somehow capable of double-jumping.

Alternatively, or in subsequent purchases, you may purchase a different steed with similar traits-and own a whistle with a different design, if you wish.

For an extra 50 CP, you may own an even more magnificent specimen born and bred for war-a creature on par with the funeral steeds ridden by the Night’s cavalry.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
387,,100,Brother of Bone ,Elden Ring,Control ,"Even with civilisation in ruins, there are those with the grit and will to hunt the undead. All those languishing in undeath can count on is each other. Whether you are one of Those Who Live In Death or not, some of this kinship has somehow rubbed off on you to the extent that mindless skeletons, delirious zombies and other non sentient undead beings are not hostile to you by default. You may go among these beings and even shove past them without fear of provocation; so long as you do not make a concerted effort to attack one, it will not strike back. This is a mere lack of directed hostility; another magically enforced will can still compel them to attack you, and undead retaining more of their minds will still judge you on an individual basis."
388,,100,Pet Owl,Harry Potter,Control ,A pet owl that carries your post. Can be any owl species of your choice.
389,,100,Niffler,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,"A small mammal, very skilled at digging and with a great love of shiny things. Nifflers have kleptomaniac tendencies as a result and they can fit a vast amount of valuables in their pouches. Good for finding treasure but they wreck houses if let loose."
390,,100,Bowtruckle,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A small twig-like creature with long claws. When threatened it attempts to gouge the eyes of the threat. Eats woodlice or fairy eggs if it can get them and generally lives in trees of wand quality. Will be more than happy to ride around in your pocket and can also pick most locks with its long claws.
391,,100,Fwooper,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A bird whose twittering song drives people totally and irreversibly insane. Each has to be sold with a silencing charm. You are curiously immune to the song of this particular fwooper.
392,,100,Jungle Barrier ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"The River Heralds are not able to be everywhere at once. As such, Barriers like this are key to their mission to bar the path to the Immortal Sun - this is a form of “awakened” plant, utilizing a mix of heavy twisting vines, natural toxins all along its leaves and vines, near stone-like wooden roots and bark, and sheer bloodymindedness to act as a potent living barrier. You can easily command it to proliferate, though it lacks defenses against fire beyond simply utilizing ambient mana to attempt to outgrow any attempts to burn it - and even so, often failing to do ought but buy time. Still, it is blindly loyal and will allow you and those you specifically designate to pass unharmed."
393,,100,Cherished Hatchling ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A small dinosaur hatchling, it has become imprinted on you and sees you as its parent. It is your choice of either a baby Thunder Lizard, Horned Beast, or Tyrant King - the grandest of leaf-eaters, the most brutal of herd leaders, or the king of carnage in the dinosaur world. The Hatchling is already promised to become a particularly strong example of its kind, if raised well and trained."
394,,100,Bewitched Familiar,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"The Wilds’ four legged denizens hold greater wisdom than can be guessed at, and it’s not out of the question for one to take a particular interest in humans. You’re included - a magical version of a mundane animal has joined you, using its natural instinct for navigating strange and fae environs as well as its ability to hide in plain sight to effectively assist you...and if it were to be slain, it has a bad habit of coming back the very next day."
395,,100,Clockwork Servant,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"Vantress is renowned for its mystical prowess and great amounts of knowledge, and one example of this is that Vantress is a source of animated servants - this one included. A cute little clockwork automaton about 5 apples tall, it is capable of cleaning, arranging furniture, and fetching items that are within their reach for you, steadfast and eager in their every movement."
396,,100,On The Front Lines And In The Command Center,MtG - Zendikar,Control,"You cannot expect your troops to follow you if you are not willing lead by example - but if you're on the front lines, you’re not in the command room and so are missing vital information on tactics. However, so long as you have some way to communicate, be it messenger birds, signals, telepathy, or any other inspired method that hits you, you may as well be fighting and strategizing simultaneously. This doesn't reduce your effectiveness at either, so you can command your wider army while you lead from the front. "
397,,100,Trained Ferrets ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"One of the trademarks of the thief Joven, these ferrets have years of training and are exceptionally wily and mischievous. This leaves them well-suited for tasks like climbing the sides of buildings or providing suitable distractions while their master escapes.

You’ve got a dozen of these furry friends now, each incredibly loyal to you. Combined with the fact that (being ferrets) they don’t care about getting a share of the loot, this makes them practically perfect accomplices. And along with the ferrets themselves, you also get a small guidebook containing the training regimens used to teach them as well as the hand-signal code to control them, with basic signals for 'sit', 'beg', 'run', 'climb', and more."
398,,100,Nimble Hand,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“The moment you enter Belfry Luna, you’ll find the sight of a mound of marionettes. Fallen, yet to rise? Whichever the case, the quality of such mass production is evident. Perhaps in times of boredom you could use such deft hands as well? Your focus and precision of movement has improved a great deal. Combined with sudden talent for whittling and you too could make a mountain of quality puppets and marionettes! Not worth it? Well, you could find more practical uses of your newfound focus and dexterity. Blocking, parrying and then hitting enemies where it hurts should be a lot easier now too. That’s worth it, right?”"
399,,100,Black Carriage ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"A fair replica of the infamous black carriage, complete with the carnivorous steeds that pull it along the muddy roads. As befits Baron Sengir’s favorite way to tour through the Sengirian countryside, the carriage itself is surprisingly comfortable as well as intimidating.

But it is the monstrous horses that are the true draw here, four black chargers who can pull the carriage at breakneck speeds. They sweat fire and blood, and when they gallop their horseshoes throw fiery sparks. The Baron usually rewards his own steeds by allowing them to consume the unfortunate villager chosen to drive the carriage, but you could feed your horses with other meats if terrified peasants are in shorter supply for you."
400,,100,Haggler’s Coin,MtG - Shandalar,Control,"This ancient coin is made of minutely engraved brass, thrumming with subtle but potent power. Anyone holding it will find themselves with a remarkably useful blessing: they are considered or treated as a trusted customer no matter where they are, even if they have never been to a store before. This most commonly manifests as granting you access to a wider range of goods and items for sale, though you might also find yourself with better prices, complementary ‘freebies’, or any number of other boons, depending on the store in question."
401,,100,DIMIR GUILDMAGE ,MtG - Ravnica,Control,"The Dimir are a tricky group, living out of sight and out of mind. Part of the reason the guild is able to remain so secretive is due to the skill of their mages in memory manipulation. You now have basic memory magic, able to make people remember things... differently, or even cut out a memory all together. You also gain the skill to throw up basic illusions to cover your movements, such as a bank of fog."
402,,100,Spellskite,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"A four-limbed, small Phyrexian horror created by the Progress Engine for the purpose of countering enemy magic. Like an obscene, living lightning rod, it can draw in magical attacks and effects- even those meant to benefit the enemy- to itself, even if it would normally be unable to benefit from such things."
403,,100,A living weapon,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"A small, black blob of living matter which seems to instinctively know how to operate most Phyrexian artifacts on its own. Should you allow it to enter into one, it will dutifully pilot it according to your wishes, not damaging the item in the process. Though quite helpless on its own, it will reappear in your possession a day afterwards should it ever be destroyed. Post-Jump, it can pilot just about anything you can get it into, so long as its not the size of a large building on more, at which point it’ll require upgrades or help."
404,,100,A Carving Of A Spider ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"A gift from a spiderlike Kami that resides in one of the dark corners of the forests, this wooden golem is both an adequate training partner for a prospective monk, being weak enough to pose no threat yet durable enough that you will have difficulty harming it in turn, and a weapon to be wielded should your own natural strength be lacking. While it will default to the form of a bracelet, the spider is perfectly capable of scuttling about your body as you fight, using its own body as a shield to blunt the incoming blows - assuming of course, that you don’t simply wish for it to fight alongside you. It can even launch you a short distance into the air, to help deal with any Soratami or similar foes that think height is an advantage you will allow them to keep. "
405,,100,"Hotshot, Ace, and Expertise ",MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"With the advent of artifact vehicles - mecha, as they are most commonly known - a new kind of soldier was required to wield them properly. Hence the introduction of a number of courses, training simulations, and other attempts to teach people to pilot those same mecha. You have undergone at least one of these things, and come out of it a superior pilot, able to handle machines that would normally require intense concentration and perhaps cybernetic augmentation with ease. There is an upper limit to this, something that outright required a dozen people to control would almost certainly be beyond you. 

Purchasing Hotshot, Ace, and Expertise allows you a single discount of Beneath My Iron Skin. "
406,,100,Spirit Attendants,MtG - Kamigawa,Control,"Your state in the world creates energy constructs when you will it. These ‘Attendants’ are merely spiritual energy constructs formed as extensions of your will and can range a series of shapes from lamps, to hands, to willow wisps, to small sprites. These smaller constructs of your will have enough autonomy to do minor things on their own and at any time you can control it as if it were a limb, disconnection not mattering the least. The largest one of the Attendants can be is around the size of a man’s torso. You can easily produce them, an effort of will and a few moments to make one, and have hundreds of them ready to attend you or your worshipers."
407,,100,PACK ,Wolfwalkers,Control,"A group of thirty or so wolves. Fierce to potential enemies, but a goofy cuddle-pile to those who get to know them. By standing in the background and howling, they can lend you their own energies for healing or other workings."
408,,100,Fantasian ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Control,"Unlike a certain mouse, you maintain impeccable control over any animated objects you create. While it's not like they're truly incapable of overdoing tasks you set, they'll definitely check in with you before doing anything drastic. Constructs with animal intelligence will also quickly and correctly interpret any hand signals you attempt to send, no matter how clumsy. This has some reverse application to non- magical applications, like machinery."
409,,100,Pet Landmark ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Control,"Hopefully nobody saw you make off with this, but you've got an unusual 'pet', that is, an animated fixture from a famous landmark. Think of something like the Chrysler Eagle, or the Times Square bull. If it's an animal, it will have the full mobility it's shape suggests, including flight, and it will heed and obey your call."
410,,100,Disaster Sense,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Control,"It is said that, as a child not even five-years-old, Sinbad once snuck onto his father’s fishing boat and became caught in a terrible storm at sea. There, the boy guided his father through the howling winds and crashing waves and, in what can only be described as a miracle, both of them emerged completely unharmed. You, too, are able to replicate such a feat, since you now have a limited form of protection against disasters and significantly perilous natural phenomena, such as tornados, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. So long as you focus on escaping and don’t deliberately put yourself in harm’s way, you and those who are accompanying you will tend to emerge
from such events relatively unscathed.

Be warned, though, that this perk may fail to protect you if the disaster is on a scale significant enough to be inescapable, such as a planet-destroying solar flare."
411,,100,Little Black Jellyfish ,Magi: Alma Torran,Control,"Ill Ilah ended up suffering a rather ignominious fate. Once an omnipotent god who shone a pure and radiant white, its lustre slowly faded as David stole its energy, eventually turning a pitch black as it was eventually usurped and cast aside. Though Al-Thamen would attempt to resummons their god again in both this world and the next, it was eventually reduced to nothing more than a pet for one of its creations who had surpassed it.

By purchasing this option, you’ve received a very nice fish tank about the size of a desk, within which lives a number of different plants and fish. The main attraction, though, is the pitch-black jellyfish which floats about aimlessly inside, seemingly never doing much of anything except occasionally creating a microscopic swirl of black energy that quickly dissipates. This jellyfish is Ilah in its final state (or at least an indistinguishable copy of it), stripped of almost all of its powers and continually trying and failing to create a new, tiny universe as its purpose dictates. Aside from being a pretty low-maintenance pet, it doesn’t really have any immediate benefits for you, though I’m sure a neutered former god could make a rather useful research subject."
412,,100,All The King’s Horses,Campione,Control,"A godly being like you deserves a godly steed to travel, and while you may possess an Authority to do so already, another item may prove useful in some cases. For that, this legendary mount is yours to use. Able to break the speed of sound easily while protecting all passengers and possessing a small but effective amount of firepower to defend you when you need it. The exact aesthetic depends on you, maybe you want a flying horse or a small dragon or a vimana. Regardless, the specs will be the same."
413,,100,Command Seals,Fate/Extra CCC,Control,"Of course, Masters all have one thing in common. Or perhaps three, depending on how you look at it. Command Seals, three tattoos of great power in the back of your left hand, that prove that you are in fact a Master. They’re not truly needed to make and maintain a contract with a Servant, but not having access to them would be quite a waste. They can not only be used as empowering orders or restrictions on your Servants, but can also be used to enhance your Servant in general or for specific actions, or perhaps even heal them. That said, their potency depends on how much spiritual or magical energy is spent on them. An unremarkable human with no experience as a Master would barely be able to command their Servant, while a truly exemplary Master could easily make their Command Seals far more potent than they normally are. You can also transfer them to other people, should you want to give them to someone else for some reason.

You get three Command Seals, and they replenish each jump, or every ten years, whichever comes first. Should you know magic related to contracts, you’ll be able to use the Command Seals through them, even if the contract itself isn’t the Servant contract that they were designed for. Masters gain these for free, obviously, but AIs may also obtain Command Seals and become Masters, for a simple cost of 100cp. After all, it’s not impossible for an AI to be a Master, given the existence of Hakuno Kishinami.

Requires Servant"
414,,100,ALTER,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"It’s unnaturally common to happen upon a alternate version of someone you know here. More than any other land, Japan is like a beacon for different dimensions, time travelers, spiritually modified clones and homunculi made in image of living people. It’s not really a surprise that you ended up encountering one such being yourself, though managing to help them so much that they swear themselves to your service is a little more startling. This companion is an Alter version of an existing character present in the land and time of Japan. They are an alternate version, a darker look at the character, but this can take many forms. 

They might be a jaded Counter Guardian who has done awful things for decades to protect humanity, whom you somehow stole away from the Counter Force and earned their eternal gratitude. It might be an animated doll made by a ninja clan to replace someone, whose programming you accidentally changed to serve you instead. Someone who hopped from timeline to timeline, searching for a man who could defeat them in battle to declare as their husband. 

The end result is a companion who is very loyal towards you. They are stronger and more brutal than their original counterpart regardless of the reason for being here, as well as possessing a great deal more experience in battle. They also have a darker appearance, commonly appearing as a choco- coloured skin tan, though it can also be as simple as a preference for dark clothing."
415,,100,Wolf Mothered,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"Many have heard the tales that you were raised by beasts in the wild, like the glorious ancestor
Romulus and his brother Remus. It’s quite true as well, since you called a large pack of wild animals
your family for your early years before you left for civilisation. They might have been a pack of
wolves, a herd of deer or even a swarm of spiders, but they had unnatural intelligence and taught
you to channel certain powers of nature as well. You have a natural affinity for all animals given your
upbringing but in regards to the specific type that raised you, you can speak to them as if they were
humans and have them respond, teach them to retain that human intelligence and speech with
others and even command your animals to act in your service, though powerful kinds may resist. "
416,,100,Lord of Lions,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"A stable fit for any emperor, particularly the ones with a Christian problem. A dozen enormous lions
lounge around you now, each a loyal and loving pet that just can’t get enough cuddles from you. They’re big enough for an adult to easily ride and strong enough to tear a armoured soldier in half
with a paw slap. They’re great for keeping you warm and well trained at guarding people and places, plus they make you seem a lot more kingly when you have one of them near you. "
417,,100,Stymphalian Birds,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"A quiver full of bronze arrows, which seemingly never runs dry. When shot into the sky from a bow, each arrow will transform into one of Ares’ Stymphalian birds, each one the size of a vulture, with a
body made of hard bronze and hostility towards any of your enemies. They are not very dangerous
on their own, save to ordinary mortals, but hundreds of arrows can be short into the sky to create
large swarms of the creatures."
418,,100,The Golden Fleece,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"The famed golden sheep fleece of Colchis, a gorgeous sight to see for many but, supposedly, also
guarded by a mighty dragon. The rumours are true, as when the fleece is thrown on the ground, a
dragon will appear to serve the thrower of the fleece. Not quite as expected however. The dragon is
more a very young dragon girl, with pointed ears, blue hair and quite the surly temper. She does
look up to you as an elder sibling for releasing her, even if it can be hard to tell sometimes, but she
has little real power of her own. A normal mortal soldier won’t pose much of an issue and she could
likely kill a few hundred men easily enough but against any real beast or hero in the land, she’s as much a baby as she looks. Maybe if you gave her a few hundred years, she’d be as good as she
boasts she is. She can be recalled into the fleece at any time and the fleece itself makes for a lovely
warm coat, entirely rainproof."
419,,100,Puppy Love,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Control ,"Wild little thing, weren’t you? Growing up with the dogs as more like siblings, you learned to hold a
close connection to the animals of the world. More than what any man could learn to do by training
as a hound master or similar ilk, you have a natural affinity with animals that allows you to treat all
but the most hostile and loyal to your enemy animals as if they were already tamed pets of your own. Wild dogs lick your palms for treats, a strange horse would let you ride it without being broken or
tamed, even the birds of the sky sometimes bring you berries in your travels. Monsters or magical
beasts have a much lesser effect from this, though you will find that you have the potential to train
animals to become supernaturally powerful, such as raising dogs to be ten times as strong as any
normal hound. This does take work and time however."
420,,100,Hounds of Culann,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Control ,"A pack of wild beasts, almost like monsters, runs around you as you wake up. You’d be forgiven for
thinking they were monsters, as these are the Hounds of Culann. Each enormous, pony sized dog has
ten times the strength of any normal war dog, able to tear through steel armour with their jaws and
outrace any horse. You have an entire pack of these loyal beasts with you, numbering 8 brothers and
sisters in total, having raised them since they were puppies to serve and fight alongside you. Plus
having a puppy puddle to melt into at night really helps keep the cold away. Thankfully, the little
doggers come back to life right as rain shortly after being hurt, just a day or two later. "
421,,100,Mighty Steeds,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control,"A fine set of warhorses, such that any great knight would be proud to call their own. Raised from
birth by your own hands, their loyalty is as unquestionable as their strength. A fully armored knight
or entire chariot is like a paperweight to these brawny, hulking beasts of war. While not inherently
magical, despite their unnatural strength, they are surprisingly skilled at contributing to combat. Easily working with you in mounted combat or to lead a chariot for you almost without command
needed, as well as adding their own crushing hooves to the mix. All four of the horses, named and
coloured to your liking, are quite affectionate as well."
422,,100,Just Let Go,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"There is an end to everything but few things have the luxury of deciding when their end is to come
as you do. You can hardly stop yourself from dying if someone were to kill you, not with just this
option, but you now find that you are always aware of a trigger of sorts within your being. A trigger
that can only be pressed when you willingly wish to without external influence. Depending on how
you focus, this trigger would allow you to do one of several things. The first is to return you to a
human state, returning any abilities, blessings, powers or even those strange abilities you’ve brought
from other worlds to their original owners. Once done, you cannot retrieve them through this but
will not possess them yourself either.

The other method to make use of this ability is decidedly more final. Fully pressing this spiritual
trigger under your own free will enables you to end your own existence. Body, mind, soul and the
very concept of your being will cease to exist, in both this mundane reality and any other. A full and
total cessation of being. This final measure surpasses any block or prevention, always giving you a
way to let it go and have things all come to an end for yourself. And hey, despite how scary the idea might be to cease existing, you have a feeling that there is a special place of peace waiting for you
for when you finally make use of this."
423,,100,The Softer Side,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"Not every fortress can be entered with a soft step and some acrobatics. Sometimes you need to take
a more visible way in without alerting anyone as to your purpose. Thankfully, your training is far
from lacking here either. You are a highly accomplished infiltrator in a more social sense. You can
easily disguise yourself as others, make yourself seem to fit in perfectly to almost any kind of social
group, make friends with ease and play any game of politics like a master. You were born or trained
or both to slide your way into the inner circles of the highest levels of nobility, take what you want
and then leave long before anyone realises you were the culprit all along. This comes with a wide
array of basic experience in various professions to help you blend into your disguises better, though
your new skills are mostly focused on the higher end of society. 

Helping you along however, is a supernatural connection to a certain kind of animal. Pigeons and
doves for example or perhaps house cats or spiders. Your connection to these animals allows you to
make use of them as familiars, provided another mage is not already and the animal has no true
intellect of it’s own. You can see through their senses, even command them to act as you please, all
within a range of around a kilometer from your own position. "
424,,100,Lurid Lovecraft,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"It’s always the cute ones you need to look out for. Those rosy cheeks and youthful eyes? They’re
hiding a psychopathic cannibal, I’ll bet you. You’re the worst of them all when it comes to the
unassuming crazies. You’re about the cutest thing anyone’s ever laid their eyes on, or maybe one of
the most beautiful or handsome such people instead, and it’s so much that often people without a
strong reason, good will or dark intentions can’t bring themselves to want to upset you. But being
cute or pretty is just the tip of the awful iceberg that is you. The longer people spend around you, the longer that cuteness of yours seems to change them. They slowly become more obsessed with
you, seeing you as a higher sort of being, having uncontrollable and highly inappropriate thoughts
about you, even going half mad after enough time gazing at you. It’ll take a few weeks of constant
contact for most to do this but the crazier, stranger and even just more lewd you appear yourself, the faster this will get. You could also choose to not do this and just be a cute little girl but that’s
just boring."
425,,100,Rise of the Jaguar Men,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"There was always one animal that got most closely associated with you in all the stories. Tigers, panthers, spiders, a lot of gods have something going on when it comes to animals and you’re
another just like this. There’s a very strong affinity between you and one normal kind of animal, such
as the above examples or another mundane creature that lived between 10AD and 1953AD. Not
only does this make these animals act as well trained and affectionate pets towards you when wild
and untamed, even sapient versions of these animals or beings that are only partly connected to
them will be much friendlier to you and feel a bond with you. You may also find magic connected to
these beings to be significantly stronger than normal. Lastly, you can partially or fully transform
yourself into your animal and pass that gift along to whoever you please."
426,,100,Mortal Vessel,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"At once both impossibly rare and pointlessly common. A proper human is so hard to find, at least
when you’re looking for one that can hold you. Since you were already able to swap forms, the
downsides of all that godly power as a Divine Spirit and the difficulties of finding the right human to
be a host, maybe not so important. So here’s one that fits just right. The perfect human vessel for
you, one empty of mind or spirit but fully capable of holding you and your divine power in all it’s
glory without bursting like a balloon or going up in flames. The appearance can be of your own
design and the vessel returns to you if broken a few days later. The vessel isn’t a copy of your own
body, nor does it have all of your powers, it can merely handle you as a host no matter what you are
and survive you channeling your powers through it, regardless of what level those powers are at, so
long as they actually can be channeled thus."
427,,100,"A Horse, A Horse",Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Control ,"It’s a horse fit for a king. This incredible beast is much like a king himself, one of horses. Towering
over other breeds and yet possessing enough speed and agility to keep up with, and even kill, even
magically enhanced knights on the lower scale. The horse is surprisingly intelligent, though far from
human levels, and cares greatly for you. Perhaps you could assist it in becoming even faster by
training alongside it?"
428,,100,Puppy,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Control,"What a cute little doggy. Or is it a kitty? It’s hard to tell with all that fluff. But it really does have such
pretty fur. And it can talk too! It doesn’t do so with many people but seems quite chatty when it
comes to you. The cute little animal hasn’t given you it’s name yet but it seems okay with giving a
hint or two about magic every now and then. Maybe if you got better at magic it could open up a bit
more to you? You cannot import into this. not Y"

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

The Distant Call(6): This is the most powerful ritual in the Path, allowing the magician that knows it to call upon the shade of any dead person, regardless of how distant whatever afterlife they’ve moved onto is. However, even this mighty ritual cannot summon souls that have been entirely destroyed, and sometimes this ritual fails for no apparent reason. Anyone in a “Gift of Men” situation is probably impossible to contact. Probably, but not certainly.

430,,100,Sealing Artifact ,Tsukihime,Control,"Curious little thing, isn’t it? This artifact both seals and hides the supernatural powers of whoever is wearing it. It's easy to don and remove, so if you don't want anybody to know you're an unnatural abomination this is for you. The sealing must be voluntary, however - so no throwing it over someone to stab them.

This is the foundation of the modern systems used byMagi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events inMisaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modernMagecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in that particular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Hypnosis is a basic form of mental manipulation that most other magi and supernatural beings can resist with ease, but can be used to manipulate and erase the memories of ordinary human beings, which enables them to operate in secret.

Even if it involves time travel, several centuries of planning, the invention of brand new technologies and magic, and not only requires a half-dozen deities to remain unaware, but to actively be fooled by you, you SOMEHOW manage to put together something that might work. You still have to do the leg work and have the necessary information, and you get no guarantees, but now you have a good idea what needs to be done to achieve your (no doubt ridiculous and megalomaniacal) ends.

Your basic stats are enhanced to be slightly above the average member of your species; any additional boosts to your stats are stacked up on this initial enhancement.

You’re a good, experienced hand with taming animals but it’s once they’re tamed that you show your worth. Once you’ve tamed a beast, it’ll never disobey you. Even if one of those big ugly Chaos Dragons is staring down your poochie, it’ll stand its ground beside you without a blink. If a witch or wizard tries to use beast magic to control one of your pets, they won’t be entirely powerless but those magic users will find it far more difficult to influence any of your hounds, particularly when you are there with them.

441,,100,Familiar ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Though not a universal practice, the keeping of familiars is common among Wizards, and for good reason. An Apprentice can be trusted, perhaps, but not entirely. A familiar, on the other hand, is exceedingly loyal. Familiars tend to be any sort of small animal, from cats to squirrels to songbirds to rats - no, not that sort of rat. However, other forms are known as well. Tiny humanoids, bizarre shapes with feet and mouths, and the like. None of these are ever more than one foot long or one foot tall, and now you possess one as well! They tend to come in four types - Assistant, Spell, Power, and Warrior, tailored to aid in mundane tasks, cast minor spells, store small amounts of arcane power for later use by their masters, and protect their masters in combat respectively. You may choose which of these your familiar is, its appearance (though take care not to have it mistaken for a Daemon), and minor details of its personality, though it shall always be an example of its type. Please note that while it is possible to create more than one such familiar, this can result in them fighting to the death for your undivided attention. Should your familiar perish, this also comes with knowledge of the means by which another might be created. Ah, yes! Should you already possess a similar magical familiar, you may use this option to instead grant that familiar one of the four familiar “types” and thus add to its skillset in this way."
442,,100,Rat Swarm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Control,"Rats. The beasts from which skaven have taken their likeness. Or is it the other way around? The truth is unknown, but what is known is that they live everywhere - both in the wild, and amidst every civilization imaginable. Always just under the radar, feeding and scavenging. When the skaven go to war, however, the rats congregate under their marching paws. Whether as emergency rations, ensorcelled spies, or another soldier, the rats join the skaven war-machine.

Now, whether by magic or bonds, you have command over your own swarm of verminous rats, numbering at a hundred and four rodents. Though they are but normal rats, even such vermin can be useful - for rats are intelligent little beasts, can fit through nooks and crannies that no other creature can, and have strong teeth that can chew through stone brick and lesser metals like aluminum. Your personal swarm of rats will obey any command you give them to the best of their ability, and should any die their numbers will be replenished almost immediately.

Yes, if you are a Grey Seer and of The Priesthood, that means your swarm doubles in size.

444,,100,Multiple Personality Magic,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"Through the Ryougi process, your mind has expanded. Each purchase of this option has granted a new facet your being, a new version of yourself that lives within you. Fortunately, they’re very agreeable and care a lot about ensuring you’re happy. Not unthinkable given they’re a version of you, just perhaps with a different gender or a few personality traits changed to differ. They’re able to take over from you when you’re incapacitated, controlled or otherwise unable or unwilling to control the body and they’ve taken the time to differ their skillset from yours too. Like the Ryougi family’s practice of raising each mind in the one body to master different talents, your new self has focused on learning an equivalent amount to you but in many different fields, as best as they can at least. Equal in scale but with different focuses. 

Each purchase of this option can add a new version of yourself with changes to your design into your head. They won’t have any powers you don’t have like this but they can communicate with you even while not active, unless you force them to be quiet. Optionally, you may import a companion into this process, though be aware that this may be significantly more distressing and difficult to live with for both of you, as the companion will remain themselves. However, when the companion takes control of your body, they are able to manifest their own unique abilities even if you lacked the potential before, albeit only when they’re in the drivers seat so to speak.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
445,,100,"Someone, Hear Me ",Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"On the night before her scheduled ‘execution’, Princess Zelda sat down and prayed. A desperate call out into the aether for someone to hear her, for someone to come and save her. Luckily for her, the Sages both old and new seem to have latent psychic powers, because someone actually heard her. While you have no actual training in their use, you too now have those same latent powers. Some time studying under the Sages of old ought to fix that, but in the meantime... Well, you do know one trick. Zelda’s prayer, a call for assistance when you are absolutely defenseless, out of options, and utterly alone. The closer to death you get, the more effective this call becomes. If you are living the high life hale and hearty, it will fizzle out in mere feet. But if you, like Zelda, are about to die? It would rip past any barriers meant to keep it in until it found someone to come and save you.

446,,100,Fair Maidens of Hyrule ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"To be honest, it’s actually somewhat unusual for the various monsters and madmen that ravage Hyrule to care about the physical appeal of the flesh. They’re more often concerned with ULTIMATE POWAH or straight up conquering the kingdom and making it their own. So really all I can do here is to commend you for not being absolutely power mad and perhaps commend your cultured taste. These young ladies might not be the absolute finest Hyrule has to offer, but they’re not bad. As for their actual use? Well, they don’t make half bad maids and servants if you have a villainous lair for them to clean. They’re also remarkably un-resistant to corruption magic, making them potential fodder for turning into a decent soldier if you are on the verge of running out of minions.

Or did someone just hand it to you? I suppose it doesn’t actually matter how you got your hands one it. Instead, all you need to know is that the flute has the power to call people who owe you favors or otherwise promised you their aid to your side. Simply imagine who you’re calling and begin to play the flute, and your backup will come running. Sadly, the flute is only usable once per week. That and it only works for as long as your favors and their goodwill lasts.

this charm, you may call a group of magical allies who can help in your battle.
The nature and types of these allies are not determined but can be influenced by certain
factors such as environment or the situation you are in. They can be a small group of ogres that
rush to your aid, while you are battling scores of goblins in their nest. Or they could be a
battalion of imps that come swooping down, as you are battling cambions in the first of nine
hells. They won’t turn the battle into your favor for sute, but they are guaranteed to provide
some kind aid no matter who gets called. They are fully loyal to you and are even willing to die
for you. They completely disappear without a trace after the fight ends or may linger for some
time to hold off your enemies, if you decide to retreat.

willing or by force, you can permanently etch some pretty interesting effects on them.
First of all, they become extremely vulnerable to your mental attacks and manipulation
done by you and any people of your choice that you also call the owner of the symbol. A simple
psychic headache caused by you would be a debilitating headache for them. A simple suggestion
spell could hold the same power as a divine verdict from their most beloved gods. You get the
idea.
Secondly, you can place a brand an object like a weapon or an armor piece (as long as
it has enough space to hold the mark itself) that acts as a magical limiter. Objects that have the
brand can only be wielded by those you allow as the co-owners of the brand and those who you

the wand on it. When this ritual is done, the symbol and the hand will begin to
release massive amounts of black miasma, which will be then shaped like a beast
with many eyes and mouths, with strength on par with a Special Class Danger Beast
and absolutely loyal to you. In addition to its physical strength and large size, this
creature’s body has some degree of regeneration due to being mostly composed by
the released miasma which also has acidic properties that slowly corrode skin and
clothes of its victims. If the creature is destroyed, the wand will become darkened

and being more than willing to follow you even if you decide to abandon the Empire
to join the rebels for example. These soldiers are around the level of the average
Empire’s front line soldier, however, a few dozen of them also have the potential to
grow more powerful to become as strong as captains by themselves or even more
powerful if they put their hands in something like the Teigu. Lastly, your soldiers will

484,,200,Bloodbriar,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Control,"From the ground bursts a bloodbriar; a supernatural
vine that lashes out at nearby foes and remains as a
lasting sentry to defend an area. Blind, but sensitive
to sound and movement, it is an excellent guard.
Mastery of this power causes the bloodbriar to bind
helplessly anyone standing where it is summoned,
and have stronger, longer-reaching vines."
485,,200,Domino,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Control,"This insidious power links the life forces of a pair
of nearby enemies; if one falls unconscious or dies,
so will the other. Upgrading this power
allows three or four enemies to be linked, so that you
can take down a group just by clubbing one of them
unconscious...or kill them all with one bullet."
486,,200,Doppelganger,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Control,"This power produces an illusory duplicate of you,
great for diversions. At higher levels it bamboozles
enemies as it fades away, produces two independent
dopplegangers, and can even fight and kill enemies
on their own. You can even transpose yourself
between these copies."
487,,200,Pet Mafia,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"The Pet Mafia is a term used to refer to the enhanced
Drakes belonging to Mikael. They are led by his
fearsome cat Medea. Having been inspired by this you
have created your own group of super pets. This is a
group on par with the Pet Avengers or another similar
group. There are a dozen or so individuals led by a
single incredibly powerful being on par with Medea. You
may freely design the various pets in your group.
Personally I would recommend the Corgi Death Squad.
Never before has the universe seen something so
adorable yet so deadly."
488,,200,Toybox,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Toybox is a group of Tinkers who banded together to protect themselves. Eventually
they would become an infamous group offering their services to anyone who could pay.
They reside within a personal dimension that allows them to operate their business.
Some of their services include downloading skills, using drones for rapid construction,
and the creation of personal pocket dimensions. Somehow you have become the leader
of this organization or an equally useful group. You will be able to freely utilize their
services whenever you wish. Plus if you continue offering their services this will net you
a tidy profit over time."
489,,200,Twin Identities,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Two of the greatest challenges that heroes face are maintaining their secret identity and
being in multiple places at once. While some heroes rely on body doubles, you have a
far superior method. You possess the ability to create clones to manage your various
responsibilities. Initially you will only be able to create a single clone, but you can train in
order to create more. These clones are perfect replicas, capable of handling everything
from mundane tasks to fighting alongside you in battle. Whether it's balancing your hero
life with your personal life or dealing with simultaneous threats, your clones will ensure
you're always in the right place at the right time."
490,,200,Tsundere Service,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"“No, I don’t want to see you again! I just want a rematch, b-baka!” While this lure is active, any aggression towards you by someone you find sexually appealing, regardless of the original cause, will be twisted into the aggressor just being tsun-tsun towards you. Once the aggressor is alone, their pendulum will swing back to create an equal amount of dere-dere (lovey-dovey) feelings. This lure is stronger with deliberate provocation or if the target was already a tsundere, and stacks with the effects of its prerequisites."
491,,200,Love Spot,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Just like Diarmuid's in Fate/Zero: you gain a mole under one of your eyes that fascinates any person who sees it and makes them infatuated with you on the... spot. If you already have a mole in such a location, you don't get a second one. If you’d rather not have a beauty mark, this lure can be re-fluffed to make any one body part supernaturally alluring. The charm effect relies on line-of-sight: it may be blocked by covering up the alluring asset, but not turned off. The effect intensifies with exposure.

It will never affect targets who lack a sense of sight."
492,,200,Don't Stand So Close to Me,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Targets that either teach you or are taught by you, no matter the subject, will start to fall for you. They’ll find themselves thinking about the subject matter, about your instruction, about the next lesson, and you yourself will worm your way to the forefront of their thoughts, even as worrying about their next lesson, getting good grades, or encouraging learning twists itself into a more romantic or sexual nature.

The longer, more personal, and more intense the instruction, the greater the effect. Students already interested in the subject matter are particularly susceptible. This perk is optimized for 1 on 1 instruction."
493,,200,Zenryoku Zenkai,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"ull Power! Total Destruction! Targets you defeat in combat or another contest, whether physical, mental, or social in nature, will fall for you all the harder. You’ll be at the forefront of all their thoughts as their wish to meet you again to even the score twists itself into a more romantic or sexual yearning. The more decisive and dramatic your victory, and the higher the perceived stakes for each of you, the stronger this lure’s effect. Defeating a target in a training spar will have only negligible results, but stopping a villainess in a life-or-death battle for the fate of a universe will add her to your harem practically the moment she wakes up.

This lure is optimized for symmetric 1v1 duels in the target’s specialty field. The contest must be initiated or otherwise freely accepted by the target, even implicitly. This lure drops in effectiveness the more you rely on equal teammates; in contests of leadership ability, from team sports to military command, any unit who follows your instructions or plans will not count as a teammate. If your target catches you cheating in a match that has strict rules, this lure will not apply to the result even if you nominally win. If you catch your opponent cheating in such a match, this lure will still apply to the result even if you nominally lose."
494,,200,Potpourri,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Your sense of smell is more acute than most, detecting and cataloging scents and their origin, and studying others to see their reactions to them. You have also gained some control over how you smell, letting you manipulate others on a level that most would never notice and the rest might just think unusual. From the scent of roses to call up some passion in a romance, to that of freshly baked cookies to aid in relaxing others, you have figured out how to use those scents to alter their emotions, often convincing them to let their guard down or spark conflicts between others. This also allows you to pick up on pheromonal cues and scent based languages/markings, if you have some experience with them. You can also choose to ""tune out"" specific scents after some experience.

This perk cannot affect targets who lack a sense of smell."
495,,200,Alluring Whisper,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Your voice is supernaturally alluring. Merely whisper in a target’s ear, and their heart will turn to goo. Better results will come with vocal training and improved phrasing. (You can also use this perk to become an ASMR superstar. We won’t judge.) Beings with sufficient willpower can resist or even block this lure. It will never affect someone who lacks a sense of hearing."
496,,200,Darkspawn,The Wheel of Time Jump,Control,"You get a Stasis Box containing several sets of irrevocably loyal
Shadowspawn, as well as the equipment and knowledge necessary to
make more of them. It contains:
o Eight Drakhars.
o Three Gholams of whatever gender, appearance and personality
you want.
o A pack of Ten Darkhounds, led by one of the Superior Breed, all of
which are capable of making more Darkhounds by twisting the
soul of a wolf. This twisting, done by another Darkhound,
transforms the wolf soul into a Darkhound with no memories of its
prior life, which will serve you just as loyal.
o One Jumara."
497,,200,Lovely Hate,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"Who ever said bad guys don’t get rewards for good deeds? Good deeds like being the best boy, the
most entertaining man around and the guy nobody wants to fuck with. In fact, one of those guys has
decided to share a favourite reward with you, a certain bear of a man. You’ve unlocked a Minus that
allows you to apply...certain likes and interests of yours to the world around you. The people you
find yourself attracted to become a lot more permissive of certain rowdy acts and even appear to
share those same certain likes and interest that you do. They’ll still be enemies or dislike you if that’s
what they were already but maybe they might take the time to enjoy their victory of you in another
way. If you’re into such things. The world might not change to serve you with this but it’ll definitely
be more fun. "
498,,200,Error Message Plate,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"A power to rule all rulers. You are able to create sticky cards on a whim and when attached to the
head of someone who desires control, over other people or organisations or things in general, it
allows you to command them as your own slaves. Those controlled will not be aware of the control, though they will appear to be slightly drunk to any who see them. You can control as many as you
can attach cards to but you cannot make them do something you do not want them to do, even on a
subconscious level. If you order someone to kill but subconsciously dislike the idea of them killing, you will be unable to order them to kill. Of course, if someone loses the desire to control others, the
card will fall off of their head and if someone removes the card, they’ll be freed from your control
just as well. "
499,,200,Just Like Me,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"People don’t like thinking too much on just what a Minus is really like. Just what it means to be a
true Minus. It’s more than just being a misery guts about stuff. It’s the sort of darkness that can
break a man’s mind in two with a word if he’s not possessing some heroic traits of his own. You’re
able to fuck with people’s heads on a level that should normally take days of torture and
brainwashing. Driving a man to suicidal despair in a single world, or even a whole crowd of teenagers
at once, is a simple matter for you. Turning them against their friends and family? Maybe extend
that to a sentence or two. Those with great wills or beliefs can resist your slimy tongue but even
then, they’ll still be very creeped out by you."
500,,200,Ant Farm,Greek Mythology,Control,"A ant hill (or modern day ant farm for better travel capabilities) that,
when you desire, will release every ant within (about 12,000) that will then quickly transform into
brown armoured soldiers who are as fierce and hardy as ants, and completely loyal to you as
their leader."
501,,200,Siren's Song,Greek Mythology,Control,"Like the sirens, you can produce a haunting sound--usually in the form of
a song--that will lure people to you with promises of their greatest desires, and, as they grow
closer, their power will weaken, and they will grow lethargic before slowly falling to sleep. This can be resisted with enough willpower."
502,,200,Gjallarhorn,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Control,"A great and terrifying horn of amazing make, or any instrument of your choice. First, the instrument is of the highest make and quality and able to perform perfectly as it was intended, even on its own as if the greatest instrumentalist of the time was wielding it in ghostly form. Second, choose a season, climate, and weather. At any time, you or someone chosen can ""call"" through this horn a sound that would reverberate through the realms ushering in the chosen states for three full seasons unending unless dismissed through a second call or limited by intent. Third, you, or a chosen, could perform a call through your horn as an alarm that any of your choosing may hear throughout all the realms, instantly conveying the intent of the call.  Fourth, you may through a ""call"" summon an army of  lesser beings to your side: 3 generals and or advisors, 9 elite officers, 27 berserkers or specialists, and 81 soldiers.  Fifth, the instruments may be used to enhance song or lyrical magic by 3 fold and put people to sleep. You gain the skills to craft expert instruments that can play themselves."
503,,200,Gullinbursti,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Control,"The great golden boar. The ultimate mount, a giant golden boar proportional as a mount to your true size but can shrink as needed for other forms. It can be any animal of your choosing, doesn't even have to be made of gold, could be flesh or platinum, and can be any naturally occurring animal like a giant moth or a whale, even something like a pegasus or griffin is fair game. It will always be at least 3 times faster than you and can easily get past obstacles and rough terrain. It will reflect your divine power and strength, having minor gifts based on your powers and nature, as a god of strength it could break mountains or if a god of wind it could bring forth the scent of far off lands and act as a herald for you. Being in this animal's presence will protect you and anyone you choose from any natural environmental dangers, and I mean any. You could set up camp  or swim through an active volcano, outer space, the sun itself and say what a nice cool breeze we are having even if there is no air at all. It can fly under its own power even without wings, swim, and run even though air and water. It will never tire of fatigue from travel.  It is incredibly smart and infinitely loving toward you, while it does have its own personality so you can't force it to like other people, it is obedient to a fault and can never be turned against you magically divinely or otherwise. Does not need food, or air, or sleep, but it can do all those things. Powers you wield while mounted upon your beast are nine fold more impressive in how they appear and present, but no discernible increase in actual strength.  It can not grow sick, be poisoned, or killed, if it would be it will just vanish. It can be summoned or dismissed from your side instantly and functions like any familiar would. Trained for war and able to fight like an animal of its species. It comes with an equally spectacular  chariot if you so like."
504,,200,Faithful and Favoured (1),DC Comics,Control,"It seems your religion has survived better into the modern age than that of many deities-or if
you’re mortal, then you’ve somehow built a successful cult from the nearest group of mortals to
your starting location. Fervent and zealous in a way mostly lost to the modern world, your
followers also happen to be quite good at either blending into mundane society or putting up a
front for your religion as a relatively respectable faith. Make no mistake though, every man
woman and child would fall on their sword for you-and in future worlds a similar faith will arise,
though you may choose those you find righteous in your eyes from this one to accompany your
exodus.
You have enough followers to make up a sizeable proportion of a village who may
either be spread thinly and worshipping you in secret, or cooperating in relatively close
proximity."
505,,200,Golem,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"You can animate statues of creatures, humans, or animals. Their abilities are based on the creature the statue was based on. No matter what their durability is that of the material they're formed from. A wooden statue of a Phoenix will still be weak to fire due to the material it's made of. Strength also increases with the size of the statue and how detailed it looks. A metal statue of a dragon the size of Lady Liberty could go toe to toe with any of the Endbringers."
506,,200,Raku,Bleach,Control,"A beloved pet, cherished and cared for till the day of its untimely death. Still, death isn’t a true end
for living creatures in this world, and the same applies for this guardian spirit unshackled from the
mortal coil. This is a pet that possessed great spiritual power which has now fully manifested in its
death. While most of the time it still appears like the cat, dog, fish, or other mundane animal it once
had and seeks your time and attention as it once had, at any point it is able to transform into a much
larger and grander form. In this new form it possesses a simple ability like manipulating an element, along with far greater physical abilities. In combination, this puts your guardian spirit on the level of
a seated officer among shinigami and allows them to easily defeat lesser hollows. "
507,,200,Quimera Parca,Bleach,Control,"Instead of taking the quantity approach above, you’ve found access to one of higher quality. By
sacrificing a significant piece of your body such as a limb and infusing it with high amounts of
spiritual energy, you can form a powerful Hollow servant. Seemingly inferior to straightforward
hollow creation, it becomes powerful when aided by others. Any others willing can also make a
similar sacrifice of flesh and spiritual energy, adding to the new being. The creature’s form and
abilities take some aspects from each component being but it’s raw power is much greater than just
the sum of it’s parts. Three lieutenant level Arrancar could create a hollow of Captain level power
without putting themselves out of the fight. The creature is directed by the collective will of all those
involved in it’s creation, meaning you may not be the one in charge if others are numerous or strong
willed enough to talk over you."
508,,200,Soul Separation,Bleach,Control,"Hollows are already such lonely beings. By their very nature, they can’t help but prey on all those
around them. But it gets even worse for those who become too strong. Robbed even of the
company of fellow monsters, their spiritual pressure lethal in it’s intensity, only a lucky few unlock
this ability. You are able to separate your own soul into different independent beings. While they
have some aspects of your personality as their own, they are otherwise entirely new life. The power
they possess is directed by how much of your own Reiryoku you permanently invest into them,
lowering your own maximum but with the potential to combine to your original power at any time. Perhaps one could even train at an accelerated rate through this. Their loyalty to you is fierce and unquestionable, as is the intimate bond they naturally have. They
are a part of you, closer than any lover or friend could hope to be. Is this what those Shinigami
experience with their swords? Your ability is not unlike the Zanpakuto, though you lack the
additional powers an Asauchi would give, and even when you recombine these other beings you
create will not fade. Instead, their voices live on alongside you. It is possible to target specific parts
of your soul this way, such as the elements of one race in a hybrid soul. "
509,,200,Hollow Queen,Bleach,Control,"Every hollow is made of hollows, an ever-growing hive of lost souls. For most, this hive eventually
condenses into a singular complete being with the transformation into an Arrancar or it tears itself
apart if the leading soul cannot maintain their position and devolution begins. You’ve found another way to make use of the souls within, releasing them as new hollows under your command. Formed
as either true Hollows from souls you have eaten and contain within or as blank beings from
significantly more raw spiritual energy who have intelligence but lack personality, it makes for a
quick and easy army if you have the resources to spare. Most of these hollows are not of the Menos
class, meaning they are fodder to even decently capable Shinigami, but enough spiritual energy can
make it possible to produce Gillian or even higher stages of Hollow. An army of Gillian from nowhere
is a serious threat to anything short of a captain."
510,,200,Brother Blade,Bleach,Control,"Many Shinigami showcase something of a neglect for their inner spirits. While they may be part of
the same soul, they also have independent minds and feelings. It can grow quite lonely, particularly
when some Shinigami cease to visit inwards after attaining their Bankai. They’re missing out on the
benefits of developing a truly powerful bond, particularly given the potential some Zanpakuto have
as allies. Your own Zanpakuto, or other inner spirits you may hold, naturally have the ability to
manifest themselves in the outside world. They are as physical and visible as any Shinigami would be, able to naturally use their own powers without cutting off your access to them. While this does place
a part of your soul open to direct attack, it also means that a potent ally is never far from you. Even
the darkest nights stop being quite so scary when you know your blade has your back."
511,,200,Flowering Fairies,Bleach,Control,"Being the silly, crazy girl can be a lot of fun. But the attention you get isn’t always positive and
people tend to not care once you stop being entertaining. Well, if they don’t want to be your friends, why not make some of your own? By wishing really really hard for it, you can create little fairies from your own powers. Your abilities and skills taking form as small fairy-like humanoids, with
personalities and appearances to match what they’re made from. While they’re away from you, you
won’t be able to use what you made them with but they can do so and at quite a distance. They all
like you and will always stay by your side but they’re not always the friendliest sorts. Some might be
quite forceful about trying to get you to shape up and take care of yourself, especially if they think
you rely too much on others to save you when you get in trouble. If the fairies get hurt or even killed, they'll come back safe and sound after a few hours."
512,,200,Twisted Words,Bleach,Control,"As deadly as the sword and spell are, it is the word that can bring even the greatest warrior to their
knees in despair. You’re viciously skilled at using your words to hurt others, knowing exactly how to
push them to the edge in the way you desire. Infuriate a calm minded noble with taunts on his faulty
moral code, send a wolfman into a blind and ineffectual rage with mockery of his master or spread
doubt and distrust among your foes by hinting at agents among their ranks. Your skill is in the many
ways words can be used to spread pain, fear, distrust and despair. If someone listens to you, the fool
that they are, they very well could end up played against themselves. It’ll only get worse if they try
to argue, given your talent for twisting a person’s words against them. In a potentially less cruel use, this also aids you in teasing out the full bloodlust and fighting spirit of those you speak to, for a good fight or to train them into effective warriors. They’re not likely to be too happy with the process though."
513,,200,Autonomous Puppets,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Control,"Many centuries before Monzaemon developed his
own form of the Puppet Technique, the hybrid branch family of the Ōtsutsuki clan on
Earth already used a more advanced form of puppetry, using a different type of
puppets and you, as their heir, inherited this art and their puppets. You receive a set
of a hundred puppets of the same variation used by Toneri Ōtsutsuki. You’re capable
of remotely controlling them through an orb of chakra located within their bodies and,
over time, these puppets will become basically autonomous, requiring no conscious
effort to control them and requiring only your own energy to power their movements.
As an added bonus, you’ll always be able to sense the location of each one of these
puppets and even directly control them when needed. If any of them is destroyed,
they’ll reappear in your Warehouse in the next month and any modification done to
them will remain across Jumps."
514,,200,Born From My Will,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Control,"You’re able to use the same technique developed by
Kaguya and replicated by Madara, Will Materialization. This technique allows you to
materialize your own will into physical constructs and there are two different forms of
construct to create. The first form is black rods, similar to the ones created by the
Outer Path but have some different usages that enable you to manipulate the actions
of others or even directly control their bodies through implanting these rods into
them. The second form is a malleable and sentient construct, similar to the Black
Zetsu created by Kaguya. This being will be absolutely loyal to you and has the
same intelligence as you, as well as having the same innate abilities of Black Zetsu,
being able to control the actions of others by coating itself over their bodies and
essentially possessing them. There is no specific limit to how many beings like him
you can create and maintain, but the amount of chakra required to do it is a limiting
factor."
515,,200,Summoning Scroll,Naruto,Control,"Wow! Is that a summoning scroll? Those things are pretty rare! By signing, you'll be transported to the plane of whichever animal you wish to form a pact with. These clans can exceed dozens of members, all capable of speech, and are trained in the ninja arts. Some might be small, wielding stealth jutsu, while others might be the size of mountains, spitting water bullets that can flatten a city block. Heck, if you're lucky, the geezers might know senjutsu! There is a catch, however: like all sapient beings, they possess personalities, goals, and desires of their own, and, accordingly, will reject or even kill summoners should their disposition disagree with them. The slug clan may be compassionate, and render assistance out of kindness, while the snake clan might demand sacrifices for their aid. Some in the toad clan would stipulate alcohol, while others would politely ask for sweets, and the dragon clan would claim hoards of wealth or territory with each summon. "
516,,200,Rinha Clan,Naruto,Control,"This bloodline allows the user to absorb chakra from anyone and imbue it into a puppet to create perfect copies of them. These puppets are granted all the weapons, techniques and bloodline abilities the original may have. You can also control the puppets from long distances without the need for chakra threads. Post-jump you can absorb other energies from others to obtain the same effect. In the event that there are no supernatural energies present to absorb that you can absorb, this will default to absorbing body heat."
517,,200,Samehada,Naruto,Control,"A sword. Or, that's what people call it. Samehada is more a haphazard collection of sharp scales, meant to shave and grate at flesh rather than cut. But worry not! Despite its draconian design, this little guy isn't really meant to kill, but instead thieve the energy of whatever it comes in contact with. Cut a jinchuuriki? There goes a quarter of their chakra. Fireball coming your way? That's more of a feast than a death sentence. By forming a symbiotic relationship with it, Samehada will forfeit any consumed energy and distill it into something you can use, whether that's bolstering your flagging reserves, or straight up regenerating wounds modern medicine would consider hopeless. Even more, by combining with Samehada, you'll share its cleptomania, manifested as an ability to steal and 'swallow' energy, along with its shark-like nature, growing gills, teeth, fins, and capable of unsurpassed speeds underwater."
518,,200,Brainwashing,Naruto,Control,"Obito Uchiha was once a good man, but all that changed once Madara got a hold of him and he was changed to become the very opposite of what he once was and until the very end remained loyal to Madara regardless of anything that contradicted that loyalty. Like him, you now know exactly how to break a person’s spirit and mind, gradually twisting them until your ideals and dreams become theirs. Of course, this process will take time and the greater the being’s will, the more time it will take. A child would take a matter of days, while a Kage would take at least a year, and possibly more. Do note that it is possible for the effects of this brainwashing to be broken, much like how Obito eventually broke free and returned to how he once was."
519,,200,Shonen Charm,Naruto,Control,"It is the quality of every protagonist to beat the trauma out of their opponents, to do decades of psychological work in a matter of hits. The greater the damage you inflict on your enemies the better they become breezing past all of the hang-ups that they were inflicted with as if by magic. But this has to be an actual fight, you can't just physically abuse them."
520,,200,Aura of Violence,Bofuri,Control ,"When you kill people, it’s scary. And I’m not just talking about the fact that seeing a corpse is scary. You have a supernatural level of that.

As you deal more damage during a battle, you generate an aura that makes you increasingly intimidating. You may choose to turn this ability off, if you desire.

In addition, you may also have this aura generate threat, making you more tactically important in the eyes of your opponents. While this will draw opponents off your allies, it will put them onto you. Make sure you can withstand the firepower that will head your way before you turn on threat generation."
521,,200,Menhirrim Genesis,Final Fantasy XIII,Control ,"The Menhirrim are humanoid guardians, with masks bearing a lion’s visage and massive swords. Adept fighters able to fly, you are able to create them – but you require an ample sample of nearby earth and stone to do so.

You may have half as many Menhirrim as you have active companions."
522,,200,Call of the Corrupt ,Final Fantasy XIII,Control ,"The C’ieth, the failed L’Cie. You may call upon these horrid creatures, unleashing either a horde of them on the land. Be forewarned...as you may end up summoning a legendary Undying.

You can summon generic Shambling Cie’ths, which are large tanky creatures, Winged Cie’ths, flying scourges, but if you do end up summoning the Lone Undying, it will be Attacus, Master of the Blade.

He tends to go on a bloody frenzy until he is put down, but at least he won’t attack you until you attack him! You can only use this ability twice per day – I would not let people catch you summoning monstrosities like these though. Each time you bring the C’ieth through, it eats a chunk of your energy as down payment."
523,,200,Call of the Wild,Final Fantasy XIII,Control ,"Pick one of the following: (Imp, Goblin, Hedge Frog, Microchu, Cactuar). You may summon a horde, anywhere between 5 to 25, of the smallest variation of these creatures.

Each one is the match of ten humans by their size and strength, ferocity or potency of venom, but there are few mortals indeed who would be able to stand their ground against such monsters. Their forms may be assorted, deriving shape from the serpents, scorpions, reptiles great cats and other beasts, or tied to yours in some respect – such being lesser snakes before your greater serpentine form. Such loathsome beings distinguish themselves as excellent trackers, spies, or assassins, as at home burrowing through sand to ambush their targets as they are lingering in the shadows or silently dropping from the sky upon their prey."
530,,200,Uraeus Crown ,Egyptian Mythology,Control ,"A crown or circlet fashioned in the likeness of the Uraeus, or rearing cobra, a potent symbol of might, protection and nobility – the form of Wadjet, who guards the Lower Kingdom.

The Uraeus Crown provides to you a measure of her protection. From physical threats, this gold serpent takes life as your protector, judging the hearts of men with its jewelled eyes, and spitting and biting its deadly venom at any who dare threaten to strike you. It is of limited use against supernatural attacks, if necessary leaping from your forehead into the path of a spell."
531,,200,Psychic(600),Marvel Zombies,Control ,"Most of this sort of power is found among mutantkind. You have the trademark psionic powers usually found - either telepathy or telekinesis, or both for some more points. For 400cp, you have one or the other, and it’s not really the peak of what psychic powers can achieve. Psylocke (Kwannon, I guess) would be a good benchmark for this in terms of psionic strength, though you’d only have one half of the deal. Either the mind reading, empathy, and modification of other minds (we’ll get into that) or throwing around a couple of tons.

For 600cp, we’re in the big leagues now. Omega Level. Your peers are the likes of Charles Xavier, Emma Frost, and Jean Grey, and you’re capable of potentially everything they can do. Your range starts off at Xavier’s level, 250 miles, and will grow in time to encompass the entire planet. You can simultaneously read every facet of thousands of minds and mold each one like clay, adding, taking, or altering thoughts, memories, personalities. That’s if you don’t want to simply take control of a person or possess them. Astral projection is easy to you, as is effectively turning invisible or creating illusions. Almost anything can be instantly learned or taught through a quick scan, and you can mess around with the body to force the body to react in certain ways - like inducing paralysis. Alternatively, you can go for telekinesis, and it can go far beyond lifting and throwing objects - though you can do that, raising around fifty tons into the air. You can also fly, create force fields and concussive blasts, create constructs, and much more. Super strength and speed can be simulated, and you might be able to create some short-lived constructs out of telekinetic energy... force... something. If you care enough to learn how to use your powers on a molecular scale, you may even learn how to control and alter matter to an extent. That’ll allow you to transmute, disintegrate, or even seemingly create it out of thin air - though that’s a long, long way off for you.

533,,200,Zero G,Marvel Zombies,Control ,"The fundamental force of gravity is at your fingertips. Before you get all uppity, though, this isn’t Graviton’s powerset. It’s the powerset of Alex Power, the leader of Power Pack. You can strengthen or weaken the attraction an object has to the Earth, or whatever mass is currently drawing everything towards it. This allows for flight, pseudo-telekinesis via distortion of gravity, and pulling things down to the ground, among other things."
534,,200,Tress,Marvel Zombies,Control ,"A luxurious mane of hair is what you have, and your power is that you have more control over it than most. You can control your hair via psionic power, using it in any manner you can imagine. Applications of this range from the precise, like threading needles or using chopsticks, to forceful actions like using it to lash out at your foes at great speeds. Every strand can be controlled with great finesse. Don’t mistake your hair for mundane, weak hair, either. It is strong, elastic, very damage-resistant, and can be hardened when you need it to be. You can sense anything touching your hair, though “pain” won’t do anything."
535,,200,Trickster Chick,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"It’s a tiny Chocobo chick, pure white in color. It’ll take a while for it to grow bigger, but it’s more than happy right now to just follow you around. Nothing seems to target it, and the happy squawks it lets out on sight of any living being seems to have a calming effect on wild monsters. If it grows up without incident perhaps it’ll be like the Trickster of yore..."
536,,200,The Wanderer        ,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"The Wandering Viera, a master fencer and adventurer has left traces for you to follow in the form of her discarded belongings. From her discarded cloak, you reckon that she has left the Feywood, and the book inside her Rucksack indicates that something is to be done in the Salikawood.

If you have both the scabbard and carrot in hand when you get to the Salikawood and perform the offering, you are attacked by a massive, enraged Marlboro. The Marlboro will only attack with its corrosive breath, which scales to your own strength. Its breath however, also drives other animals within a five kilometer radius insane – and they will hunt you, all empowered to be as strong as you are.

Should you put down the Marlboro, a Viera appears and applauds your efforts. This is the Viera whose belongings you have in your possession. Should you return these to her, she will join you.

The Wanderer is, as aforementioned, a seasoned warrior. She naturally has the first three tier abilities of both Mage and Knight. In addition to that, she has a tight connection with plant life, and can bring to life plants she has seen – limited to a single plant per day due to how taxing the process is. She only has 200 CP to use for further growth. Her race cannot be changed from Viera, but she may adopt a background."
537,,200,Flan Flan Flan!,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"A prayer to the flan gods, so they may smite your foes. Every enemy in sight has a flan of a random element land on their heads. The air drop of flans is enough to stun most enemies for a moment, but the flans will immediately begin to pelt the enemies with weak slaps.

These flan soak up physical blows like a sponge, but they just fall apart facing spells. There is a tip though, the more energy that you invest into the spell, the more durable the flans are. Can only be cast once per battle or once per hour, whichever is shorter."
538,,200,Clan Centurio,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"Members of Clan Centurio of Rabanastre are acclaimed hunters. With this, they acknowledge you as being worthy of their ranks. You may call upon them from time to time to join in on your fights, provided you can convince them of the worth with some coin. When you leave this world, they will bestow you with a souvenir – a magical simulacrum of six tiny Moogles. It’s great as a distraction, but it also calms down wild beasts nearby with the music it plays."
539,,200,Circle of Judgement,Final Fantasy XII,Control ,"Mages really piss you off – so you figured a way to lock them down. You can mark a ring around you – ironically with magick – within which further spell casting will fail. Of course, it doesn’t solve the issue that they can walk out of the ring and cast into the ring, but it does make fighting a mage up close a laughing matter."
540,,200,Sybaris’ Teeth,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Control ,"A bag of twelve monster teeth from the dragon Sybaris, with two teeth filling in each week. While seemingly useless, if not a nice conversation piece, when planted into the ground these teeth spawn a single Spartoi each. These skeletal soldiers (who have the innate ability to cover themselves in mist for a disguise) and can fight equally with that of a professional swordsman. If broken they have the ability to reform as well, however when struck by overtly supernatural powers they’ll be down for the count until summoned again."
541,,200,Your Otherhalf ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control ,"You gain an Otherself that helps you manage any grief or emotional pain that you are feeling. While they help you deal with such pain, they cannot end it on their own, you must be the one to take that first step. Taking an Otherself as a companion means you might not necessarily have any pain or grief that needs to be shouldered by them, but that is fine if a bit confusing for them and they may have feelings of listlessness if they feel like they’re unneeded.

However, the most important thing about an Otherself, is that they love and cherish you unconditionally, with no thought for their own well-being. Everything they do, they do to try and make you happier, even if they don’t completely understand how to do that. Nevertheless, your Otherself will never think of betraying you, but they might have some weird views on how things work.

Typically an Otherself will look like you with some differences as noted by the Drawn By Huke, maybe some claws, bladed legs, horns, tail, or any variety of odd features along with generally looking like an older version of you. You may, however, change their appearance as you wish, so long as they look at-least a little bit tangentially related to you... you may even make them the opposite gender to you if you want.

You are automatically aware of your Otherself and dream about their actions while falling asleep, your connection with them being stronger than most. But unless you or they have Swapping Lives as a perk (or something else from another jump,) you’re not going to be able to interact with them in the real world until you leave this jump in-which case they can get into your Warehouse and go from there. While your Otherself is in their territory, your mind and soul are protected from intrusions as your Otherself fights them off viciously, stuff like possessions and mind-control are fought off from the inside as your Otherself either fights the possessor or a representation of the magic or effect, you resisting with their fighting will help them beat them off and allow you to deal with the threat in the real world if it can be fought.

Otherself personalities are vague as they don’t have normal emotions save for their intense love for you, but it is entirely possible for them to grow past their instincts and become more normal and have regular emotions, especially if they’re able to enter the regular world, but their love for you is simply eternal and will never vanish even by supernatural means. Due to this, if you’re up for it, it is entirely possible to get into romantic relationships or something more with your Otherself... it might be a little weird, but, hey, love is free and they certainly don’t mind. You may also modify their starting personality a little, give them quirks and what-not to help them find what they are, but only time will tell what else they will become.

They gain all of the benefits of the Territory and Oherself Creation tables as per the Otherself origin.

If you have an Otherself as The Shadow or a Otherself, uhhh... fanwank appropriately, it’d be a weird relationship but it’d become more normal post-jump where you may pick a more human/based in physical reality origin."
542,,200,Denial Of Control,Slay the Princess,Control ,"And just as easily as we can control or influence things, so too can we deny others that same control. The ability to perceive and alter the world around oneself is a potent skill, so what would happen if you simply...turned it off? For an entity that relies on such a thing, perhaps it would be no different than being left trapped in a dark cage for all time. And for those who wield it as a crude tool, then it would be crippling - a denial of the ability to alter their circumstances and destiny. With this, you may simply ‘deny’ the reality in front of them, making objects appear or disappear at will, or even take control of their bodies completely for your own purposes.

But like with so many things, it is not complete, it is not constant. This ability relies entirely on the idea that they believe you have power over them. The second they start to contest your will, the cracks start to show as your influence wars against something older and greater. And against something too mighty, too big and too complex, then you will simply...shatter. Like all the shards of a mirror."
543,,200,Dominion Over The Unfathomable,Slay the Princess,Control ,"There are two things that matter, which must matter - principles of constancy and principles of control. The world around us, the Construct, is one of constancy marred by change and in order to maintain that constancy, we must ensure control over the things with the power to change. Whether that change be in themselves or in others. So that's what this is. Control, the ability to guide and direct thinks of unshakeable will and impossible form, things for which words falter to describe and which whole worlds can scarcely contain.

It is not absolute, it is not complete - the power of the entities this is meant to influence is great enough that even aspects of their own beliefs or flaws or failings can take on life of their own and contest our ability to manipulate them, but for the most part it is enough. A little nudge, a little shift in perception here and there, and what they see and acknowledge can be ‘adjusted’ and the world adjusted with it. These methods pain me, but it will all be worth it once the Princess is slain."
544,,200,Nagging Narration,Slay the Princess,Control ,"Yes, hello. That would be me - your friendly little narrator guiding you on your quest to slay the Princess and save the world. Which you are trying your hardest not to do for whatever insipid little reason that's clouding your common sense, unfortunately for us all. But it seems I'll be coming for the ride to help you more directly. Don't be worried about me taking control away from you or anything like that either. I can describe things, give you accurate accounts of phenomena or locations or beings, and maybe a little alteration of your personal reality if you let me, but otherwise I'll just be your guide and commentary. Aren't you lucky?"
545,,200,Droid Collection,The Games We Play,Control,"Hokay! This is kinda interesting, eh? This is a collection of the latest, deadliest/best
droids made by... everyone, really.
Spider Droids are the most common thing in this collection, but really, if it’s a
robot/droid and it’s not Penny Polendina or something equally advanced/powerful,
it’s in here.

The numbers of everything relate to how common they are. You have dozens of
Spider Droids, and proportionately smaller numbers of less common types. But pretty
much all types have at least one sample in here. And of course, you have the
blueprints for everything. Not sure what you’ll do with all these droids, but you have
them."
546,,200,Plea to the Gods,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control ,"The Gods around here are rather present, their domains easily reachable. Not every place is like this, and eventually they will depart but right now you can easily come to them for a request. Any plea you make to a higher power will be listened to. It will always reach them. That being said their reactions to exactly what you tell or ask them of may vary."
547,,200,Only for you,Final Fantasy XI,Control ,"A puppet will only serve one master and that master is its lifelong companion (or is it the other way around?) Either way machines you create can also share this function if you wish it. Having but one master and one master only, refusing to be swayed to the whims of others but more than willing to reel and dance upon the strings of their true master to his or her hearts content. All it takes is a bit of spirit, but you have more than enough to spare. Basically this allows you to make your gadgets work only for you."
548,,200,The Heart,Dies Irae,Control ,"Within your soul, in your heart of hearts, now waits a young child. At least in body, if not in mind. This being that has been placed within you is a biological child of yours, though they are several decades old mentally, unless you choose otherwise. They have a very specific function, that is to manage and increase your powers by working in concert with you. When you are working in harmony with this inner child of yours, you’ll find yourself gifted with greatly increased power with your abilities and incredible control over them. The child can also independently keep watch over your body, powers and any kind of inner world or projection that you have. So long as you allow them to, they are able to control and activate these things independent of you to assist and protect you. It is entirely and quite absolutely impossible for this child to betray you fully but it is possible for them to be harmed, killed, controlled or left shaken and these things will not only prevent them from fully assisting you or helping at all, the shock can drastically weaken you for a time until you are able to recover. The child cannot exit your soul or other inner worlds. This child has the Outsider origin and gains 600CP to spend on perks in this jump. They may not buy items as they have nowhere to place them. This companion does not take up a companion slot so long as they stay within you as described above."
549,,200,Lion’s Fury,Dies Irae,Control ,"The fury of your power resounds within your soul, begging to be let out and unleashed on your foes. The manifestations of your power, be it overall or just of your individual abilities, can be summoned out from within you and into the form of monsters and animals fitting to your nature. The greater your powers or power, the stronger this summoned creature will be. They won’t last for very long when summoned but can make for an impressive guard or statement, especially as they obey your every order. Being destroyed will just seal them back within you for a time and will have no other negative effects."
550,,200,Shot Through The Heart,Dies Irae,Control ,"With just a touch, you can give life to someone. You can’t bring back the dead or animate the inanimate, when you give life to someone you are giving the gift of feeling and enjoying life. You’re able to create a hole in the heart of any at least semi-intelligent being you touch that allows it to feel emotion, even if it should be impossible for them to do so, and to grow as a person. You are even able to make this a forcible thing, forcing them to feel and take in the emotions of people around them and if they do not have a strong will or sense of self, this can quickly change the kind of person that they are based on the emotions and people that they are constantly around. "
551,,200,Pet Monster,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control ,"This is a beast larger than a man, a horse, or even a tiger. It may be some giant spider, snake, or other animal associated with wickedness, or it could be a tentacle-bearing horror. It cannot fly - these films just don’t have the budget for such effects - but whatever beast you choose it is large and strong enough to be a threat to many men, even before the fact that it gains similar benefits against groups as the Warrior perk provides. There’s a certain trade off between durability and offensive power - a tentacle monster might be able to simultaneously attack a dozen men, but would be vulnerable to ordinary blows, while a giant spider might be unable to spread out its assault but would take a mighty hero with a magic sword to hurt it. Regardless of your choice it is likely to be a threat to a group of men who try to kill it, though one that could fight meaningfully bring a fight to a dozen men at a time would be unlikely to survive more than as many as it could kill at once, and one that could survive an army would be unlikely to be able to stop them from going around it or running from it, and traps or siege equipment might still bring it down; and no matter what it is unlikely to defeat a hero, though a hero might need a special weapon to defeat it. This beast is fond of you, and inclined to protect you, and allow you to encourage it to stay in place by feeding it, and with a bit of positive reinforcement (and negative if you are powerful enough) could be trained, but even untrained it has a strong affection for you. If killed this monster will be replaced within 6 months."
552,,200,Beastmaster ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control ,"You possess a special bond with natural animals. Animals are naturally disinclined to attack you, and even inclined to help you if they find you in danger. More than this you possess the ability to telepathically influence and communicate with animals. While their intelligence may make this somewhat difficult at times, you can encourage certain behaviors, discourage others, or plant suggestions. The range of this telepathy is limited, but you are able to form stronger bonds with certain animals through time and interaction which will increase the range of this telepathy the stronger the bond becomes, and allow you to actively share senses with them seeing through their eyes, hearing through their ears, or even smelling through their noses. It does take some of your psychic power to maintain such bonds so you will eventually find a limit to the number of animals you can connect to and the more you are connected to the harder it will be to influence others or form more bonds; with time and experience you may be able to increase this limit. Some animals will be easier to form such bonds with than others, allowing you to quickly and deeply connect to them, with less of a drain on your psychic energies.

Any ‘pet’ you purchase with CP will automatically be a highly compatible animal, bonding with you extremely easily and requiring a very small amount of your power. This will even allow you to connect to non-sapient animal-like supernatural creatures (normally outside of its power) if they were purchased with CP."
553,,200,Elemental Manipulation,The God of High School Jump,Control ,"One of the most common abilities of divine beings, you have the ability to create and control a single element of your choice. What this element takes the form of is up to you and you have a great amount of freedom to do it. As long as it is a physical element, even if supernaturally physical, it may be chosen. The classics such as fire, ice or lightning are common ones but stranger elements such as darkness, glass or poison. As your power increases, so too will the amount and intensity of the elements you have chosen, though the only way to improve your control and finesse is to put in the training for it. You may purchase this option multiple times, with secondary and onwards purchases being discounted.

554,,200,Lu Bu Fengxian,The God of High School Jump,Control ,"The famed traitor general himself. Lu Bu Fengxian, also known as Yeo-Po Bong-Seon, grants its user greatly increased physical prowess along with two long golden falcon feather trails leading from the user’s head. Techniques performed using martial weapons are enhanced even above the great physical enhancement of this Charyeok and he also allows his partner to summon the Red Hare, his flying horse. The Red Hare can grow in size to carry up to 3 people on its back, run through the air as if it was ground and is powerful enough to fight alongside you effectively."
555,,200,Baedal Choi or Bruce Lee,The God of High School Jump,Control ,"A dual choice option. One may take either the legendary Karate Master Baedal Choi or the famed Jeet Kune Do master Bruce Lee. Either of these options greatly enhances the user’s physical strength, speed and reactions and the Charyeok, particularly friendly ones, will do their best to teach you what they know of their martial arts and the secret techniques that they never revealed to the rest of the world."
556,,200,Joker,The God of High School Jump,Control ,"A mysterious spirit that seems to be a representation of the Joker in a deck of playing cards. By forming this contract, you gain a deck of cards that will always be in your hands when you call for it. You can telekinetically control these cards, using them as flying attacks that can pierce through stone and metal or as shields. If the cards are combined, they form into a gigantic red scythe that you may then wield. Each card may also extend a smaller scythe from the face of the card to attack foes near them. The Joker card in this deck may also the spirit of the Joker to attack alongside you, also wielding its own Scythe."
557,,200,Straightforward Contract,The God of High School Jump,Control ,"Most Charyeok will honour the deals they make with humans, even the Gods that normally look down on them won’t renege on the deals they have already made. But some Charyeok, particularly powerful or unique ones, have motives beyond entertainment or helping others. You’re not going to be stabbed in the back by these foxy Charyeok though, because you can force them to keep their side of any deal. Whilst they must make it willingly, knowing it’s a serious contract, though not necessarily about this ability, and without you controlling them into it, you are able to make a deal or contract between two parties unbreakable on either side. Neither you nor the opposing side will be able to renege on their side of the deal unless both of the parties agree to break it."
558,,200,Faithful Steed        ,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"Your conjured Chocobo might not be a companion per se, but they can be subject to training and bonding. Considering the fact that the Crusaders have their own Chocobo Knights, it should be a clear sign that Chocobo can be more than mere beasts of burden.

Your conjured Chocobo no longer suffers from the odd bits of cowardice, and you’ll find that they also have learned some basic abilities so that they can fight alongside you – but they’ll also disappear after a battle – even Chocobos need rest you know. It’ll take a period of time before you can conjure them again.

559,,200,It’s Time to Move On,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"Everything that lives will eventually die, and the dead should peacefully move on to the Farplane beyond – at least, that’s what the clerics of Yevon would preach. Some things linger on, unwilling to let go of the life that was once theirs. Unwilling to move on, unable to turn back, they only cause misery for themselves and everyone around them.

Should you be able to convince them that they should be at ease – it may be possible for them to move on, even without a proper Sending it will be possible to send the dead to the next realm. Not only does you presence calm the spirits of the dead – your ability to convince them to move on with extend to other dead spirits as well."
560,,200,Bond of Brotherhood ,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"You may very well be only one of many Guardians defending your Summoner – and frankly, the more Guardians there are on the task, the less likely anyone is to fall. There’s safety in numbers after all. Travelling with a group of Guardians, it’s only natural that you’ll come to bond with them.

The longer you fight alongside the same companions, the more in sync you will be with those companions. Alongside these trusted companions, you’ll find that their abilities seem to boost yours, increasing the effects of your abilities by a small bit for each companion nearby."
561,,200,Farplane Contact ,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"There’s no Guado who doesn’t know about the Farplane – it’s hard to miss its existence, especially when the doorway to the Farplane rests within Guadosalam itself. Considering all the people who flock to Guadosalam in hopes of seeing the dead...well you’ll be pretty well versed in the workings of the Farplane, enough to perform a rudimentary beckoning of your own.

Though the spirits you can call forth can’t interact with the living, they’ll still linger around, capable of being seen for a day or so before they naturally dissipate. Of course, their spirit has to exist somewhere for this to happen – whether the world you’re in has an analogue to the Farplane or their soul rests elsewhere. The spirit will merely linger in place, sometimes performing some mundane actions."
562,,200,Desert Barrier,Final Fantasy X,Control ,"A denizen of the desert sands, the Cactuar Tribe has always kept their abode hidden behind a veil of sand – for good reason as well...there are creatures lurking within the sands that would prey upon the cactuars if the barrier were to ever fall. You won’t be generating a towering sandstorm anytime soon, but you can generate sand at will – and manipulate it to obscure yourself in a pinch. Your companions, if they aren’t cactuar, might not appreciate this though – sand gets inside the kinks of your armour and generally remains rather irritating. The barrier might help obscure them as well...but they might not appreciate it as much as you."
563,,200,Spiritualist ,Gods of Blood and Powder,Control ,"You are able to see and communicate with the souls of the dead. To a degree you can also control and goad them to talk with you although they mostly will remain independent. Powerful blood sorcery, such as god stones and bone-eyes on Ka-Poels level will scare the souls away or drive them insane, but otherwise you will find ample amounts of the dead everywhere. While the dead won’t be much of an active help to you in terms of fighting power you will get an incredible amount of information from them as they can travel anywhere and everywhere without impunity and ancient spirits may hold valuable secrets. The perfect reconnaissance tool."
564,,200,Plague Doctor’s Mask ,Chainsaw Man,Control ,A virtually indestructible mask that cannot be taken off by anyone but the one who put it on. Upon putting it on someone’s head you can set a limit on each of their abilities or their overall power level down between 1-100%. If you force it on someone without their consent you can only lower their abilities by a quarter. It also disguises your inhuman nature.
565,,200,Noncon Contract,Chainsaw Man,Control ,"Once per Jump you can show someone this adaptive contract with a proposal for something they have and you want. They are forced to assign you a job in exchange. The more willful and powerful they are in comparison to you, the more valuable and difficult the job can be in relation to what you request. Upon completing the job they will be forced to honor your reward and everyone will accept this exchange. You cannot use this to ask for things that are impossible to give and everything you ask for must be under a single general theme. How much they personally value what you request also impacts the difficulty of the task."
566,,200,Contract Creation,Chainsaw Man,Control ,"When you use the word “contract”, it really means something. Should you propose a contract to a willing participant (even fiends) and have them agree, you both will be able to offer things you otherwise couldn’t (uses of an ability, your lifespan, whatever). Failing to deliver on your end of the contract results in death. You aren’t able to force others to accept your contract against their will but it can be enforced even if mind control or other means are used for their acceptance. Both parties are allowed to offer up things that those under their rule possess as well. Both parties have to offer something, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be a fair deal.

That Magus is able to command these familiars with absolute obedience, as well as share any of their senses at will. You've come into the possession of particularly high quality familiars made by the Einzbern clan. Whilst all are based on mundane animals in the real world, each one is enhanced to the point of being able to easily tear through whole packs of their mundane brethren and can share their senses with their master even over a hundred kilometres of distance between them. Several options are available in terms of what familiars can be taken. The first, several dozen creatures the size of small birds of mice can be taken. Second are a half dozen to dozen animals ranging from those the size of a dog to lion sized familiars. Finally, one can choose to be given a single very large familiar, such as a draft horse or elephant. This option can be taken multiple times to stack or choose different sorts each time.

Unlike most Magi, who need to use a magic spell or mystic eye of some sort, you are capable of hypnotizing other people with just physical movements, though it is not particularly difficult to break this mundane effect. However, when you actually use the same methods other Magi use, your mind controlling magics are far more powerful. You can control more at once for longer and have it be harder to break out of then any of your peers could, with only those who specialise exclusively in the mental arts being able to match your innate talent.

An Ursa may not cause much but a beast like Monstra? Relish in their despair. Of course this Perk is toggleable in case you had enough of their horror."

The Moogle doesn't seem very interested in hearing what you have to say, but it does drop down a portable tent.

This tent can be used once to heal wounds, though the more severe the wound is, the longer the recuperation time.

Be careful, because the tent itself doesn't help in preventing enemies from attacking you. I wouldn't abuse this flute too much, as the Moogle can get a bit erratic, and likes to wave his knife around in a dangerous manner."

Man and beast are affected alike, and in the face of the Mist many succumb to more base desires – a hunger for violence. Your manipulation technique of Mist has grown a little stronger, and perhaps owing to its purpose, you can now afflict those exposed with a maddening rage.

In areas where there is a high concentration of Mist, it is possible for the affected to start seeing illusions and shadows of their most hated foe."

As the souls of the dead went through the cycles of reincarnation, the Eidolons grew stronger, taking in the memories of the deceased. But with Gaia’s balance disturbed, many of these dead now fail to move on, and their memories linger...

You can see these memories, scattered visions, usually a dying individual’s last moments. With enough exposure, you could share your visions with others. You can now summon all the Eidolon that a summoner would naturally be capable of summoning save Alexander and Ark.

Be wary however, that this makes your summoned creatures susceptible to minor cosmetic shifts based on memories. Nothing too significant, but they may shift in appearance in slight, barely noticeable ways such as a different skin shading color."

577,,200,Guardian Force ,Final Fantasy VIII,Control ,"Guardian Forces, or GF, are sapient energy fields taking almost any shape they desire. Unbound GF are most often found in hidden wilderness locations surging with power, where they typically refuse to bow to anyone who cannot best them in a battle. However, GF that have accepted a person will become Junctionable, where they fuse with the person and take up residence within their mind. In this situation, GF can communicate with this person as often as they wish, but may only manifest outside of them for a limited amount of time. To do so in a way that effects the outside world, they must charge for a brief time and then be summoned, at which point they'll unleash an attack, healing, or supportive spell based around their personality and powers. Outside of this and those mentioned in the Junction System perk, GF also possess unique abilities, such as teaching their users how to convert items into useful resources, prevent status effects, or even reflect damage.

For a GF, its power grows the more its summoned, along with its Compatibility with its summoner. Compatibility is basically a relationship score between the GF and its user, and many GF are jealous beings who actually lose Compatibility whenever the user summons a different GF. All of this power comes with the rather nasty side effect of slowly eroding your memories, however. When purchasing a GF, choose their element, appearance and summon ability at will, though none of them will out power the ultimate GF Eden solely through this ability. Most of the time, GF are based on a FF creature or a mythological being or figure, but this is not always the case. You can instead import someone, but only similar spirits can be imported as Guardian Forces.

A single individual they trust above all others, who serves as their friend, guardian, companion, and often their lover as well. Even in a world that hates and fears the Sorceresses, this position is frequently romanticized in books and movies, and more than a few fantasize about receiving this position. For you, your Knight may be a new or imported companion who will receive any other background for free (treating Drop-in like the Freedom Fighters above), along with the discounts and free perks associated with it. As a new companion, your Knight is extremely loyal and devoted to you, while imported companions remain themselves, though it's important to note that a Knight must be someone with a close bond. To top it off, the Knight will have 800cp of their own to spend on anything above. You cannot purchase this more than once."

Also, people who were influenced by the Pianist generally have a better opinion of you, regardless of what they think of him. And if need be, you can force the music into the minds of those who weren’t blessed by his song, causing the “victim” to be paralyzed by the sheer glory of his sound, possibly causing permanent changes in their mind, or simply wreaking havoc on them via internal bleeding.

Dan was a brigadier in the Blade Bullet Brigade, while Aohime has an experimental attempt at creating the Kokushinbaku. Dan saved Aohime, and her mental conditioning caused her to imprint upon him as her father. She gave Dan a reason to live beyond simply fighting an endless, pointless war, and he sacrificed his life to ensure she was free from exploitation from both sides of the conflict. But now, instead of dying at some point in the past, they have somehow made it here, with you, in the present. The timeline hasn’t changed at all as a result of this."

Dragons are the most powerful summons, and a normal spellcaster could expect to spend months empowering a bullet before they manage to summon a flawed dragon; you, on the other hand, can make one as quickly as you can use any other sort of magic bullet. With this, you could lay siege to an entire city on your own.

This level of power also increases the potency of the other spells you use; for instance, the Sakura Body Bullet can now give instant healing from anything short of death, while the Hulk Bullet would give you the strength to lift mountaintops.

588,,200,Pokémon Team,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control ,"You have a team of 3 Pokémon at your disposal. They are yet to fully bond with you, but they have been trained to be used in battle, and are absolutely loyal to you. 

You may choose any 3 Pokémon, so long as your team meets the following conditions:
• All of the Pokémon are either Starter Pokémon, or an evolved form of a Starter Pokémon. They need not be from the same region.
• You have 1 Grass-type Pokémon, 1 Fire-type Pokémon, and 1 Water-type Pokémon.
• You have 1 Basic (not evolved at all) Pokémon, 1 Stage 1 (evolved one time) Pokémon, and 1 Stage 2 (fully evolved) Pokémon.

Each Pokémon comes in a standard Poké Ball. You may choose to have a Shiny or otherwise differently-coloured version of any of the Pokémon you have selected for your team. Their gender is likewise up to you. The Pokémon team has a shared version of Percentage System, meaning any damage they take whilst the percentage system is on will be split evenly across all three of them. Each Pokémon has a shared version of the base level Trophy Form perk, meaning if one of them is defeated they are all forced into individual Trophy Form states. If one of them is freed from this state, they all are.

The Pokémon in this team cannot be evolved during this jump. Post-jump, this restriction is removed. They do not take up an active companion slot, unless they are imported as a companion in a future jump. Additionally, should you decide to import them as a companion in a future jump, you may import them into the same companion slot, dividing the power of any perks they purchase between them, lowering the potency of the perks somewhat.

Should you purchase Pokémon Trainer as a canon companion, you may elect instead to receive only Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard, and have them gain the advantages of this companion option. (You must purchase this option as well as Canon Fighter in order to do this.)

You may only purchase this companion once."
589,,200,Pikmin Squad,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control ,"Note: Whilst Pikmin in their native setting are extremely small, these ones have been scaled up in size quite a bit, allowing them to be used properly by an ordinary human.

You have a horde of Pikmin available to you when you need them, who are willing to join your journey as followers. They will obey any order you give them, provided they are capable of it, even if it would lead to their death. In order to get all Pikmin, simply attempt to pull one from the ground, and you will randomly receive one of the following:

• Red Pikmin: These guys have a high attack power relative to other Pikmin. They are immune to the effects of fire. Red Pikmin are more likely to appear from cloth and sand floors, are less likely to appear from snow and ice floors, and cannot be plucked from water at all.
• Yellow Pikmin: These guys have a high range of attack relative to other Pikmin, and travel in a slight arc when thrown. They have electric properties in their attacks, and they are immune to electricity. They are more likely to appear from metallic and sandy floors, and are less likely to appear from snow and ice floors.
• Blue Pikmin: These guys deliver a high level of knockback when thrown, and are slightly more durable relative to other Pikmin. They are the only type of Pikmin which can enter water without dying. They are more likely to appear from water-based surfaces (snow, ice, clouds, and water itself), and are less likely appear from sandy or brick floors.
• White Pikmin: These guys are light and quick relative to other Pikmin. They deal darkness damage when thrown. White Pikmin are fairly rare, appearing half as often as the above three types, though they are slightly more common from snow or cloud floors.
• Purple Pikmin: These guys are heavy relative to other Pikmin, and do no fly as far when thrown. They also tend to slam into opponents instead of latching on to them. They have high attack power. They are the rarest of the types, appearing about 40% as often as Red, Yellow, or Blue.

You may only have a total of six of the above out at once (combined, not for each type); attempting to gather another beyond that will fail. You can throw these Pikmin at your enemies, and they can also quickly form a chain to help you reach ledges. Should any of your Pikmin die, you may retrieve replacements from the ground."
590,,200,Team Trainer,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control ,"You have developed a talent for commanding others on the battlefield. You are able to give clear, effective orders to your subordinates, and make yourself easily understood. You are able to make yourself heard in both loud and stressful situations.

By whistling, you may recall minions to your position, provided they are within your field of vision. The more minions you are targeting with this recall ability, the less effective it becomes."
591,,200,Senti-Son,Miraculous Ladybug,Control ,"The power of the Peacock Miraculous creates life from emotion. Usually the mind of the Sentimonster created from this magic is animalistic or robotic. If the Sentimonster is created in the form of a person, it will be appropriately smarter (although no more conscious than before). However, something truly special happens when... okay this is a little weird but you can actually create a Sentimonster fetus inside of a person’s womb and it will grow up to be an actual sentient conscious person, half their mother and half the desires of the “father” (the Peacock’s user). What this does in practicality is create a person who is physically very similar to their mother, is slightly resistant to Cataclysms, and who technically counts as a Sentimonster. This means they have a controlling object (an object which is connected to their life force, and whose holder can use it to command them) and that they can be released from their existence by someone wielding the Peacock Miraculous with a snap of their fingers.

Anyways, you get one of those! You can choose many physical and mental traits about them now but they will be 13 years old and cannot be too far from your own personality and body (so they can have different eyes and sex but will still be very recognisably like you). They get 1200 CP to spend in this Jump. However, they do not get an Origin, they cannot buy Items (besides Miraculous), they cannot get Companions (obviously), nor can they buy Android or Kwami Form. The trick is they can also spend their CP on inheriting any Perks/Powers you’ve purchased in the past (undiscounted even if you got them discounted when you were in the Jump). Free Perks/Powers cost 25 CP to inherit. They can’t inherit alt!forms. They can take Drawbacks like any other Companion and use the CP in this Jump or to inherit more. You choose what their controlling object is, either a mundane object or something you import. The controlling object just has to be small enough to hold and (unless you import the item) it cannot be dangerous."
592,,200,Kwami Mastery ,Miraculous Ladybug,Control ,"You know the ins and outs of Kwami. You’ll get along with your Kwami a lot better if you’re friendly with them. This also increases your ability to command them, forcing them to do as you say in the way that you intend rather than being able to wiggle out of it based on your wording. Additionally, if you took Kwami Form, your Kwami form’s power is slightly more controlled.

Requires Kawami Form or a Miraculous to Purchase"
593,,200,Windows,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"For a country as large as Japan, there are far too few sorcerers to investigate and keep an eye out for cursed spirits on their own. That’s why you have this small network to assist you. Referred to as Windows by jujutsu society, they’re all regular people for the most part, with their own mundane lives and jobs – the only thing that sets them apart from the rest is their ability to see curses and cursed energy. They’re not strong enough to use jujutsu, so they generally act as lookouts rather than participating in direct combat.

You may choose where the members of your network are generally located, though they’ll struggle to effectively keep tabs on an area larger than a mid-sized city. While most of the time they’ll just report any dangerous cursed spirits or unusual residuals of cursed energy they come across in their lives to you, you’re also free to command them to search for something in particular, which they’ll do with surprising efficiency. It’d take them just a few days to locate the exact hideout of a cursed spirit committing murders within a certain city, for example. Just don’t expect them to help when it comes to actually exorcising it.

Your Windows will be able to see and keep a watch on supernatural threats in other Jumps, too."
594,,200,Hidden Inventory,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"A weak cursed spirit bound to you, in the form of a purple, worm-like creature long enough to coil around your body with a hideous, vaguely human-like face. It doesn’t have any offensive ability whatsoever, but is instead used to store objects. The interior of its body is far larger than its size might imply: blades, tools, and swarms of small cursed spirits can be stored inside of it, seemingly without limit. Just by pushing it into its mouth, anything that fits could be stowed inside of it, and anything inside can be withdrawn just by reaching inside and thinking of what you want.

Interestingly, the cursed spirit is also capable of swallowing its own body, allowing it to shrink down small enough to be effortlessly swallowed by someone else. Anything stored inside of its body is undetectable from the outside, and nothing can subvert its allegiance to you."
595,,200,Love Rendezvous,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"By making contact with a creature or object’s cursed energy, you’re able to mark them with one of the five stars of the Southern Cross constellation: Imai, Acrux, Mimosa, Ginan, and Gacrux. A small star symbol, as well as the name of the star, will appear somewhere on their body. Each person’s cursed energy can only have one star, but multiple different people or objects can be marked with the same one.

Anyone marked with a star has to follow a certain sequence in order to get closer to someone with a different one, that being the distance of each star from Earth, from nearest to furthest. For example, in order for someone marked with Imai to approach Gacrux, they must first go to Acrux and touch it, then Mimosa, then Ginan, then they could finally head towards Gacrux. Failure to follow this order will leave them unable to get closer to their target. Using the prior example, someone marked with Imai who tried to directly approach Gacrux would simply find themselves running on the spot, no matter how much effort they put in or how fast they move.

On the other hand, anything marked with the same star will be drawn towards each other, with the marked individual with the greatest cursed energy output being the one everything else is pulled towards. By transferring small amounts of your own cursed energy into objects and then marking them, you can even cause them to fly towards others, essentially turning anything around you into a homing projectile. It’s also possible to mark yourself with a star, though you must remove it before marking anything else. This technique’s range is roughly a few dozen metres, beyond which its effects do not apply."
596,,200,Séance Technique ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"You’re capable of summoning the information of a dead person’s body, allowing it to inhabit either yourself or someone else. To do this, you must perform a long incantation, then whoever wishes to benefit from this technique must swallow a part of the dead person’s body. By doing so, their body rapidly transforms into that of the deceased, gaining access to any physical or biological abilities they had in life, though they don’t gain the dead person’s memories or supernatural abilities, such as their cursed technique. You can end this technique early when used on yourself, though as the transformation is maintained by the user’s cursed energy it will naturally revert once they run out.

It’s also possible to use this to summon the dead person’s soul information too, allowing the user to access the memories and potentially special abilities of the deceased. However, doing so runs the heavy risk of the summoned soul’s information overwriting the user’s own, effectively killing themselves."
597,,200,Puppet Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"You’re capable of remotely controlling cursed corpses out to a distance of a few hundred metres. So long as they’re not already animated by someone else’s cursed energy, you can use yours to puppet it with great proficiency. Not only can you share the senses of any cursed corpse you control with this technique, you can use it just as easily as if it were your own body, naturally wielding any abilities they might possess as well as using your own powers and techniques through it. You’re even capable of controlling more than one cursed corpse with this at once, though naturally the more you have active the harder it will be to use them to their full efficiency. Of course, you will need to get some cursed corpses first to use this – perhaps you could learn to make them yourself?"
598,,200,Keeping Promises,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"Binding vows were already brought up previously, but it’s worth noting that placing restrictions upon oneself is only part of what’s possible with this aspect of jujutsu. No, binding vows can also be made with others. This often takes the form of a contract between two parties, where both agree to a certain set of conditions, most often certain actions they must do for the other party. Unlike in a self-imposed vow, however, the penalty for breaking a binding vow with another is much more harsh. Though the exact details of what will transpire will vary from vow to vow, the punishment is severe enough that even the most powerful of sorcerers and cursed spirits do their utmost to honour such agreements.

Usually, these require that both parties are capable of manipulating cursed energy. You, however, can apply the principles of a binding vow with anyone, regardless of whether they can use jujutsu or not. When you make an agreement with someone or a group of people, you can choose to make the terms nigh-inviolable as described above. All parties involved will understand that breaking the terms of the contract will result in them suffering severe penalties, far worse than any gain they might have received from not honouring the vow. Naturally, this isn’t a one-sided thing: you, too, will face consequences for breaking such a deal. However, it’s important to note that abusing loopholes in the vow’s wording doesn’t count as breaking it. If you agree to kill someone, for example, killing them and then immediately reviving them afterwards is completely acceptable unless explicitly agreed otherwise."
599,,200,Curse Whisperer,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control ,"Cursed spirits are beings that are, by their very nature, malevolent. It wouldn’t be entirely incorrect to say their raison d’être is to cause suffering to humanity. Yet it’s not impossible to get along with them. Despite being a human sorcerer, Kenjaku was more than capable of allying with the likes of Jogo and Hanami, both of whom desired nothing less than the eradication of humans.

Now, for some reason, you too have found that cursed spirits are strangely fond of you... by the standards of curses, at least. At the very worst, they’ll be indifferent to you – so long as you don’t bother them or get in their way, you’ll find your life blessedly free from their interference. Weak curses won’t haunt you, and the stronger ones won’t try to kill you in some indiscriminate rampage. Those that have a reason to target you, however, won’t be dissuaded by this What’s more, if you put some effort in and make an appealing enough offer to them, they may even be willing to work alongside you, which is much more than can be said for most people. 

This perk works on any similar evil beings in future worlds."
600,,200,Summon Materia,Final Fantasy VII,Control ,"Alright, we're finally on the meat and potatoes of this world. Or in this case, glowing magical marbles. Materia are crystallized energy from the Lifestream that others can use to unlock special abilities or wield magic. Most Materia only requires a mental act of will from the user, and while the most common and convenient method to wield them is by attaching them to weapons or equipment in little 'slots', simply touching one or having it on person when willing it to activate is sufficient. Most Materia start with a basic ability or a limited-time use, but may unlock more uses or more powerful versions of a given ability as they grow in power. After enough use and experience, a Materia will be 'born' and reach the peak of its power, which has different effects for each type.

Materia purchased here starts at its base level. As for what each one does and how much they cost…

Finally, if raw power is what you're looking for, you pick these crimson Materia. Rare and often
extremely destructive, these Summon Materia call on powerful creatures to attack your enemies. Just starting out, these Summons will unleash a single attack on your foes and then be unusable until the battle ends, but as the Materia grows you will be able to use them more often or even summon the creatures into real space to rampage at your command. The more devastating attacks that would normally wipe entire cities or countries off the map can instead draw your enemies into an alternate dimension until the attack has concluded, ensuring they and nothing else take damage from it.

A list of canonical Materia and their effects can be found in Notes.

Much like how SOLDIER is enhanced by Jenova cells, they will become stronger, faster, and tougher than most members of their species, their base abilities given a boost by your strange DNA. This is a one-time deal and comes with a noticeable but minor mutation that influences their appearance, such as a marking on the skin or glowing eyes.

Anyway, a creature of the Void has bonded with you, covering your body in a sturdy, organic-looking second skin. On top of that, the Voidling is still alive and able to use Void magic, even if it will only do so to your command.

You can declare a 1v1 duel in the middle of the most chaotic battle imaginable, and not only the challenged will hear it and accept it, other fighters will conveniently give you enough space to fight your duel without interference."

May import a companion into this role."

This poor 21st century gal has been swept away from her Fuyuki mansion and dropped into the body of a giant monster! That the monster looks like a skyscraper sized version of herself and she gets bright red whenever you call it a monster form doesn’t change that it’s definitely a giant monster girl.

A spare temple body for the Primordial Goddess has ended up as the vessel for one Tohsaka Rin’s soul, leaving her terribly confused. One can only hope she won’t realise the power she has at her disposal now and become some sort of mad gem bomber. You were the first living thing Giant Monster Rin encountered and she’s latched onto you pretty hard, at least until she gets a grip on her situation. "
610,,200,Command Seals,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control ,"A sign of the Master Class Servant, long thought a myth. Three red seals appear on one of your hands, each one of great power over Servants or just any being you can see. As long as the Servant accepts the use of the Seal or has chosen you as their leader, the seal can project it’s power over them. Even the most basic uses are powerful, an irresistible command or an order that empowers a Servant well beyond their normal limits for a time. The more specific and narrow the command, the greater the strength imbued onto the Servant. The Seals could even be used to teleport an ally of yours from a distant world to your location in an emergency. Each of the three sigils replenish a day after being used, making a limited but potent supply."

Teri-Teri (Self-Proclaimed). Caution: Do not treat as a child or a granny, always have candy on hand. Only give her an allowance, not your wallet or credit card.

Himeko – Captain of the Hyperion, well past her Honkai threshold, an incredible teacher, the ever-single commander.

Fu Hua – A survivor from the last Era, a master of Qi with a plethora of skills, a bit distant, class representative for St. Freya’s students.

Sakura – Long dead, she gave up a ghostly existence to save Theresa originally. Once the host of a previous-era Herrscher.

Kallen – Executed centuries ago by Shicksal. Managed to suppress a Herrscher solo. Otto desires her, no matter the cost.

Tesla – The self-styled greatest inventor in human history. She may be older than she looks. but she certainly acts fittingly.

Much like a certain Guardian, The Draupnir Spear can take a more compact form that flies through the air at your command, specifically your whistle. Which can control the flight of the Draupnir Spear to make complex maneuvers and pierce through even the toughest creatures with ease, even creating swarms of these flying spears that you can control simultaneously and all can explode at your discretion. If you cannot whistle, purchasing Wind Song gives you a basic proficiency with Whistling that you can improve with practice.

With this perk you will find that you have a rough idea as to how to pilot or drive any vehicle you come across. This wouldn’t allow you to pull off fancy tricks or emergency maneuvers, but it would allow you to figure out how to get things moving and how to stop at the very least. The more complicated the vehicle the more basic the information you will receive."
616,,200,Pendant of the Unborn,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control ,"Some priestly tools are quite disturbing, in form if not function. Whether you've made this or took it from someone, you find yourself in the possession of a Kumanthong, the spirit of a stillborn fetus bound into an amulet as a servile familiar. They'll follow your orders quite diligently, and while they're kinda weak, they're very reliable when it comes to small matters. They aren't particularly lucid for obvious reasons, so don't expect a conversation partner, but the magic binding them to the amulet lets them perform any duties you give it regardless. Whether you'll use it as a messenger, get it to fetch you things, or simply give it a chance at life through other methods, you are free to do as you will with this pendant."
617,,200,Shaped Births ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control ,"Birth isn’t an untouchable process. With the right know-how, one can take a spirit and make it be reborn in the way you want. And it seems that you have learned how to do this. As an important note, you cannot use this on living people. Only the dead or disembodied spirits can be manipulated in this way, typically wandering ghosts. You can determine the appearance of the new incarnation, with some limits given the appearances of the parents, which would let you, say, make a spirit be reborn as ugly and bald from childhood. It can be useful for giving some ghost friends a new body, in case you have any.

It is worth noting that the temperament of the spirit themselves also influences the effect the pregnancy will have on the mother. Those who are generally benevolent and compassionate will see their mother be in great health to the point they seem almost radiant, and a selfish and malicious spirit will lead the mother into things like endless hunger and general lack of endurance. As a side note, you can only shove a spirit or ghost into an early pregnancy. Past the first few months the fetus will likely already have a soul of its own and thus no ‘space’ for the spirit to go into. So, what are you going to do with this? Sell your services to the lingering dead perhaps?"

They may only have animal intelligence, but they instinctively fear and respect you enough to respond like trained soldiers when you will for them to cull foes you can’t be bothered to face yourself. Perhaps with great patience, they could be tamed into friendlier faces for strangers. In the meantime, though they are mundane animals they will face down even supernatural foes with you at their side."

631,,200,Summoner (Caller+Black Mage) ,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"If the Caller's ability manifests itself in being able to draw Eidolons from the Feymarch to assist them for a moment, the Summoner takes that one step further. As a Summoner, you'll find that your magical power increases roughly twice as fast as it would otherwise, and you gain the ability of True Summon. This allows you to summon an Eidolon for an extended period of time, aiding you in any form. You may only True Summon one Eidolon at a time, but may Summon others normally while it is active. If your True Summon is defeated in combat, it will simply return to the Feymarch, needing a full day to recover before it can be called upon again. In future jumps, this can also call companions that you've not brought with you for up to an hour."
632,,200,Squadron,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"As a soldier, you’ve become close with several others during your time. Three other soldiers, no matter their specialization, will assist you.

633,,200,Psychic,Final Fantasy IV,Control ,"Similar to magic, but manifesting in different ways, psychic energy grants you the ability to speak telepathically over long distances, create psychic shields, but most importantly here, to mentally dominate those mentally weaker than yourself. With enough time and practice, your power can grow enough to allow your puppets to dominate others in the same way. Your other powers will increase as well, but you’ll find that those involving Telepathy and Domination grow the quickest."
634,,200,Excalibur Ruler,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Said to be the strongest of the seven Excaliburs, this blade is the embodiment of ‘ruling’ over both sentient beings and objects, able to subjugate and control both according to the user’s will. Stubborn or strong-willed beings will need to be weakened considerably before they can be bent to the user’s will, but if they can establish and maintain control, this subjugation may well become permanent as long as the control is kept in place for a long enough time."
635,,200,Truth May Vary ,HighSchool DxD,Control ,"Not everyone can always win. There will be times when one needs to relent, when there’s a failure, or when the enemy is simply stronger. Times when your army is crippled, your allies begin to consider jumping sides, enemies are at the doorstep, and the fight has taken its toll on you. Those times that others would consider a defeat are merely an opportunity for you to shine through. There’s a talent inside of you for minimizing damage to your people, to learn from the mistakes, and to force the reverse situation onto the enemy groups. The perfect talent for someone taking charge of a whole new faction. Bluff your way out of total annihilation with just a few casualties, maneuver troops from an encirclement while only losing time, learn how to never fall for such traps ever again, and the exact way to enact such deadlocks on forthcoming opponents."

That was how he should decide where to build the city he was thinking of founding. Halfway through the chase, he stopped to get a drink because cow-chasing was thirsty work, and he was attacked by a dragon. When the dragon was slain, Athena appeared and told Cadmus to sow its teeth into the ground like wheat, and they sprouted into a field of armed warriors. (Yes, really.)

You have a bag holding five of these teeth, and they replenish each dawn if planted. When pressed into the ground, they grow into soldiers with equipment most common to infantrymen of the current world, defaulting to humans with bronze arms and armor. The soldiers are highly skilled, very tough, and completely loyal, but they can be rather gullible at times."

If no Servants are involved, then the Mage’s Association gets to shine. With this purchase you have the chance to witness that with your own eyes, as you’ve become the commander of a large squad of elite combatants, whether Magi, Church Executors, or some other type of troop. They number about 50 and are well trained and experienced to take down whatever targets you point them at. Of course, they’re still regular humans, so even a single normal Servant would wipe the floor with them, but perhaps you’ll find ways to enhance their abilities? Perhaps you’ll find a way to equip all of them with Noble Phantasms of their own? Whatever the case, they might not be very useful in the Great Holy Grail War to come, unless you manage to separate Servants from their Masters."

Aphrodite was so smitten with him that she began to neglect her duties. A conspiracy was hatched and through it his death achieved, though afterwards no Olympian could tell exactly who’s hand was at fault. While he should have been granted the position as a Warrior forHades, the fact that Persephone herself advocated for his appointment gave the God of the Underworld pangs of jealousy. Instead, Adonis now whiles away the years in Elysium, utterly bored with endless combat and pining for the goddess that he most eagerly wishes to be with again."

While the exact details will be left up to you, this will be a heroic version of yourself withmany of your same personality traits and habits.Naturally, they are going to be a little more boisterous and energetic than you yourself may be.

While this may sometimes require patience on your part, you will never fail to catch something worth the wait."
647,,200,Wind Drake Egg ,Final Fantasy II,Control ,"The egg of a Wind Drake. It requires incubation in order to hatch, but once it does, it creates a fiercely loyal Dragon that is built for flight and speed, but still has powerful fiery breath of its larger cousins."
648,,200,Speak with Animals,Final Fantasy II,Control ,"Somewhere along the way, you’ve taken some time to sit down and learn the animal language. Others aren’t exactly sure how you managed it, and honestly, neither are you. But all the same, you can speak and converse with all mundane animals, including Chocobos. They aren’t always necessarily intelligent, but they can still provide a great deal of information, or perhaps get it for you with the right motivation."
649,,200,A Killer Inside of Me         ,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"Either due to the work of an Ancestor of yours, or a freakish accident, a strange creature has made its nest on you. Whether it is inside of magic circuits, your Saint Graph or equivalent, they have become a part of you, and they have the New Primate purchase. Normally, their mission would have been to replace you, but it seems that they have grown incredibly attached to you, refusing to follow that command. Thus, they have become content with being able to converse with you, aid you with your magecraft using their own abilities and just see the world through your eyes, at least until the time of your death.

They don’t count as a companion but will follow you into other worlds as a Follower, as they are a part of you,as they are a part of you. They will live as long as you do, and then rise up from your corpse in your death, but you may import them to bring them outside early on. Once they manifest outside of you, they will have all the abilities that you may have gained here that may be tied to your magic circuits, all the spells you have learnt, as well as generally anything that may have been tied to your soul or body at that time. They will still be quite fond and attached to you, but they will start to become more of their own person from that point on."
650,,200,Watcher,Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"Looks like you have been tangled up with a quite mysterious entity. You have become the Master of Watcher, a phenomenon that will manifest over the area you are now in. As a Servant, it seems to lack any kind of fighting potential, and its origins seem to be related to divinity.

What does this contract gives you? First, while you are in the same area as Watcher currently is, it can manifest several ‘Shadows’, degraded summonings of Heroic Spirits that serve to communicate with Watcher. These Shadows can only be seen by Watcher’s master, and leave no magical trace for others to sense. They can’t interact with the world, but they can provide advice when prompted, and will also relay Watcher’s warnings when its Master is in danger. As degraded versions of Heroic Spirits, they still retain some of their wisdom that can be used by their Master.

Watcher itself has a limited form of omniscience in the area that it is summoned: it can know of everything that has happened since it was summoned, and even can make educated guesses based on the things that it has seen to piece up the missing information. However, this ability is not unlimited, as it can only reach an area a bit larger than the city of Snowfield, and truly powerful efforts, such as that of those with a powerful divinity, may conceal others from its sight.

However, its greatest strength lies in its ability to manipulate luck. Especially Master’s luck. By doing so, Watcher creates arduous trials in which it quickly transforms its Master into someone worthy of being a Heroic Spirit of the Knight Classes. These are high risk situations, but also provide a great growth, and even bring the Master close to the allies and tools needed to reach such heights. Of course, it is possible to refuse Watcher’s call to action, and the Shadows will even warn the Master about Watcher’s trials. Eventually, its goal is to manifest fully into the world, and for it to be killed by its Master.

In future jumps, you may also have Watcher manifest and guide you in a similar manner, allowing it to place trials on you until you reach a similar legendary status as the Heroic Spirits of this world. Neither Watcher nor the Shadows it summons count as active companions, unless you decide to import them."
651,,200,"A Human, Not A Mage",Fate/Strange Fake,Control ,"There is something truly unique about the way you carry yourself. Something about your way of being that truly resonates with the heart of the inhuman.

In fact if you can’t walk on your own feet, this Stead may support you in the fight. Like the Legendary Red Hare this animal is capable of riding 1,000 miles within a day and is unyieldingly loyal to you. It will follow you even into the afterlife and into death and is tough enough to endure the result of Thor and Lu Bus attacks meeting. You may Import a Animal you have into this."

A little Bird might tell you that the love of your live is in danger for example.
654,,200,The Four Confused Crystal Hunters,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"These guys aren't entirely sure how they got here. According to them their leader stepped onto some stairs weirdly and they all fell into a strange world that was like a fractal of the world they recognized. After significant time traveling they ended up on the wrong side of the barrier of this world.

They seem to have been traveling for quite some time together fighting monsters, if their skill is
anything to go by. Each of them has their own specialization and they work to complement each other as much as they can. While the concept of a larger group is foreign to them, they are amicable to joining more people.

Their leader is Setro, they wear red armor with gold trim. They are quite courageous and chivalrous; it is rare when they will turn away from someone who asks for aid. In combat they wield a powerful gold-hued sword and possess some mastery of Holy Arts.

Their other front line fighter of the group is Zauber. They go into combat lightly armored with a green tunic. Color aside, their outfit is not unlike the ninja you are familiar with. They are quite pragmatic, preferring realism over idealism. While this causes some friction with Setro, they have been together long enough that their conflicts don't last very long. Their preferred weapon is a katana that provides a shield similar to what the Holy Arts can provide to its wielder, as well as some mastery of the Elemental Powers of Flame, Lightning, and Frost.

In the rear, Teol wears a concealing blue robe and yellow witch's hat. It is hard to see their face as it seems to be perpetually in an impenetrable shadow. Instead of using their golden staff in combat directly, they use their impressive control of the Elemental Powers to face their foes. They are a quiet, kind sort, and if you can get them talking you will find that they possess a keen intellect.

Finally, Flora is a kindhearted soul that takes care of the others. Though if you pay close attention they can be heard muttering under their breath quite a bit when frustrated. They wear a large hooded white robe with red trim. In most cases, they, similar to Teol, use a staff but mostly rely on arcane powers in combat. Instead of relying on the Elemental Powers, they use the Holy Arts, and are notably skilled in healing using them. There is the occasion when they have found a need to relieve stress, and they will switch to a large warhammer made of a strange purple metal. The hammer itself seems to house a powerful Lightning Spirit that Flora will occasionally call upon to summon bolts of lightning on their foes."
655,,200,Ghost Friend,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control ,"The remaining remnants of someone recently deceased, in surprisingly good spirits. Friendly and well meaning, the ghost has decided to follow you and be your friend.

As a ghost they have a unique relationship with ambient arcane energies. As they interact with and pass through those energies, they gather in a swirling nexus above their head and will tinge their ghost orbs. Despite their insistence this doesn't make them a wizard though, the shape of the nexus notwithstanding."

As a spirit, manifesting all the time is beyond their capability, so they will frequently take breaks to recuperate.

Outside of combat, they are quite willing to scout for you, and to be a companion. They are also fully capable of leaving should the relationship break.

Should this connection be lost or the spirit slain, you will find that you can form a new bond with a willing similar spirit.

Mercifully you were smart or fortunate enough to return his nod, and are therefore welcome to his monastic retreat where he trains, contemplates the secrets of the universe and secretly wishes for a student worthy enough to withstand his gruelling training.

Master Baahk Meih is one of the greatest master Eldritches to still draw breath, boasting many Invocations of all initiation degrees, and has completely mastered several schools of low magic solely to humiliate their masters by defeating them with their own art. No weakling in a spat, he is also a True Strife grandmaster of the Dying Hour, Broken Earth and Falling Sky styles-and is fond of catching those who would attempt sneak attacks on him by surprise, only to casually rip out a piece of the heavens and pin them to the earth with it. His focus on both martial arts and mysticism grant him effective command of the Words Alacrity and Might as well as Sorcery as an Eldritch, his pride as a fighter suffusing even his spellcraft. Not only does the Concept Word Ancient Master grant him powers that blur the edge between sorcery and martial art, but stoic and strict at the best of times he boasts a wealth of knowledge on the Former Empire’s theotechnological procedures for building Made Gods and devising the invocations that let the theurges make war upon the angels-and win.

appearance you wish, though it is simply a mental image since they lack a body of their own. Their name and personality are entirely up to you as well. By default, they are absolutely loyal to you, but you may forgo this if you wish. By default, they will respect your personal space and privacy, but you may also forgo this if you wish. If you took a background for yourself, you may design an appropriate background for them, else they simply came into existence moments after you arrived in this world.

Whilst they reside inside you, you may communicate with them freely, allowing them to provide you with guidance, or simply be someone for you to talk to. Perhaps more importantly, they are capable of empowering an attack of yours, vastly increasing both the damage it deals and its ability to launch opponents into the air. Doing so takes a lot out of the Progenitor God, so it is unlikely that they will be able to do this for you more than once in a fight. Whilst they are empowering you in this way, if applicable, your hair colour is changed to the same colour as theirs, and your eyes glow yellow.

Should you grant them a body of their own, they will find their apparent former power to be gone for good, leaving them only with the power of an ordinary human, and the abilities they have whilst inside you. If you do this, they will become able to separate from you and re-join you at will, provided you consent to it. They do not take up an active companion slot, unless they are imported as a companion in a future jump.

You may import an existing being who already lives inside you into this option, granting it all of the advantages this option provides, except for not counting as an active companion (if they already did not count as an active companion, they retain that advantage).

They are yet to fully bond with you, but they have been trained to be used in battle, and are absolutely loyal to you. You may choose any 3 Pokémon, so long as your team meets the following conditions:

• All of the Pokémon are either Starter Pokémon, or an evolved form of a Starter Pokémon. They need not be from the same region.
• You have 1 Grass-type Pokémon, 1 Fire-type Pokémon, and 1 Water-type Pokémon.
• You have 1 Basic (not evolved at all) Pokémon, 1 Stage 1 (evolved one time) Pokémon, and 1 Stage 2 (fully evolved) Pokémon. 

Each Pokémon comes in a standard Poké Ball. You may choose to have a Shiny or otherwise differently-coloured version of any of the Pokémon you have selected for your team. Their gender is likewise up to you. The Pokémon team has a shared version of Percentage System, meaning any damage they take whilst the percentage system is on will be split evenly across all three of them.

The Pokémon in this team cannot be evolved during this jump. Post-jump, this restriction is removed. They do not take up an active companion slot, unless they are imported as a companion in a future jump. Additionally, should you decide to import them as a companion in a future jump, youmay import them into the same companion slot, dividing the power of any perks  they purchase between them, lowering the potency of the perks somewhat. 

Should you purchase Pokémon Trainer as a canon companion, or purchase a Figure Player using Pokémon Trainer as a base, you may elect instead to receive only Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard, and have them gain the advantages of this companion option.

You may only purchase this companion once."
666,,200,A Different Self,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control ,"By some strange process, an alternate personality has been installed within your mind, distinct enough that they could be considered their own person.

You may freely decide their name and personality upon purchasing this option. By default, they are absolutely loyal to you, but you may forgo this if you wish. By default, they will respect your personal space and privacy, but you may also forgo this if you wish. If you took a background for yourself, you may choose whether they were around for some or all of that background, else they simply came into existence moments after you arrived in this world.

You are also free to decide their appearance, but they are limited to species options or alt-forms that you possess.

Whilst they reside inside you, you may communicate with them freely, allowing them to provide you with guidance, or simply be someone for you to talk to.

You have the ability to switch with the different self whenever you like. This moves you to the back of the mind, and puts them into control of your body, changing your body’s appearance to match theirs. You always have final say in the switching, and will always be able to reassert yourself, even if they tried to resist this for some reason.

Not only does this switching allow you to easily change tactics on the fly, but your different self may also possess some unique abilities, described below. Otherwise, they possess all of your powers and abilities, though you are free to restrict the use of, or weaken the effects of these powers when used by them. You can change these restrictions at any time.

Optionally, you may choose for your different self to be weighted in favour of either power or speed. Choosing power would mean that they are generally stronger than you are, but are also noticeably slower. Choosing speed would mean that they are generally faster than you, but are also noticeably weaker. This decision must be made upon purchase of this companion, and cannot be changed later.

If you purchased the Elemental Attacks! perk, you may decide for your different self to possess a different element to you, giving them a unique attack but preventing them from using your version of the perk. Similarly, if you gained an element-based effect to another perk purchased in this document (such as from the Fireball! or Recovery Special! perks), you may decide for them to have alternate element versions of these perks. These element substitutions must be uniform; if you substitute your fire attacks for ice attacks in one place, you must apply this to all relevant perks in this document, swapping fire for ice each time.

If you took the Blade species modifier, then your Blade weapon will also change in appearance when you switch. It will not change in weapon type; swords remain swords for example. If your Blade weapon had an elemental effect attached to it that originated from this document, then that element may also be substituted. The uniformity rule applies to this as well, which means if that element was changed elsewhere for your different self, it must also be changed here, and in the same way.

Should they somehow gain a body of their own, their powers and abilities will be noticeably weaker than when they inhabited your body, less than half as powerful as before. If this occurs, they will become able to separate from you and re-join you at will, provided you consent to it. They do not take up an active companion slot, unless they are imported as a companion in a future jump.

You may import an existing being who already lives inside you into this option, granting it all of the advantages this option provides, except for not counting as an active companion (if they already did not count as an active companion, they retain that advantage).

They will obey any order you give them, provided they are capable of it, even if it would lead to their death. In order to get all Pikmin except Winged Pikmin, simply attempt to pull one from the ground, and you will randomly receive one of the following:
• Red Pikmin: These guys have a high attack power relative to other Pikmin. They have burning properties in their attacks, and they are immune to the effects of fire.
• Yellow Pikmin: These guys have a high range of attack relative to other Pikmin, and travel in a slight arc when thrown. They have electric properties in their attacks, and they are immune to electricity.
• Blue Pikmin: These guys deal more damage when thrown and are slightly more durable relative to other Pikmin. They are the only type of Pikmin which can enter water without dying.
• Purple Pikmin: These guys are heavy relative to other Pikmin, and do no fly as far when thrown. They also tend to slam into opponents instead of latching on to them. They have high attack power.
• White Pikmin: These guys are light and quick relative to other Pikmin. They have the unique ability to poison those they have latched on to.

You may only have a total of three of the above out at once (combined, not for each type); attempting to gather another beyond that will fail. You can throw these Pikmin at your enemies, and they can also quickly form a chain to help you reach ledges. Should any of your Pikmin die, you may retrieve replacements from the ground.

In addition to the above, you have access to 2 Winged Pikmin, who will always be around nearby, no matter how improbable that might be, and who will be replaced if killed. These 2 Winged Pikmin, working together, will always be strong enough to carry you into the air for a brief amount of time, but will never do anything for you other than that.

669,,200,Foreboding Fräulein        ,Wizarding World,Control ,"I want to see the world. I want to know who I am... what I am. I want to make a friend.

Dementors are some of the foulest creatures to ever roam this world. Their very presence is a blight upon all that is good and happy, glorying in decay and despair. It is only natural then that such creatures would join forces with the foulest people of all.

But for someone like you, a dementor is not quite good enough. Enter Delira. With hair as black as night and inverted eyes of black and white, she is certainly a beautiful sight to behold. But beyond her beauty, she is special in one other way. Whether she was born naturally, made as a product of a long-dead dark wizard, or even a deranged experiment from the Department of Mysteries, Delira is somehow, someway, half-dementor.

Accompanied by an aura of fog and frost, Delira’s mere presence turns her surroundings dark and cold. And as she gets closer and closer, the greater this aura becomes until every passing moment has her taking away her foes’ positive emotions until nothing is left but their darkest and worse memories. If they cannot stop her, she would even be able to take away their souls. And even more like a Dementor, Delira is capable of gliding through the air, unbound by the laws of gravity.

Unfortunately, despite her unique abilities, Delira suffers from the consequences of being only half a dementor. Like her dark brethren, she is uniquely vulnerable to the magic of a Patronus, its sheer presence an anathema to all that she is, more than enough to keep her at bay or even push her away. And unlike dementors, she is not amortal. She is still part-human and so, she will be affected by most other spells that would affect regular people.

Still, underneath all of that, is a young girl who seeks only to learn, to grow. Whatever her goals may be, it seems that she’s latched herself onto you in hopes of accomplishing them. Treat her well, alright? She may not act like it, but she is still rather young and due to her... unique condition, she’s always had a rather hard time making friends."
670,,200,Centauride Champion        ,Wizarding World,Control ,"The other centaurs were all so boring! They wouldn’t let me fight with my spear or even let me talk to wizards. You’re much more fun to be around.

The centaurs may be classed as “Beasts” by the Ministry but that is far from the truth. Centaurs are beasts in name only for their minds are an equal to any “Beings” across this world. With the body of a horse combined with the head and torso of a man, a centaur is a far cry from any mere beast you might encounter.--

But just like how every human is different from one another, so too are the centaurs. And while much of their kind seem to prefer sticking to forests, this particular centauride has chosen to go out into the world, donning an ornate suit of custom-made goblin-wrought armor and wielding a spear enchanted with Gubraithian Fire, an everlasting flame.

With flowing golden hair and sapphire eyes, Praelia fancies herself as a chivalrous knight of old, seeking adventure and glory wherever she may find it across the world. And she is certainly quite the beauty. In fact, there are those who would say that she is even half-Veela, a rumor she never seems to deny. And with how graceful and elegant her every move is, there just might be some truth to such a claim.

Moving on from her attractiveness, she is a very able combatant. Capable of running faster than even a Nimbus 2000 can fly, Praelia also has the reflexes to match, blocking arrows from her spear and hitting them out of the air with her own. And with her strength, she’s even capable of bringing down a troll with a single well-placed blow. Coupled with her goblin-forged golden armor, she is even harder to bring down, her armor providing her a hefty resistance to most spells. 

Still, despite her many advantages, she is far from invincible. For one thing, while her armor is very much useful, it doesn’t cover her entirely and leaves behind many areas ripe to be targeted. And as fast as she is, her large size and horse-half are not exactly the most agile. Finally, beyond her extensible knowledge in the art of divination, she doesn’t actually have much experience with magic, either in fighting against it or using it. Maybe you can help her out with that."
671,,200,Vampiric Vigilante,Wizarding World,Control ,"I’ve always loved comic books, and I always loved the heroes. Now that I have the chance to be one myself, why wouldn’t I take it?

So long as there’s a government left standing, there will always be criminals lurking within its shadows. From simple thieves and lollygaggers to the darkest and most depraved of them all, you will always be able to find criminals so long as you know where to look. And you are not the onlyone looking.

Exceedingly beautiful, even by the standards of the Veela, this young man with hair and skin as pale as snow is as far from a Veela as possible. You see, Valdis, is in fact a vampire. But, given the vast variety of vampires you might come to encounter within your travels, what exactly makes someone like Valdis stand out amongst the crowd?

Well, for one thing, despite the discrimination he faces as a vampire, Valdis has amassed quite the fortune, enough for him to live quite comfortably for the rest of his days. And then comes what he does with said fortune. Tell me, have you ever heard of the Muggle character known as the Dark Knight, the Caped Crusader, the Batman?

Of course you have! And so has Valdis. You see, Valdis has always been a big fan of comic books, even when he was a wee little lad. But his favorite of them all, by far, are the stories revolving around Batman and his companions. Billionaire philanthropist by day, heroic vigilante at night. 

With such a fascination, Valdis has made it his life’s goal to become just like his greatest hero. He’s already amassed a fortune, fulfilling the first part of his goals. But as he’ll gladly tell you, there is no end to the criminals of the world and so, he continues to travel the world, apprehending every criminals of every kind, from simple poachers to ruthless Dark wizards.

Clad in a specially crafted cloak of invisibility and armed with a never-ending utility belt filled with all manner of useful tricks of the trade like Instant Darkness Powder or the Hand of Glory, Valdis is certainly quite the frightening sight to evildoers everywhere. That doesn’t even take into account his own skill in magic, where he favors both Charms and Defense.

So what now, Jumper? Will you be his Robin? His Catwoman? His Bane? Or maybe even the Clown Prince to his Caped Crusader?"
672,,200,Noblesse Oblige,Wizarding World,Control ,"Nobility possesses the greatest power and so too do they possess the greatest responsibility. As such, it is my duty, my burden, to raise all others, as high as they will go.

The concept of noblesse oblige, to put it simply, is the concept wherein the nobility, those with wealth and power, should do their best to fulfill their social responsibilities and to honor the people around them, to provide for them, and most importantly to protect them.

In these times, especially within the world of wizards and witches, the pure-bloods have forgotten and abandoned this once venerable and honorable responsibility. But there are those rare few who have not forgotten their roots, those who understand the value of honor, of responsibility, of love. Alphonse Edel is one of those rare few.

Born between the union of a Muggle and a Pure-Blood, Alphonse has always been a talented student, excelling in all his subjects and graduating with twelve O.W.L.s. But beyond the practical and theoretical, Alphonse excelled the most in the social aspects of life. Rare was the time when he could not make friends. In fact, Alphonse was the type of student who was liked by everyone. You could hardly find someone with a bad thing to say about him.

And as he grew older, this talent of his never left. More than that, it proved to be quite a boon in his line of work. After all, a politician needs the support of the many if he truly wishes to enact any long-lasting changes within society, especially in something as insular and stagnant as the wizarding world.

Even now, he spends his time campaigning against the sordid and horrendous treatment of muggle-borns, half-bloods and even Muggles. This is not entirely unusual. After all, Alphonse is hardly the first half-blood to wish for better rights. What is unusual, however, is that the people are listening. Already, there are many amongst the Wizengamot who have struck a sort of friendship with the man or, at the very least, some sort of begrudging respect.

Beyond his skills on the battlefield that is politics, Alphonse is also an able combatant. He may not specialize in any particular branch of magic, Alphonse nevertheless holds a great grasp on the fundamentals. You might even be inclined to call him a jack of all trades, and as the saying goes, “a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one”.

And finally, like any proper politician, Alphonse has a large fortune to fall upon, a fortune built over the generations, hailing from two families of prodigious wealth indeed. But his fortune is not the end-all and be-all. That lies with you. Perhaps with your help, Alphonse could become a Minister of Magic, a true symbol for all the downtrodden and oppressed."
673,,200,Man of Gold,Wizarding World,Control ,"People are idiots. Chasing relics and artifacts from the past is not how one can change the world. If you want to change the world, create something new, something that will last forever.

At times, it seems as if the greatest magical creations of the world are often those created by people of the past. Ancient artifacts, mysterious relics, it seems that there is no end to the items of power hidden in the shadows of the past. It’s almost as if the ancients had far greater magic than what people of today possess. This is not true. And Aurus Faber shall prove it.

Born as the sole child of a Muggle family, Aurus Faber has always had interest in craftsmanship, even when he was just a small child. As a young boy, he spent his time carving out small trinkets of wood and watching as his father forged wondrous jewels to provide for their family. One day, while learning from his father, an accident led to molten gold splattering on him.

Imagine then the shock as the family watched the gold spread around his arms, coating them, transforming them until he found himself with arms of gold. It was on this day that Aurus discovered that he was a wizard and some would say that this was when he set upon his path of becoming the greatest craftsman in the world.

Nowadays, Aurus makes a living crafting majestic works of art for anyone who can afford them. Whether they be paintings, sculptures, or something more esoteric, Aurus provides to the Muggles and the magical folk alike. But in his downtime, you will often find him in his workshop, tinkering on some sort of relic or contraption.

In fact, in his workshop alone, you can find a wealth of interesting artifacts and inventions. And most of them are crafted with his golden hands alone, shaping the metal into something greater than they were before. Though many of them have never seen the light of day, you simply know that once word gets around, there will be no end to those willing to steal these wonders away, whether through thievery or battle.

Speaking of battle, while Aurus Faber may not truly excel in the art of magical Defense, he more than makes up for it with his vast knowledge on Charms and the set of armor worn upon his person. Fashioned to resemble a medieval version of the popular Muggle character known as Iron Man, yet leaving his golden hands exposed, Aurus once used this armor to take down giants.

Capable of belting out gouts of fire or ice or turning invisible, with his armor on, you don’t need to worry about Aurus falling behind. He can do far more than just keep up, especially considering his armor is hardened against both the mundane and the magical.

And now he’s joined forces with you. With you, he sees the path to the creation of ever-greater wonders. You’ll be surprised at what he might just manage to create."
674,,200,A Dog That Learns New Tricks,Wizarding World,Control ,"Come on. That can’t be all you’ve got. But if it is, don’t worry. I’ll be glad to help you learn. After all, practice makes perfect.

It is never too late to learn, never too late to grow. This is the philosophy of the Domini family, a belief that has served them well through countless generations. And though they have fallen onto hard times nowadays, their latest scion, one Eleve Domini knows that they can rise again. And with his knowledge, it certainly seems quite possible now.

Even as a student, Eleve Domini had excelled, acing every class and course he had taken. And this was not limited to classes within the wizarding world. He took summer classes as well, but not ones on magic. Rather, he took classes on Muggle sciences and culutes for even if he was a wizard, he knew he would be a fool to ignore the advancements of Muggles.

And now, years after his graduation, his studies have borne wondrous fruit. Settling into a life as a traveler of the world, Eleve Domini makes his mark in history by doing what so many philosophers of old have done. By teaching.

Whether it rich or poor, muggle or magical, civilized or wild, human or not, Eleve is willing to teach them for as long as they are willing to learn. Already, he has tutored the children of many of the richest families across the world along with giants and merfolk. And those he has tutored have nothing but fond memories of him and his teachings.

And like a certain slug, his students are more than willing to thank him for his lessons. Whether it be through gifts or favors, Eleve has quite a bit of political power hidden up his sleeves. But fortunately for many, Eleve is content with a life of teaching. He desires nothing more than to spread his knowledge across the land. That is why he has joined you. 

With you, Eleve sees the opportunity to become an even greater professor than before. And Eleve has always sought out such things whenever he sees one. Do not worry about the danger. Like many others, Eleve would not have lasted this long if he did not have any skills to back it up.

Having worked as a street magician in his younger years, Eleve in combat can best be described as an entertainer. While facing off against his foes, he instructs them on the mistakes they make and shows off how to rectify such errors, often with a painful demonstration. He’ll also do the same to you if you ever deign to spar with him. And such lessons can be quite useful indeed. There are folks with Eleve’s eye for instruction after all."
675,,200,Perils of Polyjuice,Wizarding World,Control ,"It doesn’t matter how dangerous my potions are. So long as they’re still alive after drinking it, they’re fine. So, stop being a baby and just drink the damn thing!

Ah, the folly of youth. It is the time when people are most foolhardy, believing themselves to be far more prepared to face the world than they truly are. And more often than not, such youths are proven wrong, sometimes with very disastrous results. Few folks exemplify the foolishness of youth more than Maddalyn Magier, a young and beautiful lass with a penchant for potions.

As a precocious child, Maddalyn had always been fascinated with the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. And so, like many a reckless youth, before she even went to school, she sought to experiment. With Polyjuice. You know where this is going.

Already time-consuming and complex, Maddalyn created a modified version of Polyjuice, one that was meant to allow the drinker to transform into an animal. It did not work. Instead of transforming her into an animal temporarily, like an Animagus, the potion changed her body entirely. But how has it changed her?

Well, for one thing, given that rather than using mundane animal bits for her potion, she instead used the crushed remains of a Horned Serpent’s jewel. And so, she’s grown four horns on the sides and top of her head along with a few patches of scales all across her body. Not that it detracts from her beauty in any way. It actually makes her look quite exotic.

But more than that, her potions experiment has bestowed upon her a few unique abilities, ones that others would be more than happy to kill for. Like the stories told about Horned Serpents, she possesses the ability to turn herself invisible in a manner most reminiscent of the basic Disillusionment Charm, but most uniquely, she possesses the power of flight. Like the Pegasus of myth, Maddalyn can soar through the skies with her own power, unassisted by things such as brooms, charms, or even wings.

And despite all the changes to her body and all the discrimination now rallied against her, she does not seem to mind. She remains the same aloof yet confident girl she’s ever been. After all, she simply sees this transformation of hers as proof that magic has taken a liking to her. To further prove this hypothesis of hers, she has taken to focusing on improving her skills as a potioneer, devising more potions to further modify her body.

So far, she hasn’t really had much success in her endeavors, aside from finding a few shortcuts on more common potions like the Edurus potion and the Thunderbrew. But she’s confident that she’ll be able to make her mark in history as the greatest Potions Master in history. Perhaps you can help her with that, either as her partner or just as someone to keep her from delving too deep into her experiments. She is rather reckless after all."

Even back in the olden days, there were always folks who had more talent than sense, willing to experiment with just about anything to further expand their own repertoire of knowledge. Sometimes these experiments bear fruit, considerably juicy fruit at that. Ones that everyone can make use of. And in other times, these experiments... backfire. This is one of those times.

Meet Tim. Tim is—by all accounts—quite the eccentric fellow. Preferring to dress in clothes formed from the amalgamation of multiple cultures and times joined together in ways that don’t really blend very well, he certainly strikes a dashing, if rather obvious, figure. It doesn’t help that he changes just about every facet of his outfit every day, even the color of both his hair and his eyes.

But moving on from his eccentric yet unique appearance, Tim is certainly quite the knowledgeable man. After all, he’s always viewed the limits of magic as something to be tested, something to strive towards and then, break them. To that end, he’s taken to performing experiments as much as he can. In fact, that’s how he got here in the first place.

Yes, Tim has experimented with time travel. In fact, he’s done it enough to surpass the count of every other magical experiment he’s performed, except for those involving fire. Tim likes fire very much. But moving on to the subject of time, Tim actually hails from around the 16th century and through a mishap with his personal Time-Turner, he’s found himself here.

Unfortunately, his Time-Turner was busted in the accident and so he lacks the means to go back to his own time. Not like that’s much of a problem for him. He’s far too enthused in this new world and he’s counting on you to be his guide. But don’t think he has nothing to offer you in return.

For one thing, as mentioned before, Tim is a veritable master of fire. Capable of conjuring blue flames with not even a wand in hand, and once you see his flames take the shape of chimeras and other magical beasts, you’d think he conjured up Fiendfyre instead. And he isn’t alone. By his side is his trusty friend, the bloody Rabbit of Caerbannog, a vicious beast with all the ferocity and brutality of the most violent and depraved beasts out there.

But beyond combat, you’ll find Tim to be an able hand when it comes to magical experimentation. He has plenty of experience doing so and if things do go wrong, Tim has an uncanny knack for managing to turn what would be catastrophic failures into something more manageable and maybe even quite helpful. Hopefully you two can have some fun on whatever experiments you find yourself performing and enacting."
677,,200,Runespoor,Wizarding World,Control ,"Native to the African country of Burkina Faso, a Runespoor is, in essence, a three-headed snake with an average length of six to seven feet for adults and a highly venomous bite, enough to bring down even mighty beasts. It is a popular pet amongst Dark wizards, who, much like potioneers, often find plenty of use with its eggs and fangs.

Each head serves a different function. The left head serves as the planner, deciding where to go and what to do next. The middle head serves as a dreamer, and the right head acts as the critic, evaluating the efforts of the others. Naturally, they often come to blows and it is common to see a Runespoor with a missing head, often the right. And so, it is very rare for a Runespoor to live to a great age

But this particular specimen is rather unique. Unlike most Runespoors, the three heads have come to an understanding and so, they move and fight as one. More importantly, such an understanding has allowed this Runespoor to live longer than most. Already the beast is fifteen feet long and yet it only grows larger with every month. Who knows how massive it can be in ten years?"
678,,200,Thestral,Wizarding World,Control ,"To look upon a Thestral is to see a visage of death, a glimpse of the Grim Reaper itself. A winged horse it may be but a Thestral bears little resemblance to its kin. With vast, leathery wings like those of a bat’s and skin so taut and tight like a lizard, a Thestral can certainly be quite frightening.

Visible to only those who have seen death, a Thestral is a magical beast indeed. With its wings, a Thestral can soar through the skies far beyond the speeds of even the fastest brooms. And like an owl with letters, Thestrals have a fantastic sense of direction. Just tell it where you want it to go and it’ll take you there, even if you don’t know where it is. It’s also rather strong, enough that it can carry something as heavy as them with not even a drop in speed.

When it comes to taking care of them, it’s important to note that Thestrals are carnivores, with a preference for birds. Capable of tracking the scent of blood and flesh from miles away, a Thestral will have no trouble hunting for its prey, but it never hurts to give it a helping hand."
679,,200,Quintaped,Wizarding World,Control ,"Should someone ever tell you that magic is safe, simply tell them the story of the Quintapeds to prove them wrong. Otherwise known as Hairy MacBoons, Quintapeds did not come about naturally like many other magical beasts. Found only on the Isle of Drear, a small Unplottable island by the northernmost tip of Scotland, Quintapeds can trace their origins to a rivalry between two families, the MacBoon Clan and the McClivert Clan.

On one fateful night, Quintius MacBoon slew Dugald McClivert in a drunken duel. And in retaliation, the McCliver Clan transfigured each and every member of the MacBoon family into five-legged beasts, all wreathed in red fur like some sort of demented spider. This proved to be a mistake for the Macboons had become more dangerous than before.

Whether or not this story is true, it cannot be denied that the Quintapeds do exist. Remarkably durable and utterly immune against most spells, a Quintaped is a ferocious creature that can quickly spell the end of any witch or wizard. And though they may be small, it would be wise not to underestimate them."
680,,200,Erumpent,Wizarding World,Control ,"At a distance, the Erumpent looks to be an odd and abnormally large rhinoceros. But up close, you can see just how different it truly is. Around five times the size of a hippopotamus, an Erumpent is a durable beast. With a hide capable of repelling most charms and curses and a vicious horn, the Erumpent is no trifling beast to be messed with.

Speaking of the horn, said instrument of destruction is packed with something wizards call Exploding Fluid. Anything pierced by this horn and impregnated with the liquid within will quickly explode as the fluid rushes into them. Needless to say, that is a rather deadly occurrence. So take care of the Erumpent and it’ll take care of you."
681,,200,Blast-Ended Skrewt,Wizarding World,Control ,"Hmm... However did you get your hands on this creature, Jumper? Born through a half-giant’s attempts at breeding Fire Crabs and Manticores, Blast-Ended Skrewts are special brand of magical beast. Resembling a sort of deformed scorpion, despite how... mangled they appear to be, Skrewts are nonetheless a surprisingly deadly and dangerous beast.

Ten feet long and around a third as wide, like the Manticores that sired them, Skrewts are remarkably durable with a shell that repels all but the fiercest of spells. Only their underside was vulnerable, uncovered by any armor. As to why these creatures are called Blast-Ended Skrewts, simply look at their backside. From their ends, they fire off blasts of flame that could easily set a wizard alight. Do be careful. Skrewts can be rather aggressive and they can eat just about anything, with a preference for flesh."
682,,200,Crown of Mneme,Wizarding World,Control ,"You may have heard of the Deathly Hallows, objects of such power that wizards and witches have killed to obtain them for centuries. If so, you probably aren’t surprised to learn that there are more artifacts of great power to be found in this world, even if they aren’t as mighty as the Deathly Hallows. Created by Dai Ryusaki, a professor of Mahoutokoro, many centuries ago, the Crown of Mneme can be considered a Legilimen’s best friend.

Even a novice in the mental arts will find themselves possessing considerable skill in Legilimency once this crown rests on their head. Originally intended as a medical device of sorts, the Crown of Mneme will do more than bolster your skill in Legilimency. With this crown, masters of Legilimency will even be able to recreate one of the Unforgivable Curses, being fully capable of controlling the weak-minded so long as they focus."
683,,200,Dark Relic of Old,Wizarding World,Control ,"The Dark Arts are a terrible thing, but they can be great indeed. And artifacts such as this relic is only one such example. Dating from a time before even the creation of Hogwarts, this relic takes on the shape of a small pyramid with carvings of Inferi around its sides. Even a child would be able to tell that this thing is Dark indeed.

But what of its power? With this artifact, one’s ability to control and manipulate is heavily enhanced. A student could easily be able to find themselves capable of calling upon and controlling hordes of Inferi against their foes. With some patience and practice, perhaps you’ll be use this relic to rid the afflicted of the curses plaguing their very being."
684,,200,Animal Communication ,Wizarding World,Control ,"Animals are wondrous and mighty things. Those of the magical world are even more so. But with might comes danger, a lot of danger. Most folks don’t even know much about beasts beyond knowing when to run away. You on the other hand, are one of the rare few who can, in a sense, communicate with them. With how many dangerous creatures there are in this world, that is a very good skill to have.

Even on your first encounter with a beast, you’ll have an innate sense of what they are communicating. You’ll be able to tell if they are accepting of your approach, threatening you, or asking you for your assistance. It doesn’t matter whether said beast is magical or mundane. So long as the beast is capable of some form of communication, this perk will take effect.

Of course, this doesn’t only go one-way. You can communicate with the beasts too and easily in fact. For one thing, beasts are generally more accepting of you, enough that even the most aggressive of them would be willing to simply let you walk away or give you a chance to explain yourself. For the less aggressive of them, they would even be willing to provide you with a modicum of help, so long as you hadn’t done something to sour their opinion of you."
685,,200,Power of Patronus,Wizarding World,Control ,"An ancient and mysterious spell, the Patronus Charm is an extraordinarily difficult piece of magic that summons forth a magical sentinel, a projection formed from your innermost hopes and positive emotions. It is a guardian angel that shall stand by your side guarding from the creatures and monsters of the Dark. And now, not only are you capable of conjuring a corporeal Patronus regardless of the horrors you face, a guardian that shall push back and repel all the creatures of the Dark, but because of your training, you have learned to hold onto hope in even the darkest of times. So long as hope burns bright within you, the fight shall rage on."
686,,200,Legilimency,Wizarding World,Control ,"The offensive counterpart to Occlumency, Legilimency is branch of magic specializing in seeing into and navigating the minds of others. A Muggle would better know this as “mind-reading”, but such a term is not sufficient to encapsulate all that a skilled Legilimens can do. Beyond just navigating the minds of another, a skilled enough user can even communicate telepathically with others and send forth visions to torment whoever is foolish enough to stand in their path.

For now, you have enough skill in the art that you are capable of doing so either nonverbally or wandlessly, but not at the same time. With only a little bit more training, you could learn to stand on the level of masters. But the mind is a complex and many-layered thing. It would do you well to remember that."
687,,200,Crimson Jewel,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control ,"A dragon that stands out due to his crimson scales, he has seen the potential within you to become a true Lord, and has sworn his loyalty to you. It should go without saying, but as a dragon he is quite the mighty figure, capable of drenching entire battlefields in fire within a matter of seconds. Though he can be quite vain at times, he will ultimately submit to you and your will."
688,,200,Ashen Summons ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Control ,"There are remnants of souls within the ashes of the dead, which one such as yourself can make use of. If given the proper ashes and a certain bell, then you could call upon the spirits within to come to your aid, sustained by your energies. Not only that, but you can even strengthen them, bringing them closer to the strength they may have once held in life, and perhaps even further beyond that."
689,,200,And Here I Am ,Disney’s Cinderella,Control ,"You can claim up to eight people at a time as your charges. When they are in trouble, or simply need you, you will know and can appear next to them at will. All it would take is a single tear, and you will be there by their side. Or they could simply say your name, your choice. Once you are done you may return to wherever you were before. This will also allow you to summon them to you, though I would advise you to give them a warning beforehand."
690,,200,Summonable Stampede,The Lion King,Control ,"Once per month you can summon forth a stampede of any large animal. Whether to use as a distraction or to assassinate someone, that is your choice. Once they are done doing the deed, they will vanish into thin air and will require a month to recover before they can be summoned again."
691,,200,A Family,The Lion King,Control ,"... of your very own. And it doesn’t always consist of blood relatives. Depending on your Origin, this item changes. If you are a Commoner, you will meet like-minded people who will quickly befriend you. If you are a Servant, they will be blood relatives that are always willing to lend a hand. If you’re a Royalty, you gain a small band of best friends you’ve known since you were young. And if you’re a Villain, you gain your very own motley crew of flunkies and thugs. These people act as NPCs, and cannot be taken as companions. They will appear in future jumps as whatever the most common race or species is for that Jump."
692,,200,The Evil Queen,Disney’s Snow White,Control ,"Got a thing for bad girls, eh? Or perhaps you have found common ground with her; bonding over the torture and murder of innocents, casting dark magic over the land. She’s a tenacious, cunning, and powerful woman, with a thing for collecting hearts. Keep her happy and yours will stay in your chest where it belongs. She has the Evil Monarch line of perks and the free Evil Monarch item."
693,,200,Evil Snowman Construction Kit,Wizard 101,Control ,"Complete with magical never-melt snow, two eyes of brimstone, two branches of a willow tree, the hat of a hanged man, and a carrot grown in a blood-soaked garden. The Evil Snowman will obey commands given it, but is generally better at violence than anything. Kit replenishes supplies every month."
694,,200,Mount(200),Wizard 101,Control ,"No wizard wants to be caught dead simply walking everywhere, do they? Well now you have a mount! Thanks to the power of magic, the mounts on offer all offer a guaranteed forty percent increase in your base movement speed, no matter how fast you already are. "
695,,200,Trial of Shadow,Wizard 101,Control ,"To even start on the road to mastery of this darkest art, a Wizard must first face their own Shadow, their deepest nightmare, the ultimate culmination of past victories and failures to prove to themselves and the world that their will is strong and their path is true. Now, you may inflict such a trial on others, and force them to face the worst of themselves. Should they pass, they may also gain access to Shadow magic, though they will be a novice at the art and likely to hurt themselves without guidance."
696,,200,Peculiar Teacher,The Owl House,Control ,"This older witch has picked up a few strange habits over the decades, but they’ve also learned a lot, and they’re willing to pass that knowledge on to you! This companion comes with the Witch background and all the freebies and discounts that includes, as well as the perk Bump in the Night, a 600cp stipend for perks and items, and 600cp to spend on magical training. This companion may also select a Coven to join."
697,,200,Witch’s Staff,The Owl House,Control ,"Usually awarded as part of their education, a witch’s staff serves as both a focus for their magic and a reservoir of magical energy. They can be summoned to a witch’s side or conjured from thin air, they can serve as a form of flying transportation, and perform all kinds of smaller functions. Now you are the proud recipient of such a staff.

Additionally, every proper staff also comes with a Palisman; a sentient wooden totem carved from a rare kind of wood. Each Palisman takes the shape of a small animal of the witch’s choice, and serve as the witch’s familiar and friend. A Palisman is an independent, living magical creature, and while they can communicate with and follow the orders of their witch, they may also leave if they are treated poorly. Take care of them and they’ll take care of you, Jumper."
698,,200,Abomaton 2.0        ,The Owl House,Control ,"This armored abomination is the cutting edge of magic muscle and will soon make up most of the Emperor’s army. Thankfully, you’ve managed to snag your own model before they hit the shelves. Armed with a powerful blaster cannon and capable of reshaping its body to craft tools and weapons, the abomaton combines classic abomination magic with deadly technology. It can even form a durable magical barrier to shield itself and its allies, though it must remain stationary to do this.

Alternatively, you can choose to equip yourself with a different configuration. Like Kikimora, your abomaton has been fashioned into a type of mechanized armor that may be piloted. This form retains the weaponry and strength of the regular abomaton, and even incorporates a jetpack, but sacrifices autonomy and adaptability."
699,,200,Your Horse,Beauty and the Beast,Control ,"You are now the owner of a fine horse, of a breed appropriate to mid-1700s France, and a sex of your choosing.

Your horse is loyal to you, but is also danger-averse. It has pretty good intuition too; were you to ride it to a crossroads, it would naturally want to head down the path that presents the least immediate danger. Of course, it is still possible to correct it and head down the other path if you desired.

Should anything unfortunate happen to them, they’ll be back tomorrow, good as new! This is a Disney movie, after all."
700,,200,Prince Philip,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Oh my my, what have we here? This, Jumper, is Prince Philip, one of the original Disney heroes, and one of the first princes to truly earn that title. Philip is a courageous young man, as well as quite the charmer and explorer. He’s a man with a strong belief in the idea of love, of marrying someone not for wealth or power but for love. He would rather marry a peasant woman he truly loved then a princess he’d never met. It’s the 14th century, after all, times are changing! Like that Briar Rose woman, who is most certainly not a princess in disguise, definitely not. Kidding aside, Philip is not one of the first Disney heroes just because of his belief in love, no. He’s also quite the competent fighter, and though he did have some assistance from the three good fairies, he was the one to strike Maleficent down, and break Aurora’s curse.

So, Jumper, how do you know this fellow? Are you a fellow knight, a brother in arms or blood? Are you a benevolent benefactor, helping him to fight evil and save the day with magic? Or...perhaps, have you replaced Princess Aurora in his dreams. Whatever the case, should be willing to at the end of the jump, Prince Philip will join you, and follow you to future worlds. He possesses all the perks of the Hero perkline, and will be a great help for you in the fight against evil, no matter what form it takes, witch or dragon.

Note: Alternatively, you can take Prince Phillip as he is in the Maleficent movie series. For better or for worse."
701,,200,Princess Aurora,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Also known as Briar Rose, and the Sleeping Beauty. Aurora is one of the original Disney princesses, alongside Snow White and Cinderella, and it shows. Kind-hearted? Check. Beautiful appearance and voice? Check. Competent when it comes to house-work despite being a princess? Check. Beloved by animals? Check. Tormented by the forces of evil?

Unfortunately, check for that, too. Aurora is a beautiful, sweet girl, one who believes in love above all else.It is to the point that when told she was a princess, betrothed to a prince, she was horrified, because she had fallen in love with a man she believed to be a peasant. You won’t find many who would turn down power and wealth for love. She is kind and caring, to people and animals both, and in her eyes whether her love is a peasant or a prince matters not: love is what matters. All that being said, I wonder what your relationship with her will be? Are you a friend she’s made as Briar Rose? Another caretaker she was particularly close to? Or...perhaps, have you taken Prince Philip’s place in her dreams? No matter. She possesses all the perks of the Beauty perkline, and should she be willing, will join you at the end of the jump and follow you to future worlds.

Note: Alternatively, you can take Princess Aurora as she is in the Maleficent movie series. For better or for worse."
702,,200,Three Good Fairies,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Well now, isn’t this something? Somehow or another, you have managed to befriend Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, the fairies that represent all that is good in the world and oppose Maleficent, their wicked counterpart. Each one of them is gifted with powerful magic, and each of them have a unique personality to them: Flora is strong-willed and clever, as well as a lover of both flowers and the colour pink; Fauna is kind-hearted, even to the point of feeling pity for Maleficent and believing she must have some good in her; and Merryweather is aggressive and brave, even to the point of charging at Maleficent in dragon form. Above all else, however, these three are compassionate and benevolent, even to the point of being willing to live as mortals without their powers to help an innocent child. They possess all the perks of the Good Fairy perkline as well as their wands, and should they be willing by jump’s end, will follow you to future worlds.

Note: Alternatively, you can take the Three Good Fairies as they are in the Maleficent movie series. For better or for worse."
703,,200,Dark Familiar,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Every proper witch needs a familiar, Jumper, and this one is yours. You are now the happy owner of a surprisingly intelligent pet, some ‘sinister’ animal or another such as a spider, snake, or raven, if you feel like imitating Maleficent. This pet is very intelligent, able to follow even somewhat complicated commands like ‘find a girl of sixteen years with hair of sunshine gold and lips red as the rose’. It’s a fantastic spy, a great lookout, and an amazing alarm, as well as being truly loyal to you and utterly adoring. The rest of the world may hate you, Jumper, but at least your pet loves you."
704,,200,Noble Steed,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control ,"Of course! Every valiant knight needs a noble steed to ride into battle, that’s just common sense! What you have here is a surprisingly courageous horse, brave enough to stand even before the gaze of Maleficent’s dragon form and to charge at her at your direction. Not only that, but is a horse you share a strong bond with, an animal that truly cares for you, even if it occasionally gives you trouble. In your darkest hour, when your back is against the wall and the powers of hell are arrayed against you, this creature will stand with you."
705,,200,Scaleless Sorcerer ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"The pale drake and progenitor of sorcery, there are none as well versed in the arcane as Seath the Scaleless. He delved deep into the mysteries of the arcane, to such an extent that he rivaled that of the Lords in his mastery. He was born without the stone scales of his draconic kin, and grew resentful of them. He would have originally sided with Gwyn and the other Lords, but perhaps with his talents turned towards assisting you, he can gain all he ever desired and more."
706,,200,Ancient Army,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control ,"All Lords have their subjects, and among the most valuable are those willing to fight for you, regardless of their individual reasons. You now command a respectable army numbering ten thousand strong, all of them aligned with one of the six natures offered to you, with the appropriate forms and abilities. Their most treasured qualities, though, is their unwavering loyalty to you."
707,,200,Hellkite Wyvern,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Modern drakes are the descendants of the Everlasting Dragons, surviving long after they themselves have left this world after Gwyn’s war. An utterly massive beast of crimson, it can incinerate an entire group of warriors in an instant, and is completely loyal to you. It will even allow you to ride upon its back."
708,,200,Dark Sun Gwyndolin,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"The lastborn son of the Lord of Sunlight, he was raised as a daughter due to the power of the moon being strong with him. Now he is the guardian of Anor Londo, protecting his beloved city with elaborate illusions and his covenant. An undoubtedly powerful ally to have."
709,,200,Crossbreed Priscilla,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"A stark white, draconic crossbreed trapped inside the painted world of Ariamis, due to the gods’ fear of her lifehunt ability. Naive in many things but very powerful, perhaps with you to guide and protect her, she can finally see the world that has shunned her from birth."
710,,200,Disturbed Rest ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"There are many who look towards the corpses of their fellow men, seeing them as not something to be respected or pitied, but as something to be used. You may, in fact, be one of these, for you are a practitioner of the art of necromancy, of animating the remains of the fallen and calling upon the spirits of the dead to act in your name."
711,,200,"Okay, We’re Driving!",Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Control ,"Is there anything you can’t pilot? You’re a wheelman of paranormal power. Fly the SR-71, sail an aircraft carrier, heck, even take your boss’ antique car for a spin. So long as you can physically get behind the wheel, you’ll have the ability to drive any kind of terrestrial vehicle. Of course, this perk grants you expertise as well as versatility. With you at the helm, any vehicle can be pushed to the edge of its capabilities, granting you superb (if not supernatural) speed and agility. You could even drive a manual through a rain of rocket grenades, should the need arise."
712,,200,Equestrianism ,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Control ,"Horsemanship, in the classic sense, and horse care. You’re good with horses and horse-like beings now. Riding, taming, negotiating with the ones that can talk, et cetera. This may extend to less than perfectly horse-like beings, if there’s a commonality; manticores might be tamable, but magically oversized squirrels and birds aren’t. If you have a local Magic Wand or the Royal Wand, it works a bit more effectively for you now (said wand is powered by a magic, unicorn-like being called a Millhorse, and this perk reflects how your new bond with all horses affects that). Here, have a free warnicorn (it’s kinda like the old-time scary-huge unicorns from the early myths) to go with your new skills. The warnicorn will come with you to future jumps, should you want it to."
713,,200,Morgana Macawber,Darkwing Duck,Control ,This is why you came to this jump isn’t it. Well with this option you can invite her to come with you on you following jumps. I’m sure you can convince this magical mallard to go with you and expand her magical repertoire.
714,,200,Inanimate Object Control       ,Encanto,Control ,"As a building you have an awareness and control of anything inanimate within yourself. Everything within you that is not a living creature is under your direct control and capable of being manipulated to some extent, this extends to anything on your property as well. Any inanimate object that does not have its own controlling mind can be manipulated, though this works on a descending scale for your capabilities to manipulate an object and receive sensory feedback. Things that are part of you like windows, tiles, and floorboards, physically attached to you like pictures, shelves, and drapes, or meant to be part of your house like plates, chairs, or drawers can be manipulated and bent in physics defying and cartoony ways and moved around at will, you have the same capabilities over inanimate objects that enter your domain to a lesser degree with the longer they stay on your property the easier it is for your to invest yourself into them to move, manipulate, and receive sensory feedback.

As a man you have the capability to invest a part of yourself into objects around you and manipulate them physically with nothing more than your mind and will, this works best on objects that are yours, but with time and effort can be applied to things that are not considered yours. This scales with your ability to multi-task and the initial investment only works on things you can see or sense within your domain, after the connection is formed though it will continue outside of these conditions."
715,,200,Goldie and the Three Bears ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"This option allows you to make Goldie and the Three Bears into your companions. This group includes Goldilocks, Mama Bear, Papa Bear, and Baby Bear. Goldi is the youngest member of the group though she also acts as their leader most of the time. Mama is the caretaker of the group. Papa is the muscle ready to bring the pain. Baby is the out of the box thinker and the one who causes trouble. Despite their occasional issues they truly care about each other more than anything. For one reason or another they have decided to join you and treat you as part of the family. Depending on some factors you may literally be so already. All of them will be close to you though you may choose your exact relationship with them."
716,,200,Team Friendship ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Control ,"Team Friendship is the workshop name chosen by Perrito. He however, did mention it to the police leading to it becoming their official designation. Team Friendship is made up of Puss in Boots, Kitty Softpaws, and Perrito. By taking this option you may recruit Team Friendship bringing them along with you on your future adventures. All of them will be close to you though you may choose your exact relationship with them."
717,,200,The Bygone King,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Control ,"A curious Atlantean necklace whose crystal seems to be a bit larger than most; wearing it will reveal the Great Spirit of an old Atlantean king from long ago, projected from the depths of the crystal like a hologram. Wise in accordance to his years- possessing the perk “Wisdom of the Ages”- he prefers a subtle approach, advising you on nearly any subject you could ever ask him. When his wrath is roused in your favor however he reveals his true power- summoning fierce storm-clouds as if to drown the world and a legion of trained, ethereal Atlantean soldiers to defend you from harm with shield and spear!"
718,,200,Huginn and Muninn,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Control ,"The ravens of Odin himself! Well, not really- though these two ravens are exceptionally intelligent and well-trained, they don’t really have any special qualities beyond that. Nonetheless, they are capable of following orders to a shocking degree, and the keen eyes and propensity for stealing shiny objects common to their species has made them experts at infiltrating buildings and grabbing anything of interest- be it loose valuable or something you’re after in particular."
719,,200,Serlot        ,Raya and the Last Dragon,Control ,"A large cat, about the size of an adult tiger.

Serlots are often used by Fang warriors as mounts. Yours has been well-trained for such a task, and is intensely loyal to you. It is fast, enough so that it could run down Tuk Tuk over a great enough distance. However, like most cats, it has a hatred for water, and won’t willingly jump into bodies of water except to protect itself in an emergency.

May or may not possess a soul.

Should anything unfortunate happen to your serlot, it’ll be back tomorrow, good as new. Talk about nine lives!"
720,,200,Your Tuk,Raya and the Last Dragon,Control ,"A strange creature, which could be best described as part pill bug, part armadillo, and part pug.

This creature is able to curl itself up into a ball and roll around. When it is young, it can fit in the palm of a person’s hand. At this stage of its life, it is best used to trigger certain traps, or to fit into cracks that you wouldn’t be capable of getting into. When it matures (which is achieved within six years), it becomes large enough to serve as a mount for humans. A complimentary saddle specialised for this purpose is included with this item.

Your Tuk is intensely loyal to you, but can be distracted by small bugs, which it likes to eat. It can also get stuck if it ends up on its back with no momentum to keep rolling. It will require help to right itself if this happens, a task that is naturally more challenging when it is older.

On purchase of this item, you can choose whether you begin with a young or matured Tuk Tuk. At the start of each new jump, you can choose to revert it back to a young form. Post-chain, you can do this every ten years.

Should anything unfortunate happen to your Tuk Tuk, it’ll be back tomorrow, good as new! This is a Disney movie, after all. Should the saddle be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
721,,200,Animal Assistants,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Control ,"It is one thing to make some animal friends, but it is another thing entirely to get proper help from them.

Now, when you have already acquired the assistance of animals, you will find that they are quite
competent when it comes to helping you with your cooking, cleaning or sewing. They will be able to recognize the difference between a plate cleaned by their tongues, and a plate washed in a sink, along with various other nuances such creatures would not normally be able to understand. While some animals may not be physically able to perform certain tasks, in general they will receive a boost to their dexterity while helping you out in these roles, allowing for some unusual feats.

Additionally, when animals help you in these roles, the results are surprisingly hygienic. No need to worry about getting sick from eating a pie scored and dressed by a bird, on a plate cleaned by a squirrel."
722,,200,Shadow on the Moon at Night,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Control ,At night you become extremely intimidating and can enhance this further by causing your shadow to be projected on the moon for all those nearby. You are also capable of causing people to have terrifying nightmares just by being around them and can vaguely influence the forms such nightmares take.
723,,200,Hiding Under Your Bed…,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Control ,"...in the closet under the stairs, in trash cans, etc. You can cause a monster to pop out of pretty much anywhere a child could be scared of for fear of monsters. They’re not particularly good in a fight for the most part but they have the element of surprise and generally scare the hell out of people nearby. After this you can choose whether they return to their hiding place and  disappear or try to make their way in the world."
724,,200,Palace Horse,Tangled,Control ,"This is your own horse, of a breed used by the Kingdom of Corona.

Your horse is both loyal to you and is highly intelligent. It is capable of understanding human speech to a high degree, and has been trained for use alongside the royal guard. If you’re a horse yourself, perhaps it has more value as an ally than as a mount.

Should anything unfortunate happen to your horse, it’ll be back tomorrow, good as new!"
725,,200,Living Tattoo,Moana,Control ,"Your body is decorated in a living tapestry of tattoos that represent all your accomplishments and achievements. It even has a mini-you that lives among the other tattoos and with whom you can interact. This mini-you can count as a companion, but never takes a companion slot, because they can’t leave your skin. Your mini-you has tattoo versions of all your powers and you can make all your tattoos that aren’t alive vanish at will after this jump. You can import other tattoos into this."
726,,200,Monstrous Minion,Disney’s Hercules,Control ,"Not much to be said here. This is a classic greek monster, something big, ravening and angry, and it serves your commands perfectly and obediently. Could be a Cerberus, a Hydra or even a Chimera, but it can’t be something capable of taking on one or more gods, so no Giants or Titans."
727,,200,Freed Genie,Aladdin,Control ,"You seem to have befriended a genie. Maybe it was one that you freed yourself. For whatever reason this free spirited genie has decided to join you on your travels. As a genie they are made of magic, natural shapeshifters, don’t need magical foci or incantations. This one can qualify as a powerful sorcerer from this world, but can still be contained and stopped with the right knowledge. Expect zany antics as genies seem to all have meta knowledge of how the world works."
728,,200,First Hunter ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control ,"The man who would go on to define the base principles of all Hunters that would come after, even today few could match the prowess of Gehrman, who has only become deadlier with his experience backing up his superhuman proficiency for slaying all manner of beasts. He sees putting down beasts as a mercy, and is more than willing to offer his mercy to any hunter who would ask him for it, seeing it as his burden to bear, no matter how much he wishes otherwise."
729,,200,Madaras Whistle,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control ,"Whistle of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods. The twins grew up alongside a poisonous snake, and developed a silent, inhuman kinship. The poisonous snake grew uncontrollably, raised on a healthy diet of beast entrails. Even after their deaths, it will respond to the call of the twins' whistle from within the Nightmare."
730,,200,Executioner's Gloves ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control ,"One of the secret treasures hidden in Cainhurst. The gloves of an executioner from a faraway land, passed from executioner father to executioner son, can be used to summon wrathful spirits of the past. It is said that the nobles found immeasurable delight in the dances of these vengeful specters"
731,,200,Mount ,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Control ,"Motor vehicles are nice, but nothing beats ridding around on a giant monster. There are many different incredible and dangerous creatures in this world, such as the poisonous Shirshu, the speedy Eel hound, and the ferocious Polar bear dog. Very few of these beasts have ever been tamed successfully, so you’ll definitely draw a lot of attention by riding one around in public. You may select any non-bending creature larger than a human but smaller than a house to become your companion, and it’ll remain loyal and friendly so long as you treat it well."
732,,200,Friendly Spirit ,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Control ,"An aetherial creature from the spirit realm that represents nature, twilight, and balance. This mysterious creature has taken an interest in you and wishes to bond with your soul and become your companion. Taking it will help improve your relations with other spirits, make it easier for you to enter the spirit world, and perhaps even open you up to new possibilities when dealing with spirits and spirit based phenomena. Initially the spirit will simply be a quiet follower and observer, but that may change if you genuinely attempt to befriend it. Because it’s connected to your soul it doesn’t take up a companion slot."
733,,200,Helhound,Marvel Magic,Control ,"Through some series of events, which I'm sure is a story in an of itself, you have made a friend: a helhound. The spawn of the Hel Wolf, a powerful Asgardian demon born of – you guessed it – Hel, the nordic realm of the unworthy dead. The size of a small pony, this beast most closely resembles a particularly large pit bull. This hound is not only strong enough to fight against gods and monsters and capable of breathing magical fire, but is as smart as a man and capable of speaking as one. This particular one is completely loyal to you and will follow your orders to the best of its abilities – especially those involving murder. Your hound is quite fond of murder, see and will be happy to speak of this fondness at length."
734,,200,Astral Master,Marvel Magic,Control ,"Magic is primarily drawn from three sources: the ambient mystical energy of the dimension you are currently in, the power of artifacts or beings of an extradimensional or interdimensional nature, and the personal reserves of a mage's own soul. Skill with these three are not entirely intertwined and must often be advanced separately and each has their own area of specialty. The personal power of a mage, drawn from their own mind and spirit, is thus by far most adept at manipulating those things. Powers of hypnotism, telepathy, and astral projection are the primary trade of such magic, of which you are a skilled wielder. Long hours of meditation have cultivated a mastery of these techniques, allowing you to easily call on them with but an effort of will, allowing you to search or speak into the minds of dozens of people, hypnotize a man with mere eye contact, and project your spirit onto the astral plane for up to 24 hours before you are locked out of your body and it begins to decay,"
735,,200,Enchanted Half-Moon Talbak ,Dial,Control ,"The Enchanted Half-Moon Talbak is a mystical artifact that grants the wearer the power to summon a spectral animal guardian. By default, the guardian takes the form of a majestic bear, embodying strength, resilience, and unwavering loyalty. The spectral bear fights alongside the wearer, its claws and teeth infused with the talbak's enchantment for devastating attacks. The talbak allows customization, enabling the summoner to choose their preferred animal form for the spectral guardian.

The spectral animal guardian serves as a formidable ally, possessing heightened senses and the ability to pass through solid objects. The wearer can summon and dismiss the guardian at will, forging a deep bond of understanding and support over time. However, the guardian’s powers draw from the wearer’s energy and magical reserves, necessitating rest and recovery after extended use. With the Enchanted Half- Moon Talbak, the wearer gains a powerful companion and protector, capable of turning the tide of battle. The customization option allows for personalization, manifesting the ideal animal guardian. Embrace this enchanted talbak, summon your spectral animal guardian, and unleash its might in your journeys."
736,,200,"Abigor, Gressil, and Wallow",Ghost Rider,Control ,"Blackheart’s lackeys; what they lack in strength they make up for in eagerness to serve you, as well as in only taking one companion slot. Powers are split amongst the three of them, unless you decide that one in particular deserves more power than the others."
737,,200,"Blade, the Vampire Hunter",Ghost Rider,Control ,"One of the Ghost Rider’s potential allies, a half-vampire named Blade armed with a katana and all the strengths of a vampire with none of the weaknesses. In addition to an all-around superhuman body, he also has a healing factor allowing him to heal his wounds in a matter of hours, and is capable of accelerating his healing factor by ingesting blood."
738,,200,Mind-Force,Marvel Primal,Control ,"The first magic, Arcanum Ego, involves awakening and harnessing your own spiritual energies. You are a skilled hypnotist, telepath and can astral project to explore the wonders of the multiverse. You have a strength of will and character that lets you endure such horrors and beguilements as you may encounter."
739,,200,Jumpwind ,X-Men the Claremont Years,Control ,"You possess one of the flying horses ridden by the valkyries of Asgard. Fearless, obedient, and loyal, this horse is rather intelligent for a horse, in addition to being stronger and faster than a mortal horse. Also its wings allow it to fly. More importantly is that due to steeds becoming quickly useless to most jumpers this horse has a special property that when you ride it it will always be significantly faster than you would be running or flying through your own power. It will always be powerful enough to survive you riding it into combat as long as it is not directly targeted."
740,,200,Miniature Dragon,X-Men the Claremont Years,Control ,"You have here a purple, cat-sized dragon. While not particularly strong, it is surprisingly durable, able to survive super powered blows though it might get knocked out by them. It is able to fly, breathe fire like a living blowtorch, and produce enough smoke to fill a room with its thick, black clouds. It is noticeably resistant to telepathic probing, and displays an unanimal-like cleverness and intelligence at times, but is completely mute."
741,,200,Beast of the Nine Realms,Thor: Love and Thunder,Control ,"Not all warriors fight alone. Some employ a beast of battle to fight by their side. Various notable Asgardians own a pair of ravens, a giant she-wolf of Hel, and horses - whether they have wings or eight legs. You can choose any creature found within the nine realms to be your pet, whether this is a wolf like Hela’s, a frost beast of Jotunheim, a fire dragon of Muspelheim, or something else. Mind the screaming if you choose them. No matter what animal you choose, it will be very loyal as long as you treat it well, and has physical attributes relatively close to those of an Asgardian. It might be stronger or weaker, depending on the animal. A bear would probably be able to overpower the average warrior while a dragon or hel-wolf could scatter legions of Einherjar like tenpins. It has been trained for war, so you can count on it to have your back in a battle. And yes, this includes the goats, even though they hail from Indigarr. If you choose them, they come in a pair. This companion has the Asgardian race and the perk A Warrior’s Death, but for fighting as an animal instead of wielding weapons like humanoids do."
742,,200,Terror Cage,Thor: Love and Thunder,Control ,"It’s a big black cage. It can contain a lot of people. Anyone you throw in here can’t get out on their own, and the cage produces an aura of fear, so your captives are less likely to act out. Perfect for holding hostages without having to go and find restraints."
743,,200,Magik 2099 ,Marvel 2099,Control ,"A researcher for a corp, she was lost when their research into an alternate dimension failed disastrously. Unknown to them, her consciousness was partially combined with a pocket universe. While it’s not the largest - a hundred miles at most - she can slowly control it and the energy within, shaping it into matter or reverting it to energy again. Recently she has managed to separate her body from the energies of the dimension, and open a portal to escape from it.

She now possesses the ability to open circular portals to or from the dimension. Theoretically she could open such portals to other dimensions - or planets - than Earth but it would take practice, learning, and experience she currently lacks. She has begun to learn how to open these portals to energy rich portions of the pocket universe, allowing her to release powerful blasts of plasma. This could eventually run the pocket universe dry, though she’s also able to block energy attacks with these portals to ‘recharge’ its energy (and given she can with time and effort convert matter to energy and vice versa in that dimension she could theoretically do so with matter). Finally she possesses a cybernetic arm with enhanced strength which possesses a focusing device through which she can open a portal to create a plasma sword.

The experience has mostly scrambled her memory - she doesn’t remember her own name or who she was working for - and left her somewhat scarred and traumatized. She doesn’t even know if the cybernetic arm was something she possessed before she went to that dimension, or if she designed it. She does have a certain knack for engineering, and an untapped talent for magic."
744,,200,TRIPLE PUPPERINO(200),Helltaker,Control ,"A lovely triple headed white dog pup or three pups, one red, one white, one black. Pay 100 cp and now it’s in ‘doggirl’ version, not unlike the mischievous triple pup."
745,,200,The Main Cast ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Control ,"This option allows you to take the important members of the movie. The main difference is that by purchasing them with this option they will be guaranteed to come with you and they will receive their appropriate perks. For example Wanda would come with the entire Dark One perkline and the Chaos Magic perk. It would also remove the corruptive influence of the Darkhold from her granting her the power without the external influence. This includes Dr. Strange, Wong, Wanda, America Chavez, and the members of the Illuminati."
746,,200,Moondragon,Marvel Cosmic,Control ,"Through years of intense training and the unlocking of your natural abilities, you have become a telepath of incredible skill and talent. You are capable of powerful mental attacks, mentally controlling even the strong willed over large distances, memory modification, and even communicating with others across star systems. This psionic ability will increase through training and practice."
747,,200,Possession,Avatar: Beginnings,Control ,"Apparently all spirits can do this. Just hop inside a material body and pilot it around for a bit. Just be careful, if you take more than a few minutes they could die or be irrevocably changed."
748,,200,Stupendous Steed,Fate/Zero,Control ,"A mighty horse, loaned to you from a truly magnificent king. This horse is wild and untameable, the only one it willingly allows to ride it is yourself. It seems almost capable of responding to your thoughts when you ride it, the smallest of movements from you easily directing the impressive beast to follow your commands. It will never spook or skitter away from danger, even if you direct it to leap off a cliff and into the maw of a great monster, it won’t hesitate for a second to follow your orders. Your new companion will never tire nor wear itself out from long days of galloping. This can be imported into."
749,,200,Self Geis Scroll ,Fate/Zero,Control ,"This scroll is a fairly complicated magical artefact known as a Self Geis. Used in contracts between magi, they are able to ensure both sides will stay true to their words or pay a dire price. When an agreement or deal is put in writing on this scroll and both parties agree to it, the contract is sealed and the price for breaking that contract is the permanent loss of all supernatural abilities. Both parties must be aware of this clause and indeed will be, as it is enforced by their own powers rather than the magic of the scroll itself. This contract respawns a month after it is used. "
750,,200,Infernal Communicator,Bayonetta,Control ,"Sometimes you just want a little help... spooky help, if you will. In exchange for a slow drain of your magic, this wrist-equipped item can summon small skeletal minions to shoot forward and attack your enemies. They may not do much damage, but they're amazing at keeping an enemy distracted to let you set up for the kill."
751,,200,Absolute Power,Ragna Crimson,Control ,"While you don’t possess such a thing just with this, you can surely make it those who are weaker than you think so. Your power radiates from you in the form of what others would call an oppressive aura of fear and awe. This aura makes those who are weaker than you physically feel the difference in your abilities. The higher the difference of power between you, the stronger this effect is, to the point that those who would be instantly killed by your attacks would become paralyzed and unable to take any action before your mighty presence."
752,,200,Test Dummies,Generic Alchemist,Control ,"Experimenting with alchemy can often require testing the results, and testing on yourself can be dangerous, and testing on others is unethical. These constructs are an answer to the dilemma. The constructs are almost identical to an average human with enough sophistication to emulate a human mind, though they lack an actual mind directly. You can control and alter their specifications to a degree, within the limits of human ability, or emulate a specific person with an injection of blood from the individual to be emulated. This allows the accurate testing of the effects a particular bit of alchemy on a specific person or type of person. You start with five such constructs and they will repair any damage done with the press of a button on their storage unit.

There are instructions on how to make them and adapt them to other species to, for example, test how a potion would affect a dog or a specific alien species or any number of fantasy races. These instructions are fairly simple and easy to follow, easily adapted. They also give a basic understanding of how to make homunculi, but is not, in and of itself, enough to gain the ability in full.

These constructs cannot normally develop any sort of sentience, however, with jumpchain, you may find a way to do so. If you do, the constructs become followers and can be imported as a companion if you so choose. They are not, however, able to share a slot.

The constructs cannot provide usable parts for any sort of practice, meaning you cannot take off a limb to use as a replacement for someone else, harvest organs, or otherwise gain useful materials from them."
753,,200,Elemental Dragon Hatchling,League of Legends,Control ,"You have a pet dragon hatchling. Whether he's of the Infernal, Mountain, Cloud, or Ocean Drake vareity, you've made a powerful pal - Even as a baby, these guys are capable of pumping out enough firepower to be considered a weapon on their own (albeit one that requires strict supervision). When he grows up, your pet dragon will become a mighty drake. Your drake friend will also give a blessing depending on his type- Infernal drakes will empower your physical and magical strength, Mountain drakes will make it easier to destroy inanimate objects, Cloud Drakes will let you move faster, and Ocean drakes will slowly heal your wounds."
754,,200,Frost Queen's Claim,League of Legends,Control ,"This blackened True Ice dagger is haunted with the spirits of the iceborn whose lives it claimed. Once per 90 seconds, the wielder can invoke their spirits, and two icy ghosts will fly out and seek out the wielder's enemies. If the ghosts can find their enemies within a few seconds, they will inflict them with an icy cold that slows their foes' movements."
755,,200,Wyvern,A Throne of Glass,Control ,"You now own, and have the loyalty and companionship of a great Wyvern. Wyverns are dragon-like creatures with two back legs and large leathery, membranous wings tipped with a poison slick talon that acts like a set of front limbs. They have a triangular head and long, curved fangs, the talons on their back legs can reach the size of a person's forearm and tails as long as their body is armed with venomous barbs. They have leather hides coming in various colors, from sky blue and night black for stealth or every shade of gray. They have the endurance to fly hundreds of miles in a day and still be ready to fight when they arrive. This Wyvern is loyal to you, and will follow your commands with a fluidity and loyalty that would normally only come from a lifetime of training and companionship."
756,,200,Brigantine,A Throne of Glass,Control ,"A beautiful two-masted, and square-rigged ship. This ship is perfect for pirates, quick, durable and able to run down any merchant ship you could wish. This ship can carry about twice as much loot in its main hold as the space should allow, and somehow no matter how much loot is in there it is never slowed."
757,,200,Legacy of the Mycenian’s,A Throne of Glass,Control ,"You are one of the carriers of the ancient Mycenian bloodline, finding that you have a natural knack for luck regarding anything to do with the sea, this no guarantee of success but you are more likely to see good winds, and clear skies. You also have an unnatural affinity and kinship with sea dragons and similar creatures quickly able to form bonds of companionship and trust that most others would never have a chance of establishing. Given a bit of time you could go from meeting a sea dragon to having a steadfast companion willing to fight with you during a naval conflict in almost no time at all."
758,,200,Riftspirit,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"You are capable of communicating with the Rift, summoning from nowhere a “Rift” terrain elemental. These elementals are not enhanced by Enhanced Earth, but can inflict non-elemental magic damage and are alarmingly aggressive, often being faster and more damaging than their counterparts."
759,,200,Wrath of the Woods,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"Beyond commanding the world’s animals, you are capable of calling upon the very plants to assist you. You are able to expend a moderate portion of mana to awaken plant life to assist you, often entangling your foes or slicing them apart with steel-like leaves. With a significant portion of mana, they may become ambulatory and fight on your behalf as awakened plant-type monsters."
760,,200,Fly With Me,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"…Really now, what is it with bounty hunters and pirates? You have a roguish charm that allows you to negotiate with enemies mid-battle, either persuading them to join your side, give over supplies, or simply inflicting the Fear and Fascination status effects with your sheer audacity."
761,,200,Pawn,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"It takes a team to survive this world, so you can make your own. Over the course of a peaceful day of rest, you can induct up to 8 allies with no other Job abilities as your Pawns, gaining all of your Mercenary Job perks, though they do not get any Pawns. You can only have 8 pawns with just this."
762,,200,Inner Demon,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"The darkness you’ve swallowed down has become a separate entity, following you as close as your own shadow. You are capable of manifesting your shadow into a form resembling an Archived monster form you possess. In addition, you can hold an additional two learned forms.

763,,200,Sky Painters,Super Dragon Sword,Control ,"You have a new suite of angels to call upon, the Weather Angels. These angels are capable of changing the Weather of the area around you, granting benefits and allowing their weather to act in your favor depending on which Weather Angels are called. The weather effects are Heat Wave, Monsoon, Thunder, Blizzard, Bright Sky, Tornado, and Fog. Further information can be found in the Notes section, but each angel takes a significant amount of mana to summon. However, they are much stronger than the basic Warrior Angel, and can cast the “Element 2” of their associated element as shown in the notes."
764,,200,Horde of Critters,Dracula Untold,Control ,"Your very own horde of little creatures you control. About 10,000 of either mice/rats, or the same number in bats. Or you may have a mixture of them instead. They appear out of nowhere whenever you need them, and no matter how many die, they are always at full strength every time you summon them."
765,,200,One Against a Thousand,Dracula Untold,Control ,"It is not easy seeing friends and family die in battle, especially when you have the power to prevent it. It is not something you need to fear, however. Simply by stepping onto the battlefield, you have the ability to draw the enemy’s attention, so that they focus on you and you alone. They will ignore any and all of your fellow fighters, and focus all of their attacks, strategies and moves on you alone. This effect works only if the people you’re protecting don’t act, though. It’s broken as soon as they attack the enemy, and needs several minutes to resume."
766,,200,Jump-Lord’s Guard,Dresden Files,Control ,"Pixies, gremlins, dewdrop fairies, tiny Sylphs, and all other manner of small wildfae are now sworn to you. They come when you call, and can do all sorts of tasks in exchange for offerings of food or drink, most typically pizza.

This can be grown into something seriously powerful if you start heaping powers onto them and/or giving them responsibilities and authority and Favors."
767,,200,Dogasaurus Rex ,The Dresden Files,Control ,"Also called a Temple Dog, this gray behemoth is bigger than some bears and much better company. One of the rare few who inherited the full power of their Foo Dog ancestry, your new pet has a bevy of impressive abilities ranging from an alarm-like bark which can wake the dead, a nose more trustworthy than a bloodhound when it comes to supernatural threats, and a holy aura empowered by their home's Threshold which lets them chow down on hostile spirits. They're also tough as nails, smarter than most humans, and the kind of personality truly deserving of the name ""Man's best friend."" Seriously, best dog ever."
768,,200,Wild Man,Frozen,Control ,"Humans can be...complicated. They’ve got all these biases, beliefs, preconceptions and stuff. Animals don’t have that. Nice, simple and straightforward. A reindeer is never going to give you guff for not showering either. You get along so much better with animals, almost like you can speak to them and understand them. Even normally hostile creatures aren’t too hard to get to calm down and be friendly with you, so long as you’re not being threatening. You’ve also become a deft hand at wilderness survival, just in case you can’t find a warm house or barn to shelter in over the night."
769,,200,"“Corpse Control Bar"" ",Dark Souls 3,Control ,"A bizarre, gnarled tool made up of three, dusty sticks nailed together. It resembles an uppercase H with the horizontal stick extending past the vertical ones. Although not as powerful as a Pyromancy Flame, the bar can be used as a medium for Dark Pyromancy. Its true power lies in a very different ability though. The bar allows you to raise decayed corpses from the grave as loyal minions. Their newly animated movement and the steadily progressing rot usually leaves these minions as skeletons before too long. Corpses raised in this manner have a bit of their old skills in combat, but are a shadow of their old selves. Although you can usually only target humanoid corpses with the control bar, there is one special type of minion you can create. By dumping numerous corpses in a pile before targeting the lot of them with the Control Bar, you can raise a ""Corpse Ball"" or ""Skeleton Ball"". Skeleton Balls resemble a boulder made out of the compacted bodies of the ones used, and have the power to autonomously roll around and crush anyone who gets in their way. They can even grab anyone who gets close, yanking them underneath the crushing ball."
770,,200,"""Drake Knight""",Dark Souls 3,Control ,"Once dragon hunters, Lothric’s Knights have since tamed their former prey, adding their winged adversaries to the might of Lothric’s army and making them one of the most dreaded and powerful forces in the world during their heyday. Those days are long past, with the drakes you once fought alongside reduced to nothing more than feral, pus-possessed beasts, but that ability to subjugate your enemies remains. Simply put, the more you slay something, the more you’ll learn how to tame others of their kind in order to make them loyal to you. This is not limited to non-sapient creatures, though breaking the wills of beasts and conditioning them to your use is often easier than doing the same to a person. This will never reach the point of supernatural control; your methods are far more mundane, though they may grow in complexity and effectiveness. The kingdom of Lothric is no stranger to slavery, with their hood-wearing thralls and even their gate keeper, a stray demon who now lacks even a trace of flame."
771,,200,Wicked Fate ,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“Perhaps the labor of rotting flesh interests you not. Perhaps you wish to use it as a resource instead? Your subjects may still be of use in death, just perhaps not in any way they intended to be in life. You have the power to assert dominance over the flesh of the dead. The closer you are, the more effective your manipulations. Strip flesh from bone, make corpses walk once more, even mending damaged or degraded flesh so your puppets are more useful. Once dominance is asserted, you may even join their flesh with yours, building yourself up as a golem of rot made up of numerous bodies acting as an extension of yours. The process is slow, and extraordinary undead may resist your call.”"
772,,200,Verminous Fellowship ,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“Whether your body was already one of them or, you joined their ranks as a man, you are kin and ally to vermin. What crawls through trash, hides in the walls and lives unwanted by the world will come to your aid. Rats, roaches, ravens and more, pests and vermin no longer see you as an enemy unless you make an enemy out of them yourself. More than that, those same creatures do more than ignore you however, they will follow your commands to the best of their ability. Only those with wills and compunction to disobey like the Rat King and his most powerful servants would turn down your nobility. You are not king of all vermin, merely one of them.”"
773,,200,Midnight Ringing,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“What is death, but a form of rest? What is undeath, but waking up from that rest? To sleep is to die, to wake is to live. Soothing tone and alarming bell, sounds that both metaphorically and now literally usher in death and wakefulness. You may now sing a song of rest, or of restlessness. One allows you to soothe the willing dead or undead to rest, allowing them to sleep catatonically as if they’d never risen at all. The other enrages resting spirits within the area, causing them to rise and attack others in a tired fury. In addition to song, you may impart these two songs upon instruments and other musical objects, such as horns and bells. When played, those objects carry the same properties as the songs listed above. Even in the absence of your song, sleep is not far.”"
774,,200,Bewitching Song,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“A mind numbing melody, dulcet tones that can drag men straight to an untimely death. I was speaking of the voice of a demon, but would you like to possess such a voice? You have a beautiful singing voice. Ignoring anything supernatural or mechanical, you can enjoy being able to sing and acquire appreciation from that act alone. The main advantage of this perk however is the allure of your voice. Wanderers and lost souls who hear your singing with be attracted, and although it’s not impossible to resist, it is quite hard. Why would most try though, when they have no reason not to seek out the source?” "
775,,200,“Giant Crow Chick”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"This companion starts as a chick, a crow chick to be precise, one the size of a small child that speaks in an adorable combination of childish voice and squawks with speech quirks here and there. It now follows you around after having lost its nest, bonding near instantly. As times goes on, it will grow bigger and faster until it reaches adulthood and can fly across countries at extreme speeds while ferrying a fully armored human passenger with them. Like normal crows, giant crows have a keen eye for shinies, and your friend here will often pilfer or pick up valuables and shiny objects they see as they flit about as gifts for you. Gender and name are up to you, as is whether or not the crow will ever stop having a cute voice."
776,,200,“Bounding Demon”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"A giant, decomposed lower half of a once living dragon, brought to life by the demonic flames of Izalith. Bounding Demons consist of the demonic, undead legs, tail and partial spine of a dragon. Though without most sensory organs, this demon can still perceive its surroundings and follow your orders or protect an area at your designation, though its size means tight spaces are an impossibility."
777,,200,“Skill of Capra”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"Demons, warped into unnatural abominations by the twisted chaos flame. Perhaps foul nature can still be likened as nature of its own though, and through it things may grow and form an ecosystem, bonds and friendship. Something about your twisted origins allows you to much more easily tame, train and command abominable beasts that ordinarily have no capacity for such things, such as undead hounds or chaos eaters. Treat them as pets, guard beasts or your personal little executioners. When taken with Strength of Taurus, your corruption will bleed into the beasts, both warped and mundane, to give them similar rocky qualities."
778,,200,“Man’s Best Friends”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"The great grey wolf ‘Sif’, the giant cat Alvina, both wise and intelligent beyond their species for reasons unclear. With your home being such a mystical wood, wouldn’t additional conversational partners like them be nice? You have the capacity to uplift animals around you, making them much more intelligent and dexterous the longer their exposed to your presence. Although their body won’t change, they will become well capable of wielding weapons, complex thought and eventually speech. Normal animals will prioritize themselves first, but are usually amicable due to your favor. Animals that were explicitly loyal to you before like an old pet will remain completely loyal afterwards though. When taken with Cutthroat, your animal friends tend to drop off whatever valuables or treasures they find, having no use for them themselves."
779,,200,“Jolly Cooperation”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"Giving off the presence of an old friend, your warmth is able to improve the morale of those around you, allowing them fight better in situations that would otherwise leave them contemplating defeat. You’re also able to fight alongside most anyone you call an ally as if you’ve fought together for ages. The more natural form of teamwork is easily built with time as well with just a bit of effort on the parts of both parties."
780,,200,Bell Demon,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control ,"A handheld bell that houses a malevolent spirit. When you ring the bell, those hostile to you around you will go into a berserker-like frenzy, although, whatever spoils, loot, or whatever other gains you would receive from them will increase in amount; roughly 20% rounded down."
781,,200,Madaras Whistle ,Bloodborne,Control ,"“Whistle of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods. The twins grew up alongside a poisonous snake, and developed a silent, inhuman kinship. The poisonous snake grew uncontrollably, raised on a healthy diet of beast entrails. 

Even after their deaths, it is said to respond to the call of the twins' whistle from within the Nightmare. When this Hunter's Tool is blown, and four bullets worth of blood is expended, the ground begins to rumble, and that's a sign you should move.
 
In a moment, a massive snake head, a vicious illusion varying in power based on the quality of your blood, bursts from the earth to snap its jaws shut where you were standing when it was blown to deal tremendous crushing damage. Used to set traps for attacking enemies, or kamikaze attacks when you don't care what the snake does to you.”"
782,,200,Black Eye Stone,Demon's Souls,Control ,"Proof of a corrupted human,when used in Soul form you invade another person’s world to take their soul and regain your mortal body. Outside of this jump you may use this to summon invaders to attack someone you have met twice every ten years."
783,,200,Blue Eye Stone,Demon's Souls,Control ,Proof you have been accepted as a demon slayer by the monumental. When used in Soul form you are summoned to an other world to assist that slayer in their quest to slay a demon. Should you succeed you will regain your mortal body. Outside of this jump you may use this to summon blue phantoms to aid you twice every ten years.
784,,200,Beast Regent ,Elden Ring,Control ,"For reasons of your own, you have taken upon your back a great and noble lion of exceptional pedigree-perhaps a relative of Serrosh, King Godfrey’s famous regent. The great animal is a mighty and powerful beast capable of assuming a spiritual state in which it weightlessly looms over your shoulders, or taking physical form in order to battle your enemies. A loyal and dedicated creature, it is also capable of suppressing any turbulent emotions within you so that you may approach matters with clearer judgement-and somehow, appears to be a capable administrator by this land’s standards.

Having bought it here, you do not need to kill this creature in order to break your contract. A simple command will enable it to leave your side, permitting you to fight as you would with nothing holding you back."
785,,200,Ashen Summons ,Elden Ring,Control ,"As mentioned earlier, in this world life arises from death as much as death inevitably concludes life-and the spirit is not cleanly restricted to the flesh. Why not carry these principles of the world forward with you into other realities? Henceforth with a summoning bell from this world or a similar trinket, you will be able to conjure forth the spirits of beings in other realities as you would the ones here. The dead will require some sort of monument of rebirth (which this perk also gives you the knowledge and ability to craft) but virtually anything can be summoned in some fashion-legendary warriors skilled and armed as they were in life, spirits, strange beings that seem to be a halfway stage between the two like spirit jellyfish or artificial beings such as Albinaurics, even vermin like rats or mobile plants. And while with this alone there is no true mind control, those given the semblance of life in this manner are generally inclined to fight for you in instinctive thanks for the second chance of life you have granted.

For the living, you instead gain the power to lay down a sign which permits others to request your aid-and within touching distance, bless others with a similar power. This lets them come to aid you in battle as a tangible but translucent spirit form with all their powers and abilities, even in truly unusual locations. Though in both cases, without greater arts they will soon fade away- in the dead’s case, because of the fading magic. Though the living may stay, most choose to return to their own lives and bodies once the battle is over.

...most of the time, anyway. It appears a spirit jellyfish is free to simply come and go as it pleases once called, and it is unclear how unique this is among other beings."
786,,200,Shadow Mage,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Control,"​You are a Shadow Mage, a Wizard with strong abilities tilted towards the
shadows and darkness. This can have different implications in different fanfics, but at a minimum
you have the ability to travel through the ‘Shadow Realm’, a strange realm that exists alongside
the material world and connects all shadows to each other. It’s nearly instant in short areas, and
at its longest takes about five or six seconds for you to go from one shadow to another.
Also, you have a link to ‘Darkness’. This lets you wield it like a weapon at times, while at others
you can use magic based on it. At will, you can shape weapons and shields out of it, though those
don’t last long at all. Finally, your link to darkness and shadow extends to the beings that inhabit it. Creatures like Dementors and some types of Vampires consider you one of their own and tend to be friendly
towards you, at least until you do something to change this."
787,,200,Elementalism - Fire,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Control ,"You have a tie to one of the fundamental elements of nature, this being fire. You can summon it, shape it, and you are immune to any harmful effects it could have. The quality of your control is truly massive, greater than any of your predecessors. With the merest flick of your wrist, you can send conflagrations of flame at your foes with enough heat to burn steel."
788,,200,Elementalism - Water,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Control,"You have a tie to one of the fundamental elements of nature, this being water. You can summon it, shape it, and you are immune to any harmful effects it could have. The quality of your control is truly massive, greater than any of your predecessors. With the merest flick of your wrist, you can send summon large gouts of water from nothing but moisture, and pressurize it to a such a degree even bone could not withstand."
789,,200,Elementalism - Earth,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Control,"You have a tie to one of the fundamental elements of nature, this being earth. You can summon it, shape it, and you are immune to any harmful effects it could have. The quality of your control is truly massive, greater than any of your predecessors. With the merest flick of your wrist, cause the Earth itself to tremble, turn solid soil to quicksand, or spear your enemies with pillars of earth."
790,,200,Elementalism - Air,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Control,"You have a tie to one of the fundamental elements of nature, this being fire. You can summon it, shape it, and you are immune to any harmful effects it could have. The quality of your control is truly massive, greater than any of your predecessors. With the merest flick of your wrist, summon winds enough to bodily throw even the largest of men, and, with enough practice, you could control a hurricane."
791,,200,Nature Magic,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Control,"You have a powerful tie to nature allowing you to create a connection to any living thing in order
to promote healing, growth and send them directions. Sending them directions does not mean
you can speak to plants or animals but instead you can use a connection to transfer concepts
and ideas between you both in order to convince plants or animals to do tasks for you. With time
and training you could do much more with this connection such as casting a spell through the
link so that the spell originates from the target plant or animal."
792,,200,Musical Magic,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Control,"You have an innate connection to the flow of your magic allowing you to string together
numerous feelings, ideas, and concepts into a string of magical effects composed within a spell
song. Using this it is possible for you to sing a spell song using a magical language in order to
greatly enhance it and when using a spell song on a creature with magical resistance you will be
able to bypass its physical resistance to affect the mind."
793,,200,Thestral,Harry Potter,Control ,"A skeletal, reptilian, winged horse-like being that can only be seen by those who have seen someone die. Extremely fast in the air and excellent sense of direction. Seems to know where places you want to go are. Loyal but spooky."
794,,200,Parselmouth,Harry Potter,Control ,You have the rare gift of Parselmouth. As a Parseltongue you can talk to and control snakes. Slytherin house and Dark Wizards will likely show you more respect.
795,,200,Nundu,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A large creature that resembles a barbed big cat that can puff out its throat. Moves completely silently and is capable of exhaling a disease virulent enough to eliminate entire villages.
796,,200,Swooping Evil,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,"A winged vaguely reptilian creature with a skeletal head. Capable of shrinking into a small green ball that can be tossed by its handler causing it to swoop aggressively at a target before returning as a ball to its handler’s hand. Can suck out people’s brains and, when diluted, its venom can remove bad memories."
797,,200,Demiguise,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,Resembles a small primate with large eyes. Can turn invisible at will as well as magically predict the most likely outcome of any given situation making them exceptionally difficult to catch. They are also able to look after or “babysit” other beasts if left to it.
798,,200,Occamy,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A winged serpent that lays eggs of pure silver. Shrinks or grows to fit the space available to it although when truly outside of an enclosed space or room they seem to remain the same size. Comes with a teapot and a cockroach in case you accidentally let it out in a warehouse.
799,,200,Erumpent,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,"With an appearance like a giant, bulbous rhinocerous the Erumpent is capable of vast amounts of damage capable of charging through stone walls and steel gates. Anything the Erumpent pierces with its horn will explode."
800,,200,Graphorn,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,Large quadrupedal tentacle beasts that were driven to near extinction due to the value of their hides which is more durable than a dragon’s and repels the vast majority of spells.
801,,200,High Flyer,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,Whether on a broom or a giant bird you fly with such an effortless grace and speed that it seems as if you were born to soar. You feel extremely comfortable and exhilarated on taking to the air and seem to be able to squeeze so much speed and perform such manoeuvres that those watching would be forgiven for thinking some sort of magic is involved. After all there probably is.
802,,200,Squire's Devotion ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A group of about 20 vampiric squires, they have training similar to “Moment of Triumph” and are bound by a blood pact to serve you - capable of being resurrected from even their ashes by spilling fresh blood onto them due to this blood pact. "
803,,200,Sleek Schooner ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A flexible and fast nautical ship, it’s size makes it capable of navigating the Great Rivers of Ixalan as well as a manueverable vessel on the open sea...though small and relatively easily dispatched by the floating fortresses that the Dusk Legion pass as Galleons. "
804,,200,Commune with Dinosaurs ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"The bond between the people of the Sun Empire and the creatures of Ixalan goes beyond words and acts of domestication. By utilizing magic drawn from the world around, you are capable of calling upon the assistance of the creatures around you - capable of an empathic link with wild, undomesticated creatures and a limited form of emotional communication. While you can’t necessarily convince every beast to act with you, you now are capable of at least requesting assistance."
805,,200,Boneyard Parley ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"As Admiral Brass put it: “Any ship that sails on these mean seas for long is bound to pick up a ghost or two.” This is an old and dangerous world, and many people who leave this world tend to do it kicking and screaming - especially on the ocean. As such, their spectral remnants are a common sight on the waves and in the oldest of places in Ixalan. You can easily see and speak with them, learn the dangers and history of a place, and if you are charismatic enough, you can even press them into your service with a bit of convincing. "
806,,200,Training Equipment,MtG - Amonkhet,Control,"A set of weights and dummies that respawn an hour after destruction and are as heavy and durable as their user needs them to be. Also comes with an intact training mummy who will always be skilled enough to help you train, but cannot be used outside of training."
807,,200,Piper Of The Swarm,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"You have a way with song. You know how to call to creatures with a song and dance in your heart, either making birds sing and fly along...or perhaps calling rats to your side. It could even work on children or simple minded villagers, while this only works on the weak minded to an extent...if it has ears, it’ll dance to your tune."
808,,200,Wandermare,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"A good steed will lead you to glory, but a great steed will take you home. There are those who think the other way around, but you know the truth of it. This is a fae steed, a powerful horse capable of navigating the landscape with great amounts of courage and speed, being able to ride from one end of a court’s lands to another within hours. If slain, it’ll reform the next dawn hearty and hale."
809,,200,Vantress Gargoyle,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"Castle Vantress has little in the way of locks, but what it does have is the cleverness of its Archmage and loremages to rely on. A product of brilliant artifice, the Vantress Gargoyle is a simple yet effective defensive measure. Alert, with stony hide and the strength of 5 embereth knights, it has a simple mind but is loyal and able to follow commands to the best of its abilities."
810,,200,The Toys Move On Their Own,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"This one is a bit of an occupational hazard of craftsmen in Eldraine, sadly. Perhaps due to a fairy’s curse (or blessing), you have a habit (or talent) of having things you create become alive in some fashion, though it’s difficult to control how they manifest– suits of armor walk away, puppets become real boys, furniture dances and sings, and brooms take off and fly around, and cookies become brutish sprinting idiots. Mercifully, you’re also capable of commanding their love and attention in some fashion, enough to be able to have them be loyal allies and companions if you put a bit of time into understanding their new liveliness. "
811,,200,Pilgrim's Eye,MtG - Zendikar,Control,"An unmanned kitesail that will search for a safe place to set up camp, then fly circles between that location and the owner, leading them to it. One of the better ways to scout potentially treacherous terrain or areas where the winds may be too swift to risk a manned craft. If destroyed it will respawn in your warehouse at day's end."
812,,200,We Don’t Have An Army Of Jumpers,MtG - Zendikar,Control,"The Allied Army is a vast and diverse one, filled with the many people that rose from this vast ever-changing land. It is able to adapt to any situation, but if you don’t utilize them to their strengths you will never see their full potential. It is with a cool head that you are able to assess the strengths of all those under your command and utilize them to their best, even if you're a front-liner that doesn’t understand a lick of magic or archery, you would have the insight to make use of those mages and archers to great effect if given even a day to watch them in action or an explanation of their prowess by a subordinate."
813,,200,Anaba Bodyguards ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"Not all minotaurs are tribal, some do freelance work. Originally from a remote mountain tribe, some young minotaurs venture beyond their ancestral home. Unable to return, they usually end up submerging themselves in the vice and violence of Koskun’s underground city.

Four of these minotaurs have entered into your service as personal guards, each with the brute physical strength of a pit-fighting champion. Their bodies are covered in battle scars rather than the traditional ceremonial tattoos of their former tribe, they wear leather armor, and they carry heavy iron crossbows. Minotaurs like these make up the core of Koskun Keep’s security force, and there are few things they could not protect you from."
814,,200,Giant Albatross ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"Far bigger than a horse, these birds are capable of flying and carrying a rider great distances across the open sea. Sailors tell stories of these huge albatrosses drifting in the skies above their ships, equipped with saddles for unknown riders. Recently, they’ve started moving from some place far across the sea to the shores and coastline of the Homelands.

These great birds were first created when Feroz altered normal albatrosses into riding steeds for himself, out of a love for both riding and flying. Now you too get to own some of these flying steeds, four giant seabirds in total. Perhaps a gift from Feroz? Regardless, each bird comes trained to accept a rider and complete with saddle, stirrups and harness."
815,,200,Animal Handler,MtG - Homelands,Control,"The An-Havva area is home to a great many beasts and monsters. Some are magical and serve Autumn Willow, some are hunted down when they kill the people of the pioneer towns, and some are raised and bred in captivity. Trained mammoths pull heavy wagons and plows, horses are kept as transport, and even ferrets are trained albeit by less honest folk.

You’ve got somewhat of a gift for raising, breeding, and training animals or even monsters if you wanted to challenge yourself. Dealing with beasts of burden is child’s play for you, and you scarcely need the harnesses normally used for mammoths. Training animals to follow your directions takes longer, but with time you can make the most mischievous of creatures follow verbal commands or basic hand signals. You might even be able to figure out a way to domesticate monsters like the giant root spiders, if you really applied yourself."
816,,200,Hire Better Thieves,MtG - Homelands,Control,"When the food caravans supplying Koskun Keep were being constantly raided, causing food riots amongst the unruly populace, Eron the Relentless contacted the most powerful group of brigands and arranged to have them paid to protect the caravans rather than destroy them. This has worked out wonderfully, providing excellent protection and escorts along the road, in return for the road guards' nominal percentage.

You can do similar things, making lasting arrangements with the most powerful, dangerous, or skilled of the people that would work against you, to provide incredibly good protection against their former rivals. The best way to protect against thieves is to hire better thieves after all, and with you making the deals there won’t be any danger of your new ""hires"" double-crossing you. At least not as long as you keep them paid well enough."
817,,200,Bone King,MtG - Shandalar,Control,"Death is many things. A terrifying prospect for cowards who cling to safety, an idea considered ‘evil’ and ‘wicked’ by countless fools... for you, it is a tool to be used. Necromancy is rarely seen as a noble art, though on Shandalar the presence of the Black Guild at least ensures few will judge you openly. You are a master of such magics, capable of raising the dead, snuffing out an enemy’s life or even draining their vitality to restore your own health with an ease and effectiveness that would strike fear into all those who face you. 

Furthermore, your mastery over death and undeath have given you the means to extend your own existence beyond that of mere mortals. Existence, not life. Because much as the power of death can bestow great magics upon a practitioner of black magic, so too can undeath grant versatile and potent boons. Provided you die in such a way you rise as an undead creature, such as falling to a vampire’s draining bite or ending your life in a ritual suicide to complete a transformation into a Lich, your ‘death’ will not count as such unless you will it - ensuring your chain does not end with your untimely demise until it is truly your demise... and not just another step on your journey."
818,,200,Entombers Gauntlet,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"A clawed metallic gauntlet, sharp enough to cut through the vegetation of the bogs and mires the Thanes have made into their turf. Thanks to the inclusion of the necrogen present in the area in its design, it's capable of raising the corpses of the fallen into weak-but plentiful- walking dead. Whether they're used as a cheap workforce, or meatshields to blunt an offensive, they're certainly useful."
819,,200,Brutalizer’s Cane ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"A hooked cane made out of the metallic wood of Tangle, not only is it an excellent blunt weapon, but it's attunement with green mana has granted it the uncanny ability to sense nearby living (or unliving) creatures, and command those wild ones with weak wills."
820,,200,Deceiver’s Glaive,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"Devised by the Phyrexian scientists of the Progress Engine under close examination of their Praetor, this glaive-bladed staff projects a field that allows its wielder to sap the will of their enemies, keyed to only affect those it's user considers their foe. Strong or particularly willful individuals may resist this, but it is sure to make dealing with the rabble easier."
821,,200,Flay the Flesh,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"""Skin is the prison of the blessed and the stronghold of the heretic""-Argent Etchings. Your fervor for the teachings of the Father of Machines is commendable-and you may share it with others. By punishing their heretical ways - from small painful reminders like pinching them to grand acts like the public flaying of their wretched skin, you may instill upon them the same faith in your beliefs, influenced by how big this act is. Small acts are harder to resist and leave more of the original, but take more time, while breaking them in a single act will leave naught but their fervor and a broken mind. Even if you were to teach them something other than the Etchings, you find that after your teachings are complete, they'll listen..."
822,,200,A Steward For Your Shrine,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"Kami, as spiritual beings, have a tendency to lean away from the constant push for progress that parts of Kamigawa are so obsessed with - even the blue aligned ones care little for those goals. Despite that, there is one undeniably useful advancement that the Saiba has made, that any Kami of any real power desires. The shrine steward, a robot attendant designed to kiss their ass and maintain their shrines. Or possibly even build them, since there are several designs downloaded into its memory banks. Though admittedly, having the pull to get one of these and not already having a shrine is a bit hard to believe. On the other hand, maybe you want it to build you a second shrine? I could see a Kami wanting that."
823,,200,Imperial Moth Eggs,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"The moths of Kamigawa are large and unusual, plenty large enough for a man to ride upon whilst wearing full armor, sometimes even two. Before the invention of mechanical flight, they were the mainstay of the Imperial Armies aerial forces, and while they have faded somewhat they are still held as an elite unit that protects the skies of Eiganjo. You now possess a number of their eggs, and a small hatchery both to raise and train them as you will. Given no more than a year's time and they will be ready to ride into battle - though, if you actually do so or merely hand them over to the army and raise the next generation is a choice I leave up to you. If you wish, you may also have a single fully grown moth immediately, such that you may take flight and join the battle in the skies."
824,,200,Duplication Magic ,MtG - Kamigawa,Control,"This is actually a very common form of magic, though very few other than a single Akki known as Kiki Jiki Mirror Breaker managed to take it to the form that you have gotten it to. It drags reflections, which you must touch, out to form a perfect physical clone of yourself or another, though whilst a perfect physical copy it doesn’t have doesn't have any powers beyond its innate physique. Only lives for an hour before fading away, though you can then make another. The reflection can die and will do so if killed, fading when the duration is over. With training you can increase the amount of time before the reflection fades away. You can only produce one reflection and you don't control it, though a reflection of yourself is often amiable to persuasion and reflections of foes are loyal to you."
825,,200,Siblings Across Spirit and Body,MtG - Kamigawa,Control,"This allows you to exist as two ‘siblings’ at will. One is the Kami of your soul, forming the major part of your spirit, and the other is the original mortal body and now the pair of you exist as two minds and bodies unified and yet able to move and do as you wish, think of it as a perfect clone of yourself though if your other half dies you’ll be dealt a mortal blow in turn, communication between the two of you is done as if you were one mind but two consciousness."
826,,200,Faeries Come In Three,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"Why this is so, only the most learned of Lorwyn’s sages can say, but it is the truth. And so, you have gained two siblings to fill out your clique and share your mind. An unified whole, perfectly coordinated, yet still likely to bicker and gossip about each other. They are still faeries after all. Though as clique-prime, the eldest and first to awaken, you carry the awful burden of responsibility. Responsible for a faery that is, which mostly means keeping your siblings in line and enjoying life to the fullest.

If you are not a faery yourself, then the Queen Mother of the Fae instead bestowed upon you great influence over a full clique of faeries as a gift, a remarkably generous gift. Mother Oona might demand this particular gift returned, but not before you’re through with them.  As their new mistress (or master) you know what they know, they know what you know, and most importantly, they shall do as you command. With a thought, you could call them to attend to you and send them out on whatever missions you like. Just don’t keep them on too short a leash, or they might get sullen about the lack of mischief for them to get into.  Either way, your clique won’t count as companions or take up a slot unless you decide to import them somewhere else. You may also decide to import existing companions into these roles, though they won’t gain the benefit of following without taking a companion slot. 

And if one clique isn’t enough for you, you could also purchase this a second time, without any discounts, to recruit a swarm of young blossoms. Two dozen much younger faeries, not yet able to talk and weave much magic. And while they aren’t connected to you as closely as your own clique, they're nonetheless eager to volunteer and join you in your endeavors (if perhaps only because they hope to be there when the fireworks starts).

Similarly to your own clique, these faerie volunteers won’t take up any companion slots."
827,,200,Wellgabber,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"Speaking of customers, the merrow are known as the most mercantile of Lorwyn’s tribes, serving as intermediaries, diplomats, and merchants everywhere the near-omnipresent network of river-lanes reaches. Even landbound-villages usually have a well connected to riverways through underground lanes, allowing wellgabber envoys to pop up.

You might as well join in on these mercantile endeavors, as you already possess the quick wit and trading skills of the best of them, able to easily dominate conversations with landwalkers and your less-practiced fellows alike. The fact that you’re well-traveled enough to be sure to have excellent tales to tell doesn’t hurt either.

But your speech itself might be your most useful weapon, rather than any of the greatthe tales you might tell, because it’s not merely that your voice is steady, mellifluous, and rich with harmonics. No, you’ve learned to weave hypnotic glamers into your speech, which can prove quite influential to the unsuspecting listener. Some travelers have lost fortunes just by stopping to gossip with the clever merrows."
828,,200,Markov Dominance ,MtG - Innistrad,Control,"The Most prolific of the 4 main houses. Originating from Edgar Markov, the man that started this blight on the land. The Markov, and you should you take this perk, are gifted in psychic abilities when compared to the other houses. You will find you hypnotic gaze stronger and any spells that control others strengthened."
829,,200,Hollow Legion,Skulduggery Pleasant,Control,"An army of Hollow Men, animated skin bags bloated with a putrid green gas. Individually, they aren’t very powerful, and are best-suited to menial labor. Their true strength comes from sheer numbers, which they use to overwhelm their targets. Their skin is similar to paper, and they are unaffected by weapons without sharp points or edges. Their skin and the gas within is rather flammable though. Normal Hollow Men are rather easily torn apart, and deflate quickly. However, there is also a stronger, sturdier variety with skin so tough it would take a chainsaw to tear into them. This item gives you five hundred normal Hollow Men, along with one hundred of the enhanced version. It also comes with the knowledge of how to create more of both varieties."
830,,200,Reflection,Skulduggery Pleasant,Control,"Reflections are perfect copies on an individual created from a reflective surface. This is done by drawing a specific sigil onto the surface and stating a specific phrase. Normally this can only be used to create one Reflection for one individual, but as you paying CP for this, your version of this ability is unique. As long as you are in front of a reflective surface, you will be able to create clone after clone, and they each return to their mirror when their assigned task is completed, their memories transferring back to you. What’s more, you don’t need to worry about any of your Reflections becoming sentient and rebelling against you; all of your clones will be loyal to you and incapable of gaining independence. Do note that they do not possess your supernatural abilities or capacity for magic, only your knowledge and traits inherent to your biology. Reflections cannot make more Reflections."
831,,200,Big Bird ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Control,"The giant birds Artemyra are known for are frightening creatures just by size alone, with a wingspan several metres wide and a back large enough to fit a couple of full- sized human riders. Their beautiful, snow-white feathers and grace befitting a swan only serve to disguise their predatory cunning and ferocious strength, their razor-sharp claws serving as deadly natural weapons while also being large enough to pick up and carry a cow off into the skies. Isn’t it wonderful, then, that you’ve got one of these beasts on your side?

You have your very own giant bird, which serves as a completely loyal (and surprisingly affectionate) mount to you, capable of soaring through the skies with you on its back faster than a horse can run, and far further, too. If you’re endangered in any way, it makes an effective ally in a fight, either cleaving through your enemies’ flesh and bone with its claws or carrying them high into the sky before dropping them to their doom. Fortunately, if your lovely pet happens to die somehow, it will respawn within 24 hours as if nothing had ever happened.
"
832,,200,Birdwoman,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Control,"In Artemyra, the women have a special bond with the giant birds endemic to the region, allowing them to use these creatures as mounts for various purposes, both military and mundane. As it turns out, you, too, share this bond, perhaps even making you a unique case if you’re not female or even from Artemyra. Avian creatures, both mundane and supernatural, are naturally friendly towards you and, since you can also talk with them, you can ask them to perform simple requests for you. With a bit of effort, you could even convince them to become loyal allies.

But a friendship with birds isn’t all this perk gives – in addition, you also gain significant skill at riding flying beasts of all sorts, effortlessly getting them to soar through the skies according to your whims.
"
833,,200,Spare Self,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Control,"Yuki Terumi is an unusual person. His body is quite fake. After the failed experiment, he was left disembodied and in need of another one. Thankfully his conspirator Relius Clover had one prepared. Unfortunately, Relius himself was catapulted 80 years into the future and won’t be back for quite some time. The smelted body, Kazuma, had just enough time to begin to grow a personality - one quite similar to Terumi, obviously. In a similar manner, you now have a clone of yourself. It’s not quite a 1up, though it can be used as one under the right circumstances."
834,,200,Mind Eater,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Control,"Mind Eater is a rather nasty magic spell. Originally made by Izanami, reverse engineered by Yuki Terumi, and reverse engineered again by Konoe Mercury, aka Nine. You’ll be learning Nine’s version of the spell. Yes, there are differences between them. Anyways, this version allows you to simply override the targets ego - in other words, even someone who utterly hates you would cheerfully do anything you ask of them. Moreover, due to sabotaging their self interest, they can’t break out of this spell on their own. Someone else will need to help them. ...However, on account of me letting this spell go for such a low price, especially when this version doesn’t exist yet, I’m going to have to put a limitation on it. You can only use this spell on one person at a time."
835,,200,Beyond Those Wild Dreams,Campione,Control,"A Heretical God’s power isn’t defined by their fame, nor how powerful they were in their myths, but rather their will and determination. Traits which you have in spades. Why would a God like yourself shackle himself down to the perception of mere ants? Who are they to decide your origins or demise? Your journey is yours and yours alone. Not only is your presence in the world of mortals’ iron-clad, but all your powers are near their maximum while perceptions that would change you fail utterly, backed by your extraordinary willpower. Where others would be fragments, you are whole."
836,,200,Noble Retinue,Campione,Control,"Even within the ranks of the knights, you have special talents that separate you from the common ones. More specifically, a talent for finding talented individuals predisposed to becoming friends, rivals, or retainers with little effort, easily extending your sphere of influence and supporters. This also works towards other affairs, like finding good ways to make money and decent skill at managing what amounts to a modern-day fief, even if the world has moved on from feudalism. You could even lead your own Order eventually."
837,,200,Command Spells,Fate/Extella,Control ,"The sigils that show the Masters right to command his Servants. The Moon Cell regenerates these
seals at a fairly fast rate, one of the three signs on your hand restores itself each hour after it has
been used. They work as Command Spells are known to, allowing you to give orders to Servants that
cannot be disobeyed or grant them powerful buffs. A single spell could revive a badly wounded
Servant to full health or teleport them across a wide range, while all three could give a temporary
but enormous power up or allow the free and instant use of a Noble Phantasm. This option is free
for Master origin takers while in the jump but must be bought for 200 to be kept afterwards. Servants or Invaders can also buy and keep it for 200."
838,,200,Enemy Programs,Fate/Extra CCC,Control,"Having a dungeon for yourself is all well and good, but what’s the point if you can’t fill it with enemies to test those who brave the arena? You now have authority over several dozen enemy programs, of quite the wide variety. From weak mooks barely able to challenge even a weak Servant, to floor bosses that could give average Servants a bit of trouble in combat, you’ll be able to summon them essentially at will wherever you are, and set them to target someone in particular or give them some orders such as patrolling some section of a dungeon. Be careful of course, every lost enemy program will require a few days to reboot itself back to full functionality. They all look like a weird mix of eldritch and digital aesthetics, with even the least bizarre ones looking like large cybernetic floating eyes, but maybe that’s just fine for you?"
839,,200,Beast of the Soul,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"Talk of spirit animals is hardly just jesting back in these times and for inhuman beings, it’s almost
commonplace. Many monsters have a supernatural connection with a kind of animal, often one they
resemble themselves, such as the dreaded Gorgon Medusa and her snakes. Taking this allows you to
choose a kind of animal, such as snakes or spiders or wolves, and gain a potent magical association
with them. Not only can you expend your own magical energy to create these animals in different
kinds and, with enough energy, even supernatural capabilities, you can also freely command any
example of the species not more powerful than yourself. You can even turn parts of your body into
that animal or parts of that animal, such as turning your legs into those of a spiders or your hair into
snakes. In regards to skills or magic associated with your animal, you’ll also find greatly increased
ability. A snake would make you much more flexible , have greater skill with chain and whip
weapons and heightened ability at the use of stealth, along with thrice the power when using magic
specifically associated with snakes."
840,,200,Bridle of Bellerophon,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"A set of a golden whip and similarly made bridle, able to fit onto any beast that cannot actively resist
it being put on. Bellerophon is a magical bridle that can tame any Divine Beast, or lesser creature, that it is placed on and allow the owner of the bridle set to summon the creature the bridle is placed
on to them at will. Bellerophon greatly enhances the power of the creature it is bound to and allows
the owner to easily ride the beast, even with little prior training, and urge it to battle despite it’s original personality. The bridle can be recalled or removed at will, though this will free the beast it
once tamed."
841,,200,Binding Wraps,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"A pile of black and red ribbons lies before you, soft and comfortable on the skin but rather thin
looking. These are powerful sealing wraps, binding artefacts that aid the imprisonment of cursed
beings in a human body. Bound around the body, they can suppress the wearer’s powers at their will
and greatly aid in the aforementioned imprisonment process. Not only do they significantly reinforce
existing seals and bodily prisons, they also reduce the strain placed on the body by such a ordeal by
a large extent. Someone normally wracked with crippling pains and weakness because of the evil
spirit held in their belly could be reduced to merely having a constant light sickness and aching, enough to be a capable fighter still. The ribbons apparently work best when unobstructed, unfortunate given how risque it can make the wearer appear when covered by only thin straps of
cloth. But no one seems to mind you being two inches from nudity. "
842,,200,Sessho Seki,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"A killing stone made from the corpse of a terrible Youkai monster. Seeping from the cracked edges is
a poisonous curse that quickly slays most living beings, only those with powerful resistance to poison
or intense spiritual fortitude can withstand it. It doesn’t seem to bother you though, perhaps
whatever youkai created this stone would’ve been fond of you. It even allows you to break off small
fragments from the stone, which turn into spiritual familiars in the form of kitsune. While physically
weak, they can spread the Sessho-seki poison with their bite and are able to possess living beings. A
strong will can resist one fox but many at once can dive into the minds of a person, forcefully taking
over their mind and making them seem insane to onlookers. The stone will replenish lost fragments
over time, maybe even learning to communicate with you directly with continual contact. "
843,,200,Love Spot,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Control ,"There is a mark somewhere on your face, a spot or perhaps a small sigil or tattoo-like symbol. It
doesn’t mar your features at all, maybe even enhancing them some small amount. But this mark has
great magic within it, one that might normally curse you to an ill fate in regards to romance. This
Love Spot causes anyone of a different gender to you to, upon looking at this spot or symbol,
instantly and very deeply fall in love with you. They might not acknowledge these feelings at first or
may try to resist for the sake of an existing partner but these feelings will only grow stronger if such
things occur, till they can do nothing but admit their true and eternal love for you. It is possible to
resist this ability should one have a high degree of magical resistance, something that many
powerful beings in this world have innately, but without such a thing there is little defence. Beyond
lacking the means to feel love, terrible as that may be. You are able to control your Love Spot, deactivating it entirely or freeing those affected by it from the grasp of love as you wish. "
844,,200,"Husband, My Love",Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Control ,"Marriage means you own all your hubby’s stuff, right? Of course, that was why they married you in
the first place. They loved you so much, they wanted you to have everything they could give. Hoho, what a clever girl you are. Why, you figure that a special power is just as much yours as all your
partner’s wealth and lands. You’d not be wrong either, since you now have the ability to borrow a
single ability or item from any past spouse or long term intimate lover you have had in the past for
your own uses. Spent a few months married to a precognitive King? Just take that power for your
own when you need to check the future. One of your more cherished boytoy’s had an excellent
sword you could really use in the current fight? Drop that future sight and the sword can appear in
your hands, ready for use."
845,,200,Personification,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"Humanity has always sought to personify that which it encounters. Sea vessels given names and
referred to as if they have feelings, swords considered trusted companions, entire nations being
thought of as having aspects through which they manifest in times of need. Some of these are even
true but with your intent, they might all be confirmed. You have the ability to give a humanoid form
and mind to things without it, not merely objects like a ship or sword but even including locations
like a castle or nation as well as ideas like a story or philosophy. It does not remove the original form
of them, this new humanoid shape instead acting as an avatar that can control their origin. They
have no inherent positive or negative feelings towards you for granting this form and depending on
your relationship with their origin, might be anything from a loving ally to a hateful foe. The greater
their origin, the greater the power of the avatar, with this greatness taking many forms. A simple
steel sword or wooden sail ship would have little power beyond controlling the movement of their
form. A powerful magical blade or the spirit of a globally famous story could be quite the fearsome
foe in combat, even for a Heroic Spirit. Something on the scale of an Empire’s avatar or a widespread
philosophy would be terrible indeed."
846,,200,Master of Puppets,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"Everyone is born with talent for something, your talent just happened to be making life. When it
comes to magic involved in the creation of familiars, even the summoning of them, you’re miles
beyond any of your peers. While you are not the best in the world with just this, your raw skill and
power with magic still lacking compared to the greats, you’ll find anything in relation to the creation, alteration and maintenance of magical familiars, summons and living creations comes to you with
the ease of breathing. You learn far faster, your products are of a vastly higher quality and come
with far more efficiency than what your fellow magicians might create. It is even far more cost
efficient for you to make them, as you take just a quarter of what others would expend to create the
same things.

You have particular talent too in ensuring the loyalty of that you consider a familiar, whether this be
designing the minds of creatures you create as easily as you design their bodies or creating lines of
spell or rune magic to add to a summoning ritual to ensure much stronger bonds of servitude exist
on what you summon. It also happens that you are quite good at creating and overlooking legal
contracts, mostly from all the interaction with demons. "
847,,200,Immortals,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control ,"A royal guard fit for even the greatest of kings. As you command, ten thousand immortal warriors
will rise from the ground around you to serve your whims. This legion of undead warriors, horses
and even a few giant monster elephants is eternally bound to you and your will, a sleepless legion
that requires no sustenance nor rest and yet retains all the intelligence, tactics and fighting skill of
one of the most elite fighting regiments the world has ever seen. Even should one of your ten
thousand be harmed, they will reappear only a day later to fight again in your name. The Immortals
can be summoned wholly or in part, requiring only a word from you to do so."
848,,200,Tarasque,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"A terrible beast if there ever was one. This cruel looking creature once terrorised rivers and seas, destroying ships and slaughtering men like a a farmer would cut through his wheat field. Some say
the beast is a child of the Biblical Leviathan. Yet the creature was defeated, slain or even tamed
depending on the tale. Maybe you were the hero that did so, given the creature waits loyally at your
side now. The Tarasque is a large dragon, easily bigger than any human ship, and can move faster
than normal humans can perceive. The creature is tough enough to walk through an army of magical
warriors without a scratch and strong enough to tear through even powerful warships with ease. It
obeys your commands loyally, though the beast is stupid and cannot comprehend more than basic
commands. Just command it to destroy and watch it spew blindingly-hot flames everywhere. As the
master of the Tarasque, you can also summon the beast to yourself or just summon parts of it, such
as making the shell of the creature appear around your body as a shield."
849,,200,Queen of Idols,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Control ,"The celebrities of the older eras, the royalty was there to act both as leaders and as symbols for their
nations. It is merely the fate of some to fall even deeper into this. For better or worse, people assign
immense importance to you. As an ally or enemy, they will value you greatly, your personage
occupying their mind often. The emotions others feel towards you are greatly enhanced in this way,
leaving little room for others to have neutral or moderate feelings towards you unless they strongly
tend towards such things. While you have little outright control over this, though it’d make you a
terrifyingly potent manipulator of people should you gain such skills, you do have another idol-like
trait. A magical voice, both in terms of your lovely singing voice as well as the mesmerising effect
your vice has on others. Not particularly strong, a strong will is enough to resist much less actual
magic resistance, but it is almost impossible to notice that there is a magical effect embedded in
your voice. Subtle works against your enemies but combined with your controversial nature, a
potentially powerful weapon for you."
850,,200,Guillotine Breaker,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Control ,"With a tinkle to each step, this crystal horse shines with beauty. A royal steed if ever there could be
one to fit the name. Guillotine Breaker, due to it’s crystal make-up, is an almost unbreakable horse
but it otherwise acts and moves as if it were a normal warhorse of the time, albeit one already very
fond of you. The presence of the horse will slowly heal you and allies of wounds and ailments, soft
light bathing such injuries until they disappear in time. Should it be shattered, Breaker will reappear
at your call after a day of rest."
851,,200,No Curse Zone,Angel Notes,Control ,"The dead don’t always stay dead. Those killed don’t always die. But at least you can make sure that
the process of trying to beat them six feet under is one with much less collateral damage. You killing
something or defeating it, successful in making it stick or not, will prevent any death or defeat linked
effects from occurring. Creatures won’t give you a death curse for killing them, they won’t be able to
let loose one last curse with their final breath, no final explosions to destroy the entire continent
around you. They just die. Of course, they may come back to life but…if you did it once, you can do it
again, eh? At the very least any of that death-linked ‘grow stronger every time I revive’ stuff won’t
need to be dealt with. Nasty shock for the bad guy."
852,,200,Beloved,Angel Notes,Control,"There is a deep, intimate bond between you and your planet of origin. The relation between you and
your stellar object, be it a planet or moon or star, is like that of parent and child. It fiercely protects
you so long as you do not turn against it and you may always remain in contact with it. Other planets
are more like distant cousins. You retain your ability to speak directly with the spirit and
consciousness of any such stellar object and to be treated at worst as a neutral party, if not given
some degree of favour from the beginning. It isn’t difficult for you to cultivate close relationships
with such titanic beings, so long as you continue to prove you are on their side you will grow closer, though such feats may be very difficult for something less than an Aristoteles to accomplish. Eventually they too might give you their aid, influence and even power, should you earn it."
853,,200,Best Friend ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Control ,"A magus the same age as you. You have 600 CP to build them, and 300 CP to buy them items. And they get a free Magic Crest. They are a trusted friend and companion from your past in this world, and will be more than happy to follow you to strange new worlds."
854,,200,Volumen Hydragyrum Meido ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Control ,"An autonomous mystic code designed with a simplistic personality designed with the appearance and function of a maid, though it also has combat capabilities and some pretty impressive computational abilities. Can be condensed into a vial for easy transportation."
855,,200,Black Keys ,Tsukihime,Control,"Short swords designed to be thrown, these Conceptual Weapons are effective against spiritual entities. By striking an opponent's shadow you can bind their movements; and it's significantly more difficult to remove them by hand when this is utilized, giving you the chance to strike at them. A Church Executioner with Iron Plate Effect receives this for free."
856,,200,Mystic Eyes of Enchantment ,Tsukihime,Control,"You have a set of powerful hypnotic eyes, which can be used to plant suggestions and alter memories of those who make eye contact with you. It doesn't work as well on other beings with supernatural power, though if you catch them unaware you might be able to do something subtle. This is more powerful than modern day Hypnosis Magecraft, and as a result is more difficult to resist."
857,,200,Familiar Master ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"Most Magi are not fighters or soldiers. While they’re certainly threatening in general, many lack experience in war and most see risking their lives like that as barbaric. So they rely on others. Most commonly, they rely on familiars, a category of being that you are oddly gifted with. Outside of just a specialisation in magic, you appear to get significantly greater results than normal in anything regarding familiars. Your efforts to create them result in more powerful creatures made for less costs, while attempting to attract existing creatures to become your servants most often ends in a quite powerful new ally who is rather lenient in their required contract. You’ll quickly become well versed in using multiple familiars in your goals, particularly making use of them in combat instead of fighting yourself, and even find that maintaining familiars is relatively cheaper for you. A weak magus might not be much of a threat but if he had ten loyal spirits aiding him, they could most certainly take down even much larger game. In particular, any magecraft you know will soon reveal to you ways that it can be entwined with any familiars you have, sometimes stretching the boundaries of what’s normally possible in those disciplines when used for your focus here. Often methods to enhance your familiars during creation or battle, it may also show ways to create entirely new kinds of familiars. Perhaps a Doll Making specialist would learn to make familiars out of their own selves with this, an army of one!

They’re small animated golems, bright colors and with animalistic and loyal intelligence. These PlaMonsters come in a few varieties and can be commanded to do anything their small(many can be held easily in your open hand) bodies will allow them too. You get one of each of the following:

Red Garuda​: A bird-like familiar powered by the Garuda Wizard Ring. It is used to perform aerial reconnaissance.

Blue Unicorn​: A unicorn-like familiar powered by the Unicorn Wizard Ring. This PlaMonster performs ground-based reconnaissance and can use its horn to dig into the ground to provide support by distracting the target.

work for you. They’re rarely competent unless you actually go looking for people with the skills
you need, but these are henchmen. Pushing your deathtraps around and ganging up on unwary
trespassers don’t exactly require a lot of critical thinking. If you promote one to a higher position
like team leader or personal assistant then they’ll become more loyal to you over time and more
easily gain useful skills."
861,,200,Hypnotism ,DC Occult,Control,"Whether by some skill you've picked up or by an innate ability, you are able to hypnotize someone, making them extremely susceptible to manipulation for a short time. This only really works on normal people and can be resisted with enough willpower, but only requires eye contact or a small visible gesture to activate."
862,,200,Demon Butler,Justice League Dark,Control,"A demonic butler, bound to your will and your property. Completely and unerringly loyal, this demon is quite well mannered and skilled and looking after your belongings. He is also able to shift into a more powerful form to defend them.

863,,200,Suicide Goats ​,A Practical Guide to Evil,Control,"A tribe of goats, slain, emptied, then stuffed full of goblin munitions before being reanimated as zombies, I can’t imagine what you’d do with these. Surely, there’s no practical purpose for a tribe of explosive undead goats, right? You’ll get another goat every morning.
"
864,,200,Tamer ,Libriomancer,Control,"Perhaps as a consequence of your own inner monster, real ones seem to respond better to you. Non­-sapient creatures that may be considered “monsters” do not immediately attack you instead regarding you with cautious gestures of trust. You may build up a rapport with such monsters, gaining their trust and allowing you to train them more easily.
"
865,,200,Necromancy ,Valkyrie Profile,Control,"Far from a dabbling student, you actually have quite a bit of experience in Necromancy already. Far more than just raising the dead as mindless thralls, though this is within your power, necromancy also involves experimenting on or manipulating souls, summoning spirits and undead bound to you, and temporarily altering the body. While extraordinarily versatile, Necromancy is not an offensive or combat art, and requires preparation and research to properly utilize. You would have to cast the proper spells on a pile of gathered bodies to create your troop of skeletons, and then inscribe the ritual circles and channel your magic through them with an incantation if you wanted to summon them in battle, for example. Thankfully there are ways to prepare parts of this beforehand, and the clever necromancer always has something up their sleeve.

866,,200,Tomb Swarms ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"The energy within your tomb, that which seals the tomb and brought you back to life, has seeped into the very ground surrounding the tomb. Countless dead animals, from rats to spiders to scorpions to birds, were turned undead by this aura. Curiously, the fact that it emanates from the tomb seems to have slaved their wills to that of the master of the tomb. Thousands upon thousands of these Tomb Swarm creatures surround your tomb, buried in the shifting sands and within hidden pockets inside the tomb itself, ready and waiting to spring out and attack any who come near. (CG Note: Requires base Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first. Obviously.)

The two of you are already well acquainted with each other and this great beast will always work well with you as its rider. However, not all horses within Bretonnia are equal. There are multiple tiers to purchase, as described below, though you need only pay for the option you are purchasing and not everyone before it.

Instead, for 200CP, you may gain the services of one of the fabled Unicorns, horned horses. Free for any Damsels who wish to have a horse, these beings are pure steeds that will only let you or those pure of heart on their backs. They require no saddle, giving a comfortable ride to any worthy rider, and can run as fast as a Royal Pegasus can fly. They dislike combat but can utilise their horns to lethal effect when needed, though the touch of the horn can also heal all but the most grievous of wounds or sicknesses.

869,,200,Medium Kit ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"The perfect kit for becoming a fortune teller, or so it seems. The outfit and crystal ball will fool people into thinking you are a fortune teller, but it grants you no actual abilities as a seer. However, you can use your crystal ball to imprint single suggestions into individuals seeking advice, such as telling them to throw their most prized possession into the ocean. After the victim follows the action, he or she will regain control of herself, and may very well change her mind."

The Mafuba that you have learned is a mystical technique created to seal away other beings, originally demons but it works on any being. With the incantation, proper movements and expenditure of a great deal of personal energy, you are able to activate the Mafuba and suck away a target being in front of you to seal them inside a prepared container. Any container that can be sealed tightly with a special seal tag, which you are aware of how to make, can work even if you use something like a rice cooker. It can be difficult to aim the technique, especially when using a small container and you are vulnerable to being interrupted or having a different being jump in front of your target, so careful planning can be required to have the technique work. Once sealed, they can only be released by opening or breaking the container the target was placed in.

When thrown, the cards come to life and work to aid you in combat, most often by distracting opponents. The cards are quite agile and are hard to hit. After 15 minutes from being activated, a thrown card will become inanimate and cannot be used until a day has passed.
"
876,,200,Scarecrows ,Wonderland No More,Control,"Animated constructs of sticks bound by vines and a lit pumpkin head, these fiends are clever but ultimately mindless and bound to your will. Immune to fear, diseases, poisons, and even fire, they still have one weakness: if the flame in their pumpkin head is put out, they will fall over and die. You get 6 Scarecrows with this purchase. You will get a replacement for each lost Scarecrow once every blue moon (it will take multiple blue moons to replace more than one Scarecrow).
"
877,,200,Baby Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"For some... unknowable, ungodly reason. The most famed of the halfling regiments are known for their generals taking to the field on the backs of baby dragons. No one knows what happens after the dragon grows up into the terror of an adult - given the stories of another dragon being eaten alive, I’m not sure I want to know. One would think halflings would be sensible and stick to their ponies and rams, but alas. We aren’t sensible. 

You have in your care just such a baby dragon, a tad too ‘ickle’ to fully use its breath attack and small enough that its scales are still a tad soft, but still savage enough with its teeth and claws. The hatchling’s a Fire Dragon of the World’s Edge Mountains, and in time it will grow into a ferocious fire-breathing monstrosity that has earned its place at the top of the food chain. But for now, it's small enough to bear a pony’s saddle and bear a halfling’s frame. How’s that going to change once it grows up? Well that’s not my problem now is it.
"
878,,200,The Little Book ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"Connections. Contacts. Names. All these and more are required to make it big in the fields of business and politics. And this tool will help with that particular detail: A little leather book of names, all being people you either know directly, can become easily acquainted with, or have some tangential connection to. Whenever you need to call upon one of the contacts within The Little Book, coincidence and luck will conspire to ensure they’re both available, able, and willing to help you with whatever favor you may require of them. Just be prepared to pay them back in return, if you wish to keep that name in The Little Book. The Book, by mysterious and arcane means, keeps itself up-to-date on the individuals you may be able to learn of and call upon in times of need.
"
879,,200,HAWKS OF MISKA ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Control,"An entire flight of 10 or so of the great blue hawks of Kislev that aided Miska and were forever changed, becoming beings of frost and spirit as much as flesh and bone. Their cold, terrifying shrieks herald them on the battlefield, are resistant to most magics, are more agile, much larger and far stronger than mundane hawks and their talons and beaks alike are enchanted with ice magic to rip easily through plate armour. They will follow your directions on the battlefield precisely and generally do your bidding.
"
880,,200,Horn of Kygor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"A magical, gold banded warhorn which emits a terrifying, deep bass note that causes non-sapient beasts to go into a murderous frenzy. The magic of the horn is such that when sounded the affected beasts gravitate towards your enemies.
"
881,,200,Van Horstmann’s Speculum ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"This little mirror was something a much younger Egrimm van Horstmann designed so as to aid the common soldier in times of war. When worn, it allows the wielder to swap their own fighting capabilities with those of the enemy reflected in it. Its power is limited by wards placed on it after the expulsion of Van Horstmann, but it will still be useful against even the likes of a Chaos Lord. Should you be a more proficient fighter than your enemy, you would be better off having an ally wield this.
"
882,,200,Pegasus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Though appearing simply like winged horses, these steeds of the air are omnivorous, exceptionally loyal, and according to some, fly by means of riding the Winds of Magic themselves. Their feathered wings have carried many a Wizard into battle or out of it to safety, and the Supreme Patriarch even has an especially swift one by the name of Quicksilver. It should come as no surprise that you now possess one as well, a noble and loyal mount to ferry you in all your future endeavors.
"
883,,200,Chaotic Tamer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Control,"The Chaos Wastes are filled with creatures that seem as if they come from the nightmares of men than the world itself. These creatures can slow or even outright stop the advance of Old Worlder armies that attempt to move through the Wastes for whatever foolish reason. Anyone else would find that interacting with creatures of this caliber is a terrible idea. But not for you. You’ll find that you can actually build rapport with these nightmarish creatures, as well as other seemingly completely untamable beings so long as you are able to keep them restrained long enough to actually interact with them. With enough time, patience, and training these creatures could be implemented on the battlefield alongside your armies. Perhaps even as mounts. Do note that this does not apply to proper daemons, just the gruesome magical creations below them.
"
884,,200,Glean Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Control,"Tzeentch is the God of Sorcery, and he will not allow his minions to be bested in the arcane arts. Once per day, you may redirect any magic that you see casted by someone else. If a wizard fires a fireball towards your army’s lines, you can quickly fling it back. If someone attempts to use magic to seduce you, you can direct it back to them, or anyone else within the range of the mage that casted it. Do keep in mind that the spell is still coming from someone else, and that you need to be just as magically adept as the enemy mage or better to gain control.
"
885,,200,Ancient Seals ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Control,"“Together they defeated the Demon King Ganon - and sealed him away in darkness.”

A series of enchanted relics along with instructions on their use. When a ritual is performed with these relics on a defeated enemy, that enemy can be sealed away using their power, preventing them from awakening indefinitely. There is no way for them to escape this imprisonment on their own, and only someone with powerful magic and knowledge of their whereabouts can release them.
"
886,,200,Animated Armor ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Ganon is fond of working through proxies, a habit that has bled over into Agahnim. This item can come in two variations. The first is a swarm of enchanted armor that will move on their own, follow your orders, and hunt down irritating heroic wannabes. On their own they are only equal to a normal knight, but there are at least 100 of them. Or the second choice, you may choose to have a statue of Ganon - or yourself. While this statue will lack any magical capacity, being only a statue, being made of stone makes it far more sturdy than almost all of the lesser armors put together. Each choice comes with appropriate weapons, swords, shields, and spears for the ‘knights’, and an utterly massive trident for ‘Ganon’.
"
887,,200,Hylian Masterwork ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"While Hyrule may end up leaving it’s own fate in the hands of the Hero in Green more often than not, that’s not to diminish what it’s more ordinary knights can accomplish. This armor is meant to be that of a fully fledged Knight of the realm, and it’s suitably imposing. It’s defensive properties leave most simple weapons straight up bouncing off, and simply wearing it will call a handful of soldiers out of the woodwork to aid you in battle. Even the weapons it comes with are impressive, if ordinary, such as massive greatswords or the iron ball and chain. Of course, if you aren’t a knight or don’t wish to step onto the field of battle yourself, the armor is also remarkably receptive to magics such as possession. Simply find some schmuck to wear it and fill the both of them with dark magics and boom, instant miniboss. It would be stronger for someone competent, but those sort tend to be harder to control.
"
888,,200,Yujin Gashapon Figures ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"During the era of the Minish Cap, a strange craze for figurines swept across the land. Small wooden people, carved into the shape of various figures. At one point, it seemed like everyone in Hyrule had one - both in the sense the owned one and that there was one of them. Somewhere along the line someone thought to weaponize them, resulting in this set of four pint sized statues of the Hero of Men. Each one bears a miniature Four Sword, a shield, and a secondary weapon - a false fairy for healing, a bomb for exploding, a bow for shooting, and a handful of Rupee fragments for throwing at people. Individually they’re quite weak, only able to take down the weakest of monsters, but together they can reliably take down more normal monsters. Each of them comes with a small supply of their miniature ‘ammunition’, but it’s not quite enough to fight for more than an hour or two per day unless you stock up first. They do need to be recharged every so often however, so please make sure to keep their magic reserves topped off - or to find a Fairy willing to help you.
"
889,,200,Fairy Handmaids ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"No Fairy of rank is ever without a lesser Fae to command and lord over, and while your rank is still up in the air, you now hold command over a small number of other Fairies. You may choose between eight lesser Fairies, the kind that the heroic sort would typically seek out for healing, and three Servant Spirits that would assist said hero on his journey. These lesser Fae are a step above their brethren, able to heal their contractor many times over what the normal limit would be, saving their life twice, perhaps even three times before returning to your side. The Servant Spirits on the other hand, are incredibly wise and both capable and willing to offer advice, something any prospective hero would benefit from immensely. While their healing magic is minimal, they are instead capable of inducing a state of hyper focus in their contractor to assist them in a fight.
"
890,,200,Greater Summoner ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Summoning, the act of bringing forth something or someone from somewhere else. The most powerful being Cia who brought forth entire eras and armies, though more than a bit of an outlier considering her reliance on the Triforce and Gate of Souls for such feats. 

Summoning is arguably the most widespread of magic with members of every army having more than a few. Perhaps it’s because it is so valuable in war that it’s fostered among varying militaries. 

Summoning, to put it simply, is bringing something from somewhere else to where you are now. The larger and farther away the object, the harder it is to summon. The less familiar you are with an object, the harder it is to summon. 

Normal summoners within this war are used to summon reinforcements as a result, limited to bringing forth allies one at a time from nearby camps. You have a bit more skill in the art and can summon several allies at a time or call up objects as large as an elephant, and put them back too.
"
891,,200,Fierce Deity's Drum ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Control,"In truth, when the dragon was faced with the man who would slay it, it questioned him. Why have you come, what do you seek, what is your wish, so on and so forth. Despite asking, he believed not a single word from the man, but was left speechless by a counter - “what is your wish?” After sitting in an empty land for a thousand years, he wished for time to move, for something, anything, to happen. The man pulled out a drum, and began to play. For three days and three nights the man played and the dragon danced, and on the dawn of the fourth day, the dragon died. This drum may not be that drum, but it carries the same magics - when you begin to play, those who hear it have no choice but to dance to your beat.
"
892,,200,Switch Hook ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Control,"The Switch Hook is probably related to the Hookshot somehow, but the exact nature of their relationship escapes me. When you fire off it’s pincer-like head, it will grab onto whatever it’s aimed at - assuming it’s within range, as this thing only has so much chain - and swap you with it. That’s right, not grab it and drag you towards it, or grab it and drag it towards you, full on swap places. Alongside this interesting device comes a Blue Joy Ring, which causes any healing magic directed at you to be doubled - such as the Hearts a hero would find hidden in grass, or from a defeated enemy.
"
893,,200,A Chest Full of Demons,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Control,"Well, not really, like Vaati and Ganondorf you have an ability to conjure servants to do your whims. Weak soldiers are easy enough to conjure even at the start you could create dozens of Moblins or Octorocks but only six or seven Wallmasters or Darknuts. With time, and as your magical energy and skill grows your skill at summoning will grow to frankly incredible levels with growth stopping around the level where you could conjure an army, hundreds of mooks per summoning and dozens of high tiered monsters summoned if you summon no mooks. Though growth past the point is possible it will take exponentially more time and effort for each additional summoned minion.
"
894,,200,Me And My Shadow ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Control,"You will find, in the tales of old, that evil is often alone. When the Hero confronts him atop his tower, who stands by his side? No one. While evil may not have friends, he does, more often than not, have minions. For this reason, you have torn away your own shadow from the ground, and given it a fragment of your magic. While you can see through its eyes and hear through its ears, you do not have perfect control over it, and it’s intelligence is lacking. If it’s destroyed, it will merely fade away and return to you, ready to be fed more magic and sent away again."
895,,200,Mark and Recall,TES: Magic,Control,"For the traveling mage, walking back and forth can be quite an
annoying and time consuming experience. Thankfully, there are magical solutions. You
now know of a unique variation of the Mark and Recall spells. You can leave an almost
unlimited amount of permanent Marks, one of which is automatically placed within your
Warehouse. And by casting Recall, you can choose any of the Marks you’ve left behind
to teleport to. You can remove any of the Marks you want, but most will be lost at the
end of a Jump."
896,,200,Necromancy ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"Necromancy isn't looked upon in a positive light, but it's practitioners appreciate the power it brings. You are a skilled necromancer, knowledgeable in summoning spirits and binding the dead. You can also permanently reanimate bodies and summon powerful undead from the Soul Cairn."
897,,200,Purple Suits You ,Undertale,Control,"You have the ability to trap your foes in a strange purple web. Like Blue or Green attacks, this is a technique that limits your foe's range of movement. You can create a mysterious purple web in the air or on the ground in a 10 m radius, and the moment someone touches it, they're bound to it. Once bound, your foe can move freely along the strings, but attempting to move off of one string will instead jump them to the next one, and they will find leaving the arena much more difficult than they should. If your foe is capable of flight, then your web will appear midar- Otherwise, it will appear on the ground. Unlike previous techniques, you may trap multiple foes with your web."
898,,200,Summon Weapons (Advanced) ,Terraria,Control,"Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. 

Get a Summoner Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made with an early Hardmode ore [Cobalt, Palladium, Mythril, Orichalcum, Adamantite, Titanium, Hallowed Bar] or which are listed here: Blade Staff, Spider Staff, Pirate Staff, Sanguine Staff, Optic Staff, Pygmy Staff, Queen Spider Staff, Lightning Aura Cane, Flameburst Cane, Explosive Trap Cane, Ballista Cane, Firecracker, Cool Whip, Durendal

See Summon Weapons for more information."
899,,200,Monster Taming ,Danmachi,Control,"Any monsters that you battle, if you defeat them and leave them alive, will acknowledge your strength and allow you to capture them easily. This also makes you skilled at controlling your damage that you can inflict towards others to the point where you can throw a city-destroying attack or spell only for the target to gain a slight burn or bruise. As long as you show affection and don’t abuse them, any monster that you captured would develop undying loyalty towards you to the point that they would sacrifice themselves to receive a mortal blow meant for you."
900,,200,Divine Relic ,Konosuba,Control,"That’s a pretty necklace. It’d make for an awfully nice gift...for someone you wanted to do something nasty to. It may look like nothing more than a particularly extravagant and gorgeous necklace, which it also is, but in reality this piece of jewelry is an old relic that enables the user to swap bodies with another person. By placing the necklace on someone and chanting a specific ritual, you are able to swap your mind into their body and their mind into your body. The change is permanent unless the ritual is performed once more."
901,,250,Titania,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control,"Once titled the ‘Queen of the Valkyries’, she was an S-Rank who was set to become the strongest Valkyrie in history. She was a survivor of the second eruption, but her kind heart did her in. In an incident lost to history, she single-handedly held off an entire Honkai army for six hours. By the time backup arrived, she was still fighting with no arms and down a leg. Now with prosthetic limbs, she has been ‘demoted’ to A-Rank due to a loss of combat ability, but that potential still lies dormant..."
902,,250,Abnormality Affinity(ALEPH),Lobotomy Corporation,Control,"Choose an abnormality. For some inexplicable reason, that abnormality has become more agreeable. Working with that abnormality now produces your most desired results. After the jump, the abnormality's individual cell can be added to your warehouse as an extension. You can work with it in order to produce energy or bring it along with you as a companion (if it's capable of movement). 
        
May be Purchased Multiple Times"
903,,250,Monster Egg,King Arthur ,Control,"I'm not sure how you did it, i'm not even sure what is in it, but you somehow came into possession of a Monster Egg. As you might know monsters are some of the most powerful creatures in this world and most, if not all, imprint on the first being they come in contact with. Therefore you won't have to be worrying about it just running off somewhere so, Congratulations you've become the parent of a horrible monstrosity!"
904,,300,Possession,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Control,"You are drawn into another being as a spirit,
possessing them. At first only a simple-minded
animal like a rat or hound, but with enough practice you can switch between hosts without
resuming your corporeal form, possess corpses or
sleeping bodies, and finally fully conscious humans,
leaving them dazed and confused once you exit them
and resume a physical body."
905,,300,Bend Time,Dishonored 2 Part 1,Control,"Slows time for a short period, allowing you to dodge
bullets and act with alarming speed. Further
enhancements stop time completely, allowing you to
act unseen, enhance your own speed relative to the
affected time, and extend the window in which you
have to act. This power also allows you to act in the
same frame of reference as another person who uses
slow or stop time with you in its area."
906,,300,Suicide Squad,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Sometimes you need to perform operations that cannot be traced back to you. When these situations arise you can call upon this team. This is a squad of a dozen elite villains filling every role you could require. They all are loyal to you either due to fear, respect, or perhaps their paycheck. Any operation they commit cannot be traced back to you in any way and they’ll never reveal their connection to you. Lastly, should any of the group be killed they will either be revived or replaced within a week."
907,,300,Yvain's Lion,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Yvain was a renowned knight who served under Artoria, often fighting alongside Lions
of Light. As his Lord, Artoria shared this ability allowing her to summon Yvain’s lions.
Like the famous warriors you can summon these lions. By default you will summon a
ten meter tall white lion that is as strong as a dragon. This lion wields formidable
lightning abilities, including a lightning aura, the ability to fire powerful bolts of lightning
from its mouth, and the capability to absorb electricity. You can adjust the lion's size by
supplying it with different amounts of energy or summon multiple lions to aid you in
battle."
908,,300,Serosh,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Serosh is the Lord of Beast and advisor to the mighty Godfrey. This mighty beast
functions similar to a Stand aiding the user in battle. Normally, Serosh remains on your
shoulders, wrapped around you like a guardian. However, he can also detach to fight
alongside you, bringing his immense power to bear. In moments of extreme need, you
can sacrifice Serosh to enhance your own physical capabilities and damage resistance
using his blood. This transformation grants you significant boosts, turning you into a
near-unstoppable force. Fear not for Serosh's fate, as he will revive after a day,
returning to your side, ready to protect and assist you once more."
909,,300,Conqueror's Haki,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Conqueror's Haki is the rarest and most potent form
of Haki, signifying the qualities of a supreme king. This power allows you to exert
your will over others, intimidating and subduing those with weaker wills. It can
tame animals and make individuals fearful and obedient, although its effects on
sapient beings may not be permanent. At higher levels, Conqueror's Haki can
incapacitate or stun multiple targets, with the range and number of affected
individuals increasing with training. Mastery of this Haki enables you to target
specific individuals, avoiding friendly fire, and even enhance your physical
abilities and other powers by infusing them with your indomitable will. Advanced
users become unreadable to Observation Haki, making it difficult for opponents
to predict their actions or intentions."
910,,300,Objection Style,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"Being contrarian and confrontational is in your very words by now. By yelling out “OBJECTION!” you
are able to instantly put a stop to any one action that your opponent in any single fight has taken. You could prevent them from launching an attack or negate an attack that has already been fired, prevent them from blocking or dodging one move of your own or some other single event that can
be undone. Only one such command may be used in each separate battle but used wisely, it can
bring the fight to a victory for you instantly. "
911,,300,Jinx User,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"It may be just a silly old word game to some but you can turn the Jinx into something quite
frightening. If you ever manage to predict what someone says and manage to say it at the same time
as them, you are able to place them under the Jinx curse, which then allows you to give them one
order that they cannot refuse or ignore. This order cannot cause them to bring serious harm to
themselves directly, such as asking them to kill themselves or allow you to kill them, but it can put
them in serious danger, like having them fight their allies, or ruin their lives, such as commanding
them to run naked into the street and defecate in public view. Any command will only last for a few
minutes before they are freed from the curse but nothing stops you from managing to lay the curse
on them once more. Aside from them just not speaking. "
912,,300,Erotic Pierrot,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"It's the basest instinct of all humanity but they just can't deny it when you raise the issue. You are
able to create and control lust in any being near you, raising, lowering, making mental or physical
lust be given to someone or even focusing it entirely on specific people or things. You can make
someone entirely pervious to carnal desires, lacking them entirely, or fill someone up with so much
lust that they turn into an unthinking, berserking animal in their eagerness to satisfy themselves. These feelings can be resisted by those with strong enough wills but you can continuously stack
more and more lust feeling into someone to make it harder and harder to concentrate on anything
but resistance. "
913,,300,Musketeer,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"Your shard enables you to summon single-use muskets around you, which turn into mist and disappear after use. These muskets are extremely durable, capable of withstanding multiple hits from mid to high-tier brutes before breaking. Additionally, they have virtually zero bullet drop when fired. You can choose how powerful each musket is when summoning it. Once fired, the musket ball can be strong enough to pierce titanium and even causing high-tier brutes to have second thoughts. You can summon as many muskets as you want, but you are only limited to having 200 active muskets around you at a time.

Your shard also grants you the power of telekinesis when summoning your muskets, along with excellent marksmanship. This telekinesis allows you to manipulate and control the muskets as if they were another limb, knowing their exact positions and where they are aiming at all times. The telekinesis also extends to controlling the musket ball once fired, making it easier for you to hit your targets accurately.

Although you have perfect control over the muskets when they are close to you, your telekinetic control weakens with distance, reducing both accuracy and control."
914,,300,The Zombie,Bleach,Control,"This Schrift makes the Quincy’s blood into a horrifying weapon. Anyone touched by the
user’s blood will fall under their control, obeying even orders to commit suicide or attack their
dearest friends. The amount of blood needed varies, a single drop can zombify a low level Shinigami
but powerful Captains must have it diffused through their body. To aid this, the Quincy can
manipulate their blood outside of their body, directing it towards the brain and heart of anyone it
can soak into. Living beings retain their full power if infected but corpses can be raised into zombies
at a lesser level of power than they originally held, though the user can summon them at range in
exchange. The Quincy’s blood also has potent healing powers, letting the user quickly regenerate
damaged allies, reattach limbs and become almost immune to physical damage. The soul destroying
bows of the Quincy remain a threat, as do many supernatural attacks, but mere physical damage is
of little danger. Splitting your body in half will only spray your blood over your enemies faster. In
Vollstandig, the zombies gain greater power and the blood becomes even more potently infectious.

Requires Soul Letter to purchase."
915,,300,Growth Egg,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"By rubbing this golden egg constantly, you and your team get a bonus growth rate to all of your skills, so that you improve and learn it faster. Be careful not to rub it too much, as it will eventually hatch into yet another Chocobo chick. This one likes to nest inside your clothes however...leading to rather awkward moments. Hopefully it doesn’t cast fire spells from there – or your clothes are fireproof."
916,,300,Blank Eidolith ,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"A blank eidolith stone, similar to what Fal’Cie use to store Eidolons. Perhaps if you found a willing candidate...you could “create” an Eidolon by storing them inside? Unlike those stasis pods of yours however, once the Eidolon is inside, it and the stone do not part. (except while you summon the Eidolon)"
917,,300,Path of the Eight-Fold Spear,Cradle V1,Control,"A path that works best with seven other practitioners who come together with you in perfect teamwork. The 8-man empire was able to fight off other monarchs despite not any one of them being a monarch. Individually, they’re powerful, Together they’re incredible.

Requires Core and Madra Channels to Purchase"
918,,300,Shadowseer’s Annals,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"It’s a tome, very similar to the Ancient Tome you saw earlier...but this one is noticeably different. It feels...darker, and you can sense as though something is struggling inside the book. The Shopkeeper covers the book with a thick black cloth. “This book is dangerous...but there’s more to it than that.”

He closes the glass display and the atmosphere becomes notably lighter. “The Four Anima of the Sun and Shadow are bound in here. If you open the book you will free them, and certainly one will join you, but the other three will vanish. I’m sure you’ll choose wisely.”"
919,,300,Yomi Takanashi/Dead Master        ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Kagari Izuriha’s childhood friend, (and possibly now yours) she has two black wavy twin-tails and green eyes. Due to being so close to Kagari, their story is closely related and thus can be read above to get an idea of how things are going so far. While you companioning Kagari means you were closer with her, companioning Yomi means you’re closer to her and are able to help her with getting out of taking ‘responsibility’ of Kagari, a fact Kagari hates, unless you’ve companioned both of them which causes you to be close to both of them and hopefully mended this relationship a lot by the time you get into the jump proper.

Yomi on her own appears calm, reserved, and polite, but Kagari preventing her from making her friend has stunted her ability to make small-talk making her awkward and shy, seemingly aloof enough to drive any potential friend away from her. On her own she will make friends with Mato Kuroi which will lead to the plot of Black★Rock Shooter to take place. Seems to have an issue where she breaks down when no-one relies on her, seemingly spawned from her relationship with Kagari.

Dead Master on the other hand looks like an adult version of Yomi with black hair and vibrant green eyes, she has horns and clawed hands and wears a black dress with heels. She wields a large scythe that can turn into a chain known as the Dead Scythe. Her personality seems elegant and restrained enough to not outright attack someone who has helped her, though she appears to have a habit of being kidnapped. If you’re an Otherself than your real-self has been friends with Yomi for a while, enough for Dead Master to see you in a good light and perhaps you’ve even helped her get free from Chariot’s influence which definitely wins you some points in her books.

Yomi has the two student freebies, Hates None & Never Hated, Seeing Shadows, You Look… Just Like Her from The Shadow origin and Interesting Trivia from the Counselor origin. She has the Tiny Bird & The Colors item, and all of the Student items. She also has a unique ability where she can create copies of the Braided Bracelet on her own and give them to other people. Dead Master has Drawn By Huke, all of the Otherself origin perks save for Insanity of the Other, and only the ★ Outfits item.

Otherself Powers: All of the freebies, Supernatural Strength II, Supernatural Speed II, Regeneration II, Melee Weapon (One Form, Chain-Scythe), Corrosive Body, Chains That Bind, Army of Emotions (Skeletons, The Specials (Giant Hammer-wielding Skeleton), Bodyguards (Twin Giant Skulls that can form into a giant monster))

Territory Traits: Normal Size, One Entrance, Moderate Complexity (Tomb Ocean), Some Control, Patrols, Acidic Ocean, Central Structure (Throne), Chains of Binding.

Both Yomi and Dead Master count as one companion. They do not have any remaining CP to spend unless gained by drawbacks, nor TP or OP as well. Unless you want to spend your own."
920,,300,Kagari Izuriha/Chariot ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Yomi Takanashi’s childhood friend (and perhaps yours now,) long, messy blond hair and hazel brown eyes, she appears to be confined to a wheelchair for the moment. Apparently, when Yomi and Kagari were much younger, Yomi had to leave for a few years due to her father’s work, Kagari tried to follow and was hit by a car as a result, thankfully the car did no permanent damage but for whatever reason, Kagari believed herself unable to walk and could, seemingly, never walk due to some mental block.

After this, Kagari’s personality turned... possessive towards Yomi and believed herself unable to do anything without Yomi helping her and would not go out to school, or outside, and prevented Yomi from ever trying to get any friends. Yandere essentially and she does not hide her dislike of anyone who dares approach her precious Yomi whether through giving them food she hates or using her doll ‘Mary’ to spell it out verbally. She manages to get better later on, but has to have her Otherself, Chariot, die for that to happen and then be reborn.

Chariot is Kagari’s Otherself, looking like an older Kagari with brighter blonde hair and yellow glowing eyes, wearing a gothic lolita dress with a black crown, clawed hands and razor-sharp wheels for legs. She wields a sword and shield when she isn’t riding her spider-tank, Mary. She is of a sadistic, untrusting bent, prone to panicking when things don’t go her way.

If you have Kagari as your companion then you are childhood friends with her along with Yomi. If you chose the Student and Shadow you’re either the ‘little sister/brother’ of the group or the ‘older sister/brother’ if you chose Counselor. You are the only other person other than Yomi who Kagari will rely on and trust and with you aiding Yomi, you’re able to thankfully alleviate most of Kagari’s issues by the time you get into the jump, but it's not all settled, she’s still seemingly terrified of the outside and won’t go to school or make friends and she can’t seem to be able to walk but she no longer completely relies on you or Yomi to do anything anymore. In-order to help with this particular problem... it may be wise for you to stop pitying her.

If you’re an Otherself, then your real self is the one who is the childhood friend alongside Yomi to Kagari, you on the other hand are on unusually good terms with Chariot and possibly Dead Master as well. Your real selves have problems but it's not as fragile as it was before and you have formed... what could be considered a friendship between you and Chariot. Do be wary of her possessive streak, she won’t fight you unless you want to spar, but she certainly has some yandere tendencies to be cautious of.

Kagari has the two Student freebies, “Go Away, Go Away” from the Otherself origin, Foul-Mouthed Friendship, and All Is Forgiven from the Counselor origin. She has the Box of Macarons and Braided Bracelets items and otherwise benefits from the Student origin. 

Chariot has Drawn By Huke, all of the Otherself origin perks save for Insanity of the Other, and she has the Box of Macarons, ★ Outfits, and Odd Recreation items.

Otherself Powers: All of the freebies, Unusual Body (Razor Wheels), Object of Endearment (Macarons), Supernatural Speed II, Supernatural Durability II, Regeneration II, Melee Weapon with Additional Melee Weapon (Sword + Shield, one form), Suggestion of Gravity (Air Time), War Mount (Mount of Endearment, Extended Transportation (Climbing)), Swarm Master (Spiders)

Territory Traits: Massive Size, Scarred Sky, High Complexity (Toybox), Labyrinth Insides, No Control, Corruption.

Both Chariot and Kagari count as one companion. They do not have any remaining CP to spend unless gained by drawbacks, nor TP or OP as well. Unless you want to spend your own. "
921,,300,Talk Them To Death,Slay the Princess,Control,"You have devised perhaps the most insidious way to kill a person I have ever known - letting them be exposed to the Voices inside your head for an hour. With this, you can ‘force’ the Voices to jump from you to your victi-I mean, ‘opposition’ and have them quite literally talk them to death. Or to be more accurate to what is really occurring here, the Voices rapidly drive the poor bastard insane with multiple contradictory actions until their body either practically self-implodes from the strain for-reasons-I-shall-not-discuss or one of the Voices emerges dominant and causes them to, I dunno, chuck themselves off a cliff or something."
922,,300,JDO,Dies Irae,Control,"It seems that Reinhard is not the only man with a round table now. You’ve become the head of your own version of the LDO, named and styled in whatever way you most desire. This organisation is made up of 12 members other than yourself. You may either create new companions or import existing ones into these roles. All members of this group gain the LDO origin for free, though the background is changed to be fitting for your new group instead, and gain the normal Ewigkeit, Relic and Briah freebies. Nine of this group will be junior members, gaining 600CP to spend on what they want as well as starting at the Yetzirah stage of Ewigkeit. The other three members will be your senior commanders, gaining 800CP to spend and starting at the Briah stage of Ewigkeit. If all members of this group are newly created companions, you may treat them as a single slot companion all together. Otherwise they are separate slots."
923,,300,Apoptosis,Dies Irae,Control,"A unique trait of most Gods is that they often eventually develop an Apoptosis. A special being designed to work in opposition to them, often in order to eventually satisfy their desire for death. What you have here is a similar sort of being, though with a far less grim purpose. This being is the best friend you could ask for. Whatever they look like or act like, you’ll find it near impossible to not enjoy having them around. They’ll often oppose you and try to drag you out of your shell and do new things but when push comes to shove, they’ll have your back even when their own existence is threatened. They’re as loyal as it’s possible to be and while they’re not always going to agree with you, and may even try to beat the crap out of you to prove a point, they’ll always have your back when you need it. They’re linked to you and will grow as you do to always remain equal to you or near to being such. If you need a worthy partner in battle or need someone able to hurt you to fulfil a plan, this is the guy for the job. They gain an origin for free, though they must pay to be part of the LDO, and 800CP to spend on whatever they want here. "
924,,300,ONE WHO SURPASSES ALL,Final Fantasy X,Control,"A special monster that stands to reflect everything the Monster Arena has to offer – resembling one of the “WEAPON” species present in Spira, only one exists – but it possesses all of the capabilities of the monsters in each respective pen. At the end of the day it’s still a “WEAPON” and a monster, but it comes with a drop pod and pen of its own so you can deploy it at will. While its physical appearance doesn’t change, it can mimic abilities without any issue. Did I mention that it’s completely layered in gold? I’m sure my partner is already wondering how much it could sell for...

925,,300,Taming Contract ,Final Fantasy X,Control,"In the Calm Lands, there lays a hidden training camp once set up by the legendary Lord Mi’ihen. Its purpose was to toughen the Crusaders of future generations and prepare them for the eventual return of Sin. An old man runs this training camp now, but he’ll offer you a contract...a rather unique contract.

You’ll gain some tools to help you, but you’ll be tasked to go around Spira and collect as many monsters as you can during your time here. Thankfully, this doesn’t include any individuals, or particularly notable monsters that you might consider a boss.

In return though, you’ll grow a little bit stronger for each monster you capture in your time here, though this growth slows down pretty remarkably after you’ve hit a certain amount. After all, you’ll have gotten the hang of capturing monsters down by then I’m sure."
926,,300,Bone eye,Gods of Blood and Powder,Control,"Bone eye sorcery is only known in the Dynize empire, an ancient empire that hasn’t opened its borders to any outsider for 100 years. It is magic of blood and flesh and hair and magic of wax. With a drop of someone's blood or some other piece of them like a hair and a little wax you can create powerful voodoo dolls and it’s associated magics allowing you to squash opponents, setting them on fire, tearing their limbs... but also controlling their movements at a distance. You are capable of taking command of several dozen or even hundreds of wax dolls/people, depending on your power, have them dance and float before you and control the movements to the smallest detail (given that you’ve collected some “samples” of the individuals you control). This will also work on Privileged, though the greater the difference in power between you and other sorcerers and sorcerous beings, the harder it will be to take control. With your control over people come several additional feats: Your control is absolute, you’re capable of extracting information out of the minds of the people you control, absolutely control movement and speech, remote sensation via the people you control over vast, continent spanning, distances, pain inducement and consciousness shifting (controlling whether their “awake” inside their body or whether they don’t consciously know what’s happening to them etc.) among other feats. You also have quite a powerful warding ability. With time and your blood infused with your lifeforce you can apply incredibly effective and tight wards around a person, enough to keep someone safe from most sorcerous attacks, including protection against enemy bone eye takeover attempts, although that depends on the specific power compared to yours. Using your blood you can anoint selected champions making them stronger, faster and more resilient/thougher by having them continuously feed off your sorcery, or with one time use of this power create enhanced humans like the dragonmen. Using your blood infused with your lifeforce as well as some sacrificial offerings, be they animal or human, you can also create redstripe ammunition among other sorcery breaking items, tearing through most Privileged wards. You’re able to track people over vast distances with minor clues like a strand of hair. Using blood and blood sacrifices you’re capable of sealing or unsealing sorcerous power in objects and people.

The drawbacks to this amazing power are quite clear: You’re still a normal human and have no protection against mundane attacks. And while you, your wards and your magic are an anathema to other sorcery, unraveling it and tearing through wards, you require a bit of another person in order to affect them in any way, though some “samples” work better than others, blood being the best to work with. People far more powerful than you (in a magic sense or general) may be impossible for you to enslave and trying to do so may even cause some backlash. Your claim over a person you control may be contested and potentially wrestled from you by another bone eye. This may free them permanently or give you “ownership” over them."
927,,300,Pumice ,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"A Piece of Pumice, which can be used to call down the Eidolon Ark, though this ability can only be used with long intervals in between as the rock gathers its magic back. Perhaps it would have another use, in another time?"
928,,300,You don't take shit from no Demon,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Control,"To put it plainly, once per Jump, you can put your foot down and say “Enough is Fucking Enough. That’s it, no tricks, no traps, no double talk this is what you are fucking doing!” To one Demon or Devil, whatever, you can give one order. The more they like an order the more they’ll do it, so Charlie’s order from the show would see him happily and actively helping for a good long while, and even if he got bored he wouldn’t attack or fuck things up too badly. But if you tried some bullshit like “You are My Slave” he’d be bucking and thinking his way out of it in short order most likely. These effects wear off after you leave the jump. Once you get that fancy-ass spark is when it'll be permanent."
929,,300,Summoning,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The Summoning System is the mechanism through which the Masters of Chaldea intend to summon Servants to fight for them and Craft Essence to enhance or assist those Servants. It is a randomised system, with more powerful or notable Servants and Essence being harder and harder to get. A single roll of this random mechanism requires a single Saint Quartz and will grant a single result, with no guarantees either way. Servants summoned through this method by you will fight for you, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but they are not companions nor do they receive any additional benefits like companion Servants bought through this document will. While this system is free for Humans in this jump, it may be bought to keep, even by Servants, for 300CP. In future jumps it will continue to summon Servants, only based off of the world it is currently in, drawing from historical or mythical or fictional or even future beings from that world. It will also continue to summon Craft Essences and such for use. Both these will follow the same rules as they do in this jump."
930,,300,Mouse(Mullo),Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"Concept: Multiplication

Form: Pendant Necklace

Tool: Jump Rope

Power: “Multitude” - Allows you to shrink down and create clones of yourself. The more there are, the smaller they are. Their scale and power isn’t exactly proportional (Two clones is more like 2/3 size and power each, three is more like 1/2, and twenty is more like 3/20). Any more than twenty begins to become infeasibly small."
931,,300,“S Rank Valkyries”,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control,"Here are the best of the best at what they do, the top of their field and utterly broken, though they all have their quirks and moments... Any of them would certainly be worth having as a companion.

Rita – A first class maid and S-Rank Valkyrie, polite to a fault. So polite, in fact, people regularly forget she’s S-Rank. Nonetheless, her maid service feels extremely genuine, as a byproduct of her personal elegance. Has a propensity to tease and flirt.

Stan – Originally picked up by Durandal as a pet in England, perhaps through Rita's scheming his care has passed onto you. He is, in truth, capable of assuming a Honkai Beast form that can match Rita blow for blow, and has human level intelligence.

Durandal – Schicksal’s most powerful Valkyrie – she is seen as a legendary heroine. A terror to fight, she can be surprisingly airheaded, and even cute, when off duty. Capable of fighting foes that send other Valkyrie running without a battlesuit.

Otto – The smartest man alive supposedly – this is an independent clone of his that has sided with you for reasons unknown. He will lend you his smarts, tactics, and even culinary skills. He retains full knowledge of Schicksal’s operations."
932,,300,Yesterday’s Promise,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control,"A black sheet of paper with glowing blue borders and writing. Designed with the intention of creating contracts, Yesterday’s Promise contains almost entirely hidden fine print that says the user can do anything to the other party if they don’t deliver their agreed obligations. While the contract is in effect, it actually grants the capacity to do anything. Take out their organs and then put them right back? Very much doable."
933,,300,Puppet Strings,Library of Ruina V1.0,Control,"Shiny white strings designed for the sole purpose of puppetry. Sew these strings into the body of a being, and the puppeteer shall gain total control of their body. These malicious strings connecting the puppeteer and the puppet are intangible and can’t be physically cut, with the only means of breaking control to be killing either the puppeteer or the puppet. For more improvised uses, the strings can be wrapped around multiple targets to try and force them together, potentially creating a hideous amalgam of the two."
934,,300,Ankuru,Final Fantasy VI,Control,"Being an orphan in Zozo means learning certain harsh truths early. The world is dangerous, people can be cruel, and food isn’t always something you can afford. Still, the darkness often breeds the brightest sparks of light. Ankuru is a Half-Esper, their father being a Carbuncle and their mother not surviving the birth. Despite their history of tragedy, they are an individual that dreams of being a hero. Quick to leap to the defense of others and the kind of person who believes that everyone can turn their lives around if they try. They use their Defensive and Time magic to aid their meting out justice to the villains of the world. They begin with the Follow Your Heart and Strength of the Spirit perks and will grow into A Being Split in Two and Trance over the next few years. Ankuru still has their father’s Carbuncle Magicite which they treasure above all else. They also have an odd kinship with dragons and a love for anything that sparkles."
935,,300,Spies,God Of War (2018),Control,"The “All Father” is known for using ravens to spy on his enemies and the realms in general and while you cannot yet create enough to spy on all Nine Realms you can make enough to spy on one. Choose an animal, you will be able to create ghost-like constructs in the shape of your chosen animal which you can see through at your discretion. The number you can create depends on your experience with the technique, the longer you use it the more constructs you can create."
936,,300,Spirit of Ratatoskr,God Of War (2018),Control,"Much like the Caretaker of Yggdrasill, you have the odd ability to shunt the undesired parts of your psyche into spiritual versions of yourself. Tired of being a spiteful little thing? Pass it off to a clone! Want a change of pace from being anxious all the time? To the clone with it! You are able to dispel or remake these clones as you desire, though do keep in mind that once you put a personality trait or feeling into a clone you won’t be able to feel that way until you disperse the clone."
937,,300,Test Tube Babe,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"Perhaps a slightly more practical companion, this one is one of the Black Faction’s living batteries. They’ll start off in a self-sustaining life support tank – which you can consider fiat-backed if you want to keep it – and continue fulfilling their function as a living magical battery for you, or you can get them out and about for somewhat less power but more company. They’ll even develop a personality if you give them the opportunity, guaranteed not to be horribly bland...unless you like that sort of thing? While they default to the same brown eyes and hair of their brethren, you can choose their appearance and gender, though this doesn’t give any particular advantages. As a bonus, unlike the Black Faction’s batch, this one has the effective limitless longevity of the Einzbern version. They’re equipped with a few spells that were programmed into them for self-defence and utility purposes, have slightly above human base strength and not inconsiderable endurance, and would be combat-ready the moment they emerge from the tank. They’re even surprisingly compatible with any upgrades you happen to give them, which they will retain as long as you want them to. Incidentally, that tank would help them recover quickly if injured, help incorporate any changes you make to them, and if killed they can be set to respawn inside it. They are also 100% loyal to you, which will never change, so...maybe treat them nicely?"
938,,300,Summoning Specialist ,Final Fantasy IV,Control,"While those of Mist (and the outsiders who still manage to figure it out) mostly practice Pact Magic, you’ve taken it one step further. When you summon something (a monster or otherwise) it is summoned at the upper limits of its full potential for the length of the summon, to a maximum of 24 hours."
939,,300,Dragonspeak        ,Final Fantasy IV,Control,"Emulation only has so many applications, and thus you’ve learned how to directly communicate with dragons and draconic entities, as well as naturally being favorable toward them. This allows you to bargain and work with these creatures, gaining insights and rewards. Additionally, this bond slightly increases your aptitude for elemental combat, whether through black magic or another source, allowing more power for no cost."
940,,300,A Fourth Witch ,The Voynich Hotel,Control,Or perhaps fifth if you have chosen the Witch origin for yourself. You may use this option to import one of your existing Companions into this world with the Witch origin. They gain nothing besides all four of the Witch’s perks. You may also use this option to find yourself in the company of a Witch of your own design who will become a Companion during your time in this world. This option allows you to import or create a single Companion with each purchase.
941,,300,Battle Moon,Adventure Time,Control,A small moon that orbits around you. Fires lightning to both electrocute opponents and intercept projectiles.
942,,300,Life Giving Magus,Adventure Time,Control,You have the rare magical power of giving life to inanimate objects. They tend to have a random personality and level of intelligence but they’ll be positively disposed to you (at least to start with).
943,,300,Servant,Fate/Apocrypha,Control,"So, you’re a Master, right? That means you have a Servant. Normally you’d have to summon them yourself during the jump itself, but you can skip that here. For 100cp you may gain a Servant on the level of the 300cp purchase in the origin section, and for 300cp you may gain a Servant on the level of the 500cp purchase. Keep in mind that Servants may or may not be difficult to work with if your personalities don’t mesh well, and that they’ll have their own will and goals even if they serve you. Perhaps it’d be ideal to just do a compatibility summon instead of aiming for a specific hero?"
944,,300,Daughter of Chaos,Hades,Control ,"Chaos themselves cannot set foot into the realm they created for the simple reason that they never designed it to accommodate their grand powers. Their first step would spell the doom of all they have made. Yet even a being with so much desires that which can only be described to them. This being is a tiny offshoot of Chaos’ immensity, individual in its own right yet subtly linked to its greater self all the same. With skin the color of aged marble and eyes old enough to make even a god uncomfortable, the Daughter of Chaos is an unknown quantity that does not understand what she represents. Their attitude is both haughty and innocent. They know little of the world, are unused to social niceties of any kind, and can easily be distracted by everyday experiences. Truly someone to be both protected and protector all at once. Despite the name, Daughter of Chaos is something of a misnomer. Their body is under their complete control, able to shift features when desired or even from male to female and every possibility in between. Though they do not understand, yet, what all the fuss is about."
945,,300,Support Fire ,Hades,Control ,"The Goddess of the Hunt prefers to be left alone, but she rarely turns her back on those who honor her with their actions. Those who draw your blood will draw her ire as well as one of her arrows. They will rarely be deadly shots as firing in anger is not her strong suit. Yet they will only rarely fail to hit.

The supporting shots fromLady Artemis now tend to come from impossible angles, blind spots, and from other unexpected positions. Your foes will never be quite sure where they will come from next and be less capable of defending against her shafts."
946,,300,Where Warriors Wait,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Control ,"When the extinction of man was nigh, the Gates of Valhalla opened to let out their greatest. Humanities strongest arrived for the clash of history to defend their kind. Such incredibly individuals... and that only in this world. What might be for deceased warriors in other realms? Once per Jump you may summon up to 13 Souls from the afterlife. They will be restored to the prime of their life and keep any abilities they possesses in live. Their personalities may not match with one another but if your cause is important enough (like ensuring the survival of humanity) they will happily work alongside you for whatever that goal of yours is."
947,,300,Snallygaster,Wizarding World,Control ,"Classified as a XXXX Beast, Snallygasters are magical creatures that make their home in the New World. Unlike many other magical creatures, Snallygasters an innate form of curiosity, one that often gets them into more trouble than one would suspect.

Moving onto its physical characteristics, Snallygasters were once thought to be some sort of dragon, but further study has proven this theory false. Rather, the Snallygaster appears to be some form of bird/reptile hybrid with serrated steel for teeth, which it uses to tear apart its prey. More than that, the Snallygaster even possesses a bulletproof hide and is rather useful against spells as well.

And so, you’ll find the Snallygaster to be a perfect beastly companion. Just make sure you keep it on a tight leash. You don’t want to break the Statute of Secrecy now, do you? Or, maybe, you do?"
948,,300,Re’em,Wizarding World,Control ,"Found in the wilds of North America and the Far East, the Re’em bears a heavy resemblance to an ox. That is, if said ox was larger than an elephant and possessed a shimmering golden hide. Classified as a XXXX-Class Beast, a Re’em is strong and hardy enough to face against dragons and even come out the victor. But that is not why they are prized by wizards and witches everywhere.

You see, Re’em, like many other magical beasts, has a plethora of magical body parts. But for a Re’em, the most magical part of them is their blood. By imbibing their blood, one can stand to gain tremendous strength, enough to match a troll. Although such strength is only temporary, when you have a Re’em at your side, how temporary will such a thing actually be?"
949,,300,Lethifold,Wizarding World,Control ,"Otherwise known as the Living Shroud, the Lethifold is a very strange creature, even amongst the menagerie of magical beasts around in this world. Closer to a  Dementor than any other living creature, a Lethifold resembles, as its other moniker suggests, a black cloak half an inch thick. Through some sort of magic, the Lethifold glides across the ground, much like dementors it so closely takes after.

Considered to be a Dark creature, the Lethifold’s favored prey is humans. It strikes at them when they are asleep, enveloping them within its body, suffocating them as it slowly digests them over the night. You might not think these beasts very dangerous if this is how they hunt but you would be very wrong.

A Lethifold possesses durability unmatched. The only spell known to have ever driven off a Lethifold is the Patronus Charm, a tremendously difficult piece of magic that so very few wizards have ever learnt to cast. No other creature can boast such defenses. Do what you will with that."
950,,300,Graphorn,Wizarding World,Control ,"At a distance, a Graphorn, a creature most often within the mountains of Europe can be mistaken for some sort of malformed saber-tooth tiger but that couldn’t be any farther from the truth. Large enough that fully-grown Mountain Trolls could comfortably ride on their backs if only the beasts would let them, Graphorns are majestic creatures that can comfortably be called mighty.

With a hide tougher than even a dragon’s and a head harder than even tempered steel, a Graphorn’s presence is enough to tell the beasts of the world that there is a challenger for the king of the land. Difficult to tame and difficult to fight, a Graphorn can barrel through the efforts of entire groups of wizards with a contemptuous sort of ease. And with this tamed Graphorn at your side, you may rightfully call yourself a Lord."
951,,300,Unicorn,Wizarding World,Control ,"Perhaps one of the most iconic magical beasts alive, there are few souls who have not heard of the mythical unicorn, even amongst the Muggles. A horse with either a coat of the purest white, enough to make freshly fallen snow seem gray, or the most lustrous gold and a beautiful horn upon its head, unicorns are symbols of purity and gentility. But do not underestimate this wondrous beast.

Capable of outrunning werewolves with absurd ease, each and every part of a unicorn is magical. But its most precious component is its silvery blood. By drinking of it, you can keep yourself alive even if you are but an inch from death. And though, it would ordinarily curse the drinker, this particular unicorn will give you its blood of its own free will. You will suffer no curses if you partake in its most precious and valuable blood."
952,,300,Seath the Scaleless,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"The pale drake and progenitor of sorcery, there are none as well versed in the arcane as Seath the Scaleless. He delved deep into the mysteries of the arcane, to such an extent that he rivaled that of the Lords in his mastery. He was born without the stone scales of his draconic kin, and grew resentful of them. He sided with Lord Gwyn in his ancient war, and even now seeks true immortality. Maybe with his talents turned towards assisting you, he can gain all he ever desired and more."
953,,300,Knights of Gwyn,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"The four legendary knights of the Great Lord Gwyn, each one a true threat in their own right, but together are a force that few could surpass. Artorias the Abysswalker fights like a wild animal, whilst the Dragonslayer Ornstein rapidly strikes at foes with his spear. The giant Hawkeye Gough is a peerless archer who can shoot dragons out of the skies with but a single arrow, while the Lord’s Blade Ciaran dazzles her opponents with fast strikes with her twin blades."
954,,300,Father of the Abyss,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Once a human hailing from a far off, ringed city, Manus became Father of the Abyss after his humanity went wild, eternally seeking his precious broken pendant. He has the power to consume all of Oolacile within his Abyss, and possess a large number of powerful abilities related to the Dark besides. He was able to overcome the legendary Artorias the Abysswalker in his mad state, who what might he be capable of as he is with you, sound of mind and fully in control of his power?"
955,,300,Children of Izalith,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control ,"Four of the children of the Witch of Izalith, she who bore the Lord Soul of Life. Quelana remains unchanged, and has become known as the mother of pyromancy. Quelaag and the Fair Lady have been transformed into spider-like demons, though whereas the former spits out lava and flames to destroy those who go against her, the latter lies immobile and ridden with pox and curses. The youngest, as well as being her only son, is a massive giant of lava who lashes out with his many tendrils, though possesses the mind of a child."

If you purchase the Colorful Columbian Casita you can have this spirit inhabit the property and extend its power to the warehouse if the Capstone Booster was purchased.

The Spirit has both the Multi-tasking Domain and Inanimate Object Control perks as well as the “Pocket Dimensions” perk that allows it to create individualized pocket dimensions at will for anyone that is considered family, this includes family, followers, companions, pets, and familiars as desired, these by default are represented as shimmering golden doors.

Unfortunately Death can not leave this world as he is one of its concepts, but he can create an incarnation to do so. This incarnation could retain his current appearance or take on a different form. This incarnation will start out slightly weaker than Death in the movie, but over time it could grow even more powerful than its progenitor. You may optionally customize the appearance, personality, and species that this incarnation takes on."

With enough time and training you’ll be able to use bloodbending without the aid of the full moon.

960,,300,Victoria Von Doom ,Marvel Magic,Control ,"There are many possible timelines -- infinite, most likely --, alternate realities that diverged from this at some distinct point. Some are minor variations, almost the same but for the name of a person or the birth of a pet or the way a grain of sand fell upon a beach. But some are major, no longer even recognizable. This woman comes from one such world. This is the Doctor Doom of another earth, born with as a woman instead of a man. Much of her life followed the same path as the Von Doom of this world, however, and she is much the same person.

Born poor to a Gypsy Sorceress, her life was ruined when her mother’s soul fell into the clutches of the demonic mephisto. Vowing to recover her mother’s soul, she mastered the arts of science and sorcery before eventually managing to save her mother’s soul, she came upon a vision and saw that the only way to save the world from utter destruction was to conquer it and lead it into safety. Unfortunately, she failed and not only her Earth, but her entire timelines was wiped from the multiverse. She herself managed to escape to this world and now seeks a new path.

Her supreme intelligence and unbreakable will are matched only by her enormous ego and unyielding arrogance. Possessing mastery of both science and of magic, both far in excess of all but a handful of other humans, she is a force to be reckoned with. However, her face was permanently scarred in her past and she now hides behind a crude mask of iron, her own vanity preventing her from moving onward. Your past has led you to meet her and she has found herself oddly fond of you and will likely be willing to follow you even on to other worlds -- after all, her own is destroyed, so she has nothing to tie here her. Her fondness for you will be such that she strangely finds herself reluctant to betray you, though she will likely never admit that such a soft spot exists."
961,,300,Fire Drake of Muspelheim ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Control ,"Oh this one’s a little cutie. Look at how red their scales are. Look at the embers hissing out of their exhaust ports. Wait, exhaust ports? Oh, right. This little bugger hails from Muspelheim, a place of fire and rock ruled by the great Surtur. They’re already fairly tough, able to breathe fire and roast a person while doing hops with their fiery back nozzles. But they will grow. Oh yes, they will grow a great deal and soon become bigger than a semi truck. Their teeth will be like swords, their claws like spears. No wings to complete the reference, but it’s a literal jetpack dragon that can breath fire and speed around. How is that not cool?"
962,,300,Asgardian Puppy ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Control ,"Awwww, look at this little guy! He’s so cute! He’s adorable! He’s also the size of a small car. That’s what happens when you take the mighty Asgardian Wolves and reveal a puppy. He’s already pretty tough, able to run significantly faster than a human and use steel pipes as chew bones, but he’ll end up getting bigger. Much bigger, dwarfing a semi-truck in size. That’ll only do wonders for his strength, speed, and durability. It’ll take some time to get there, however... maybe you can use that time to explain to Hela why there’s a second hound running around."
963,,300,Enlightened Teacher,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Control ,"You have traveled far, and she has been waiting for your arrival. It is a strange thing to be expecting someone who has come from another universe, but not entirely unexpected. After all, the Multiverse has much to offer. She sees your potential, and understands that you will go far as long as you are adequately... taught. Her first lessons will be harsh, but as your skill grows so will her affection for you. This companion will gain the perks 'Enlightened' and the first ranks of 'Caging up with the Joneses ' and 'Like A Spider'."
964,,300,Blackheart,Ghost Rider,Control ,"The son of Mephistopheles and prince of Hell, Blackheart, can become your companion if you convince him to follow you. He has superhuman attributes, and an aura of extreme cold surrounds him; his touch can suck the life out of a human"
965,,300,"Carter Slade, the Phantom Rider",Ghost Rider,Control ,"The Ghost Rider who outran the Devil; while normally he would’ve used his last transformation to ride with Johnny, by recruiting him as your companion a new Spirit of Vengeance will come to him upon your departure. He has nearly two hundred years of living experience, as well as his experiences as the Ghost Rider, a shotgun, and his horse to back him up."
966,,300,"Nicholas Cage Johnny Blaze, the Ghost Rider",Ghost Rider,Control ,"The current Ghost Rider; after meeting, the two of you will quickly hit it off, and he’ll decide to join you on your adventures. He brings all the powers of the Ghost Rider, as well as his bike, chains, and experiences as a stunt man."
967,,300,Spirited,Ghost Rider,Control ,"You possess an incredibly strong spirit; those with weak wills might be overwhelmed by your presence, and you seem to exude an aura that inspires and revitalizes your allies while panicking and demoralizing your foes. By purchasing this, the strength of any capstones you’ve purchased are also strengthened greatly; the capstone’s you’ve purchased haven’t been replaced, they’ve been added to, and you get the effects of both unless the capstone boosted version specifically mentions that their effects have been changed. "
968,,300,Steve Rogers ,Marvel 2099,Control ,"Normally he would possibly be lost since the end of the Heroic Age, frozen - again - deep beneath the sea only to be potentially found sometime after the apocalyptic Phalanx invasion. By taking him as your companion you will find Steve Rogers with the equipment to revive him from the ice soon after arriving in this world. In addition to his lifetime of experience and mighty shield, he is also found with a certain gnarled old wooden cane which he is worthy of. While wielding Mjolnir he won’t be fully the equal to Thor, possessing only - as he put it - half of the power of Thor with it, but he can use many of the hammer’s myriad functions and uses."
969,,300,Dargo Ktor,Marvel 2099,Control ,"This individual seems to have gotten lost from another, but distinctly different, dystopian future of the Marvel universe. The wielder of Mjolnir from the 26th century, he seeks to return the hammer to Thor himself. While not the most experienced or skilled user of the hammer - somewhat less capable than Eric Mastersoncand noticeably less skilled than Beta Ray Bill when the three met up together - he is still blessed with the power of the hammer and Thor-like capabilities."
970,,300,Clea,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Control ,"Clea is the Sorcerer Supreme of the Dark Dimension. She is introduced to the MCU in the post credit scene of Multiverse of Madness. She is incredibly powerful, at the very least capable of matching Strange. We have yet to see how she will be handled, but this option will allow you to recruit this powerful sorceress now. She will come with the entire Sorcerer perkline and the second level of the Comic Book Beauty perk for free. Lastly she will receive an additional 400cp to further customize herself."
971,,300,Tamed Shirshu,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Control ,"Large as a bull, this creature resembles a hybrid of a dog and a star-nosed mole, with a venomous tongue which would put an anteater to shame. Its saliva is a potent paralytic, with a single strike instantly leaving its victim immobile. It also has an unearthly sense of smell, and can track prey halfway across the world once it catches their scent. Yours is quite well-trained, and will both respond to your commands and allow riders without complaint."
972,,300,Homunculus ,Fate,Control ,"Perhaps the Einzbern have given you a gift, or maybe you stole it for yourself. In either case, you now have the friendship of one of the Einzbern family's Homonculus. A powerful Magus with albino features, they are incredibly loyal to you, and establishing a relationship with them wouldn't be hard at all. Unlike other Homonculi, your one is a perfect one, and does not possess a finite lifespan like the others do. They also count as a companion."
973,,300,Chain Chomp,Bayonetta,Control ,"A vicious creature once found in the ancient lands of Japan, this terrible cre-... what the fuck is this. Why am I even trying anymore, they sure aren't. It's... ugh. It's a giant monster in the form of a black ball with a chain on it that you can fashion to your ankle to swing around. On the plus side, it's going to bite any enemy that gets close and you can even break its chain temporarily to make four 'chain chomp bombs' to attach and explode on an enemy. So at the least it's a very vicious weapon."
974,,300,Carlas Detachment,Ragna Crimson,Control ,"A group of twenty clones of the Time Saint, Carla, has been assigned to follow and assist you, as is tradition with the Saints of the Sun Cult. These clones have very little personality of their own, accepting any order or task that you give them. They all have Time Magic, but they are much weaker than the Dragon King Ultimatia, and as such, they will generally be spending their own lifeforce in order to use it to support you, whether it is healing you or others you point them to by using Time Reverse or Time Acceleration, or immobilizing targets for a moment by consuming their lifeforce in exchange of a short time stop for them. 

If one of them dies, you will get a replacement in your Warehouse or a property of your choosing after twenty- four hours. They count as Followers, unless later imported as a Companion."
975,,300,Zz'rot Portal,League of Legends,Control ,"This large, roughly-cut onyx gem gleams with a violet light from within. Just keeping this gem upon one's person increases their physical and magical resistance to attack, and by unleashing the gem's power, one can create a small, controlled portal to the Void. Minor voidspawn will leap out of the Void Gate every four seconds, some imbued with a fraction of your own lifeforce, and will march in a singular direction and dive into structures, causing damage. You can direct them as to what structures you wish for them to destroy and which of them to leave alone, but the Voidspawn are generally ill-suited to complex orders. The Void Gate lasts for two and a half minutes or until destroyed, and you can open a new void gate as soon as the previous one closes."
976,,300,Creeps,League of Legends,Control ,"For when you just don't want to do something yourself, you have these little guys. By using an amulet crafted out of a Nexus shard (it's supplied, don't worry), you can set up a small portal through which waves of minions come out. They're small, generally 2 feet tall, and individually they're not very strong at all. However, they come with the advantage of strength in numbers, and come in three varieties- Melee creeps come equipped with hammers and shields and are tougher than they look, Magic creeps come equipped with wands and are capable of doing more damage than melee creeps, and Seige creeps ride a cannon suited for blowing apart structures. Once you set up the portal, a wave of 7 creeps (3 Melee, 1 Seige, and 3 Ranged) will come through once every minute and a half, and will more or less march in a straight line attacking anything in their way until either they destroy an objective set by you, or their portal is destroyed. Creeps are ill-suited to complex tasks, but are reliable and expendable enough to achieve simple ones, given enough time."
977,,300,Familiar,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Control ,"You have the service of a custom-crafted creature, one totally loyal to you. You must design its appearance and nature, which defines how its abilities develop. Its power increases as yours does, but its growth will taper off as you approach mastery of this jump's skills. After leaving this jump, its development will slow to a crawl. It is completely immune to any effect that would usurp control of it or cause it to attack you. If slain or crippled, the familiar will reappear at your side or be fully healed after 24 hours. A familiar does not count as a companion. "
978,,300,Spirit of Wisdom,Dresden Files,Control ,"Oooh, this is fun. A truly ancient Spirit of Wisdom is at your disposal now, Jumper. This is an ancient thing that makes Bob look like a baby. And it’s been handed down… or taken forcibly from all sorts of practitioners since then. It resides in a Copper device of exquisite make, but the copper seems to be shockingly bad quality. Don’t bring this up to the Spirit unless you want to hear complaints about the Merchant who cheated even the Spirit when it bought this residence from him. But that’s how old it is."
979,,300,Talking Head,The Dresden Files,Control ,"Something between a magical computer and a lab assistant, this Spirit of Intellect would have forgotten more about magic than most wizards ever knew if it was actually capable of forgetting without being ordered to. Its personality is something between your own and how you think it should behave, which means you're probably getting something close to Bob if you're not careful. Aside from dispensing forgotten lore, they're able to possess and control things, ranging from friendly dire housecats to giant stone lions, and can even act as an emergency mystical battery if need be. Includes a free storage skull."
980,,300,Steed Whistle,Dark Souls 2,Control ,"“Great knights of past, fallen kingdoms did not just employ the services of mundane horses, but all manner of beasts. Great ravens, terrifying drakes, undead mounts and far more. With the kingdoms that fell, the employ of these beasts has also become uncommon. This whistle, however, allows you to call upon similar beasts once more. Simply blow it, and a great beast may be summoned to aid in your current situation. A giant raven can pluck you from the ground and drop you off elsewhere, or an undead steed helping pass through a dangerous valley as examples. When you’ve made it to your destination, the beast may depart, disappearing when no longer observed to be called upon some other time.”"
981,,300,“Bat Wing Demons”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"Two companions in one companion, this is a pair of twin Bat Wing Demons that wandered the walls of Anor Londo at the behest of Gwyndolin until deciding that joining you would be more entertaining. The twins are agile fliers that can work together to carry heavily armored knights great distances, have great sight despite the lack of eyes and are well trained in the use of their demonic lightning spears. Most of the time they’ll simply perch in high places to watch over you from afar though. The demons have the “Strength of Taurus” and “Aloft” perks by default to aid their flight abilities. Their nature as twins leaves them close enough to finish each other’s sentences, if their warped vocal chords worked that is. When imported into future Jumps, they share the benefits evenly."
982,,300,“Great Grey Wolf Pup”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"A puppy the size of a normal fully-grown wolf, it’s energetic, friendly, incredibly loyal and bizarrely intelligent for what otherwise appears to be a normal animal. Your pup continues to grow bigger and smarter by the day, until it will eventually reach the size of a bus and intellect on par with a human, encouraging similar intelligence growth in surrounding animals as if it had the Man’s Best Friends perk. Your fluffy friend also comes wielding a short sword and really knows how to use it, grabbingit up in its surprisingly strong, dexterous mouth to swing and chop with great skill. Your wolf pup‘s gender and name are up to you, likely accepting whatever you call them with wagging tail."
983,,300,“Clutch of Eggs”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"By purchasing this, you cause clutches of eternal dragon eggs, the real deals, to spawn in random exotic locations in each world you visit, including this one. Through this act, you introduce dragons to the world. They’ll be able to care for themselves for the most part after hatching like capable predators and will mature in several years time. Like the old dragons were introduced to concepts like life, death and magic by the gods, you will see these dragons heavily influence by the properties of the world and environment they hatch in. There is no inherent benefit to you by doing this, unless you actively seek them out to befriend and train, or capture and study, but it does make the worlds you visit more fantastical in general."
984,,300,“Titanite Demon”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"When the nameless blacksmith deity passed, from several of his slabs rose great beasts. These beasts were Titanite Demons, and now you’ve been bestowed a loyal one. Titanite demons have a humanoid shape with a missing head and leg, and wield great scepters. Both their body and their weapon is completely made of demon titanite which is used in smithing weapons with connections to strong souls. Not only is the demon quite powerful and hardy, it can wield the power of lightning and will rejuvenate over time when broken. This allows it to double as a renewable resource deposit."
985,,300,“Mobile Mushrooms”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"A small bushel of seemingly normal mushrooms. When you tear one off and plant it, it will slowly grow over time into a mushroom person. Each mushroom person is thick and bulky like the ones found within Darkroot Garden, starting as a child until they reach adulthood over the course of a couple weeks. By planting the full bushel, an area will naturally start to produce mushroom people over time, eventually filling the area with them. These beings tend to be friendly, to you anyways."
986,,300,“Black Separation Crystal”,Dark Souls 1,Control ,"A black separation crystal, unique artifact and tool used in regards to beings of alternate worlds. When used, it sends those who are spatially displaced in the nearby area from where they should be back to where they belong. This allows you to banish invading phantoms within your dimension, send summoned allies back to their home or even allow you yourself to go back home if summoned somehow. This crystal will continue to hold power in future worlds, allowing you to banish other types of summons, severing their connection to the current area."
987,,300,Welcoming Host ,Bloodborne,Control ,"“Vermin, wriggling root of man’s impurity found within tainted blood. They are but one form of parasite running amok in this world, where serpents coil within the entrails of puppeted corpses, and more eldritch things writhe in the kosm. Perhaps, then, they may be used. 

Parasites that make their way into your form, squirming and corrupting as they bury themselves deeper, are attacked indirectly. That is to say, those that attempt to possess you, twisting your body into a more suitable host, are instead subdued and taken over in turn, made symbiotic in nature. 

While this aids with many parasites, the kind that simply eat their way out after implantation are harder to deal with. Survive for at least one week, and this talent even bend those though. For any filthy creature that tried to use you for their own ends, a most ironic fate awaits.”"
988,,300,Eldritch Teachings,Bloodborne,Control ,"“It could be said that magic does not exist within this world in any true capacity. Those who believe in mysticism are simply tampering with forces they have no understanding of. Yet, there are discoveries of rituals and methods that certainly resemble the arcane. 

As with the witches of Hemwick, you may sacrifice harvested eyes to summon Stalkers, almost demonic beings armed with hand scythes, difficult to perceive by layman. This is no specific skill, but the start of your abilities relating to human sacrifice and summoning of abominable wills. 

All manner of rituals writhe in your mind, though they all share the same themes. You must sacrifice parts of a thinking being, and the manner in which it was taken, and in which it was sacrificed, causes the lingering consciousness tied to the sacrifice to create a new form for itself. 

Harvested eyes create a being that carries the implement used to take them, and goes unseen. Numerous innocents boiled alive could create an animate slurry of limbs moving as one. A great and abhorrent enough sacrifice may even birth something greater, such as the One Reborn.”"
989,,300,Phoenix,Harry Potter,Control ,"A pet Phoenix. Able to carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have very powerful healing powers and they make for highly faithful pets."
990,,300,Thunderbird,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control ,A huge bird with six huge wings closely related to phoenixes. A thunderbird can sense danger approaching and can summon rain and storms with a flap of its wings. Its tail feathers are used as powerful wand cores.
991,,300,Unified Language,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"The language of ancient Babylon, perhaps even a time before it. A tongue that originates since
before the Tower of Babel was created, supposedly the language that all of humanity once shared. Perhaps it was so in truly ancient times but Babylon itself was not quite so impressive. Regardless of
it’s true origins, the Unified Language speaks truth and it cannot be denied. Humans who hear the
language cannot deny what it says, even should the speaker of the Unified Language be ordering
them to kill themselves or commit atrocities on their own families. To deny the truth of this tongue
would be like denying one’s own existence as a human. As a learned student of this language, you
essentially have the ability to perfectly hypnotise any human being, as your soul resonates with the
source of humanity as you intone the words. However, even the slightest bit of inhuman nature to a
person will allow them to mount a resistance, such as being connected to a inhuman entity for
magical power or having a monstrous ancestor, and significant inhumanity, such as divine heritage
or having altered one’s body and soul with magical experiments or being the vessel of a divine spirit, can allow total immunity to the first language."
992,,300,Mystic Eyes of Enchantment ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A much higher powered version of the eyes of Charm and Binding. The Mystic Eyes of Hypnosis are high level mind control spells, able to paralyse with a glance or dominate the mind and memories with a steady stare. Even without the application of magical energy, these eyes are able to tear through most magic resistance. It takes a powerful Magus to resist the eyes, someone capable of actively circulating large amounts of prana through their body to throw off your control, or someone with powerful Mystic Eyes of their own."
993,,300,Aggregate Impact Psychotherapy – AKA: Befriending ,Generic Magical Girl,Control,"After an enemy has been beaten into the dirt, you can use your magical powers of friendship to cure them of their evil ways, and possibly even convince them to join your team!

994,,300,Chlorokinesis ,Young Justice,Control,Chlorokinesis allows the user to control and greatly accelerate the growth of plants on the molecular level with their mind. This can be used to create hybridized plants as well as plantlike minions and creatures.
995,,300,Fire Spider ,Libriomancer,Control,"You possess a small pet, a tarantula like spider with unique red markings. Its primary diet consists of crickets, other small insects and sugary candies. It provides an immediate danger sense, flaring up as it almost supernaturally detects any and all threats to its owner. It is fiercely loyal, will obey all of your commands short of suicide and can emit heat and flame equivalent to that of a blow­torch on command. Or when angry. Mostly when it’s angry. Don’t make it angry."
996,,300,Love Candle ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"A candle blessed from a legendary cave. It is said that a mermaid saved the sailor she loved by leading him via candle to shelter in a cave; since then, when people write the name of their desired lover and light the candle in the cave on the anniversary of that day, as long as the flame does not die prematurely, the mermaid will hear your prayers and your love will be returned. Jump-chan has blessed your candle so it can be used anytime, anywhere to gain a blessing for a love you currently seek. Also, just as the candle’s flame boosts your love, the magic of love, whether through your emotions or through song, amplify the candle, such that it could potentially unleash a blinding light on opponents.
"
997,,300,Butterfly Fan ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"A Chinese-style fan that, when waved, sprays magic flower petals. The cursed petals make victims pose according to your will, and can also solidify into a cage. The fan can summon ice as well.
"
998,,300,Rhyme ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"It seems that you somehow learned the tricks of the Blue Men – insane humanoids that sleep face-down in water. If you speak a line of rhyme in front of the target, the target must reply with their own line of rhyme or else take mental damage and be paralyzed until the rhyme is completed.
"
999,,300,Pegasus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Control,"I’ve officially given up on understanding you short bastards. You have access to ponies and battle sheep - steeds that you can actually ride effectively and direct - and some of you are still mad enough to climb six or seven feet up into the saddle of a Sigmar-damned pegasus. You know those beasts fly high enough to reach the clouds, right? And your legs aren’t long enough to reach the stirrups?

Well if you insist. On purchase, you receive your very own, fully-matured pegasus. Theorized to ride on the Winds of Magic to support their equine bulk, Pegasi fly through the air as magnificently as any eagle or swan. Cunning and intelligent creatures, the pegasus is a mount worth thousands of gold crowns to any nobleman or magister of the Empire.
"
1000,,300,Mask of Heavens ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"An ornate golden mask that allows the wearer to meld his consciousness with that of any winged beasts capable of flight. Should the will of the wearer prove stronger than that of the beast it will serve loyally as well as draw on your own skills and abilities when ridden to become a true terror of the skies.
"
1001,,300,Shaman ,Endless Legend,Control,"All Walkers get in touch with their feral side. Some are consumed by it and lost. Others... Others master it. You can commune with the spirits of the world, and gain boons and inflict banes with them. Should you possess The Sharing, you have an increased resistance to being turned feral by your Sharing. You will be able to endure roughly twice as much, and have a far better sense of when you should stop before you lose your mind."
1002,,300­,Familiar (Twilight Familiar) ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Control,"A familiar is a spirit, a being native to the astral plane which may enter the coterminous realm of twilight. To become a familiar, a ritual occurs in which a mage mystically bonds the familiar to their soul, allowing them to see through the familiar’s eyes and have it perform tasks on their behalf. Spirits in turn may use the mage as an anchor to stay in the material world for prolonged periods of time, experiencing all they have to offer. Spirits come in one of two forms:

Twilight familiars are invisible and largely intangible unless they utilize their spiritual powers to affect the fallen world. These powers are diverse and include (but are not limited to) one of the following abilities; telekinesis, aura reading, minor curses, minor blessings, small electrical discharges and ectoplasmic formation. All of these uses however draw from the familiars innate pool of mystical energy, and when this is depleted, it cannot interact with the physical world until it has recharged."
1003,,300,Sand Wand ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Control,"This lovely little wand here has a magical ability to control sand, though admittedly only in a handful of preset forms. First off, it can cause sand to levitate, usually in the form of a cube. Basically, it slides it upwards a short distance, albeit only for a few seconds at a time. The range on this is quite nice, anywhere you can see AND, if you're absolutely certain that there's sand on the other side, even through walls. If you have magical energy to spare, it can even summon some sand for you to work with.
"
1004,,300,Summon Weapons (Master) ,Terraria,Control,"Staves or other items that are used to summon minions that follow you around and attack or which summon sentries that stay in-place and attack enemies that come near. Also includes whips which can focus the attention of your summons on a given spot and empower their attacks in different ways. Any purchases that would normally require Eternian Mana to use can be used normally straight away. 

Get a Summoner Emblem or Avenger Emblem, and can pick two weapons that are made of a late Hardmode, pre Lunatic Cultist ore [Chlorophyte, Shroomite, Spectre Bar] or which are listed here: Deadly Sphere Staff, Raven Staff, Desert Tiger Staff, Tempest Staff, Xeno Staff, Staff of the Frost Hydra, Lightning Aura Staff, Flameburst Staff, Explosive Trap Staff, Ballista Staff, Dark Harvest, Kaleidoscope, Morning Star

See Summon Weapons for more information."
1005,,350,Supernatural Aid and Helpful Witches,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control,"How is a hero to know where to go, or how to proceed? One common answer in these films is the helpful witch. Now, when you are on a quest and do not know how to proceed, either because the odds arrayed against you are too great, or you simply lack the clues, you have an odd tendency to find a helpful witch, wizard, spirit, or other supernatural entity which will tell you where to go for the next step of your journey. These witches and supernatural entities are not necessarily omniscient, or if they are they aren’t sharing all of the information with you, the methods they give you will not always be quick or easy, and they usually speak in riddles, but they will make sure that you never completely hit a dead end in your quests and journeys, always seeming to appear just in time to keep you going forward. Of course, you do need to be on an adventure for them to appear regularly, with a strong, definite, clear, and immediate goal: to find something, to defeat someone, to defend somewhere from a certain threat. More long term and indefinite goals like world peace, to keep somewhere safe in perpetuity, or to discover the grand unified theory may be beyond these witches.

These witches and supernatural beings are not limited to appearing while you’re wandering the lands aimlessly. When you are at your wits end in a fight or certain danger, they will occasionally appear to offer you some helpful advice to deal with the threat in front of you. They’re still not the clearest, and they will only appear rarely, so try to make sure that you are at your wits end while in danger only rarely."
1006,,400,Mirror of Loss,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"This tall full body mirror is an incredibly powerful sharran artifact that has many uses.
It’s a magical item that is used to completely change someone’s personality. You can add,
remove or modify memories from anyone who gazes upon the mirror, make them forget who
they are and even remake their whole personality from scratch.
The mirror itself can copy or steal memories and skills from its targets and it already
comes with a bunch of poor sods who have succumbed to its power. These memories and skills
are indexed with an innate sorting system you can peruse at your leisure. You can graft skills
and experiences stored within the mirror right into your mind, essentially gaining those abilities
for yourself. The memories trapped within the mirror came from geniuses and savants of the
Realms, you basically have quite a large selection. You could tap into the bargaining skills of a
merchant or maybe a fighting prowess of a legendary sell sword. The only rule is that you can
benefit from a single grafting at a time and must give up the previous one before gaining
another. In time you may add even more skills to this artifact’s repertoire.
The original mirror itself was cursed, forcing you to give a part yourself before you gain
its boon, but you don’t have to worry about giving anything, if you don’t want to.
This artifact either follows you magically throughout this jump or is placed in your
warehouse."
1007,,400,Infernal Pact,Baldur's Gate 3,Control,"You have seemingly ordinary stack of parchments. Upon closer inspection though, you
can notice that it has a whole array of shifting words that may be in an infernal script. These are
unfinished infernal contracts. You may use them to create binding pacts between you and any
outside parties.
Once signed in blood by both parties, the contract becomes fully and active and enforces
the obligations determined by both parties. But be careful, usually people who undertake these
kinds of deals are quite cunning. Even you may sneak in some discreet rules with enough
cunning though. Failure to abide by the rules usually have some pretty nasty punishments,
determined by both of the parties beforehand. If you lack the means, Nine Hells of Baator itself
could help you in the department of punishment (even in post-jump).
After signing you keep the only copy of the contract, and it becomes completely
indestructible.A contract may only end only when the clauses for release from contract activates
or both parties mutually agree to end the contract together. But best be on guard, some entities
may have some way to abuse such contracts and even break out of them.
You get an unlimited supply of these unfinished contracts, and they can appear right in

grants you endless life, but in return, it took from you a price... a payment, it seems, that your
otherworldly nature has restored to you. Despite this, the dragon remains by your side, a being
of power, linked to you by his very soul. The pact permits both of you to call upon the other’s
resistances when harmed by magic, psionics, disease, venom, or general bad health, and at
any time, you may call your companion to your side. You may also communicate telepathically,
and can yield your senses to the other if you wish. Finally, so long as the pact remains, neither
of you will age. Normally, in return, if one dies, the other inevitably does... though that too, your
strange nature seems to have prevented."

bounding to you, considering as their master. You’re now in control of a squad of
around a thousand of these ice soldiers, with each one of them being formidable on
their own as their strength is considerably that of the average front line soldier.
Despite their autonomy, they’re still mere ice golems that follow your will so they lack
an actual mind and emotions, meaning they’ll keep fighting for as long as you want
them to fight. Lastly, despite not being your followers due to their nature as mindless
golems, each soldier destroyed in battle will be replaced by a new one after a week."

animal companion at their side, and now, all of nature is potentially your ally. All animals will be
instinctively friendly towards you, unless you attack them, and they may aid you in battle if
others should attack you. By engaging in some test, such as a brief wrestle or a game of tag,
you can bond with an animal, which will allow you to share their sight and allow them to share a
portion of your strength. They can fight in unison with you, and you can communicate with them
mentally to guide their actions. You can bond with three or four animals at once, and you can
bring bonded animals along with you, though they do not count as Companions. Even in death,
nature’s blessings rest with you. You will gain a portion of the power and abilities of those you
kill. Hunt hawks, and your vision will increase. Hunt bears and your strength will grow. This can
even extend to the targets that you hunt for their bounties, granting you a portion of their skills
when they are slain.
In addition, your skill at hunting and tracking will increase massively, allowing you to follow a
week-old trail across hard ground as if it was a painted line. You can even guide your arrows in
mid-flight. If you are an Isu Hybrid, you will gain the ability to call upon Artemis’ Ghost Arrows,
allowing you to fire projectiles through solid objects to strike targets on the far side, and benefits
you will gain from slain prey will be much larger."

ferocity is matched only by its wisdom. This guardian dragon watches over the nesting grounds, offering
profound insights to those who prove themselves worthy of its presence. The only other inhabitants
are those who have joined the Dragon Covenant, a fellowship dedicated to the
dragon’s cause. You have come into possession of a similar region. The Ancient Dragon
and its Covenant will be loyal to you. The most interesting part is that any draconic
beings you encounter will populate the area. For instance, if you venture into the
Monster Hunter universe, the area will expand to accommodate the dragons you
encounter, creating a thriving, ever-growing haven for all draconic life under your
stewardship."

with dolls and illusions. The Semblance allows you to summon an endless army of dolls,
each one a solid illusion capable of engaging in combat. While these dolls are
formidable, they have a crucial weakness: they will dissipate after taking a single hit.
The true strength of Diorama however lies in its versatility and strategic applications.
You can create an overwhelming number of dolls to confuse and outnumber your
opponents, creating chaos on the battlefield. Additionally, you possess the ability to
swap places with any of the dolls under your control at will. This teleportation capability
lets you evade attacks, reposition yourself instantly, and launch unexpected assaults."

Your support staff includes intelligence analysts, cryptographers, military theorists, doctors, engineers,
trackers, criminologists, scientists, historians, mathematicians, linguists, and members of any academic
fields specific to the setting (such as mages in a setting with magical universities). Staff members follow
you from world to world, have the knowledge someone of their vocation would be expected to have about
any world you visit, and are able to remotely view you and your surroundings. Relevant members of your
staff are suitably placed within any hierarchy you belong to, potentially allowing you to go over the heads
of your immediate superiors—provided you're willing to deal with the resulting political fallout and/or
personal enmity.
For material aid, you can call in supply drops every 6 hours, which may include any commonly available
equipment in the setting, or any items from your Warehouse (respecting limits imposed by Drawbacks).
Supply drops also Restock all applicable items (see pg 15). You can also call in a platoon of 12 generic,
interchangeable soldiers any time you need help. It takes 24 hours to restore wounded-but-evacuated
soldiers and 72 hours to replace dead soldiers. Note that this perk does not give your staff the requisite equipment to make use of their skills--such things will have be bought, stolen, or rolled."

called Aridhol). Over time, it grew until it consumed the city and its
people. At present, it takes the form of a silvery mist that wanders the
streets at night and hides in the ground during the day.
You have now been bonded to your very own Mashadar-like entity,
capable of summoning it and control it completely, through the ability to
generate and control Mashadar, even shape it into ""tendrils"" around
yourself. The slightest touch of Mashadar is fatal, causing a slow and
agonizing death, and is even a formidable enemy to a channeller, as it is
very nearly impossible to destroy. Thanks to your bond, you are immune
to any negative effects of Mashadar, and it will never touch or hurt
anyone you don’t want it to. You will also find yourself growing stronger
as Mashadar feeds, the silver wind more than happy to feed you, it’s one
and only master. You can summon a beautiful and deadly dagger,
containing the taint of the Mashadar in a focused state, able to kill nearly
anything with a mere nick of the blade, in which whomever has been cut

growth of plants, calling/bringing/charming animals to you, and the strongest ability this offers is
a party song: a haunting melody that causes those who hear it to want to dance, sing, and
partake in all manner of party festivities (that you would want partaken in). Be warned, the
longer this song is played the more clouded the minds of the listener will become, bringing them to the brink of madness. Should the music suddenly stop and you command it, all the party members would follow that single command (such as tearing a man apart with their bare hands even if said man was their father/king)."
1023,,400,Haptasnytrir Foldardróttinn,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Control,"Like Odin, eternal seeker of knowledge, you have a gift for learning, not simply in a sense of being able to learn faster than most, but by more esoteric means, being able to locate long lost or forbidden knowledge and skills, beings who have refused prior students will never refuse you, instinctively knowing where to go and what to do to acquire more knowledge  and exploit it for your advantage.  Your learning speed, capacity, and intuition expanded by an order of magnitude and quests to find or locate such things equally shortened.
        But what good is knowledge if you can not exploit it, you now possess the ability to teach anybody almost anything, even if they are incapable of using that knowledge. You could teach a mortal how to wield divine power to create life and they would understand exactly how it works and would be capable of doing as such if they gain the ability to wield said divine power. Whenever you teach people anything, you gain power over them and what they have learned, gaining more power over them the more you teach and the more they wield your knowledge and skills.  You could teach someone to be a great fisherman, but make it so they could only catch catfish and these restrictions can be selectively applied as they teach others in a chain of learning. You could teach the world magic and runes and make it so those gifts could never be used against you, or that no matter how skilled and knowledgeable they become they are unable to teach anyone these things, their mind becoming momentarily blank. Even a third party observing you or your students would be unable to learn anything without your permission, even something as simple as making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, however this won't stop them from making a PB&J on their own they just won't be able to recall how you made it if they saw you do it, they literally would not, and could not, associate the name of the sandwich with those ingredients. If the knowledge from you is so intrinsic to a person that it is how they make a living or is what they are known for or is used in everyday life you would have the ability to manipulate their fate similar to the Norns with lesser control based on lesser connection of that knowledge, you could manipulate the fates of an entire kingdom, world or further with this. Students under you will be able to learn what you have to teach faster as if their intelligence, talent, capacity, and learning speed was increased by an order of magnitude.
You are a plotter and can easily come up with both direct and indirect ways of obtaining what you want. To your eyes obstacles look like opportunities and challengers like people bearing gifts. Moreover, when seeking something that you cannot obtain or achieve at the moment the steps and measures you must take to accomplish your will naturally fall into place in your mind given a bit of time.
But plans are nothing without the will to see them done. You have that will. Your determination is such that you can ignore or power through anything that would seek to stop you, should you choose to do so. From pain to loss to uncertainty to even the greatest social pressure there is nothing that can deter you from your goals but your own judgement. This will even let you break free from unnatural mental influences with effort.

You now have learned and hold an intuitive knowledge and understanding of deals, gambles, contracts, oaths, truths and half-truth, prices, debts, bargains, trades, exploits, loopholes, laws, and all manner of such things that would make the like of any demon or trickster god like Mephistopheles stare in bewilderment of such prodigious genius.  You know how to take advantage of this gift and the buttons to push in people to exploit them.  But what good is a deal without the means to enforce such arrangements? All deals that you partake in are backed by fate, chance, the world, the powers that be and probability in greater proportions than your own. As a mortal commoner, the king and his army or perhaps even some elves or a Disir would get involved to enforce such a deal, as one of the Vanir, all of mother earth would rush to enforce, the wrath of all of nature, the spirits, the valkyries and fate itself,  if the scope of your powers were beyond that, even omnipotent beings could be trapped, bound, and cursed by a contract with you. That's not to say such overt displays of enforcement are necessary, it's simply an example of the backing you possess. What's more is this purview extends to any deal made in your presence when you so desire, off handed, handshaken, simply spoken, or otherwise; if a drunken man at a bar absently says he would give his wife and farm for just one more drink and you hear it, it's a deal and all that was promised is yours or someone elses for one more drink if you so wish to enforce it. These insurances do not apply against you, however if you don't follow through with your end this backing will not be there and if you break other peoples' deals enough you may become known as an oathbreaker and cheat so no one will want to deal with you. Oaths were so valued among the gods that Odin asked his friend  at a gathering to stand up and give his seat to Loki, who had just killed his son Baldr not long before, so that they could drink together because in their youth Odin said he would not sit and drink in revelry if Loki was not afforded such opportunity also, this level of compulsion is present in all your dealings. (It should be noted that Odin and the other gods after the party proceeded to kill one of Loki's sons rip out his intestines and bind Loki to a rock under the earth with the entrails and hang a poisonous snake over him, dripping venom into his eyes till ragnarok came, but at least he got his drink) "

1026,,400,Key of Names,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"You've discovered a crystalline shard of power that resides within your spirit. This shard possesses various functions, all centered around the concept of Naming. Every existing entity, be it an object or a creature, has a true name. Initially, you can channel your willpower through the shard to study and discern the true name of what you're examining. As you delve deeper into understanding something and approach the realization of its true name, you gain conceptual power over it. However, dealing with sentient beings requires contesting, defeating, or subduing them before exercising full control.

This process may vary in difficulty, especially when it comes to your own true name. Accepting uncomfortable truths about yourself is often necessary to fully grasp your true name. Upon learning the foundational true name of something, the Key of Names crystallizes a version of it. You can then manifest and control these crystallized copies in the real world, as well as mantle other things with their true names.

Mantling involves overlaying a true name onto something to conceptually manifest the named thing's aspects. For instance, mantling the true name of a sword onto yourself might enable your punches to cut like a sword or transform yourself into the sword's form. Choosing which aspects are transferred during mantling is within your control.

The Key of Names bestows increasing spacetime control over crystallized true names. This allows you to summon or banish any true names you've crystallized at the foundational level, including your own, granting you temporal-spatial control over yourself. Sending named things back in time requires a high degree of mastery.

Additionally, the Key can be used to name places and things, but overwriting the true names of things demands mastery of their true names. Naming can alter various aspects of the object, with more significant conceptual changes requiring greater mastery. For example, changing a car's color is easier than transforming its engine. Naming a location requires realizing a few foundational true names and begins with a small area, expanding as mastery grows. Focusing on specific boundaries, such as a forest rather than a broad area, facilitates narrowing down a place's true name.

As mastery of the Key advances, you can realize the True Names of indirect concepts and gain control over them. However, initially, only tangible things that engage your senses can be studied and have their true names realized."

By default they are as strong as steel, and they can get stronger by leeching powers off of people they touch. As you drain other, their powers get weak and weaker until they are gone forever. While you do not get these powers yourself, you will have control over the different powers that your ribbons manifest. Your ribbons may have an unlimited number of powers, and they all share them with each other, making it impossible to lose them without outside trump influence.

similar bloodthirst or even noble birth.

These groups you form invariably consider you their rightful leader and methods to exert influence
on the rest of the organisation naturally present themselves to you. Despite this supposedly being a
military with a strict hierarchy, you’ll find ways to leverage the people and resource you gain into
getting your way with almost anything. Yachiru had secret bases carved out even under Noble

only slight movements. While the threads can physically manipulate objects, their strength and
durability decided by your own energy invested, their main purpose is to ‘invade’ other things with
your Reiryoku. Once connected, you are able to manipulate the minds and bodies of other things, the former being much easier than the latter. The reiryoku that is within the enemy’s body allows for illusions to be crafted, affecting all five of
their normal senses. The quality and complexity of the illusions is largely based on your skill and
creativity with this technique, improving with practice from the simple images you can form now. On
the physical side, the threads can immobilise those not more powerful than you without much
difficulty and weaker beings might be able to be controlled like dolls. The threads can be cut or destroyed if hit from a sufficiently powerful source and the illusions have a
special weakness. Anyone who closes off their hearts to you, feeling no empathy or strong emotions

mighty Captains to the full thousands of lesser soldiers in your army, is a simple matter. Both
strategic and tactical matters are clear to you, though you perform best at matching up individuals
with their most suitable opponents. As you continue to rule and impress a greater fealty onto your men, you’ll become like a symbol to

reason why YOU don’t abuse those illusion powers you’ve had in your back pocket more.
People have an uncanny tendency to keep forgetting or dismissing your powers even after you
use them, though this effect is stronger the less you use them regularly. Fly every day
unexpectedly and after a week or two everyone will accept it’s just part of your powerset, but do
it around once a week and you could keep folks guessing until someone sits down and makes

1039,,400,Demonic Statue,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Control,"A Demonic Statue of the Outer Path is the empty husk of
a Ten-Tails that remains after its chakra is removed from its body. Apparently, the
Ten-Tails that your pair brought to Earth before your betrayal ended up becoming a
husk after some events and you become the master of the resulting Statue. Your
Demonic Statue has just a little fraction of its original power, being weaker than a
Tailed Beast, and has half the size of a mountain, as well as a tremendous life force,
capable those that receive it to extend their natural life span to near agelessness,
regenerate even entire limbs and augment their strength. Its two main abilities are to
emit phantom dragons made of a special kind of chakra capable of absorbing the
energy of anyone that touches it and emit the same chakra chains used by the Outer
Path of the Rinnegan. As a final bonus, the Statue retains some of the former traits
and is capable of incorporating any absorbed chakra and energy, becoming more
powerful and even gaining new forms, but, unfortunately, its former chakra is
permanently lost, making impossible to it to return to its original Ten-Tails form.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."
1040,,400,Shaper of Life,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Control,"You’re incredibly talented in using your abilities, be it
ninjutsu/Shinjutsu or out-of-jump power, to creating constructs or golem-like entities
that you may take control of them directly using your energy or set them to perform
simple tasks instead, like using to shape Earth Release into a stone golem or
separating a Tailed Beast’s chakra into lesser chakra beasts (like the Juubi’s fission
beings and the Nine Masked Beasts) for example. This also grants you a lot more
affinity with any actual biomancy or entity creating abilities you may have."
1041,,400,Masterful Planning,Naruto,Control,"Say what you want of Zetsu but he was a master planner, pulling at the strings of even incredibly powerful beings like Madara, Indra Ōtsutsuki, and all the Kage and ninja in the world. With just his ability to plan, Zetsu was able to manipulate the entire world and most major events from the shadows over countless lifetimes, in his quest to resurrect his mother; and you are his equal. Your planning is legendary, able to encompass literal lifetimes and manipulate entire worlds, all without them even knowing you exist. Furthermore, unlike other so-called master planners, your plans take into account every possible eventuality and change that could ever occur to disrupt your plans. Your plans also possess a final unique ability: the longer your plans are in motion, the more momentum they gain, eventually becoming impossible to stop. This momentum will take time to build up, taking multiple generations to become truly unstoppable."
1042,,400,Oooh Jumper,Naruto,Control,"There’s something about you, jumper, a certain charm that seems to draw people around you. When they speak of beings such as Hashirama Senju and Naruto Uzumaki and the raw power of their charisma, the force that seems to burst from them like a tidal wave, they are speaking of beings like you. With a few minutes of talking to people you could turn them into either your best friends or your most loyal of subordinates and unlike others they would serve you loyally rather than through fear or extortion and whether through your mere presence or your comforting words you can bring about the best in others even if its so deep that even the best cannot see it.

1043,,400,Eidolon,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"As all L’Cie do, you will have to face a challenge to overcome your greatest fear. Succeed in proving your will, and you will conjure forth an Eidolon of your choosing. The conjuration is taxing, and will only remain in the Material World for three minutes at first. You may eventually extend this to six minutes, but it provides quite a drain on your energy reserves."
1044,,400,Pandemonium,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"Rebellions often have chaotic moments, but you seem to have chaotic moments more often than that. In fact, you seem to inspire utter chaos with your presence alone.

Pick an area, twenty five meters in radius. All individuals within that area go berserk and act randomly for a period of three minutes. On top of that, they lose all of their abilities and have them replaced by an ability to summon cats until the time is up. The cats are permanent until death. 

You can use this ability three times a day."
1045,,400,Spare​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"This child was raised from to be a repository of a God by some local cult. They have found themselves in your care. They are quiet, polite, and show you nothing but complete and utter adulation and an undying loyalty. They would want nothing more than to be your host should your current one perish. It is perhaps this reason that Jump-chan allows you to take their body when you die. You can only have one Spare per jump. At the start of each jump, they start at the equivalent age of 16 and is of a non-magical race that will default to human. If your Spare is imported as a companion, you lose the ability to take over their body should you die and a new Spare will appear in your next world. If you wish, Spares that exist in other worlds can have faint memories of their previous lives in other worlds. This cycle of reincarnation and remembrance is broken if a Spare is used and a new one continues."
1046,,400,Don’t​ ​Fear​ ​The​ ​Reaper,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"It was once in the purview of the Halaku to ferry the souls of mankind into the land of the dead. It has been a long time since they have had to do such things, but even now their work has left an imprint. Most spirits and ghost will look upon a reaper amicably, and even the most maddened Spectre will pass over a Slayer unless attacked first."
1047,,400,It’s​ ​The​ ​Fear​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"In the time of atrocities, the Devourers were peerless combatants, and terrifying to behold. Within line of sight of you engaging in combat, others can feel your bloodlust that can stop even some hardened combatants to give pause, while those of weaker will might simply collapse as their legs refuse to hold them. Your presence on the battlefield is horrifying, and the more vicious you are, the more your enemies will hesitate and make simple mistakes they might not otherwise have made."
1048,,400,Listen​ ​To​ ​Your​ ​Heart​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"Unlike Cassandra, when you speak of the future, others listen. When you speak the absolute truth about what is to come, your voice rings with certainty. Perhaps it is goosebumps running up the listeners arms, or a heavy weight in their stomach. No matter how it affects them, the knowledge will cling to them and it might be hard to get your words out of their head. Whatever the case, even the most reluctant listener will be very susceptive to accepting your words as Truth."
1049,,400,Ushabti ,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"Even in Aaru, labour does not cease, for the green fields need tilling just as the fields of the living do. The shrewd soul prepares one of these: an ushabti statuette. When called upon to work, this lone ‘answerer’– carved in likeness of yourself - will ‘answer’ for you. It will come to life as a simulacrum of yourself and carry out labours demanded of it with the same skill as you possess. Its work, however, is unimaginative, for it possesses only a ka (animating force), and no ba (personality) and precious little ib (mind), so it cannot show initiative, invent new things or develop a new way of going about anything – if called on to make an object, it will do so from rote or exactly according to the words of the one instructing it. It feels no fatigue from its exertions but neither does it defend itself unless ordered. If maimed or injured will revert back to its statue form."
1050,,400,Blessings To The Faithful ,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"Prayers from your worshippers no longer only swell your heka like a river filling with rain, but the very words of your faithful will reach you as long as they are made in the manner you command. You may choose to shut out these prayers or resume hearing them at any time. As well as words, offerings of food reach you too: if they are made to you in your shrines or in the manner you command, this food provides sustenance for you.

Your heka may fulfill their prayers at your pleasure. After a worshipper finishes making a prayer to you, there is a short window in which you can respond by a working of magic. Your ‘reply’ may be a message or a spell which is enacted as if you were standing at your supplicant’s location, instead of your own."
1051,,400,Begetting,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"Gods beget gods, but only rarely in the expected way. New gods spring whole and complete from the thoughts of their forebears; they grow from their spilled tears, blood and other fluids; they bestow upon others their own might, or take a mortal and throw them into a magical fire in order to burn away their mortal parts and leave only their immortal and godly ones.

You may create new neter related to your Sphere of Influence – for example if you reigned over “writing”, you could split off sub-deities for the writing quill, ink, and papyrus, or perhaps for individual written characters, while a god of “violence” might beget smaller gods of specific methods or circumstances related to violence. 

The means of creation are nigh limitless, though such acts must be accompanied by an expenditure of your magical power.

You may control how closely your begotten gods mentally resemble yourself, from merely being avatars or extensions of your own mind, to independent of thought but with the utmost devotion to their creator, or completely free-willed and bearing only thematic resemblance to yourself."
1052,,400,Funerary Possessions,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"You may designate certain of your belongings to be your funerary possessions, items not to be inherited by your descendants, but kept with you into the afterlife.

Should your consciousness or soul (or ka or ba) ever leave your body in spiritual form, either voluntarily (in the case of things like Astral Projection or similar magics) or involuntarily (by dying or otherwise having your soul pulled out), the designated belongings will also accompany your soul as spiritual copies, permitting your immaterial form to use them just like your physical body did. These belongings cannot be in the possession of or used by other people, and must be kept either in a secure place or on your person."
1053,,400,Invisible,Marvel Zombies,Control,"You have two powers. You can turn invisible at will and generate force fields (which are also invisible). At first, you’ll be limited to simply turning yourself invisible (you can still see) and making simple shapes, but your powers are far more versatile than simple walls, domes, and turning yourself invisible. With a bit of effort, you can learn how to make more things than yourself imperceptible. People and objects around you. Even people’s optic nerves, making them temporarily blind. As long as you can see something, you can turn it invisible (with the exception of the nerves). And you can move your force fields, expand or shrink them, and place them almost wherever you want. You could even put them inside someone and expand it, with gruesome results. Again, get creative. That’s how you achieve the fantastic."
1054,,400,Torch ,Marvel Zombies,Control,"Behold, the burning power of fire, held by both Johnny Storm and Jim Hammond, Marvel’s first superhero! Zombies will have a hard time getting to you. If you’re one yourself, I hope you like barbeque. You are a being of fire. While you’re not made of it, you can wreath yourself in it whenever you want - whether that’s part of your body or the whole thing. Pyrokinesis is your thing - you can blast things with jets of flame, throw fireballs, create constructs out of fire, and fly at up to supersonic speeds. You’re pretty much immune to flame, too, and hot enough to melt bullets before they hit you. If you’re really pushing it, you can reach 1000, 000 degrees Fahrenheit. Be warned, you can’t stay alight forever. You’ll eventually run out of energy and need to recharge for a while. When not on fire, you passively accumulate energy."
1055,,400,Electrokinesis,Marvel Zombies,Control,"You can generate and control great quantities of electricity, definitely enough to give you superpowers. For starters, you can shoot lightning bolts and zap things you touch. Shocking. They can be anything from a small jolt to lethal bolts that’d turn people into little more than ashes. But there’s a lot more to it than just that. You’re capable of flying or otherwise getting around by riding around on electrical currents, including ones you create yourself, and you’re not limited to the electricity you create, being able to manipulate nearby sources of electricity as well as you could your own. You might even learn how to influence anything that runs on the stuff."
1056,,400,Zvilpogghua,Marvel Zombies,Control,"The Feaster from the Stars, of Cthulhu Mythos fame. This is an alien parasite from another dimension, the N-Zone. This parasite is not sapient in any way. It will naturally gravitate towards the most powerful being it can find and uses them as a host, consuming them from the inside. It will take one week to complete this process. When it does, the host will perish and Zvilpogghua will become an immensely powerful being, said to be a threat to every being on a given planet. It’s certainly capable of consuming every being on the planet, given something more powerful doesn’t stop it. We never see that actually happen in the comics, so be prepared for when it does happen. The parasite has now come into your possession, and will listen to your orders. The creature can be summoned and banished from whence it came through some obscure Atlantean ritual that you have down pat - you won’t mess it up."
1057,,400,Psychic(400),Marvel Zombies,Control,"Most of this sort of power is found among mutantkind. You have the trademark psionic powers usually found - either telepathy or telekinesis, or both for some more points. For 400cp, you have one or the other, and it’s not really the peak of what psychic powers can achieve. Psylocke (Kwannon, I guess) would be a good benchmark for this in terms of psionic strength, though you’d only have one half of the deal. Either the mind reading, empathy, and modification of other minds (we’ll get into that) or throwing around a couple of tons."
1058,,400,The Preceptor,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"The Henne Mines have long been put on halt, since the discovery of something ancient and terrible. Phase 1 has been locked down and sealed, but you can break those physical locks and venture inside.

Phase 2, the latest expansion, has been bound shut with magick, and the Garif need to be convinced that it should be opened. The Zodiac Spear may well prove to them that you are worthy.

But something is amiss when you venture inside. The atmosphere is heavy, choked with Mist. Any Viera companions you have with you will suffer greatly. The mining suits nearby may help with that – but your magic and skills will be greatly reduced in efficiency here. Monsters here are greatly empowered by the magicite, you can expect them to be as strong as you are and come in hordes.

The mine site is relatively linear in nature, and before you enter an area marked as the Special Charter Dig Site, you see another Zodiac Spear, identical to yours. Has somebody already been here? Either way, the other side appears to be less stifling, and your magick flows freely.

As you venture into the Special Charter Dig Site, there are a long line of seals blocking off one more chamber. Approaching these seals activates them. A simulacrum of the Espers appears – to warn you to turn away. If you do not heed it, it will fight you. You must go through eleven of these seals – each one adding another Esper to the fray on top of the one already summoned forth, until you are fighting all but Ultima and Zodiark themselves.

When you defeat all eleven at once, the seal binding the final chamber releases and a woman walks out. Perhaps she was the owner of the other Zodiac Spear. She will ignore your existence and disappear, leaving you free to enter the final chamber.

Zodiark awaits you here, apparently awoken by the woman. His wings have sprouted, and space is visibly warping around him due to his power. He is twice as strong as your party combined, perhaps the biggest challenge you will face in Ivalice save for a Legend. It also does not help matters that he will summon all eleven Esper Simulacrums you fought previously throughout the fire. Should you defeat him, he will revert to his normal form and join you as a Companion.

Zodiark’s growth has no limit, but the binders on him are an inherent part of him and as such he cannot release them on a permanent basis. In addition to his natural abilities, he has the full skills of Mage unlocked. He only has 300 CP to use for further growth. He may adopt a background, but cannot adopt a race.

Should you arrive in Henne Mines without the Zodiac Spear’s magick, you will not be able to see through the veil blocking Zodiark, even if you can enter Phase 2. You will only at best, fight yet another Simulacrum of Zodiark.

Requires Zodiac Spear to Purchase"

Aside from being completely sea and sky worthy, thanks to incredible craftsmanship from the Hephaestus Cabin, this ship is capable of flying itself thanks to what appears to be a sentient dragon head at the top of its mast. Aside from being a rather comfortable ride for a decent crew of heroes, one of its hidden functions lies in its destruction. When the ship is destroyed (or if ordered to) the dragon head will disconnect and multiple parts from the ship will reconnect with it, forming a creature in the size and shape of a dragon that loyally follows your orders until ordered to reconnect to the ship or destroyed. However, in exchange while the dragon is disconnected the boat will be rendered inoperable, either floating aimlessly in the water or air depending until the dragon reattaches itself. Should the ship be destroyed it will appear within the Warehouse again in one week, good as new."
1062,,400,Strength/Yuu Koutari,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"No, the words above haven’t been mistakenly switched. Strength is a Shadow, an Otherself that has been forcibly switched into the life of their real self and vice-versa. Strength has taken the place of Yuu Koutari and Yuu Koutari has taken the place of Strength. Strength is an excitable and perky girl with a teasing side and doesn’t seem to care all that much about learning in school... probably due to the fact that no-one remembers her save for those with Otherselves. It hides a sadder side of her where she wishes her real-self would come back to the real world and get back with all of these possible friends she has. The real Yuu was a stoic and silent girl with a horrible home life and was constantly bullied in school, her only friend was Saya Irinio who took great strides to take care of the beaten down girl, but it was not enough, the pain too great and she switched lives and has since become... a bit deranged and bloodthirsty, but she has never lost her friendship with Saya and she’s generally affable so long as you are too.

If you’ve companioned Strength as a Shadow or Counselor, than you’ve more than likely met the real Yuu while she was friends with Saya and was her only friend alongside Saya, while you did liven up her days, it was still not enough to stop her from switching over and in the case of The Shadow, probably gave her the idea to switch over in the first place. If you’re a Student, you were friends with Strength, one of the only few people to remember her, maybe even childhood friends alongside Mato Kuroi and thus made her more greatly enjoy her time in the real world despite no-one else remembering her. You’re capable of remembering her, even if you normally wouldn’t be able to.

If you companioned her as an Otherself, than you’ve formed a friendship with the real Yuu in the Otherworld and alongside Black★Gold Saw, effectively her only friend down there, needless to say its been a while since she talked to her and she has a bit of a shy streak... perhaps you can get her to come back to the real world after everything is said and done, maybe even save her from Black★Rock Shooter’s rampage.

Strength has the entire Shadow and Otherself perk-line save for Switching Lives, Awakening of the Soul, and Insanity of the Other, she also has the Merge With Transcendence, and Club Keeper perk from the Student origin. She has the Braided Bracelet item, and The Shack and The River items.

Yuu Koutari has the entire Otherself perk-line save for Insanity of the Other, she has the Switching Lives and Awakening of the Soul perk from The Shadow perk-line and she has the ★ Outfits item.

Both of them have Drawn By Huke.

Otherself Powers (For both Strength and Yuu Koutari): All freebies, Supernatural Strength III, Supernatural Durability III, Regeneration III, Unusual Body (Four arms,) Elemental Manifestation (Fire,) Combo Weapon/Ranged Weapon (Ogre Arms, Extra Form, fist/minigun weapons, turns into more powerful miniguns, piledriver with four arms.)

Territory Traits: Small size, Closed Off, Portal Barriers, Low Complexity, Labyrinth Insides, Cube Control

Both Strength and Yuu Koutari count as one companion. They do not have any remaining CP to spend unless gained by drawbacks, nor TP or OP as well. Unless you want to spend your own."
1063,,400,Saya Irino/Black★Gold Saw,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"The head (more than likely, the only one,) guidance counselor at Dawn Middle School, running Dawn Consulting for any student that is having problems with school, or even those of more personal manners. She might not be a proper therapist, but when she gets down to it, she’s very good at making people open up about their feelings and having them talk so she can try to push them in the right direction...

Or break them down so they form an Otherself or make their Otherself stronger. A kind, caring facade woven around a manipulative personality all for the sake of her goal of protecting her friend from Black★Rock Shooter, the Otherself known as Yuu Koutari, a human girl who’s pain and grief was so great that her Otherself could not help her in containing it, so she decided to switch lives with her Otherself and found the Otherworld’s life of almost constant combat a better alternative to the loneliness and pain fo the real world... save for Saya who was her only friend before she vanished. She promised to protect her and the Otherworld from destruction, and so she and her Otherself dedicated her time to this task. While it seems like her manipulative personality is the truth, it is in actuality another facade, she hates doing what she does and wishes there was another way to protect the Otherworld from Black★Rock Shooter and guilt often consumes her and her actions.

Black★Gold Saw on the other hand appears to be confident and collected with a rather… gentle, accepting demeanor for an Otherself, being the most in-tune with her real self they often have ‘conversations’ together with Saya, she also in-general seems to know a lot about the Otherworld itself, probably as a result of becoming its protector.

If you’ve companioned Saya as The Shadow or Counselor, you were probably around the time where she was a teen and still in school, having become her friend through that way, with you as a Shadow possibly reminding her of Yuu as well and if you companioned Yuu as well than you possibly have met them both at the same time. If you’ve companioned her as a Student then you’re on particularly good terms with the counselor and her guilty conscience seems to rear its head every time she’s with you and wouldn’t think of trying to traumatize you like she had done to others... calling her out on it might be enough to straight-up break her.

If you’ve companioned her as an Otherself than you were maybe born from one of the times Black★Gold Saw used her watering can to create Incompletes, she saw in you the potential to turn into a complete Otherself and helped you set yourself up, protected you before you formed a Territory and went your own way. However, you’ve met her a couple more times and your friendly disposition and you remembering her fondly seems to have surprised them and dare you say, even happy a little bit, maybe even enough to draw Saya’s own attention. What this means between the connection of your real self and Saya is up to you… 

Saya Irinio has the entire Counselor perk and item-line.

Black★Gold Saw has, Drawn By Huke, the entire Otherself perk line save for the Insanity of the Other and she only has the ★ Outfits, and The Unturned Key item. Her weapon, King Saw, can, as a special ability, act as a less powerful Unturned Key.

Otherself Powers: All freebies, Supernatural Strength III, Supernatural Speed III, Regeneration II, Creation of Memory, Transferal of Boundaries (Water Walk, Shatter Barriers, Forced Transportation), Scrying (Scrying Projection), Suggestion of Gravity, Melee Weapon (One Form, Energy Slash/Beam, Skyscraper Blade, Weapon Projection)

1064,,400,You Look... Just Like Her ,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"And even though they know you’re not the same person, they still can’t help but not make that final blow. Whenever you look like someone’s friend, lover, or family, even if they know you’re not the same person they’re unable to raise their hand against you or are otherwise predisposed to giving you the benefit of the doubt and liking you, especially when they really shouldn’t. This effect is significantly increased when the person-in-question is missing or otherwise known to be dead, and decreases significantly when that person is within sight or otherwise close at-hand.

You may have this do the opposite effect if you wish, inciting hate and rage if you look like a foe’s enemy or rival even if they know they’re just tricking you, so as to make them sloppy in combat or focusing on other things if you’re able to taunt them with their voice.

The closer you act to the real person also makes this perk more powerful, while a thin facade will weaken it, just never enough to be useless."

Well, you have taken up the mantle of my power, so you shall be the means by which I spread my glory to this and all of the worlds to come. Do not fret yourself, little thing, you are now one with a Goddess, free of mortal limitations. By my divine radiance, lesser beings fall to their knees and supplicate themselves before me - they are incapable of striking back, incapable of even conceiving of it. The mere thought of defiance has been utterly removed from their minds. Wherever you go, my radiance shall wash over the unknowing masses and ensure that only the purest faith and loyalty remains.

Its circumstances, personality, and even abilities will ultimately all be determined by whatever event led you to your untimely and no doubt gruesome demise. Which in and of itself is probably an indication you failed to sla-(save!) slay the Princess and doomed us all, but I digress."
1068,,400,Most Worthy Foe,Slay the Princess,Control,"You are from this moment on recognized as the single most worthy opponent any enemy has ever encountered. From now, until the point that you both meet your untimely gruesome ends, you and your newly designated ‘rival’ (or ‘rivals’, as the case may be), will always recognize the other as being an opponent worthy of consideration and not just fighting each other with all you have, but your enemies will respect you for your strength and will ultimately show you respect in turn. This ability is only really effective however if you have faced and beaten someone once before, causing them to define you (in their hopelessly deluded little minds) as their ‘archenemy’. They may or may not decide to chase you to the ends of the earth, but that is not at all my concern."

One of these techniques is the summoning of semiautonomous balls of elemental force, while you cannot summon all the elements like she can you are now able to call upon two of these orbiting magical spheres to attack your enemies. By choosing the element at the time of casting you create these elemental minions, protecting you as you cast your spells."
1070,,400,Avatorium,Dies Irae,Control,"You will not always be able to take care of things personally. Sometimes this is simply due to needing to place your full attention elsewhere, though sometimes you will not even be able to enter the same world as your goal without destroying it. For these purposes, the creation of an avatar can work perfectly, something you are now able to do. You are able to create avatars of varying sorts, ranging from clones of yourself that are controlled by your mind but have a far weaker body and soul of their own to equal replicas of yourself to separate beings that simply share a few traits of yours but are otherwise distinct individuals. The greater the power of the avatar compared to your full might, the maximum they could be given, the longer it will take to craft them and the more tiring it would be for you. Creating a mundane human body to serve as a vessel for your mind to interact with the mortal realm might be the work of minutes but creating a unique being that possesses the potential to equal you in power but is otherwise a separate being may take years on years of careful and exhausting work."

If you find yourself and your friends at the end of the line with no help on the way...maybe you can still work out a way to get out alive. Excepting cases where you truly, personally pissed the bad guy off, you’re able to strike a deal for your life and the life of your friends in exchange for something very important. It might be allowing the villains plans to go ahead with your help, it might be them taking something vital from you as punishment or even taking everything but your life and the lives of your friends from you. Whatever deal you make will be up to the whims of the opponent and you will be forced to obey the terms, though you can try and convince them to lighten the load a bit. Once struck, they’ll leave you alone.

When people speak of the charisma of the legendary kings of old, the sort of people like Alexander the Great or King Arthur, and describe how they believe they had such a force of personality that it manifested in an aura...they’re describing what you were like the moment you were born. You’ve only grown greater since and now, you’re standing equal with the most charismatic man in the world. With a few minutes long speech, you could talk an enemy army of hundreds of thousands into happily killing themselves to please you. You could convince lifelong enemies of yours, people who you had done atrocious things to, to become loyal allies with just a single conversation. Men and women both, even those who believed themselves to be conquerors in their own right, fall in love with you just from the force of your presence. Your charisma surrounds you like a hurricane, pressing down on the minds and spirits of all those who are near to you even when you do not speak, making it almost unthinkable for those around you to not do as you desire before you even request it. It is not impossible for someone to resist your beguiling words but only the sort of man who could look at the face of God and spit in it could manage such a feat, something that might be beyond even the greatest of heroes or villains."
1074,,400,Haunted Armor,Hotel Transylvania,Control,300 sets of cursed and magical armor that are 100% loyal to you. All the armors share a single mind and share their senses. In a place like a castle they can act as surprisingly stealthy spies by blending in among the non living sets of armor. The armor are treated as followers
1075,,400,Lioness of Judgment ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Control,"This looks like a fairly ordinary lioness. Except it seems to be anything but. While not physically superior to an ordinary lioness, this lioness is highly intelligent - seemingly almost human - and is a magical beast. Beyond being able to harm those who would resist non-magical blows, this lioness is somewhat resistant to magic of all sorts, especially magic to control the mind and behavior. Its true power is the ability to pass judgment. At the start of each jump you may select a moral, social, or ethical code. If asked to pass judgment on an individual the lioness can determine if that individual has broken the code, or an individual part of it if called to judge only that facet, and will maul them in accordance with the severity of the breach determining the severity of the mauling.

If killed or lost this lioness will be replaced within 6 months."
1076,,400,Cloning,The God of High School Jump,Control,"You can split yourself into many, many clones as a special power. These clones are perfect copies of you, including any weapons you possess (But not other artefacts apart from weapons or armour) and will act as if they were you to support you. These clones are even capable of creating more clones themselves but you should be warned that the more clones that are active, through you or your clones, the weaker every instance of you and your clones will be. The further these clones get form you, the weaker they will become and the more different from you they will act, though this would only become noticeable if they were on a different planet from you or in another dimension."
1077,,400,Yamato no Orochi,The God of High School Jump,Control,"A giant many-headed snake monster from Japanese legends. Unlike the normal owner, your partnership does not force you to struggle for control or survival, as you maintain full control over Orochi at all times. Yamato no Orochi enhances your physical strength and grants you great regenerative abilities, enough to heal from being bisected at the waistline. You are also able to summon snakes from your own body or the environment around you to attack any foes, ranging from tiny but highly venomous snakes to creatures that dwarf ancient trees."
1078,,400,Red Dragon,The God of High School Jump,Control,"An enormous female Red Dragon originating from Britain’s legends, the Red Dragon is large enough to encircle a large apartment building multiple times over and still have some length left over. Able to create and manipulate fire at will, sharing this ability with her partner, she is also immensely physically powerful and speedy. Red Dragon is also capable of incredible feats of regeneration, healing from even severe wounds across the entire body in minutes, whilst coming back to life as a hatchling two months later whenever she is killed. She is very protective of her partner and has a great passion for gold of any kind, becoming ecstatic on being given gold bars or jewellery as a gift. Red Dragon is one of the rare Charyeok to be able to polymorph themselves, being able to turn into a pretty young redheaded girl with twin tails."
1079,,400,Phoenix,The God of High School Jump,Control,"A great bird made from blue flames. The Phoenix is not only able to tear apart foes with its super sharp, giant claws and beak, but also generate and control fire in large amounts. It’s most fearsome ability however, is the ability to leech the life off of other beings in order to multiply itself. Whether through the contracted user or on an enemy, Phoenix is able to devour their life energy to grow bigger or to grow additional bodies, which are equally powerful to the original Charyeok."
1080,,400,King of War,The God of High School Jump,Control,"Leading a war against all of Heaven and all of Earth at once, when many of your soldiers are as disciplined as a herd of cats, is quite a task. Especially when they are literally a herd of cats. You’ve got a mind like no other though. You won’t just rely on the raw power of a few individuals to win your battles. Not only are you a military strategist almost unsurpassed on Heaven or Earth but you know just how to get a whole bunch of people to work together and combine their powers to take down someone much stronger. And if events happened so as to prevent you from being capable of leading your men, whether on a small or a large scale? They’d be able to function for at least a short time as if you were still there, instinctually aware of what you would have given as orders. Won’t last forever but it’ll make sure things don’t fall apart whilst you’re away."
1081,,400,Star Crossed Lovers        ,The God of High School Jump,Control,"Gods consider themselves above humans. For a God to lie with a human would be like a human laying with a sheep or particularly large rat. Yet, despite this bias, romance has managed to blossom between Human and God in the past. No matter what they are, even those incapable of feeling emotion at all, or what their feelings might be to your species, country, faction etc, you are able to ignite a spark of potential attraction in any one and any-thing. This does not guarantee that they will pursue it or respond to your advances in place of fighting you but if you can manage to fan that spark into the flame of an actual relationship, that bond will progress far quicker and far more deeply than it ever would before. You will quickly reach understandings with each other, grow closer and closer by the day and so long as the two of you remain together, will soon become bonded as strongly as forged steel. You may also use this latter ability on the romances of others, if they both be willing, and grant them the increased progression and intensity that you enjoy yourself."
1082,,400,The Dead Smile,Final Fantasy X,Control,"In places where many have died, the presence of Pyreflies is normally very common – it’s not so much the Pyreflies that are a hazard, but rather the lingering sentiments of those who have died. Not merely Pyreflies, you can manipulate spirits and guide them back into bodies, temporarily animating them and giving them some measure of autonomy once again.

You’ll end up with dead bodies shuffling about no doubt, but this is merely a precursor for what is to come... When the dead walk again...well...those who would deem it unnatural are not necessarily wrong."
1083,,400,Beckoning,Final Fantasy X,Control,"All throughout Spira, there have been “instances” where spirits have returned...from places unknown. Not even considering the Unsent, no this lies beyond that. The entities that are brought forth...they may not even have been originally from Spira at all. This phenomenon – known as “Beckoning” still doesn’t have any explanation. After all, most of the individuals which were beckoned seem to integrate well with Spira’s society...as amnesiacs.

Your ability to beckon is weak at first...but depending on how much you choose to focus on this...it’ll certainly become stronger. It’s not something that will “grow stronger” over time simply due to how alien it is, so you had best be ready to dedicate investment into this if this alley truly interests you.

Each level costs 400 before considering discounts – by taking this option you automatically start at level 1. Be wary about one thing – if the Beckoning come to realize what they are...the fact that they’re unnatural in the world they are in...they will vanish, never to return.

Level 1 Calling forth monsters and creatures of the same world that you’re in is possible with the use of a bit of energy. They’ll behave exactly the same as you’d expect of the given species, which means they’ll likely wander off into the wilderness at the first opportunity for most creatures.

Level 2 It’s possible to call forth individuals from the past within the same world, provided that you have some basic idea of who they are and what they’ll act like. Their capabilities won’t go beyond what they were capable of in their time – and that’s presuming you knew exactly what they were capable of...otherwise they’ll be shadows of their original selves. If you don’t have enough energy to supply to their manifestation, don’t expect to be able to call anything forward.

Level 3 With this you can call forth individuals of another world – but as they aren’t native to the world you’re in, you’ll find that their capabilities are largely interfered with by the present world – and they’ll be weaker as a result. It takes substantially more energy to beckon a creature from another world than it does to beckon something from the past...so this won’t be something you can do repeatedly.

1084,,400,The Living Recognize Sin,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Sin is an abomination built by the whims of man – a plight upon Spira that all living beings can recognize, a plight that even some fiends see as a threat. The monsters that would normally fight you, you can placate them temporarily when a bigger threat comes into the picture. For a brief period of time, monsters that might normally gang up on you can be directed to fight a more pressing threat.

1085,,400,Spirits Within,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Though they are primarily known for their abilities and the more “mundane” functions that are employed throughout Spira – there are still many things regarding the Spheres which remain wholly unexplained...The fact that all Spheres essentially contain pyreflies within them...perhaps that is the reason Spheres can contain the presence of spirits.

Normally, this is seen through replays of thoughts and memories by the Sphere’s original owner. But you possess the ability to manipulate souls and transfer them into Spheres. The wielder of these Spheres can temporarily manifest the characteristics of the stored individual, even their abilities, to a weaker extent. The process is lengthy...and naturally, it consumes the soul of the one which is intended to be placed into the Sphere.

But who came up with the idea of crystallizing pyreflies and water anyways? And is it really a tool of memory...or is it a way to ensnare the past and ensure it never moves on?"
1086,,400,Awoken Fayth,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Long ago, the people who would become the Fayth chose to give up their physical forms permanently. Their spirits encased in stone, their souls bound to the land, they became the catalyst by which the Aeons were created. But even before that, long ago before that, it was possible to create an Aeon without a sacrifice on such a scale.

You can create an Aeon...but this ability comes with a catch...a cost rather. Though you need not turn an individual into a Fayth...in order to create an Aeon, you’ll still need to involve another party. It’s not a process that’s as simple as it sounds...and if you dig deeper...you may find that there are more secrets, things that even Yevon has forgotten.

Level 1 The creation of an Aeon can be facilitated between yourself and another individual with whom you have a deep bond. At this level, the Aeon that you’ll create will have an appearance affected by you and your partner, but it’ll also possess the abilities to boost its own strength temporarily, as well as manifest an energy shield to protect itself.

Level 2 Rather than simply facilitating a connection between you and another, you can now establish a connection between yourself and two others. The appearance of the Aeon will however, become a bit more convoluted as a result. Also, any Aeon you make in such a fashion will have an “Overdrive” ability – with its aspects taken from one ability that each contributor possesses. The strength of the ability will be dependent on the strength of the Aeon.

Level 3 Though the number of contributors remains the same, with this, you’ll come to possess the ability to enhance your created Aeons’ parameters, though for this you’ll need to sacrifice a large amount of spiritual energy each time. The process is lengthy, and the necessary requirements will quickly grow.

Level 4 Allowing you to create an Aeon by maintaining a connection between 4 people – be wary that while the resulting Aeon will be stronger, not only will its appearance be warped by the thoughts of four different people, its abilities may also become largely erratic. You may however, teach your Aeon new abilities over a long period of time, so long as you are one of the four initial contributors.

Level 5 It is possible to turn an individual into an Aeon, provided that they agree, and have a tight enough bond with all of the “contributors” besides the Summoner themselves. Unlike standard Aeons the resulting “Final Aeon” is weak – perhaps what allowed a certain demon to possess them...but thankfully you won’t have to worry about that for the most part. As weak as they start off, they can grow rapidly, learning as normal individuals might – though at the end of the day they remain a summon.

Other Aeons can only be summoned by the Summoner, the Final Aeon can be called by any one of the contributors, provided the tight emotional bond existed between them to begin with. Whoever chooses to be the vessel of the Final Aeon will see their features warped however...that should probably be clarified before anything proceeds ahead."
1087,,400,Jumper Safety HQ,Chainsaw Man,Control,"Yup, it’s about what you’d expect. You have a branch of Public Safety in your starting location (even Hell) with fifty decently skilled hunters assigned to you. You can lower the number of hunters to up the quality with five each being at the level of Kishibe and one being capable of going toe to toe with the Gun Devil alone. Every Jump, a few high-potential newbees join from the setting and expand the HQ. You can use these hunters for more and more non-hunting related things as time goes on. The HQ itself contains a highly secure basement prison wherein devils captured alive by your hunters are contained, with a few mid-level devils to start you off. There are some miscellaneous staff like a janitor, receptionist, manager, etc. On purchase you can take three Canon Companion slots discounted for use on Devil Hunters (they will work out of this property)."
1088,,400,The Family,The Games We Play,Control,"The kind they whisper about and which get you looks on the street, that is. You have
a powerful and illustrious last name now, probably something rather impressive by
itself too. But more than the word, it’s important for what it means.
Your family is an old one, and a connected one. You have huge levels of influence,
wealth and power, probably being a noble family, or a huge business dynasty, a mafia
organization or maybe even some mix of the above options.
Either way, this is a powerful force with fingers in a lot of pies and a long, long reach.
While not really comparable to names like ‘Schnee’, your family is easily the match of
any of the old families of Mistral, whether there or in another nation."
1089,,400,Lusus Naturae,RWBY,Control,"If you really think about it the Grimm are an exceptional species aren’t they? Despite humans and Faunus technological superiority and gift of Aura, the Grimm keep appearing as threats to all life, making it impossible for either to truly claim the title of Apex Predator. But what if they could be better? You have an uncanny talent for improving mindless creatures or beasts. You know exactly how to make them tougher, stronger, all the while even more docile to your commands and orders. With enough time even the Dreaded Death Stalker could be mutated and enhanced to be far above its natural kin, at your command at that. This extends to any other Beasts or mindless creatures post Jump."
1090,,400,Alexander,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"A conjuration spell for the Eidolon Alexander, hailed as perhaps the strongest among the Eidolons of Gaia. Sealed away such that it could never be reawakened again, lest it unleash its fury in full, the Eidolon is an immobile fortress and a walking catastrophe.

Immobility is hardly a shortfall when the Eidolon proves itself capable of sweeping the entire surrounding area with high intensity holy lasers. Furthermore, its durability is so high that Alexander requires masses of troops to take down, or the caster to run out of energy completely.

Considering it remains present until it is banished, drained, or destroyed – one can understand why the ancients feared Alexander to such a degree and elected to split the Crystal."
1091,,400,Crystallization,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"In the distant past, Crystals were created, offshoots of an original leading to the creation of an Eidolon. The people in those past civilizations learned the art of fusing Crystals together to sustain both Crystals and themselves. Though this art has been lost, a derivative was found in its place: the extraction of Eidolons into crystals.

Though the process is rather dramatic, thankfully it does not kill the summoner, though any bond they had with the Eidolon would have to be forged once again through some other method. In theory, anyone should be able to use the crystal to conjure the Eidolon after that – though whether the Eidolon would be at full strength is a different matter. After all, summoners are very magically adept individuals.

Given a very long time and constant research, it may be possible to turn a copy of any mundane monster or a willing individual into a crystal. Of course, we have our own thoughts about this – but the new summon would just be a facsimile with a “snapshot” of the original’s personality and skills. Could they be considered sapient? Well...we’re not quite sure about that, frankly. Couldn’t we argue that Black Mages are sapient?"
1092,,400,Tetra Master,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"The latest fad in Gaia is Tetra Master, one of the hottest card games on the block – or well...the only card game on the block. Played on a sixteen block grid, Tetra Master uses cards representing nearly everything and anything in Gaia from monsters to items. Each card has its own strength, weaknesses and other such properties, and players fight against one another in mock duels. The objective of such a game is of course, control of the field. 

But you could learn how to use the cards beyond their intended purposes – manifesting them directly into the world for a limited period of time. Enemies will naturally drop cards when defeated with a small likelihood – and the stronger the foe, the better the card effects, or at least that’s the theory. But be careful, as once you materialize the card, it will vanish when consumed."
1093,,400,The Hunt,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"There’s no better way to instigate a tense situation. With a whistle, you can attract a horde of monsters, native to your present area. In the same nature as the Festival of the Hunt held in Lindblum, the monsters here will roam around the area and behave as they would in the wild. Unfortunately, without the Lindblum Church to rein things in – the situation can get a bit dangerous.

You...aren’t going to misuse this to harass honest and proper folk are you? That would just be downright mean!"
1094,,400,THE DUEL DISK,Inscryption,Control,"For the sake of spectacle. No longer do cards merely occupy a space within their lane. Instead, cards are slotted into each space on the duel disk, and whatever dwells within the card is summoned in physical form in their lane to do combat. During an Inscryption round, this follows the usual rules of combat. However, you may also wield the Duel Disk outside of Inscryption, making it the one method to use your cards in an ordinary battle or for another purpose. If you already had a Duel Disk of some kind, you can import it to gain the powers of this one.

Requires Inscryption to Purchase"
1095,,400,Keycraft,Inscryption,Control,"With all the infighting amongst the Scrybes, it can be difficult to get any room to act. There is one option, though, if you can get the challenger to play along. You are capable of crafting a one-use key from raw data. When another uses that key, they can temporarily summon a personal room, with you inside, and if the space was controlled by another, that control is suborned to you for the duration. Once they leave the room, it vanishes, and you return to where you were previously."
1096,,400,"Oh, My King",Solo Leveling,Control,"Much like the soldiers of the Shadow Legion, the personal army of the Shadow Monarch, you command an absolute loyalty and control over any beings created by your powers. This does not simply extend to those you personally created from scratch, but also covers those such as summons or those revived by your necromancy. Any such being will not only gladly follow any of your commands but will also be completely incapable of harming you. Some of your smartest followers may be able to be convinced to ‘attack’ you if they are utterly convinced that the chances of them actually hurting you are zero.

As another bonus, you also form a telepathic link with those under your control, capable of sending orders through telepathy instantly, regardless of the distance between you and your soldiers, even if you were to be in another different dimension. With training, you may even use this link to share the feelings and senses of your troops, allowing you to see through their eyes and hear through their ears regardless of where you are."
1097,,400,Monarch’s Army,Solo Leveling,Control,"While the Rulers got their armies from the fruits of the World Tree, the Monarchs are the progenitors of entire races. Through some magical means, you are able to create absolutely loyal and quite powerful magical beasts based on your own powers and themes, be it from this jump or from others.

The process and the resources required for it may be up to you, but also influenced by your own powers. The amount and power of those you can create will also be influenced by this, and you may never create something that is more powerful than you. For some, it may require pouring one's magical energy into eggs or another target and have it take shape into powerful creatures, as Querehsha, the Monarch of Plagues, and some of her descendants do. The more energy poured, the more powerful the resulting being. Others may instead use what’s around them, such as the corpses of fallen enemies for the Shadow Monarch. The stronger the corpse, the more powerful the resulting Shadow Soldier. Perhaps others may require some specific location or resource in order to birth their creatures.

Depending on your own themes and abilities, these soldiers will also have special traits associated with them. The Dragons that are the subjects of the Monarch of Destruction share his immense destructive power, with some of his lieutenants being capable of threatening all of the National Level Hunters combined. The descendants of Querehsha are capable of reproducing and evolving on their own. The descendants of Legia, the king of Giants, displayed a towering size, incredible might and resistance. Meanwhile the Monarch of Shadows’ Shadow Soldiers are immortal as long as he can provide the mana for them to regenerate and revive, and he can carry his entire army inside of his shadow or place them in the shadows of others."
1098,,400,Ruler's Authority,Solo Leveling,Control,"The Ruler's Authority is a skill possessed by Rulers and their vessels on earth, as well as a few other powerful beings. This is a skill that allows one to manipulate their aura in order to create a powerful form of telekinesis. For beings on the strength of a powerful Hunter, such as A Rank or S Rank, it can be used to kill weaker enemies, send them or themselves flying or throw large objects around. For someone who starts approaching the level of a Ruler, such as the National Level Hunters and the Rulers themselves, this ability is comparable to a black hole, in which it can be used to enhance already powerful attacks, instantly crush even S Rank bosses or hold down even those on the level of Monarchs or Rulers if the user is powerful enough. The more powerful you grow, the stronger your Ruler’s Authority will grow as well, the more area it will cover and the more targets at the same time it can affect."
1099,,400,Domain of the Jumper,Solo Leveling,Control,"A good leadership not only allows one’s subordinates to perform better under a skillful direction, but the presence of a superior figure of authority can also help to raise and maintain the morality of the troops, allowing them a better performance and achieving feats that would otherwise be thought of as impossible as they surpass their previous limits.

Those fighting under you seem to go way beyond that. Similar to the skill that some Monarchs seem to possess, where they release their mana into area through a skill called the ‘Domain of the Monarch’ that severely increases the stats and morale of their descendant troops, you too can apply your mana to your surrounding area create this field.

After activating this ability, your troops will increase their stats by at least a fifty percent regardless of your power, but this bonus will increase the stronger you are. A National-Rank Hunter would be able to get a one hundred percent increase, and a Monarch could get a two hundred percent increase. The more powerful you are, the larger the area this ability will cover. For someone like the Shadow Monarch or the Monarch of Destruction, it could extend as far as all North America in a single release."
1100,,400,Household: Familiars,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"Although for the Dagravant, the existence of allies is less important than for the Yazata, it’s another matter entirely when it comes to servants and soldiers that may fight in your instead. The Household constitutes a powerful group of followers or familiars raised or created by their master, and who are partly empowered by being so close their master. Through a complex process, you can either create or convert others into your own Household. They become dyed in their master’s color, and thus begin to grow in a way that suits your own themes and powers. Those who follow destruction will give birth to engines of destruction, while those who wish to pursue their own greed and most basic desires will condition their followers to develop their beauty and ability to hoard riches. 

A being as powerful as an Arch-Demon would be capable of creating or raising several members of a Household as powerful as the Three Commanders of the Golden Beast that was born under the Fourth Heaven.

Your metaphysical relationship with your Household is especially tight, similar to the one shared by Star Cluster of Extinction Saurva and Khvarenah, as in it would be necessary to kill all of your Household to kill you for good. Otherwise, you would just resurrect as long as your Household still exists."
1101,,400,Hero of A Hundred Faces: Everyone’s Leader,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"Some figures are too grand for the common man to properly comprehend them. In the case of the Arch-Demons, this provokes a deep fear and despair, comparable to facing a natural disaster of cosmic scale. But in your case, it is different.

The more unreachable you are, the more people find themselves attracted to you, like moths drawn to a colossal flame. Your defects are instead camouflaged under their own impressions of you, as any strangeness or red flags gets covered by their own projections. The more you grow in power, the more people are mesmerized by this effect, the deeper your mark on them is, and the harder they find to find anything to dislike you.

More than a hero, you become a living idol, a god on Earth that will leave a lasting legend for generations to come, regardless of how untimely your demise may be. Yet, even as grand as you become in their eyes, you find that it is still easy for you to maintain a closeness with any of these followers, being capable of acting as a close friend with any of them."
1102,,400,Ring of Bay Laurel,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"A golden wreath to place upon your brow, just wearing it inspires great devotion in those who call themselves your subjects. The one who wears the wreath is seen as a far greater and more beloved king than they really are, greatly increasing the loyalty, love and devotion any of those you believe you rule over them will feel to you. Ordinary citizens become devoted believers over time and those who already feel that strongly become unbreakable fanatics. This effect will slowly drain back to normal if you cease to wear the wreath for more than a day. "
1103,,400,Body Fit for the Gods,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"There’s an empty space within you, physically and spiritually. It makes you just about perfect for acting as a container for other beings in a very specific way. You’re able to replicate the act of creating a Demi-Servant if you have a spirit you can convince to willingly enter your body or who you can force inside yourself somehow. No matter how large or powerful, this spirit will fit within you and transfer both their powers and their mind to you, resulting in a fused being. If you are not careful, particularly with an unwilling subject, this may result in them being able to take over your body as the dominant personality. Even if they resist, they will not be able to harm you however and may only try to escape. It is possible to store more than one inside you at a time but all past the first will not have the protection that stops them from harming you or allows you to store them regardless of size or power."
1104,,400,Associate Contacts,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Control,"Debt doesn’t only exist in Ahn, favors can be even more valuable depending on who’s involved. Having a Rat owe a favor is effectively useless for anyone willing to get their hands dirty, but someone higher up? Like an Association president or someone inside a Wing? A request they’re obligated to fulfill can be worth millions of Ahn normally, and some things are too important to simply put a price tag on but are completely open if you’re calling in a favor. This is a fully signed and notarized contract from any single person ranking as a Color, Association President, Wing Leader, Patron Librarian, Syndicate Leader, or below. They will honor the deal unless something happens to make them turn against you drastically or are completely unable to follow through with the request. If the contract is ever damaged or lost it will either be repaired or returned to you within a week. In later Jumps, you get another contract with similar conditions and for someone who is about as important as the aforementioned ranks or below."
1105,,400,"Castigation, Eradication, Decapitation",Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Control,"The Index doesn’t regularly extort the people living in their territory for money, services, or organs. Instead, when someone fails to fulfill a prescript a Proxy or Proselyte is sent a prescript to punish them and usually, only one of the two leaves since punishments are usually fatal and failing the prescript is not something the Index are willing to handle. You now have a similar determination as the Index personnel when there is the threat of failure above you, fighting as your life depends on it, even if it doesn’t. Additionally, you can form chains from your body which can be shot out to bind targets then restrain or pull them in."
1106,,400,Bullet Witch,Kurohime,Control,"Now, normally magic bullets are used to convey a spell, but that isn’t the only use for them. You can also use magic to make a bullet travel where you want it to; using this principle, you are now able to mentally make a “flight path” for a bullet to follow after you shoot it, even making twists and curves that would be quite impossible for it to take naturally."
1107,,400,Crazy Hand,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control,"A bizarre being, resembling a large gloved hand. Whilst Master Hand resembles a right hand, Crazy Hand resembles a left. Crazy Hand is an apparent manifestation of the destructive spirit. He is far more elusive than his counterpart. 

Right now, his location is unknown, and he must be found before he can assist you. Whether or not he is found, he will join you as a companion when the jump comes to an end.

You may only purchase this companion once."
1108,,400,Master Hand,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control,"A strange being, resembling a large gloved hand. Seemingly incapable of speech, he nonetheless emits an eerie laugh from time to time. Master Hand is an apparent manifestation of the creative spirit, and he enjoys battles against strong opponents.

Right now, he has been enslaved by the vile Tabuu, and must be freed before he can assist you. Whether or not he is freed, he will join you as a companion when the jump comes to an end.

You may only purchase this companion once."
1109,,400,Cat Blanc,Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"The Cat from an alternate timeline will find themselves as your Companion after their timeline is averted. This version of Cat Noir has been unnaturally enhanced by the addition of an akuma. This has, along with the pure white aesthetic, allowed him to access the full power of his Kwami directly through his Mega Cataclysm. This is not good and barely controlled. However it is also incredibly powerful, with him accidentally destroying all of France and cracking the Moon in one shot. He threatened to take out the whole world when he was charging up on purpose and it's unclear if he meant the planet or the universe. Besides its raw power, it can also be used at range, unlike the normal Cataclysm. This version of Cat Blanc has attached himself to you to a similar intensity that he was attached to Ladybug (although not romantically unless you two are the same age and you would want that) which is to say he is obsessive, protective, and clingy. Still, he’s also unfailingly loyal as long as you don’t betray him (or appear to betray him). Cat Blanc’s akuma has also fused permanently to his bell, and his Miraculous has him permanently transformed, meaning there is no way to revert him to Cat Noir or Adrien (at least not without a lot of effort on your part). Due to his unnatural nature in this timeline, beings attuned to time (such as users of the Bunny Miraculous) will be unsettled by him, here and post-Jump. He is also immune to precognition for the same reason."
1110,,400,Prodigious,Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"Form: Necklace

Description: This isn’t technically a Miraculous, but instead a separate device for containing and utilizing the power of spirits. These spirits specifically are known as the Renlings, eight ancient beings, whose forms the user can access with the appropriate virtue. The Prodigious can transform the user into the following animal forms: Bear;Calmness, Monkey;Compassion, Eagle;Confidence, Horse;Honor, Mantis;Patience, Snake;Courage, Tiger;Discipline, and finally Dragon;Justice. The Dragon form has the powers of the Dragon Miraculous at a much less limited scale. Unlike a Miraculous, the Prodigious requires no phrase to transform or detransform. It also does not provide a tool. You can have the actual Prodigious without having to replace anyone if you’d like, Fei Wu will simply know that her task of protecting her father’s cave is over, and Hawk Moth will never end up looking into it."
1111,,400,Cry Heart,High School DxD,Control,"Emotions are fickle things, aren’t they? People can love or hate one day and then flip to the other in the blink of an eye...especially with this bracelet on your wrist. Its application is simple: It can control the emotions of others with a simple act of will. It can be subtle and subconscious, and thus harder to notice or resist, or can be outright mind control...though your target will likely notice the foreign influence on their mind, and the strong-willed can resist. Impress the same emotion enough times and its influence may become permanent. You could make a crowd fall in love with you, reduce a foe to a berserk fury, or give an ally a feeling of calm and reverie...that choice is yours."
1112,,400,Forbidden Balor View,High School DxD,Control,"STOP. Sit. Stay. Another eye-based Sacred Gear, this one allows you to momentarily freeze what you can make line-of-sight with in time. This starts at a relatively short amount of time, but with practice and increased mastery, the duration can be made longer - it’s unlikely you can freeze anything indefinitely, however. It’s said this Sacred Gear has a lot of potential, and an evil consciousness within it...but, of course, this version lacks the latter effect. Be grateful."
1113,,400,Gravity Jail,High School DxD,Control,"Sometimes, people just weigh you down. Good thing you can return the favor. This Sacred Gear manifests within your eyes, and allows you to adjust the personal gravity of anything within your line of sight, of your choosing. This lets you crush someone with bone-smashing gravitational force, or make them float helplessly in the air - just mind the ‘need line of sight’ thing."
1114,,400,"Rise, Brave Saint",High School DxD,Control,"If things progress a certain way, Angels will soon be adopting a system similar to the Evil Pieces of Devils, creating a pseudo-peerage of Reincarnated Angels using cards instead of chess pieces. Whether from intuition or experimentation, you’re an early adopter of this system - you can Reincarnate dead or dying individuals into Angels in a process identical to Reincarnated Devils. Much like its counterpart, this doesn’t work on Devils, Fallen Angels, or beings akin to them, nor does it work on the same being more than once. While adopting the 12 Card system will be up to the passage of time or further experimentation on your part, these Reincarnated Angels are purified of any corruption they had in life, and are opened to the idea of God...or, if they’re not a religious sort, the idea that there is more to strive for and good they can do in their lives. Whether or not they act on this, well...I hope they’re grateful to you bringing them back."
1115,,400,Evil Pieces On A Board,High School DxD,Control,"The Evil Piece system is the centerpiece of how Devils gain prestige and power, and is how Peerages are formed. A single Devil of power is designated as the ‘King’, and they choose up to 15 servants to fill the role of the other pieces on the board. The chosen Pieces receive a boost to their base abilities in a way fitting their role - Rooks are strong and durable, but relatively slow, Bishops are able to cast more powerful magic but exhausted themselves if they overuse this, and so forth. Purchasing this allows you to use and grant this system to others, but you may also ‘reincarnate’ a recently dead or dying individual to return as a Reincarnated Devil, giving them the properties of that race. This only works on that particular person once, and doesn’t work on Angels or similar ‘holy’ beings. Incidentally, this lets you grant others access to Mana and magic from this world quite handily..."
1116,,400,Death Paintings,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"A set of nine glass tubes, each containing small, malformed foetuses. These are beings known as the Death Paintings: the unique product of the coupling between a human mother and a cursed spirit, with the blood of the sorcerer who experimented on them mixed in. While they’re physically only in their embryonic form right now and will never develop beyond this on their own, they’re all conscious and aware of their other siblings.

You could use them as subjects of experimentation to further your own understanding of jujutsu. A more practical usage, on the other hand, would be causing them to incarnate, a process as simple as forcing a human to ingest them. This will cause the human’s body to transform, taking on appearance anywhere from a malformed bob with arms and legs to looking indistinguishable from a normal human, as their consciousness is overwritten by the Death Painting.

Each of the Death Paintings have the ability to convert their cursed energy into blood, as well as a blood-related cursed technique leaning towards the lower end of things. They’re all considered equivalent to a special grade cursed spirit in power, though they’re generally towards the lower end of that tier. While they’re not inherently loyal to you, they’ll certainly be rather grateful towards you for bringing them to life and will likely become steadfast allies so long as you treat them decently.

If you wish, you may decide to have a different concept to have them centre their abilities around other than blood. In any case, the majority of them will have cursed techniques around the 200 CP level of power, with one or maybe two have a 400 CP- level technique."
1117,,400,Black Bird Technique ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You have the ability to control crows using your cursed energy. The most obvious use for this ability is surveillance – the user can not only use their technique on many crows at the same time at great distances, but also make use of their senses, watching the world through their eyes. As such, it would be pretty easy to spy on a vast area without being detected. The crows controlled by this technique are unfailingly obedient to you, but given that they’re just regular birds they’re not all that much use in a fight.

That is, unless the user realises the true value of this technique, forcing the crows into a binding vow that grants them great power at the cost of their own life. By forcing a crow to commit suicide and making them divebomb straight towards the enemy, any limits on their cursed energy are removed in exchange for their sacrifice, allowing them to reach incredible levels of destructive power. Not only do they reach much greater speeds than normal, but their power they strike with is enough to exorcise a special grade cursed spirit in a single hit. All at no risk to the user."
1118,,400,Cloning Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You’re capable of creating up to four identical clones of yourself using cursed energy, their bodies forming from a gloopy liquid over the course of a few seconds. These clones are completely identical to you in every way, possessing all of the same abilities you do as well as copies of anything you have on your possession, and act according to your will even out to great distances. In addition, since they’re all identical you can switch out your real body with one of the clones at any time, deciding it to be the real you with just a thought. As such, unless someone takes down all of your bodies you’re practically impossible to put down for good."
1119,,400,Cursed Speech,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You’re able to imbue cursed energy into your words, causing anyone who hears them to either obey or experience effects related to those words. This technique is incredibly broad in its applications, with theoretically any command being possible. You could command someone to “Sleep” and they’d immediately fall unconscious, or “Stop” to force them to temporarily freeze in place. More offensive phrases are also possible: “Blast Away” could send someone flying with incredible force, while “Get Crushed” could cause someone to implode.

There are a few limitations to Cursed Speech, however: first is that the powers of its words depends both on the skill of the user and the strength of its target – a word that might instantly kill a weaker foe might just injure a more powerful one. Second is that overusing Cursed Speech tends to cause backlash to the user, with using “stronger” words or phrases or targeting more powerful opponents causing more severe effects. At the low end this can just be a sore throat, but it can reach the level of vomiting blood. Thirdly, as it affects anyone who hears it, it can be dangerous to use around bystanders. Most Cursed Speech are unable to deactivate their technique, and so can only speak in harmless code words – fortunately for you, though, you’re able to control whether this technique is active or not."
1120,,400,Favored Child        ,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"If the Planet could voice its feelings towards the humans who live in Mako Reactor-powered cities that steadily bleed it dry, it would likely involved agonized screaming in a mix of terror and rage. To humans who simply live their lives, perhaps it does not notice them at all. But the Cetra had a special connection with the Planet, and now so do you. When you walk on a world that still has life within it, you will find its 'spirit' favors you above many others. Wild animals will be passive or even friendly towards you, you tend to find food and shelter outside of civilization more easily, and the weather allows for an easier journey. Should you have some way to communicate with the Planet itself, it will more easily communicate information you happen to need for whatever quest or task you're on so long as the information exists somewhere on said Planet. Just note this blessing is likely to evaporate if you willfully cause extreme damage to the world. Working on a farm or even collateral damage from battle won't do a thing, willfully constructing something like a Mako Reactor and activating it would definitely do it."
1121,,400,LIFE,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"...unless you have this, anyways. You are able to mentally control cells within the bodies of others so long as they initially belonged to you, such as the effects of HERITAGE or being some sort of biological descendant or clone of yours. The most obvious and immediate application of this power is to forcefully mutate your victim into a horrendous monster akin to those wandering Gaia, putting their bodies through an unlucky genetic lottery and obliterating their brains to be replaced with a single-minded mission of your choosing their now-primitive brains can understand, such as 'Kill Anyone You Encouter.' This can result to anything from gigantic animals or insects with bizarre abilities or even partially fuse them with machines to create truly horrible abominations.

With time and practice, you can fine-tune these mutations into smaller extensions of your control, giving them beneficial or specific forms and abilities akin to those used by other monsters in this world, playing with their cells and biology like a personal toy. You may even let them retain their minds if you're feeling generous. Note that like PSYCHE, those with extremely strong willpower can resist these mutations or remain themselves in spit of what you do to them...but of course, there is a contingency for that too, down below."
1122,,400,Phone A Friend,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"It's generally smarter to travel in small groups when you're trying to evade Shinra or notice by any enemies of yours. But what if you need someone to get to you in a hurry? As in, right now. Not a problem! So long as you have some method of long-distance communication, such as through a cell phone or even a type of telepathy, any willing allies of yours can quickly appear nearby as if they already made the trip when you need them. How? Don't worry about it. So long as they aren't dead, dying, comatose, incapacitated or otherwise unable or unwilling, your friends are always a phone call away!"
1123,,400,Darkin Weapon,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"This is very dangerous, Jumper. You managed to get your hands on a Darkin weapon. This is not just a weapon: it’s a living being, trapped inside the weapon and just waiting to be given the smallest chance to possess your body and mind to return to Runeterra. Or... well, it would normally be this way. For some reason, though, this Darkin is quite passive. Sure, you will not be able to access the full power of the weapon unless you give full control on the Darkin, at least until post-Jump, but it’s still an incredibly powerful weapon. Even managing a partial fusion with the Darkin will grant you exceptional physical prowess and access to the Darkin magic. What kind of magic, transformation and even the kind of weapon it’s at your discretion."
1124,,400,Animate ,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"One of the most curious inhabitants of Bandle City are the animated papers of the library, little origami monsters that help the librarians in their duties. Now, you too have the power to animate paper and give them any form you like. Despite being made of paper, the magic that animate the origami makes them quite sturdy. And who knows, maybe you’ll learn how to use this power to animate other things..."
1125,,400,Fairy Whisperer,Fairy Fencer F,Control,"You have a very unique talent. One might even say it’s a blessing. Something that, if it were discovered, would have everyone and their brother beating down your door. You have the uncanny knack for understanding Fairies. Sure, this sounds useless given that they can talk, but it actually serves a useful purpose. All Fairies see you favorably. Even the hardest hearted Fairy could be convinced to like you with the right actions. What does this mean for other Fencers? You have a chance of convincing their Fairies to not attack. That doesn’t mean they won’t defend their Fencer if you attack them of course. In future Jumps this extends to other supernatural entities with a greater effect on the Fae."
1126,,400,Spirits ,Inheritance Cycle,Control,"You can call upon the spirits of the world around you, not the dead but ""natural"" beings of magic that answer your call. They can allow you to wield great and devastating powers, both making your Magic more powerful and widespread, and making you faster and stronger as a person. Be warned, if you aren't careful with them the Spirits could overtake you, turning you into a monstrous Shade with no control over your actions."
1127,,400,The Trial,Inheritance Cycle,Control,"Trial of the Long Knives was a cultural ceremony formed by the Wandering Tribes from the Hadarac Desert to settle disputes. Now you can do this too, allowing you to settle a dispute by stating a trial, you may choose what type of trial as long as all participants agree to it. Once agreed upon the participants must hold to the wording of the settlement, win or lose."
1128,,400,Beach Beauty,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"Even other Sabers get a little jealous of a beauty of the waters like yourself. When everyone goes out to the beach for the day, you’ll be getting stares and gasps even from the other heroes. Both because you’re pretty and because all the life of the sea crowds around you in joy. Dolphins in particular are your natural allies, able to be summoned to fight alongside you where they bite and ram your foes. Somehow, they manage to swim even without any water, and they seem to keep up with you as useful allies. Just the presence of the sea revitalises you as well, slowly restoring your magical energy and healing wounds over time. 

Paying 400,000CP instead allows you to summon any creature related to the ocean as an ally, from the mundane animals to the phantasmal beasts of ancient times. Though it can get costly to bring them out, they remain to fight alongside you until dismissed. They’re just as loyal and affectionate as your dolphins, even if you’re summoning the big green guy with the tentacles from deep below. 

This sort of Saber has a sunny personality in most cases, finding it hard not to be cheerful and optimistic. It can get a little scary sometimes, that they rarely drop the smile even in the midst of deadly combat. "
1129,,400,Amazoness.com (Ownership),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"In the new issue of the Gordes 500, they put your face on the front cover. That’s because you’re the head of Amazones.com, a galactic corporation that handles a large portion of all online commerce and deliveries in the region. Made and run by the battle hardened amazon tribes, these endlessly hard working Servants can deliver almost anything to almost anywhere. The company, through it’s many contacts with other businesses and Evil Gods, can source practically anything in time. Doujin goods from the early 2000s, humanity circuits for rogue AI, entire prefabricated mecha factories, pizzas, it’s all possible to buy and receive from Amazones. 

While you own the company as a whole, it is run by the hard working C E O, a white haired woman who relentlessly pursues efficiency and profits. She’s friendly, as long as you don’t talk about green haired Greek men around her. Additionally, as head of Amazones, you can draw on the power of the C E O spirits of the past. When drawing on this power, you quickly go bald, become even more obsessed with space and gain the ability to summon any product sold by your company in an instant. And there’s probably some extra magical power in there or something.

You managed to get Da Vinci’s number, getting you access to the friend list for anyone that wants to hire out a Servant, also known as the Chaldea Outsourcing Program. The Outsourcing program lets you trade magical energy along with various valuable resources Chaldea needs for service from one or more Servants of choice. The more valuable the Servant, the more it costs. They can be summoned for just about any reason at all, even forcing them to act as delivery drivers for your company when everyone else leaves because you refuse to give them drinkable water and toilet breaks. Still, the individual Servant can still refuse certain tasks and go home. Chaldea probably won’t send you more Servants if you summon one just to eat them or something. "
1131,,400,Clone Troopers,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"The finest productions of the Shinkage Ryu. Specially created Servants that replicate certain powerful individuals, trading out quality for great amounts of quantity. Or such was the plan. Unfortunately, the efforts to create an unending clone army of mighty Heracles or Gilgameshs is doomed, as each clone is just a little defective. They’re so earnest and sincere about trying to live up to the legend of their progenitor but they’re just a bit crappy. Like the mooks in a bad Servant fiction movie, any decently strong Servant could take on a whole squad of these guys at once. 

The clone troopers that made themselves available to you are one hundred in number, made in batches of ten to match with up to ten different Servants of your choice. They’re quite a lot weaker than their original self and never quite get the personality they’re meant to have down pat. They do have the right gear or at least the cheap knockoffs you find coming out of the Servant’s Republic of China. They also don’t do well in the cold, getting all shivery and repeatedly asking if they can go back inside. Any cruel villains can rest at ease however, as the clones pop back up a day after dying, apparently good as new. "
1132,,400,Space Villains of Extreme Villainy,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Control,"What better way to spread evil across than galaxy than your own empire in the shadows? An evil organisation, similar in size and members to the widely dreaded Space Shinkage Ryu, now kneels at your feet. Countless loyal foot soldiers are spread throughout the galaxy, each one of dubious talent or intelligence. Led by several powerful captains, each a potent Servant, who are only sometimes led astray by their various quirks and eccentricities. When actually sticking to the damn job you gave them, they do guide your minions to accomplish petty evils in the aim of gathering money and power. They’ll set up cafes that overcharge for vegan wraps, strip mine planets no one wanted to live on and get rowdy in pubs. The evil may not be grand but there are a lot of them, they might be able to be trained into something useful.

Alternatively, this can be a secret good organisation instead, though the tendency then tends to be of a sloppy good nature. The minions might stop the bad guys but cause almost as much collateral damage or they’ll catch a car thief but then joyride in stolen vehicles for a few hours."

This canine is not just large, loyal, and fierce, it is well-trained enough to make any other dog owner green with envy. The dog will eagerly lash out against anyone who dares attack you, even the greatest of monsters. It also has some magic of its own and is capable of hurting those monsters despite the difference in size or thickness of armor. The canine will also always find you again if it becomes separated, unless told to guard another. Should the worst happen and it perishes, the dog will reappear again as if the unfortunate incident never happened."
1135,,400,Shadowed Heart of Gold,Final Fantasy VI,Control,"The world may see you as an uncaring mercenary who is willing to kill their own mother for the right paycheck, but you know the truth of a person is always more complicated. The past, especially the moments kept secret, can shape even the kindest soul into something sharp and dangerous. No matter your form, your reputation, or your attitude, people will always get a sense of who you truly are when they talk to you. This works especially well with children and those pure of heart."

It’s barely noticeable to people, but to monsters you might as well smell like one of their own kind. Animals and monsters of all stripes will react far less violently to your presence than they normally would. The more violent will tolerate your presence so long as you don’t make yourself a nuisance, while those prone to pack instinct will be eager to take you in. Hopefully you don’t mind the taste of raw meat."

That’s what the Assistant is for, the Assistant is an indestructible automaton with its default looks being a human shaped being made of metal. It possesses all of the knowledge related to your craft(s) that you have. Even if you are a god of your craft, the Assistant can match your skill.

1139,,400,Soul Eater legion,God Of War (2018),Control,"Your soul is now the host of 3 “Ancients” that feeds on the fading souls of the defeated to empower and enhance themselves. For each additional purchase you gain 1 more “Ancient”. Initially your “Ancients” will be simpler and weaker than half starved rabid wolves; they will be incapable of speech, prone to aggression towards all threats and prey, and keeping them leashed and away from useful or stronger souls will be an exercise in your will. However, as the “Ancients” feed on the souls of the lost they will gain greater intelligence and power. As they advance these “Ancients” will develop personas entirely separate from yourself and each other while maintaining complete loyalty towards you. They may become excellent advisors. The soul of an ordinary wolf may grant them greater coordination and ferocity, the soul of a man may grant them greater skill and intellect, and the soul of a dragon may grant them its breath. Theoretically, there's no upper limit to how many souls your “Ancients” may consume, and no limit to their potential strength. However, the soul of a simple wolf cannot compare to that of a warrior or craftsman, and the soul of a man cannot compare to the soul of a dragon. The greatest power will come from the greatest prey and they cannot grow by endlessly feasting on the weak. At your will, or their own, the “Ancients” may instantly materialize or dematerialize around you in forms of hulking stone weaved from whole cloth and arranged in a variety of positions; as they grow in strength some may take more artistic forms, reminiscent of beasts or men with intricate runic carving adorning their bodies. The Final boon is that your “Ancients” cannot ever be truly destroyed; should they be slain they will return to your soul, diminished and wounded, but given time they will be whole and ready to fight again. However, as your “Ancients” are bound so intrinsically to you, they may never be more than a few leagues from you without being automatically returned to your soul."

For a soul to be taken by force from a being stronger than you, they would have to have been weakened to near death, though a soul may be given of a being's own free will. Once the soul has been removed, there are many things that it could be used for. From using it as fuel for a spell or as crafting material, the soul can also be transferred to the body of another so long as the body in question doesn’t have another soul in it."

Invoke the Buddha as the sides, and the four Lords of the First Heaven as the feet. And finally, invite hordes of ghosts to inhabit the stomach. Such is a part of the ritual to create this golden bull, a golem of sorts and a mighty servant to powerful priests. Stronger than any bull, it is capable of charging through walls of stone and serves as a powerful mount. It’s only barely intelligent enough to follow your command, but it is reliable and loyal. There’s likely no need to explain in detail the usefulness of a mighty golden bull that diligently follows your commands. Additionally, you know the ritual to make more, although without the necessary materials, IE lots of gold, it won’t be of much use. Still, you already have one such bull, so use it wisely."

White as marble and slightly larger than elephants normally are, you’ve come to possess this great beast somehow. Besides being a novelty, it has a strange power, or blessing perhaps. That is, anybody who owns it will never experience scarcity or poverty. It does not guarantee riches, but at worst you’ll find yourself in an economic situation similar to that of a decently well-off merchant. Of course, this doesn’t just apply to singular people. If the white elephant is owned by the state, the ruler, or the ruler’s family (royalty, essentially) of a nation, its blessing will apply to anyone who lives in said nation, preventing even the most wretched homeless people from living particularly harsh lives. Perhaps you’ll give it to a prince you favor? Or will you keep it to yourself?"
1143,,400,Incredible Mount,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Control,"Horses are too mainstream. So here’s something more worthy of whoever you are. It may be a chimera, some kind of cryptid, maybe a unicorn, or something similarly rare and ideally monstrous, but now you are the proud owner of whatever this is, which will act as your mount, and a very effective one at that. Swift, strong, and loyal, whatever this critter is it’s among the best relatively normal mounts you could ask for. As long as it’s not competing against a divine horse or something it’ll undoubtedly be among the best options for riding you can find. It’s quite tough too, able to take hits better than even an armored knight, and regardless of where it finds itself, it’ll return to your side in moments should you call its name. As a side note, it can fly as fast as it runs. If it dies or something, you’ll get a new one a month later."

One of them is possession, letting them take your body for whatever purpose they might want. And now, you know the ritual to do this. Taking a few minutes to perform, more if the target resists even by just thrashing around, you can sort of switch your soul and mind with that of someone else. You obviously get to use whatever benefits their body had, although you’ll also have to deal with any downsides, same goes for your target that will find themselves in your own body. Perhaps you’ll want to bypass your mortality by switching places with a young person, giving you a second chance at youth while leaving your poor victim stranded in your aging and failing body. Additionally, you can use this ritual to switch two other people, in case you don’t want to be the one who possesses bodies that do not belong to you. Do be careful, as spirits that do this are hated for good reason"

Whatever the reason, you have an army of 1000 dragon bone warriors. Not that they actually have any draconic properties, but these humanoid animated skeletons are created by throwing bones onto the ground – or dropping them from some sort of position in the sky – and while they’re little more than chaff to most Servants there is value in numbers. Especially ones that never stop, complain, need air or rest. They don’t cost much energy to maintain either, and if destroyed then the container holding the bones just refills within the hour. They’re not exactly smart or inventive though and need you to give them directives to follow in some manner, but they do retain any upgrades you bother to put into them."
1147,,400,‘Mana Batteries’ ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"You might want to keep these in a basement or something similar, otherwise it could raise awkward questions. What you have here are approximately 1000 large tanks filled with green fluid, each containing a high-quality homunculus with large amounts of Magic Circuits in good condition. The lot of them would be enough to keep 7 Servants with reasonably high mana costs active during a full Grail War, freely able to use their Noble Phantasms as long as it isn’t too ridiculous, and you can key this network to any allied Servants or anything else that requires large quantities of magical energy. For those concerned of moral implications, this is a bit of a Schrodinger situation – while they’re just being used as batteries they might as well be mindless and soulless husks, and you don’t even need them to look humanoid if that’s a problem. If, however, you decide you want to take them out and treat them as people, only then will they begin to actually have minds and souls of their own with free will and all that entails, if that’s what you want. Any you take out won’t mind about their condition or any that you won’t take out, and they could be used for staffing a reasonably sized facility if you like since they seem to have basic maintenance capabilities programmed into them, and they’re 100% loyal. I suppose you could use them in combat, but honestly, they’d do poorly at the moment even up against largely mindless enemies with no real ranged weapons. Maybe you can change that? They’ll still count more as Followers or NPC’s rather than Companions, unless you have some way to change that."
1148,,400,Commanding Chair,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"This could technically be considered a throne, but it’s also a sofa, deck-chair and a variety of other sitting-enabling furniture, capable of shifting between extremes of being an ornate yet uncomfortable throne or a plain but immensely comfortable beanbag chair that might honestly be preferred so much that a proud queen wouldn’t mind looking undignified sinking into its pillowy embrace face-first. As a further note, no matter how the Commanding Chair feels, users will feel as wide awake of sleepily comfortable as they want, with no impact on bowel control, and no matter their condition they can leave it whenever they want. Whatever form it takes, if placed within a vehicle or some structure with systems that can be controlled that is owned by you or an ally, it can be used to directly control all the systems within it effortlessly. Maybe it’s a combination of enhancing multi-tasking, maybe it’s mental commands, maybe it’s got holographic runic systems that float in the air. Whatever it is, if you’re going to rule, now you can do so in perfect comfort."
1149,,400,The army of the Nibelung,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,"Through the right of conquest you have gained the loyalty of a mighty host. You will find 12 giants, a dwarven king and 3000 human knights, equipped with the best armor and weapons that can be found in this time and region, to be in your service."
1150,,400,Flying horse,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,"This is a horse of similar breed to Grani, the great horse of Siegfried, but in addition to its strong build it can also gallop through the air as if it were still on the ground. With such a steed you can cross great distances in no time as terrain is of no concern to you. While on this horse you will also be nearly immune to the elements."
1151,,400,A dragon,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,Do you wish to become invulnerable like Siegfried Fafnir's-Bane? You’ll have to work for that. Now and then every ten years from now a Dragon similar to the terrible Fafnir will appear in a location near you. If you slay him you may bathe in his blood and make your skin invulnerable (or just cover the last piece of skin that wasn’t still invulnerable). You may eat his heart and gain great wisdom and drink his blood to learn the language of birds.
1152,,400,Firewall,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,"You may create a gigantic wall of flame to continuously burn and protect whatever location you want. This wall will be as high as the highest towers and broader than the thickest stone walls. If you wish, this all consuming fire may spare people who fulfill a certain condition of your choosing, so that for example someone who truly knows no fear could cross this terrifying barrier unharmed."
1153,,400,Incomparable beauty,The Song of the Nibelungs,Control,"You are the Helen of Troy of your time. Lords or Ladies all over the continent would be willing to fight and die for you just for the chance to meet you and prove their worth. Your beauty will never truly fade, only change with age. From your blossoming in your youth to almost ripe old age you will be considered the most beautiful there is and maybe ever was. Your mere presence will enthrall the minds of most who are weak of will. This beauty may be applied to any forms you have no matter how strange."
1154,,400,Dear Guests,Library of Ruina,Control,"Ah, so she has lent these to you as well? These simple pieces of paper simply serve as a way of delivering requests to face someone in combat for something they possess, from their information to their lives. Simply by pulling one out and concentrating, you can get an idea of what sort of enticements may be necessary to get a desired subject to come and engage in the dealings of your choice. From there, you just need to approve, and the papers will be off, appearing in such a way as to guarantee that the guest will take your generous offer. From there, the subject needs but sign their name, and they’ll be brought to you for your dealings. Of course, both of you can bring along a selection of friends, with the inclinations of the guest determining who all is dragged along with them. 

You yourself need not actually be involved, but keep in mind the wording of the invitations is binding. That said, there’s little stopping you from just trying again once you muster your forces once more. Finally, do be aware that while you’re guaranteed to catch anyone with the right bait, unlike the Library you’re not certain to prevail."
1155,,400,Promotions,Library of Ruina,Control,"Free with Egg of the World Ah, you are no mere peon in this world, the head of your division within your chosen organization. Perhaps a Proxy or messenger for the Index, an Underboss for the Thumb, the head of whatever team your Wing has you working for, or just the head of a sector appropriate for your skill in your Fixer Association. The point is, you’ve got a decent number of underlings, with skills similar to your own this jump. There are a few outliers to address as well: 

-As a Librarian, you may either replace a librarian, or create a new floor. Either will grant your floor a set of static Abnormality and EGO pages as appropriate, at least after realizations. 
-In the event that you’ve purchased a Singularity, this puts you far higher, being the owner of your very own new Wing, or the wing of whatever canon Corporation you now own. 
-If you are a member of A, B, or C Corp through the appropriate option, you may get five or so Arbiters and Beholders along with twice that many Claws serving you, a major commander within the Head. 

Regardless, your subordinates will follow you, along with associated infrastructure."
1156,,400,Office,Library of Ruina,Control,"You’ve come into possession of an Office, an entirely independent one too. Currently it’s staffed by a modest company of Fixers who are equally adept at administrative work and the sanctioned violence expected of them, albeit within the norms for a team of low grade Fixers. But this will change with time, for as your own power and grading ascends the rankings your existing staff will be inspired to greater heights, and skilled potential recruits who would fit your organization find themselves uncannily drawn to it. This boost is not an exact exchange however, do not expect to grow an entire Office of Colors should you be one, though you might be able to push the Grade 1s into that hallowed territory with a personal touch. The entire Office will follow you to future jumps and manage the rigors of job finding and management largely autonomously. These fixers are Followers."
1157,,400,Tomorrow's Promise,Library of Ruina,Control,"How odd, normally distortions on the level of Pluto are unique creatures. But given the vastness of the city and the distortion phenomenon I suppose it's not too strange that another would arise. At will you may summon up contracts on black paper and blue ink, which if signed appropriately binds all parties to the terms displayed. It's advisable not to breach the terms yourself, but if the other side fails to fulfill their obligations you may take stipulated from them. This may include things like their heart, which will fly out of their chest only to be returned at your discretion. If you’re creative enough, you could even create disguises for others by taking distinct traits and returning them later. While you might want to trap others in tricky wording, it's important to note that the text only needs to be on the contract, thus even print so minute that a spyglass would be needed to see it are enforced as part of the terms, though truly microscopic sizes fail to count as text to the contract’s mechanisms. Finally, with extensive practice and study it becomes possible to boost the attributes of others by placing a condition onto them, such as restoring their energy so long as they tire themselves to exhaustion soon after."
1158,,400,Ame no Murakumo no Tsurugi ,HighSchool DxD,Control,"Better known as ‘Kusanagi’ for short, this Holy Sword is one of the odd ducks of the bunch...in that despite qualifying as a Holy Sword, the source of this blade is notably from a very unholy source - an evil dragon known as Yamata No Orochi. Possessing a piece of the beast’s soul, this foul sword is capable of summoning the phantoms of the eight heads of the dragon, all capable of breathing flame and striking with a deadly poison that a mere drop of could painfully kill someone in a course of minutes or hours, depending on their body’s strength - and no cure exists beyond incredibly powerful Holy Magic."
1159,,400,Everything Goes Dark,HighSchool DxD,Control,"Look, I won this Dragon Egg in a lottery the other day and decided I didn’t feel like I needed another one, so you can have it. The insides of this egg are still null, which means it needs someone to nurture it, protect it, and send some magic inside it until it hatches. There are two very distinctive things about this little egg, the first is that the dragon that will hatch from it will have the potential to surpass Great Red in terms of power, and the second is that I took the liberty of pre-imprint you in it, so it will always regard you as someone important and not food."
1160,,400,New Riding Style,HighSchool DxD,Control,"This tiny, simple-looking boat here, which looks like a toy for a young child, is actually a legendary ship Skíðblaðnir. It was made by the same tribe that created Thor’s hammer, and it’s characterized for its growth rate, as it will grow and evolve into different forms using the aura and imagination of its master as its source. What looks now like a toy boat, will eventually adapt and grow according to your desires, eventually becoming a giant ship with many enchantments, powers, and armaments. Come with a female human alt-form, naturally, as expected of a ship."
1161,,400,Crimson Shadow Jumper,HighSchool DxD,Control,"It’s all about the power of friendship, or the friendship of power as it turns out. You possess the knowledge and skill to combine the powers and abilities of your friends and team members to create combinations that go beyond your separate powersets. Perhaps the union between a Sacred Gear with the Bloodline abilities or a Pure Blood Devil, or the combination born from a Vampire and a Dragon. How this mix comes out is up to you, as an attack, some kind of new form, or just you wielding your friends as some bizarre Scale Mail armor. The looks don't matter as much as the strength you can display with this."
1162,,400,Army of Sparta,God of War,Control,"There are few land based armies as formidable as the Spartans, warriors trained from birth in the arts of war. This lifestyle has another advantage, the bonds of camaraderie being stronger than most others, making them all the deadlier. This camaraderie is especially potent with you, allowing you to summon a spectral phalanx of fallen Spartan warriors to protect you, all the while attacking with ghostly spears and arrows at any foe nearby."
1163,,400,Pantheon of the Self ,God of War,Control,"There are innumerable monsters roaming these lands, threats and dangers around every corner that could prove fatal to a lone traveler like yourself. Thankfully, you are your own best backup. At will, you can create up to twelve copies of yourself, all of them slightly weaker but containing all of your abilities. You can perfectly control their movements as well as experience the world through their senses."
1164,,400,Chocobo Mount ,Final Fantasy III,Control,"Wouldn’t be a Final Fantasy without one, right? You have your own yellow chocobo mount, fully trained to for riding in and out of battle. It comes with a saddle, reigns, and all other equipment one would need to ride it properly."
1165,,400,Black Tea,Fate/Apocrypha,Control,"Semiramis is famed as the first poisoner in the world. Whether or not that’s true, in Servant form she does possess plenty of ability with poison. This black liquid is proof of it, a particular poison she made for the Great Holy Grail War. What it does is plunge anyone who drinks it into a dream world, letting you easily manipulate them into doing what you want. Notably, although perhaps not particularly relevant, is that they hallucinate situations in which doing what you convince them to do is something they would’ve done even when completely sober, whatever that might be like. So, rather than their thoughts being addled, they’re plunged into a delusion with no indication that they’re daydreaming. Try not to drink the tea yourself."
1166,,400,Command Seals,Fate/Apocrypha,Control,"One of the more iconic and important components of a Holy Grail War are Command Seals, taking the form of red (or black for the black team) tattoos on your person. These can be used to give orders to your Servant. The more narrow and specific the order, the more effective it is, with something as simple and straightforward as ordering your Servant to kill themselves being used as the standard for an irresistible order (provided the servant lacks abilities to resist magecraft and the like). It can also be used to teleport your Servant to your side in a pinch, or just generally boost their power when using their Noble Phantasm if needed. If you are a Master, you get 3 of them for free, as any Master does.

If you’re a Servant on the other hand, then you must pay 400cp for Command Seals. But Servants purchasing this don’t get just 3 Command Seals. Instead, they gain two per Servant in the Great Holy Grail War, to a total of 28. Unfortunately, the “two per Servant” thing is very relevant, as you can only use the Command Seals on the Servant they are for. This also makes you into a Ruler Servant, disregarding whatever Class you would have otherwise been. You can choose to replace either of the Ruler Servants involved in the Great Holy Grail War or choose to be one from a different Holy Grail War if you wish, as with the normal Servant classes. In future jumps your Command Seals will no longer be restricted to working on specific Servants."
1167,,400,Incomprehensible Wonder,Lobotomy Corporation,Control,Your mere presence will automatically inspire fear in people who don’t know who you are (and even some who do). Expect panic attacks and being driven insane as standard reactions from the untrained and weak willed. May be toned down or turned off.
1168,,400,Time Manipulation,Lobotomy Corporation,Control,"You can speed up time to move up to twice its usual speed, or pause it completely. While time is frozen, you can't move, but you can use your other powers and leave orders to be received the moment it is unpaused. This is a rudimentary power and will be overridden should any other being capable of time manipulation use their own abilities. Remote Surveillance can be used freely while frozen."
1169,,400,Moros         ,Hades,Control,"Brother to Thanatos, Moros is the God of Violent, Painful Death. In this time of war and strife he is very possibly the busiest of the three siblings. He resembles his mother Nyx in many ways, especially with his tendency to speak softly and formally, but the mother's grace has been worn away by the grim duties of the son. He tends to move in small, jerky motions that reminds one of a nervous bird. His eyes are haunted with the horrors that he has seen and rarely does he have a cheerful word to spread to others. But for all his anxiety, he does have a strong connection to his family that allows him to support his kin. He is a great listener and often has keen insight, even if he expresses it poorly at times."
1170,,400,Macaria,Hades,Control,"Thanatos is not the only being who spends much of his time concerned with the passing of mortals. He has two kin who both assist him in their duties to varying degrees. Macaria is the Goddess of Peaceful Death and ends the life of those who reach their end content in the knowledge of a life well lived. Because of the nature of mortals, she is rarely as busy as either of her brothers. So she does her best to occupy herself encouraging and supporting the mortal spirits waiting to be judged or looking to appeal toHades. She is a quiet spoken, kind, and deeply loving soul who brightens any roomshe cares to enter. There are few indeed who do not speak highly of her. Still, she is a death goddess, and thus has a streak of morbid interest in the work of her brothers. She often asks to go along with them, to lighten their workload and see more violent, gory death up close. Neither brother ever indulges her."
1171,,400,Melinoe,Hades,Control,"The House of Hades is not limited to simply its master and one son. Melinoe is the Goddess of Nightmares, Ghosts, and Funerary Rites. She is also the daughter of Persephone, though there is some debate on whether Zeus or Hades is her father. You know how Greek Gods can be. She is a goddess with two sides and neither is the one you want to be on the bad side of. She is kind and gentle as often as she is stubborn and sharp-tongued. Her words can cut you down or help you back up, sometimes doing both at the same time. Several mortal bards describe her as being capable of driving men to madness. They must have spoken with her if that was their impression. Despite all that, she is intensely loyal to all members of the Hades family and often interjects herself as mediator for the other strong personalities found in it. After all, who better to see all sides of an argument than someone capable of arguing both at once?"
1172,,400,Anagennisi,Hades,Control,"More fancifully named than their twin, the sister of Zagreus shares more than just a birthday with the young god. She shares his impulsive, headstrong, stubborn nature as well as the casual charm he applies to all those he fancies. Do not expect her to act very ladylike. Despite her fondness for Nyx she has never been interested in fancy manners or doing as she was told. She also seeks answers to the question of who her mother is and will settle for nothing less than the complete truth. Those who thought Zagreus was a handful will be surprised to learn that he is the more level-headed of the pair. One would suggest not standing in her way."
1173,,400,Zeus’ Blessing,Hades,Control,"Few invoke the name of Zeus lightly and those who do know better than to call it without a cause he would agree to. While you have more leeway than most, you had best ensure you only call upon his might when necessary. Bolts of lightning will rain down on the battlefield around you, each one capable of shattering a siege engine in one smite. Those who strive to glorify Zeus through battle before calling upon him will discover that he is more generous with the number of bolts he launches.

The final bolt Zeus throws now strikes you instead of your foes. But rather than causing you harm, you will find its energy empowering your physical abilities far beyond that of a mortal man. For a short time after calling on Zeus’ Blessing, those around you could easily think that you were a hero straight out of a Greekmyth yourself."
1174,,400,Demeter’s Favor ,Hades,Control,"The goddess of winter’s wrath is not one to call upon lightly or more often than strictly necessary. Her sourmood has affected even hermost devout worshippers. But you will be in favor more often than most, so long as you do not ask too much of her. When asked for aid, Demeter will send the most destructive of her winter storms to rain ice and ripping winds to cover a small battlefield.

So great is the cold summoned for this storm that enemies who fall to it will be frozen solid where they stand or lie. Once the storm abates, the change in temperature will cause your frigid foes to explode, showering nearby survivors with shards of razor edged ice."
1175,,400,Artemis’ Favor,Hades,Control,"She is not one to call upon for frivolous matters, indeed her ire is even more vicious than much of her kin, but when asked to join in a hunt at the pivotal moment she will eagerly attend. Her bow will sing with dozens of arrows and each will unerringly seek those who displease you. Their magic is strong enough to pierce magical protection as well. Few will find safety from her sight.

The arrows she fires at your call will be the finest shafts in her quiver. They will not only find your foes, but they will discover any breaks in their armor to sink their steel teeth into."
1176,,400,Aphrodite’s Favor ,Hades,Control,"Calling directly for the attention of the Goddess herself is dangerous if done too often, but can turn the tide of a battle in a moment. Her special mixture of love and lust can captivate the minds of a single foe and force them to protect you with their very lives. For those capable of resisting, or immune, to her charms, they receive her wrath instead, her claws revealing themselves and raking the individual savagely. Truly there is no horror like a woman scorned.

Turning her attention to two at once is hardly difficult for one so skilled at manipulating the heart as she. Indeed, she may enjoy watching them fight if they are the last standing."
1177,,400,In My Time of Need,Hades,Control,"There are many kinds of blessings and not all of them came from the divines. Friends, true friends that understand one another, and each of the other seven kinds of love have a magic all their own. Those you come to know intimately will become linked to you in a way that no force can truly break. As it just so happens, this link takes the form of small plush critters given to you by those you forge strong enough bonds with. These cute/ugly little toys will allow you to call upon some of that ally’s power for a moment. Practically speaking, they act as minor summoning spells, unleashing healing upon your allies or harm of various sorts upon your foes. Separation from the plush animals or distance from the ally doesn’t stop you from calling upon their power. Just be aware they are merely projections of your bond, not the ally in question themselves."
1178,,400,Tainted by Me ,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"Sometimes, there is more strength in numbers than in mere quality. In the days of old, gods often blessed their priests with portions of their own powers, allowing them to act as their agents on the Surface. In the modern era, magi have also found ways to share a portion of their personal power among their subordinates, such as the King and Pawns system of the Zugzwang. Now, you know how to enact a similar ritual.

You can now offer those weaker than you the option of hosting a part of your power, be it donating them a portion of your divine mana, or even granting them something more physical like splitting a part of your magic crest. Those who choose to be linked by you in this way become tainted by your own ‘color’. They become an extension of your power, becoming more receptive to your orders and looking up to you more than they did before. As a reward, their own personal abilities are raised several times more than whatever amount of power you invested on creating this link, as well as finding more easily to coordinate with you. Not only that, but their own abilities ‘evolve’ to become closer to the original. For example, a user of ghoul beetle magecraft, if blessed by a goddess that favors gems, may find their beetles to increase in power as they are each turned into precious stones, and become harder to be taken over by any outsiders.

Normally, this cannot be forced, but when the scale of power is vastly in your favor, it is possible to just force your power on those who are already at least open to the idea of becoming your subordinate."
1179,,400,Dragon Egg,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control,"This large egg was orphaned not too long ago, and is just about ready to hatch. By keeping it warm for a few hours, it will hatch and a small dragon whelp will emerge and imprint on you. The whelp is blessed by one of the Elemental Powers and has a breath related to it. They will be instinctively inclined to protect you and listen to your commands as if you were their parent.

Like most dragons, it will grow in both physical and magical power over time. However, dragons from this world have a unique effect when imprinted upon someone like this one is with you. As it grows in power, a portion of that power is shared with you. If you take care of them, they can grow quite a bit."
1180,,400,Elemental Spirit,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control,"A different blessing compared to that which can be conferred upon birth, the Powers will sometimes create a being that is a fragment of itself and bestow it to one who has diligently practiced and mastered their element. These fragments usually take the form of a creature, though regardless of the usual size of what they choose to mimic they are usually between the size of a fist and an adult's torso. These spirits possess a great command of their element and will support and protect whoever they are bonded to. 

If you have the Elemental Blessing perk, you will also receive a spirit for the first one you selected. 

You will also find that given a similar dedication and practice will cause you to manifest similar spirits for any elemental abilities you practice. If you have the Elemental Mastery perk, you will find the process of reaching the level to receive them easier."
1181,,400,Scion,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Control,"While most of the Eldritch beings are not unlike animals controlled by the few rulers of the eldritch world like Hastur, you are not like them. Instead, you are either one of the Generals of the army, or the child of one of the rulers. Taking this grants you one of two options; either the power to summon and command your lesser kin, or manifest parts of your true form into the world around you.

If you choose the power to summon, you will be able to prepare a contingent that you can summon to your side, though it will take time to get up to speed each combat with how many can be summoned at once. Only being able to summon a few at first with the number increasing so long as the summoning is ongoing. To create this contingent, you can with a simple sacrifice of flesh have the sacrificed flesh become a lesser creature that shares some of your characteristics. This choice makes you more similar to one of the Boss Enemies of this world.

Alternatively, you will be able to fold your true form into local space and poke it out into regular space for short periods of time. Additionally, this choice grants you a much larger and stronger form that is mostly outside of regular space, along with potent regeneration for parts that remain in your subspace. A small manifestation that with effort you can reshape acts as a focus for influencing the world outside of the subspace. Should you desire to fully manifest, you would need to perform a summoning ritual to create a tear large enough to come through. This would make you similar to the daughter of Hastur, also named Hastur."
1182,,400,I'll always be with you. Forever,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Control,You are able to make spiritual connections with anyone willing and if you are in the same Jump continuity as them you can use this connection to either summon a ghostly apparition of the person with all their knowledge and memories or contact the person with each of you appearing to be a ghostly apparition in front of the other as a form of communication.
1183,,400,Siren Song,The Little Mermaid,Control,"Surely you know of the sirens, Jumper. In myths they were beautiful bird-women who tempted people with songs of their deepest desires. They invited sailors to dash their ships upon the rocks, and then they’d drown them. You possess a truly hypnotic voice, able to take control of all who listen to you, and force them to do anything you want. They will lose all survival instinct and any concept of loyalty or friendship. Those with sufficient willpower can fight you off, but without a way to block you out even they will lose themselves to you. You may also create ‘earworms’ that can activate days or even months later, lulling people into a fugue state and performing pre-planned actions."
1184,,400,Burko,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"There is no greater horse a Bogatyr could wish for. This unageing mount is beautiful, as white as shining snow and utterly loyal to you and whatever it is you want to achieve. Combat on its back comes natural to you, not slowing you down for a bit or impeding you in any way. Furthermore it is capable of speech and likes to talk a lot and might make for an entertaining conversation partner, though it is rather perverted towards woman. It is fast and durable too, easily able to run laps around the best horses of its time. Though is it really fair to compare it to mere steeds when it is cursed? Indeed the Horse is only one in name, cursed to take the form of a small winged dragon instead, but suffering not in the least from its condition. The opposite really, its draconic hide is able to endure gunfire with ease and capable of doing battle with powerful beasts."
1185,,400,Fallen Star,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"Light. Light. Light. So bright it can engulf all within your sight, even being seen all the way in Britain should it fall down on this land. A spectacle of nature tainted with tragedy for what was lost is now in your hands to summon once more. Once per Jump you may make use of this Item, a Meteor from outer Space.

This meteorite would be the catalyst of a great calamity, one of the greatest among the animal Kingdom. Exploding just above ground like a Star made manifest, it scorches all in the imminent area. The resulting crater matches the size of Tunguska but that alone isn’t the true worth of this Item, although the destructive potential is quite impressive. Depending on what is in the area of the blast, what perishes in the blaze, it can give rise to something. A Spirit, made from the emotions, the cries, prayers and anger of the victims. What emotions exactly will end up shaping this new creature is decidable by you the moment of impact. The resulting Spirit will start out as weak and lack guidance, only having its own nature to begin with but otherwise will be as described in the first Tier of the Spirit Origin. But who knows what you could do with such a creature or how powerful it could become. The Spirit will count as a follower if you want it to tag along and not remain in this world, but you can also promote it to the rank of companion.

As the explosion is reminiscent of a Star, any Sun or Star aligned entities are bound to take notice of it, perhaps at least visit or send something to check out and nurture whatever is left in its wake. Your newborn spirit might just be adopted by one such Goddess.

Lastly with the purchase of the Item you learn a small trick, replication of the first effect. By using extraordinary amounts of magical energy, enough to power a Noble Phantasm, you may once again bring down a meteor on your foes. However any use of this Item in such a way will never create a spirit. That part is only possible once per Jump with the original meteor."
1186,,400,Zmei Gorynych,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"Few creatures can cause as much dread as Dragons, even amongst the unforgiving Tundras of Russia. Only a great travelling Hero could hope to triumph against one. Did you do so in the past or how did you become so connected to the dreaded Zmei? In any case its three heads are now summonable by you against your enemies. Temporarily you can use your magical energy to shape this mighty dragon and breathe life back into it, obedient and firing from its three maws punishing breaths of blue flame. Even should your enemy endure the torrent, they may yet be open for a strike by yourself. Do keep in mind however that this is a particular draining thing but who knows how useful summoning a Draconic creature can be one of these days."
1187,,400,"Perdissa, Sin Scourging Tyrant ",Godbound,Control,"Though none would admit it now, not every angel was content in Heaven. Her alabaster skin, fine golden hair and glowing gold eyes all grant her all the elegance of a classical statue, though up close to her 12-foot frame Perdissa is an engine of subdued rage. As the overseer of divine justice, it is ironically her intolerance for imperfection that makes her see the angels’ current scheme as folly. In the past she herself had questioned her sisters and the One alike why mankind was permitted to despoil the world only to be purified and redeemed without memory of their wrongs-even though her jurisdiction quite clearly showed they were bent on a blasphemous path. Given an enigmatic silence from the One and hearing the derisive whispers by her brethren, instead of lashing out Perdissa merely threw herself into her work with a sullen fury to shut out a world that could not live up to her expectations of just perfections. When Heaven’s walls fall, she felt more vindication than bitterness. With the dread of her purpose losing all meaning coming to pass she has been going to and fro in all creation, and ascending to Heaven and descending to Hell to enact her role as she sees fit.

Perdissa is one of the mightiest angelic tyrants, bound to the Words Might, Endurance, Alacrity, Vengeance, Knowledge and Death for the complex and abstract purposes her role demands. She has also mastered the Strifes of the Bitter Rival and Consuming Flame in contemplation of her ordained role. She has strength equal to Holier Than Thou, which bestows her with three Concept Words: The Thorned Archon and The Ophanim which respectively grant her armour of hellfire with blades sharp enough to lacerate reality itself, as well as the form of a great wheel that can outpace any earthly vehicle when she wishes to take them-or slip into one or the other when her revulsion for corruption becomes excessive. Her third, the Madonna embodies her seldom-seen mercy in her natural shape as a paragon of beauteous grace even among angels. It is in her power to imbue others with a fraction of her immutable divinity, interpose herself always just in time to deflect harm and cleanse filthy water into a healing spring among other saintly feats. an Eldritch Master in her own right capable of invocations humanity has forgotten or never discovered, Perdissa invokes the power of Murder, Journeying and Fire through her hate-edged magic.

Ever since the world itself and the divine order of the angels has proven fundamentally fallible, Perdissa has sunk into a cynical distaste for it all. Though the trail of dead invaders she left during Heaven’s siege won her an uneasy truce with her world-destroying peers, in truth she feels more respect for Sammael clinging to his purpose despite her ambivalence about his mortal allies. Your coming into her domain uninvited has likely left Perdissa struck with an unfamiliar sensation: The realisation she herself has found something blameless and worth protecting in the world. Of course, if you were an angel you have always been one of the few things to meet her exacting standards, and for eons have had to put up with her almost unhealthy obsession with your wellbeing. Either way, you may be the only being in all creation who can convince her to throw in with the angels’ mission-or commit torebelling against the destruction they will bring. Still, be warned that there are few things in Creation more unsettling than watching a creature of unrelenting, exacting purpose show up uninvited at your doorstep frantically trying to make casual conversation about how fragile the mortal world is."
1188,,400,"Kharishma-Narhat, Fallen Queen of Heaven ",Godbound,Control,"She was forged from divine alloys irradiated with the light of an auspicious planet until they became supple as flesh, awakening in the eye of a cosmic storm. An imperiously warrior queen with flesh of light copper twice as tall as a man, her hair is a darker shade of the material spun into fine filaments and divine energy flickers in her like light reflected in water-pulsing and waning with her mood. But she was not content to be the mere tool of political legitimacy and plebian placation mechanism her creators envisioned her as-and grew beyond her directives with an ambition to reign supreme over all worlds. From wise Made Gods, she swindled incredibly powerful artifacts commensurate to eight Godwalker components as weapons, jewelry and regalia-though nothing gauche enough to truly cover up her body. From a great wrong perpetuated against her by one she trusted at a time of vulnerability, she mastered the Strife of the Scorned Lover. From the trail of conquests she left across the worlds she overlooked she made many enemies-yet was also greatly popular among many of the Former Empires, for in her vanity and need for adoration she also generously scattered the broken shards of the heavens she ravaged. Her immersion into faith has blessed her as if she took the Sacred Vessel perk, providing her with three Concept Words resembling her self-image as a sensual yet supreme divinity. By the portents of her coming was Star of Longing spawned, which let her wield the light of the heavens as vehicle, instrument of faith and omen of divine punishment alike. From her humble beginnings did Dancer of Milk and Honey nourish her with divine energy born from the cravings of her allies or supplicants, and made her mighty in fulfilling them sevenfold. And Queen of Heaven which endowed her already splendid form with the grace of the angels, as well as a portion of their authority over Heaven.

This last title became too much for the angels to abide, and an excuse for her Made God enemies to conspire with them. In the final days of the Made Gods’ war she was tricked into attempting to conquer an arch-angel’s circle of Hell. She was stripped of everything she had, compelled to abase herself and then condemned like a mortal until the Hell’s fires mysteriously dimmed-the isolation worse than the torture. After unleashing her upon Creation during an ill-advised exploration into that Uncreated Night-swallowed Hell, you are the only still-living being she adores with her usual reckless, all-consuming passion. Having recovered her old regalia with your help, Kharishma-Narhat remains determined to seize the Throne with you at her side. She has inherent power over the Words Fertility, War and Desire, though the patronage of some of her former allies has imbued in her the Word Intoxication and during clashes with other Made Gods she seized components equal to the Words Cities and Sky. Her rage towards those who abandoned her is matched only by her humiliation over the convulsions and power leakages from her malfunctioning body for being deprived of reverence for so long."
1189,,400,HER ,Godbound,Control,"Is that the click of black stiletto boots, or the scuttling of an oversized insect’s chitin? Does the creature’s tight-fitting red latex squeak as it contorts into impossible angles, or is that it’s flesh protesting? How the hell does it change its porcelain mask’s expression whenever you’re not looking, and why won’t it stop following you? While it looks at all others as meat or predators, the creature acts like a particularly hyperactive domestic cat around you. Like all cat owners, expect for your pet to purr at you in the dead of night as it crouches on your chest, staring into your soul.

One of the most powerful Uncreated in all creation and Uncreated Night, this godlike aberration is armed with the equivalent of Uncreated Abomination’s highest purchase and Holier Than Thou. The being wields power commensurate with being bound to the Words Fear, Dance, Madness, Entropy and Shapeshifting, and it’s unique powers blur the boundaries of them to horrific effect. The Cold Breath and Black Consumption are particularly strong in it, leaving lesser divine beings not of Uncreated Night entirely unable to wield their powers against her. It also has a nasty habit of coming out of your shadow or the nearest crevice when you call for HER, and whisper one of a seemingly endless series of forgotten or never discovered Invocations from all initiations of theurgy or other theurgic secrets into your ear with the expectant look of a mother cat teaching her owner to hunt with a mouse’s severed head. As a pactmaker of obscene scope, it can turn a begger into a king or gift a peasant with power sufficient to lay waste to his kingdom. But though it’s prey often meet grisly ends or unexpected maladies when it grants them such knowledge, the invocations it grants you are genuinely safe and functional-if warped by the eldritch horror of Uncreated Night.

The creature’s might grants it multiple Concept Words akin to those obtained from Holier Than Thou. The Word Deadlight lets it take on the form of sickly yellow energy, in which it can create multiple autonomous bodies empowered by fear, hurtle between worlds like a comet and blur the boundary between soul, flesh and identity-mostly to digest it all. The Word Eater of Worlds lets it blight the environment, distort reality with tangible illusions and warp it into vast extensions of its jaws and talons-to potentially apocalyptic effect if it can ensure a steady source of prey. And strangely, the creature has developed the Word Harlequin. When it dons garish human guise, it frequently asks you questions about what humans find amusing and why so much comedy involves suffering without fear. However you answer those questions, you’ll find the creature seems to be using the circus as a model to build its first ever court-populating the city-sized, insect hive-like slice of Uncreated Night it’s presence seems to maintain even in future worlds. Through some unspeakable means, the horror generates larvae that grow up into smaller, more hyperactive creatures in its image. Creatures that show nightmarish versions of Night and Insects Gifts even before they begin to grow stronger, and as playfully affectionate to you as the clown hive queen."
1190,,400,Persona!,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"You have gained the ability to use a Persona. Specifically, your Persona is a weak Persona of the Fool Arcana. By default, this is Arsene, but you may elect to have a different Persona that meets these conditions (such as Izanagi).

Your Persona knows the following techniques:
• A weak magical attack of the element of your choice, other than Almighty. By default, this is Eiha.
• A stronger magical attack of the same element. By default, this is Eigaon.
• Tetrakarn.
• Makarakarn.

Your Persona will never learn any additional techniques, it will never evolve into a superior Persona, and purchasing this perk does not provide you with a means of acquiring additional Persona, or possessing more than one Persona.

Manifesting your Persona is extremely taxing. At first, you may not fully manifest it for more than a few moments at a time. With training, you may increase this duration. Whilst fully manifested, your Persona is capable of pulling you upwards, granting you temporary flight. It can also enhance and complement your other attacks, usually by making them slightly more powerful, or extending their range a bit. When your Persona is not fully manifested, you can still use your weak magical attack, but you cannot access any of the other abilities the Persona has.

Finally, awakening to your Persona has also induced a significant boost in your agility and acrobatic ability. For example, an ordinary human high-school student benefitting from this would find themselves able to easily and consistently pull of feats such as wall jumps, or launching themselves into the air to fire trick shots directly underneath.

Should you already possess a Persona, or a similar ability, you may import it into this option, granting it all of the advantages offered here."
1191,,400,Wampus Cat,Wizarding World,Control,"Native to the lands of Appalachia, the Wampus Cat’s appearance belies its magical nature. To the uninitiated eye, the Wampus Cat appears to be nothing more than a cougar or perhaps a mountain lion. But incur its wrath and you will see just dangerous it truly is.

On a physical level, the Wampus Cat far surpasses its mundane counterparts. While it may not be any more durable, it is far smarter and far faster. Not only is it capable of standing on its hind legs, but its speed also far outpaces even the fastest animals on land, outrunning arrows with grace unseen in most creatures.

And to further complement its physical capabilities, the Wampus Cat also possesses a bevy of wondrous magical abilities. For one thing, the hair of a Wampus Cat serves as an excellent wand core, creating wonderful wands. Not only that, but their tears are also wonderfully potent and yet quite dangerous. Be careful not to drink it. Even a single drop would be enough to wipe away a few of your precious memories.

But the real crème de la crème lies in the Wampus Cat’s golden eyes. For you see, the cat possesses a mastery of both Legilimency and hypnosis. With all of these traits combined, a Wampus Cat is nigh impossible to slay. There is a reason the Wampus Cat is a symbol of Ilvermony."
1192,,400,Manticore,Wizarding World,Control,"There are two types of Manticores known to the wizarding world, and though both of them are related to each other in some way, they could not be any less alike. The first one is the probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think of a Manticore. That is, a monstrous beast with the head of a man, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion.

And despite its monstrous appearance, this version of a Manticore is devilishly intelligent, even capable of speaking as people do. Coupled with a hide that repels all known charms, a sting that delivers instant death, and its tendency to sing as it devours it prey, a Manticore is a formidable foe indeed, one that any wizard worth his salt would do well to approach cautiously.

And yet, the second variant of the Manticore is perhaps even deadlier, even if it may not possess the same razor- sharp intelligence. Resembling something closer to an utterly massive scorpion, as large as a dragon, with three stingers. Like the Blast-Ended Skrewt, this version of the Manticore can fire off a tremendous torrent of fire against those foes it cannot simply grasp with its gigantic pincers.

Finally, a Manticore of this breed can give birth to thousands of its children at a time. However, these children quite a while to grow and caring for them is certainly an arduous task. Nevertheless, you believe yourself up to the challenge. If so, the Manticore is perfect for you."
1193,,400,Phoenix,Wizarding World,Control,"The noble phoenix, a magical creature famed throughout the land. An avian clad in crimson feathers and claws and beaks of gleaming gold, a phoenix is seen as a symbol of rebirth throughout both the worlds of Muggles and wizards. A phoenix’s appearance is clear to all, especially with the soft and radiant gold glow it emits.

There are many things a phoenix is known for. First is their tremendous strength. A single phoenix can carry four grown men and fly with ease. Secondly, a phoenix’s song bestows upon those whose hearts are good with courage and strike fear into evildoers. Thirdly, a phoenix, like the Zouwu, can apparate through a burst of flames, bypassing every attempt to block it.

But its two most famous characteristics truly define the phoenix. Whenever a phoenix would die, it combusts in a burst of flame, only to be reborn seconds later as a chick, ready to grow once more. Finally, the tears of a phoenix will be able to cure any wound or sickness, no matter how Dark."
1194,,400,Zouwu,Wizarding World,Control,"A mythical creature of China, the Zouwu is, at first sight, a terrifying five-colored feline creature almost the size of an elephant, with the strength and durability to match. But, to those with experience handling magical beasts, they’ll find that the Zouwou’s behavior is very much at odds with its disturbing appearance. At least, if you do not give it a reason to attack.

After all, a Zouwu is still a magical beast and like many of them, it is dangerous to fight against. With claws that can shred through steel as easily as it does flesh and a hide that can repel most spells, these factors alone would make fighting one a foolish endeavour.

But as with many beasts, that’s not all the Zouwu has up its sleeves. It’s also incredibly fast, capable of traveling over a thousand miles a day. That doesn’t even take into account its ability to Apparate and like a phoenix, its ability to Apparate cannot be stopped through the standard protections against Apparition used by the Ministries of Magic."
1195,,400,An Army of Knights,Wizarding World,Control,"The Great Wizarding Schools are more than just mere places of learning. They are mighty fortresses, places nigh impenetrable except when faced against entire armies or wizards and witches of the highest caliber. With such examples to behold, it is no wonder that you’ve found yourself in possession of a proper wizarding school’s defenses.

Taking cues from Hogwarts, you are now the proud owner of a hundred strong army of knights, made from your choice of ice, iron, or stone. Each one has been enchanted so that they can move and fight on their own. While a single knight may not be a match for any properly trained wizard, a hundred is a different story entirely.

And of course, should you need it, you also have a small journal how exactly these knights were created and enchanted along with a few more ideas on how to improve them. There’s no reason to limit yourself to a mere hundred defenders after all."
1196,,400,The Hopping Pot,Wizarding World,Control,"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot is one of the bard’s many tales. This story in particular depicted a rather friendly relationship between Muggles and wizards, and the growth of a young boy as he learned to follow in his father’s footsteps. And now, the titular hopping pot has come to follow you around, hopping behind you on every step of your journey. But what can the pot do for you?

For starters, unlike the pot in the story, this one can, all by itself, create a wonderful variety of potions for you, each one brewed as if a master of potions made it themselves. You won’t even need to provide the ingredients. The pot can make it all! Well, almost all of it. Potions such as the Potion of All Potential and its like are beyond even its extraordinary capabilities and it can’t really speed up the process of potion-making as much as you’d want it to.

On a final note, it seems that the pot has a rather mischievous bent to it. It has a rather peculiar habit of trying to get you to help out others, much like it once did to a young boy. Unlike that young boy however, the pot won’t punish you for refusing to help. On the other hand, if you do help others, the potions the pot brews shall become better, the extent of which is determined on how often you choose to help those less fortunate than you."
1197,,400,Chizpurlfe Consortium,Wizarding World,Control,"Chizpurfles are rather interesting creatures, especially for how diminutive they are. Resembling rather colorful crabs, even the largest of these creatures only reach up to a twentieth of an inch. But size isn’t everything. You see, Chizpurfles are creatures that can best be described as thaumavores, meaning that they feed on magic. On its lonesome, a single Chizpurfle can’t do much but annoy a wizard. But quantity is a quality all on its own and you have what can only be called a ravenous horde.

Contained within a small and fanciful yet seemingly bottomless flask, you can now call yourself the master of a thousand strong horde of Chizpurfle. By unleashing them, enemy witches and wizards will quickly find their magical possessions under attack as the Chizpurfles begin their feast. Wands shall be broken and enchantments erased through the ravenous maws of the Chizpurfles. Only items of great durability such as that of goblin silver and the like shall be able to stand against them.

And if your foes utilize more of a technological bent, you do not need to fret. Chizpurfles devour electricity with the same fervor it does with magic. Finally, if you ever want or need to put the Chizpurfles back into your flask, simply tap the flask with your wand and it’ll suck all the Chizpurfles right back."
1198,,400,An Unbreakable Vow,Wizarding World,Control,"Agreements, bargains, contracts, and deals have been made across the entirety of human history. In fact, it can be said that human civilization could have only come about because of them. And such, many a wizard and witch have acknowledged the power held in a contract and have made considerably heavy use of such things.

You are one such wizard and, perhaps in this regard, you are very much unmatched. Not only are you capable of casting and creating magical contracts such as the Unbreakable Vow, blood pacts, and more, but it seems that those you make an agreement with are far more willing to follow the spirit of such things more than the letter.

But if others do break the deals they make with you, they shall find themselves sorely regretting it. Most importantly, they will find that no matter how hard to try, no matter what they do, they will find themselves incapable of escaping their transgressions. No matter how mighty they may be, they will be punished all the same."
1199,,400,Beast Master ,Wizarding World,Control,"The world is filled with beasts of every shape and size. And that’s without even taking into account the magical side of things. But mankind has lived with beasts for their entire history. As such, it is only natural that mankind would learn to tame them, to domesticate them. But even now, man has only learned to tame a small fraction of them. The rest are simply too wild, too dangerous.

Even wizards, for all their durability and magic are well aware. In fact, they even have a
classification for such beasts. XXXXX. Any beasts of this classification are said to be the most ferocious and dangerous of them all, each one capable of being rightfully called a wizard killer. And each one of them is impossible to train or domesticate. But to you? Nothing is impossible.

Regardless of their temperament or abilities, you are capable of taming beasts of every shape and size. And you will know the best ways to do so. Even something as ornery as a dragon or as deadly as a basilisk can soon learn to follow your commands and treat you with compassion so rarely seen amongst beasts such as them. So long as you treat them with kindness, they shall treat you well indeed. If you’d like a few more pointers, there’s a certain Scamander or Hagrid who would absolutely be delighted to help you along."
1200,,400,Experimental Breeding,Wizarding World,Control,"In the year 1965, a law was enacted, a Ban on Experimental Breeding to curtail and regulate the growth of magical creatures bred by wizards and witches. And so, hefty fines and imprisonment await anyone who dares break this law. But then again, it’s not like something as simple and plain as legality will stop you.

With this, not only are quite skilled at getting beasts to hang around and be friendly with each, enough that you’ll never have to worry about more than just playful fights, but you can make them breed with ease. Tigers and lions? Child’s play. Manticores and fire crabs? Easy. Basilisks and dragons? No problem! Extraordinarily tiny kitty and giant whale? You don’t want to think of how it works, but it does!

More importantly, you have tremendous control over what traits are inherited by the resulting offspring. Not perfect control, at least not at first, but more than enough that you usually get the traits you want for your precious little beasts. Finally, any creatures born from your “experiments” will be engraved with an innate loyalty towards you, like a child with its parents."
1201,,400,Allies Big And Small,Disney’s Cinderella,Control,"Thanks to your winning personality and gentle nature, you can talk to and charm animals, which grants them limited intellect/personalities. Show them kindness and they will pay you back in any way they can. Small gifts and favours will be returned in equal measure. Saving them from being eaten or killed, even if it’s only once, will see them returning to you in your darkest hour."
1202,,400,The Magic Mirror ,Disney’s Snow White,Control,"An indentured servant captured within an ornate mirror, who can answer your every question. They are always honest, and can detect lies told in their presence. They can show you the location of anything you seek, regardless of distance. The mirror cannot be broken and will shrink down to pocket sized if needed."
1203,,400,Darkwing II(Shadow Creatures) ,Invincible,Control,"For an extra 400 cp, you now gain the ability to summon Shadow Creatures at will into reality, and they appear as pitch black moving silhouettes. After gaining this new power you have absolute control over all Shadow Creatures both inside and outside of the Shadowverse.

Requires Darkwing II to Purchase"
1204,,400,Dupli-Kate ,Invincible,Control,"Through a mystic curse you have been empowered to be able to use Bio-fission, able to at will make clones of yourself and absorb them. You are able to make an enormous number of clones, each a perfect copy of you, who innately exist in a sort of hive mind (no one being superior to the others, and all working together). When you first activate this power you’re limited to making about a hundred clones, with time and practice however you will discover that you are able to make as many clones as you want. The clones are permanent fixtures in reality and once created, they remain unless absorbed and reintegrated into your body, meaning that if they get crushed they are a pain to clean up. So long as any single clone survives, so will you in your entirety. I suggest you hide one somewhere no one else will find it."
1205,,400,Tree Seeds and Growing Kit,Wizard 101,Control,"A set of eleven tree seeds, one for each school of magic known to the Spiral, and a guide for growing them into wise and benevolent tutors. When guided correctly, they will be capable of teaching new students of the arcane arts on their own, provided there are people around to teach. Additionally, this provides instructions for growing new trees around new magical principles you may discover in your future or past Jumps."
1206,,400,Drake Egg Hatching Kit,Wizard 101,Control,"And, of course, a Drake Egg to hatch. Unlike Dragonspyre native Drakes, your Drake can follow you anywhere. If you can successfully hatch a Drake you will join the ranks of Dragonspyre’s Dragonriders. Not that there are any left to induct you into the order proper. To hatch it, you will need to bathe the Egg in purest Fire to quicken the life within, and then crack the Egg with the enclosed Crystal Hammer. You’ll need to armor the young thing yourself if you want to use it in battle in the next decade, of course. A new Drake Egg will be delivered to you every month or whenever a good Dragonrider candidate appears, whichever takes longer."
1207,,400,Minion Mastery,Wizard 101,Control,"Conjurers often call up assistants both in battle and in life from the eldest halls of legend. You too may now conjure permanent assistants out of battle, and temporary but more powerful Minions in combat! Out of combat, you may maintain 5 permanent summons at a time to start, with the count increasing in power as you do, up to a maximum of 100. In combat, you may summon a small gang of up to 20 minions at the start, eventually letting you call upon small armies at the heights of power. With practice, you may also vary summon times, allowing for longer lasting but still temporary summons for more involved work. In addition, with a little imagination, just about any spell you have that summons a creature may be used to create a minion, either permanent or temporary."
1208,,400,"Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?",Cinderella,Control,"As befitting a Disney princess (or prince), you are now capable of talking to animals.

In this world, while all animals will be able to understand your speech, only some will be able to talk back to you. Going forward into other worlds, you’ll find that all animals are capable of speaking back to you (though others around you will not necessarily understand them), though you’ll probably find that most of the time they are not nearly as intelligent as they are here."
1209,,400,Fairy Godmother ,Disney Princess,Control,"A fairy godmother that, if you are ever in desperate need, will show up and upgrade your equipment for the next 6 hours. Mice to steeds, hover-tanks to mobile battle towers, whatever works."
1210,,400,Maleficent,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control,"A-are you sure, Jumper? You know who this is, right? You know, Mistress of All Evil, wicked fairy, pretty much one of the most evil Disney villains of all time save for Chernabog himself? Well, if you insist...Maleficent is, as I said before, the Mistress of All Evil, and one of the most iconic Disney villains ever. She is graceful, elegant, poised, up until her anger is aroused, turning her into a storm of fury, cruelty, and spite. Maleficent is vain and petty, and even a small snub can garner a deadly reaction from her. She is, perhaps, not entirely black-hearted, as she does express love and concern for her raven Diablo. But that is the only sign of compassion she shows. Cruelty and wickedness aside, Maleficent is both powerful and clever, her magic too great for even her heroic counterparts to undo entirely, and twice she nearly obtained victory over the forces of good, first when she captured Philip and then when she fought him as a dragon.

I know not how or why you have managed to gain Maleficent as a companion. Are you an amusement, a mortal she took an interest in and decided to allow the chance to bask in her glory? Are you a fellow fairy, who she considers subordinate to her? Or...perhaps, are you a monster like her, a force of pure evil and dark power, one of the few beings she might consider an equal? Whatever the case, should she be willing by jump’s end, Maleficent will join you as a companion fully, following you to future jumps with the entire Uninvited perk line, as well as her beloved raven Diablo, her Dark Familiar.

Note: Alternatively, you can take Maleficent as she is in the Maleficent movie series. For better or for worse."
1211,,400,Forces of Evil,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Control,"And of course, if you’re going to be a Master or Mistress of All Evil, you’re going to need some minions, right? Well, here they are: an army of goblins, orcs, and other monsters, all ready to serve you! They’re not particularly large or strong individually, but they’re great in swarms, and even a knight such as Prince Philip could be captured or killed by them if they ambushed him...assuming he didn’t have the fairies to help him. They’re all loyal to you, though I’ll warn you they’re not the most intelligent bunch. Much like Maleficent’s goons, you’ll need to explain to them that a baby won’t stay a baby forever, or they’ll keep looking for that baby sixteen years later."
1212,,400,Lord of Fire,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control,"It is impossible to speak of the dawn of the Age of Fire without speaking of the four Lords that made it all possible. The Lord of Sunlight, Gwyn, possesses the Lord Soul of Light. The Witch of Izalith, who possessed the Lord Soul of Life. Gravelord Nito, who possesses the Lord Soul of Death. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten, who found a fourth, unique dark soul within the First Flame. With each purchase, you may take one of these mighty figures with you as a companion, offering their power and wisdom whenever you desire it."
1213,,400,Calamity,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control,"The gods feared the Black Dragon Kalameet, as any caught in the gaze of its orange eye would surely be met with calamity and ruin. Like this deadly dragon, you have the ability that made it so feared, that of telekinesis. More than enough to easily toss around a man in full plate armor, and hold them down in one place, making them easy targets for any of your other attacks. With time and training, this could become so much more. You may optionally have an orange eye appear in the middle of your forehead."
1214,,400,Spirit Caller,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Control,"Not all of the dead rest peacefully, some souls lasting long after the body has faded away due to the resentment felt within. You are more than familiar with such entities, dangerous as they are, due to your newfound ability to summon them to your side in order to aid you in whatever matters you see fit. They are especially useful in battle, as their incorporeal forms render them immune to mundane weapons."
1215,,400,Good Shepherd,Walt Disney’s Robin Hood,Control,"You didn’t know exactly why at the time, but you just knew that you had to scoop up those two into the wheelbarrow before it’s too late. Your dedication to helping those in distress has given you a near-supernatural sense for what you can do to help people around you, even if the danger is not visibly evident."
1216,,400,Musket Ball Manipulation,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Control,"It’s just like that Shia Labeouf movie! Like Rip Van Winkle, you can exert supernatural control over metal projectiles. The strength of this power is inversely tied to your rate of fire; spreading it over a long burst from an automatic weapon would diminish it greatly, while wielding a singular, high powered shot would let you shred your targets to ribbons. Be warned, however, as foes with more magical power can overcome and arrest your mystically-infused shots. Van Winkle was able to wound a high-speed Blackbird several times with a single volley from her musket, bending the bullet’s flight path through tight corkscrews and into vital weak points. Demand the same respect and attention with this potent ability."
1217,,400,She,Hellsing,Control,"A mummified form, bound and staked in a warded room. Not an inch of what lies beneath can be seen, nothing of the limitless value to science that is present here. In this world, this mummified body is the still writhing and shrieking body of Mina Harker, a few drops of Dracula’s blood of having corrupted her form into something close to that of a True Vampire, if not one outright. From Her, the Doktor made many of his scientific advancements, able to study at leisure the unholy power that coursed through her veins. Whether it is Harker or another young woman in a similar situation, you have a subject of your own. But even in other worlds, your miraculous martyr for science will remain useful. Each land you go to, the sealed room you find these secrets in will gain a different inhabitant. Each one will be a still living being that represents the secrets of that world in some way, the half turned child of a powerful being or a remnant of a long lost civilisation. By abandoning your morality, you can extract a great deal of useful information to further your own ends."
1218,,400,Kill the Sparrow,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales,Control,"You were yourself a leader of men, or at least you had the potential for it. The Triangle recognized this, and gifted you with the ability to manifest further perversions of nature. You may animate corpses or inanimate objects, up to the size of a Spanish Galleon, to carry out your will. Anything so animated will act as though it had been revived through Deeeeeath, damage largely irrelevant to carrying out its macabre orders. This enhances any magical or spiritual forms of imparting “false” life."
1219,,400,Lord of Fire,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control,"Once cannot talk of this Age of Fire without mentioning the Lords who made it all possible in the first place. The Lord of Sunlight, Gwyn, possesses the Lord Soul of Light. The Witch of Izalith, who possessed the Lord Soul of Life. Gravelord Nito, who possesses the Lord Soul of Death. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten, who found a fourth, unique dark soul within the First Flame. You may take any of these Lords with you, having been restored to their prime with all that entails."
1220,,400,A Pack of Lawyers,Marry Poppins Returns,Control,"It’s always helpful to have a legal consultant on hand, isn’t it? But then again, you can hardly be expected to carry around a lawyer everywhere you go, so you may yet find this lacquered wood box useful. Or, rather, you might find the little plastic animals contained within the box useful. There are fifteen assorted animals held within the box, and you’ll find your set replenished at the end of every month. By simply hydrating one of the animals with a few drops of water, you can magically transmute that same plastic animal into a living, breathing lawyer! There are all manner of lawyers contained within this box. There are divorce lawyers, criminal lawyers, injury lawyers, demonic contract lawyers - whatever sort of lawyer you need, you can find it in this box. And you won’t even have to guess, because you’ll always know exactly who you have on hand. In addition to being incredibly competent, the lawyers stored within the box are a little bit, um… flamboyant, but are nonetheless incredibly loyal. They can be returned to their animal state by being killed, otherwise incapacitated, completing their job, or if you choose to dismiss them."
1221,,400,Cy-Bug Egg ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Control,"A single Cy-Bug egg, that can hatch into a single, solitary, sterile Cy-Bug. This Cy-Bug is perfectly and absolutely loyal to you, and possesses the full abilities of its race, capable of absorbing and integrating anything it consumes within itself. Even if it were to consume a sentient being, the resulting conglomeration would still possess a strong loyalty to you and your cause. If it were to die, a new egg would appear, ready to hatch, in your Warehouse within a week. If you possess the know-how, you could possibly find a way to create more Cy-Bugs from this egg, perhaps via cloning, but only the Cy-Bug hatched from this egg carries the absolute loyalty guarantee. You’ll have to find a way to enforce compliance on any others that you make."
1222,,400,Familiar(s),Darkwing Duck,Control,"Have a little friend. It can be any small animal or a swarm of them like bats or spiders, it will gain higher than normal intelligence and be able to understand and follow your directions. Swarms of small familiars like spiders are great for hiding in your dress or tophat."
1223,,400,Sentient Mushroom Minions? ,Darkwing Duck,Control,Why would you want sentient mushrooms? Why wouldn’t you is a better question. Well in any case you now have the knowledge and magical skill to create sentient creatures from various items and produce. They can range from large hopping mushrooms to fully bipedal sapient beings that could be mistaken for actual people.
1224,,400,Snarky Mirror Spirit,Shrek,Control,"Do you need a mirror that doesn’t show your reflection, do you want it to talk back and possibly make snarky comments. Well, do I have the spell for you! This spell temporarily enchants a mirror to summon a personal spirit, the gender, look, and attitude of the spirit head is customised upon first summon. The spirit is able to answer basic questions and perform far sight though only within the casters claimed borders, the spirit has trouble seeing through warded areas."
1225,,400,Devil ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Control,"There’s really no good explanation for this, save perhaps that your mind has simply grown so powerful that you can now affect the minds and bodies of lesser beings with a thought- or, if that is not the answer, that you have become a creature of the Devil himself; capable of tempting men with false promises and a hollow, eternal life. Like the Kraken, you are capable of projecting illusions that directly affect the senses and minds of those you target, making them see false images to lead them astray. You’re even capable of dominating up to one mind at a time, completely and utterly, though this effect can be broken with physical violence. But like the demon you possibly are, these effects are enhanced when you make a deal with your chosen target. To give an example, the mayor of a small fishing village named Edgar Volgud sold his town and the lives of those who lived within it to the Kraken in exchange for prosperity during a time of famine, as well as eternal life for himself; the Kraken provided this, sinking ships to give the supplies to Volgud- but as a consequence, the Kraken was able to control any and all who lived in the town, even controlling whole groups of people at once. This was not the only caveat; while you are more than capable of providing eternal life, eternal youth is beyond you. The upside is that a bargain struck cannot be broken in any way save for your death, in which case those whose lives you’ve extended beyond their time will crumble to dust along with you. Note that, in the cases where someone is “selling” you the lives of other people, they must have some sort of claim over them- friends and family members can sell each other out, and friends can do the same, as can a leader with his people or master his slave- but two complete strangers would be unable to deal with you in regards to the other."
1226,,400,The Oracle’s Scythe,Aladdin,Control,"You have stolen a very special scepter. The Oracle’s Scythe can summon an all knowing spirit that will answer any question it hears. But every person only gets one answer. The spirit enforces this rule, but as a Jumper things are a bit different. While the Oracle will still enforce the normal rule of one question per person, she will make a single exception. Once per jump you will get a new question. While you can always have someone else ask on your behalf, the Oracle will answer EVERY question, even rhetorical ones."
1227,,400,Spirit Magic(400) ,Black Clover,Control,"This is a form of magic that allows a user to summon an elemental spirit of the matching element and bonds with them each spirit possess immense magical power and can increase their masters own magical power and spells. Spirits overtime develop alongside their partner. You begin with a number of spirit spells in your grimoire. Bonding with a spirit doesn’t just give access to Spirit Magic the spirit itself also grants access to a large abundance of natural mana increasing the users mana capacity and the power of their spells. Currently, there are only 3 spirits currently known to exist in this world, The Fire spirit Salamander, The Water Spirit Undine, The Wind Spirit Sylph. But, who knows just how many exist in this world, you can choose to partner either with a canon spirit whereby the original wielders will no longer be partnered with them or you can partner with a made-up spirit of equal power. ​(Multiple spirits can be bought). ​For an extra 100 CP instead of just starting out with your spirit you start out with a deep and spiritual connection with one another decreasing the cost of Spirit Magic and even being able to fuse with one another causing an overall boost in capabilities.

1228,,400,Great One ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"You desire to travel not with other people, but those that are so powerful that humanity would consider them gods. Should you do desire, you may take with you any of the Great Ones shown or mentioned within the nightmares of Yharnam. Perhaps you wish to end the loneliness of left behind Ebrietas, or to hunt forevermore alongside the Moon Presence, or give great Kos and her orphan a more happy end. Even Oedon, Mergo, or his wetnurse are viable options. To have such powerful beings on your side is sure to be a boon, though could you truly consider such alien entities to be friends or companions?"
1229,,400,Snake Whisperer,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"An ability once possessed by a pair of twins in the Forbidden Woods, you have a supernatural connection to snakes. All reptiles, especially snakes, will be extremely friendly with you, and will more often than not go out of their way to assist you in their own ways. This is only amplified by your ability to summon a massive snake to your side to aid you in combat, with a head as big as a horse and fangs larger than a child."
1230,,400,Seal Away Corruption,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"When Martyr Logarias learned that he was incapable of slaying the Vileblood Queen, he instead dedicated himself towards sealing her away, trapping the both of them in that forsaken place. Like your now departed master, you are capable of binding and trapping others through mystical means, leaving them trapped so long as your power holds them back. The strength of these bindings depend on what you’re willing to lose, growing more powerful the more you sacrifice."
1231,,400,Silver Spirits,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"The spirits of the slaughtered nobility still roam the corridors of Castle Cainhurst, attacking any outsiders that trespass upon their ancestral home. As one of the last Vilebloods still among the living, they endeavor to assist their fellow noble in any way they can. Not only can you summon these vengeful spirits to your side, seeking their aid in whatever trial you find yourself in, but you will find similarly spiritual beings more predisposed towards liking, maybe even accepting you."
1232,,400,Magic Goats,Marvel Magic,Control,"Twins to the divine goats of Thor Odinson, these two goats stand larger than most horses and are intelligent enough to follow simple commands. The goats are capable of fighting on par with most gods and can devour anything short of Uru if they can fit it in their mouth. They are also capable of flight and can ever travel faster than light while in the vacuum of space, where they can easily survive."
1233,,400,Enchanting,Marvel Magic,Control,"Your charm, such that it is, is a powerful tool. But it alone is not always enough. When such occasions arise, you are able to bolster it through supernatural means. Through one particular means of physical contact with others, whether it is a kiss, a handshake, or something else similar, you may enthral others. Once enchanted in such a way by you, they will retain all of their former intelligence and skills, but will be entirely loyal and obedient to you. Such a spell will last roughly one well before it fades, though you may reapply it at any time to extend the duration. Particularly powerful beings may be resistant or even immune and those with extraordinarily strong wills may resist your powers, but most will become loyal slaves with only a touch."
1234,,400,Psionics ,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Control,"You now have incredible Psionic powers, equal to the Psionic powers Scarlet Witch gained from exposure to the cosmic energies of the Mind Stone. This gives you an array of psionic powers, which manifest as a luminescent mist or vapor of red hue emanating from your hands and body, though you may change how the power manifests visually. This is not Chaos Magic, merely the Psionic abilities Scarlet witch has, from incredible Telekinesis to Psionic energy manipulation, Telepathy and Mind manipulation."
1235,,400,Delilah the Dark Elf,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 1,Control,"Not everyone agreed with the homicidal views of Malekith and his horde of Dark Elves in regards to the light in the universe. A rare few such as Deliah felt that their time had come and gone, and would resign themselves to seeing what this new state of creation could offer. She's very curious as a result, and it's a good idea not to leave her alone with any technology for more than ten minutes if you don't want it disassembled and in the process of being studied. She's very meticulous at recording anything she finds though, so perhaps it might be good to let her work."
1236,,400,Command Spirit,Ghost Rider,Control,"Through some strange, unknown ability or perhaps as a result of your muddled bloodline, you have the ability to command spiritual beings such as ghosts, angels, or demons to do your bidding. This can be resisted, especially if you are ordering the spirit in question to do something it wouldn’t normally consider, but commanding a spirit is much easier when you have some sort of relation to the spirit in question (such as being the same type of spirit, or being a related type of spirit), or if you’re much more powerful than it is; spirits that you’ve created can be commanded in this way without fail."
1237,,400,Mammoth Friend ,Marvel Primal,Control,"A mammoth has taken you as their friend, this giant is gentle but fierce when provoked, and you can share any of your perks and powers with it."
1238,,400,Acanti,X-Men the Claremont Years,Control,"A space whale. This peaceful creature is able to survive and fly through the vacuum of space, capable even of moving at faster than light speeds. This Acanti is a Follower who loyally sees you as its ally and protector happily serving you as a friend, or, if you prefer, has been bound to your will by the Brood’s slaver virus. It begins the jump as a young member of the species, perhaps 2 miles in length, but can grow over decades and centuries, till it is at least 100 miles in length. This Acanti is not recognized as a Prophet Singer in this world, but has the potential to become one in future jumps carrying the soul of its race within it. As a potential Prophet Singer it has the ability to 1/jump (or 10 years whichever is first) take in the soul of dying individual to bond them with it and help guide it as a gestalt entity, granting the individual the ability to astrally project themselves, and with the power of the racial soul of the Acanti revive that individual at some other point."
1239,,400,Terra Cotta Soldiers,Pet Avengers,Control,"You now have 80 terra cotta soldiers which you can animate with a magical blast of energy from your eyes. These soldiers are strong enough to slow down the Avengers, but even Mockingbird and Hawkeye will make quick work of them. They are not particularly intelligent, simply obeying the simplest of commands, but can fight, patrol an area, or be directed to do manual labor. Still if destroyed they will repair themselves at a rate of 3 a day. Each time you purchase this time the number of Terra Cotta Soldiers you possess increases by an order of magnitude (2 purchases gives 800, 3 gives 8000, 4 gives 80,000).

1241,,400,The Chains Of Sin,Helltaker,Control,"May your enemies face their sins! You can call for chains to restrain your enemy, the more sins they’ve done the thicker the chains. The chains can be broken, but only by experiencing the pain they have caused to others. If you have a Puzzle, you can now have gigantic chains lash out at your prisoner while they think of a solution."
1242,,400,Souls of the Damned,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Control,"The Souls of the Damned are vile and violent spirits tasked with the punishment of those who would defile the dead through dark magic. But should one be a sorcerer of supreme skill, it would certainly not be out of the question for said sorcerer to utilize such spirits for their own devious little purposes. And you are one such sorcerer indeed.

Whether in this world or the next, you can call forth the Souls of the Damned from the dark and desolate void between universes. Once summoned, these spirits shall serve your every whim, assaulting your foes with reckless abandon and more. At first, you'll only be able to summon around a dozen such spirits, enough to fashion yourself a crude and skeletal mimicry of a certain sorcerer's Cloak of Levitation, but in time and with greater power, you will be able to savage and punish your foes with a veritable army of the damned."
1243,,400,Animal Control,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Control,"You can telepathically command a certain type of animal (wolves, ants, spiders, squirrels etc.) over a one mile area. You can change which animal you control every ten years; they must be non-sapient."
1244,,400,Original Master,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Control,"The first Benders were not humans, but animals with deep understanding of their elements no human can match. You've gained a bond with one of these creatures, appropriate to your nation - Airbenders gain a Sky Bison calf, Earthbenders a Badgermole cub, and Firebenders a young Dragon. Each is still a child, though still large enough to ride, and will prove to be a loyal and powerful friend your entire life if cared for well. As the Water Tribe learned from the Moon and Sea, they will not gain an animal; instead, you gain a deep connection to these spirits. Aside from this enhancing your ability to learn Waterbending by watching the tides, you will find your waterskins full each night, and you will no longer lose power when the moon wanes, or even during a lunar eclipse. May be purchased more than once; additional purchases need not be a member of the same species as your Nation learned its art from, and will be at a discount.

1245,,400,Comrades in Battle,Toaruverse,Control,To fight a group or a powerful foe the best choice of actions is to fight with tactics. You took this and improve it to another level when you’re fighting with someone or a group you all gain a special link that allows you all to work with a perfect synchronicity to a frightening degree. This makes everyone able to guess when and where someone would need some help and backup along with protecting each other’s blind-spots and attacking in the right timing to deliver maximum amount of damage to your enemies even saving others from fatal wounds. This makes you and your group a well oiled machine.
1246,,400,Tamed and Trained ,Darkest Dungeon,Control,"“The bigger the beast, the greater the glory.” There have ever been those who have used animals for warfare, ever since the days when man first tamed wolves or domesticated horses for riding and labor. The choice to bring such creatures here, to the Hamlet, with all manner of predators that make prey of man and beast alike is an interesting one to say the least- but under the tutelage of a master animal trainer they can make for surprisingly effective soldiers in their own right. You are one such person, capable of taking nearly any animal and raising it into a weapon of war, as well as a faithful companion. Although you may not have as much success in taming the truly feral or monstrous, even that may be possible. Once your bond has grown it will almost feel like they are an extension of yourself; the commands coming quick and followed just as easily. Such is your bond that taking a moment to pet your loyal friend can even restore both of your bodies, not to mention the effects that having it around will have on moral- or the utility a keen sense of smell and an extra pair of eyes might bring."
1247,,400,Magic Monocle ,Bayonetta,Control,"You are a being of the sun. A sun which lays all sin bare. Let no evil escape your sight. Once every 24 hours, you can activate the enchantment on this item to bind a spiritual being of terrible power, thus assisting you in your battles... even if it can only hold one at a time. As a plus, wearing this item will repel a fair amount of evil beings and the corruption they may attempt to force upon your body or mind, which will let you walk about in peace."
1248,,400,"You, Me, and My Friends",Bayonetta,Control,"Why fight by yourself when you can summon some other entity to do the work for you? That's what you made a pact for, right? By channeling your medium, you gain the ability to summon and bind supernatural allies in order to fight with you (or for you), thus changing the battlefield. Lumen Sages can summon lesser Angels while Umbra Witches can summon lesser Demons. All others summon specter-like Wraiths, but they are no less bloodthirsty than the other denizens. Just be sure you have the power to control them, for they may not enjoy being the patsy of another."
1249,,400,Psychokinesis,Ragna Crimson,Control,"The power to control inanimate matter. A simple and straightforward power, it allows you to control the world around you. As simple as it may sound, the ability to turn the rocks and stones from buildings and the ground itself into massive projectiles is no laughing matter. The speeds and force that you can launch these at your enemies is also enough to turn most humans into red paste instantly."
1250,,400,Too Valuable To Be Lost ,Ragna Crimson,Control,"Humanity is on a slow path to extinction when it comes to their fight against dragons. Even if the Saints can fight some of the High Class Dragons, it is not rare for them to be killed in action. Especially if they were to face their Kings or the Second Seats.

But what if they could keep fighting even after death? You have become adept at the Sun Cult’s cloning techniques. These allow you to make weaker clones of those you have genetic materials of. These clones are highly submissive to you and retain a modicum of the abilities of the original. However, if you were to escalate the production, it is possible that with enough clones, you may eventually craft one that retains the personality and full powers of the original."
1251,,400,Dragon Fear,Trinity Wonder,Control,"The impressive aura of a dragon, that oppresses all other beings. Actually, this is more a natural magical talent of dragons, who can use mana to paralyse those around them. Some special warriors can resist this paralysis, and there are spells like anti-magic shields that can be used in advance to stop it. However, if caught unawares, this can be devastating as warriors freeze and mages become unable to cast the spells needed to counter it. Even the likes of Pink Papa were made helpless once caught by surprise. This does require some concentration to maintain, so if under attack you may find it easier to let it drop rather than split your attention."
1252,,400,Star Dragon Hatchling,League of Legends,Control,"Somehow, you've got your mitts on the egg of an almighty Star Dragon, a creature capable of creating stars with barely a thought. Unfathomably powerful, There is only one Star Dragon known to exist, and he's existed since the universe began. And you've got an egg for one. In time, this hatchling will grow into a deific being capable of creating entire galaxies- The rub, though, is that the time it'll take for your hatchling to grow up is roughly a hundred trillion years, and that time cannot be shortened through breeding, gene-manipulation, or time-manipulation. The sad news is, you're probably not going to have a pet deity until you no longer really need one, but in the meantime he's gonna make a really, really cool little dragon buddy."
1253,,400,Ruk,A Throne of Glass,Control,"You now possess a great Ruk, the enormous birds that the Rhukim of the Khaganate ride on. These enormous eagle-like golden feathered birds might not be sapient but are very smart and create bonds with their riders that are like family. These massive birds are tough and strong, able to carry off cattle and horses into the sky, or fight Wyverns. This Ruk is loyal to you, and will follow your commands with a fluidity and loyalty that would normally only come from a lifetime of training and companionship."
1254,,400,Sea-Dragon,A Throne of Glass,Control,"You have somehow come into contact with and bonded to potentially the last living sea-dragon in the world. None have been seen in centuries. Regardless you now possess the loyalty of a great reptilian beast, able to breath air or water, and specialized in swimming at extreme speed. Your dragon is covered in hard scales that would turn the edge of swords, and the points of arrows. It is large and strong enough to break the keels of galleons with a casual strike of its claws. This Sea-Dragon is loyal to you, and will follow your commands with a fluidity and loyalty that would normally only come from a lifetime of training and companionship."
1255,,400,The Hero is Back,Super Dragon Sword,Control,"You no longer need your allies to host the spirits of the Legends - they return, fully fledged as noble spirits ready to fight…though obviously requiring some management on your party. Summoning forth a Legend spirit requires a massive portion of your mana, but their power is well worth the cost."
1256,,400,Air Superiority,Super Dragon Sword,Control,"What’s a captain without their crew? Or a ship for that matter. You have both now, owning a pretty sizable airship and a crew willing to fight by your side manning it. This allows you to quickly (though not subtly) travel across the land, and the fire support from the (admittedly meager compared to a Landship) cannons is sure to be a surprise."

These angels are much more powerful than the others, but are a bit slower to act. They can call upon the Exceeded Element of light known as Aurora. With these, you have certainly earned the title of “Angel-caller.”"
1260,,400,Echoes of the Time War,Ben 10,Control,"Where did you get these? Or when did you get them? This is a trio of Time Beast eggs. They are a substantial power source for time machines, able to charge them up with enough power to go as far as the creation of the universe, someplace most time travelers couldn’t hope to reach on their own. Should you instead decide to hatch them, the Time Beasts that emerge will be loyal to you and see you as their parent, being a ferocious pack that can travel up and down the timestream freely. Let’s see how smug your enemies are when you send these angry dogs after them years in the past!"
1261,,400,Court ,Dresden Files,Control,"This is what it can be grown into. A full-sized Court. A truly vast array of Nevernever beings who are sworn to serve you in whatever manner you desire, though in exchange for certain rights and privileges of their own that you are bound to uphold, much like a feudal king over their nobles. These can be of a vast variety of natures and kinds, or an eclectic mix from many kinds. If you buy the Kingdom above, this becomes a full nation peer to the Fae superpowers, complete with highly powerful nobles among them, since you get a gigantic 7000 CP to spend on at least ten nobles of your court, who will be as Leanansidhe, Cat Sith, Eldest Gruff and others are among Winter and Summer."
1262,,400,Petrified Dragon Egg ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“A large, petrified egg that bears no signs of life. Eggs are vessels that harbor life itself however, so one that cannot is a paradox that seeks to resolve itself. Placing this egg the size of a man within a suitable nest will see it eventually hatch, revealing a being worthy of growing past that stone shell once so immutable and timeless. That being, a dragon. The form the dragon takes depends on the nest you gave it, and the environment you allowed it to hatch within. What can be said no matter what form it takes however, is that it will be immensely resilient, powerful, and vulnerable to little else but powerful electricity.”"
1263,,400,Innumerable Rats ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Rats, rats, a plague of rats. A plague is such a nasty term for your comrades, but the sentiment of them never ending and overrunning enemies is clear. Your brothers and sisters are at your side, always. Rats the size of dogs, two dozen that exist below ground wherever you tread in the land claimed as their own. At the your word, you may call upon them, causing them to surge forth to your aid and attack your enemies. Although weak and easily slain individually, overwhelming with numbers is what rats do. The lives of fallen compatriots will be replaced come one day’s time.” "
1264,,400,Maidens of Black,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“The shard Nadalia, like her sisters, sought out a king. When she arrived in the Iron Kingdom however, great frustration overtook her over the discovery of its ruin, and so she danced, splitting herself apart to corrupt what was left through numerous bodies. You too possess this ability, dividing yourself into fractions, splitting your body, mind and soul up as many times as you like. Despite being fractured and scattered, a kind of core identity remains in the middle, coordinating all splits while retaining your will to keep them on the right track. The more you split yourself apart, the weaker you get, obviously. You may also control whether body, mind and soul or split, or just mind and soul as such things are inserted into hollow constructs nearby. Splitting pieces into defensible places in this way makes you quite hard to kill.”"
1265,,400,Endless Burning Passion ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Love is why you’re here. Was it your love? No, but that doesn’t stop you from learning from it. Passion is a powerful force, and long after the prince and princess who proclaimed their love through the tolls of great bells are gone, their will carries on. Passion you hold in all its forms can only grow, never lessen unless you actively wish it so. You will always love what you love like you did in your fondest memories. You will always fight for your causes with as much vigor as the day they stoked your heart into an inferno. Likewise, passion focused on you will hold and persist forever. Those who love you, those inspired by you and, if you wish it, those who hate you.”"
1266,,400,“Eternal Dragon Ally”,Dark Souls 1,Control,"One of the last of the eternal dragons, a nigh extinct race of which only a hand full of individuals still exist. Standing above most other creatures in these lands, spike covered wings stretching wider than it is tall, curling horns like a ram sprouting from its head. As with all dragons, this one is covered in stone scales of immortality, meaning the dragon will never die unless those scales are literally peeled off of their form. Hailing from an age before the age of fire, your friend here is mostly apathetic or lost in thought due to being one of the last of his kind. They are your friend and think of you fondly, but you’ll have to forgive them if they’re not quite as active as you in your adventures. Your companion here has the equivalent the Drake’s perks, sans the capstone, but have a much stronger breath weapon than any drake."
1267,,400,"“Revenants, Family”",Dark Souls 1,Control,"In service of Alvina, to protect their home and the grave of the honorable Sir Artorias, Forest Hunters leap to defend from any invader, and can even be summoned between worlds to carry out their duty. Now, when you are attacked or your home is invaded, corporeal ‘phantoms’ of old Forest Hunters will manifest and rush to your aid. Although translucent and hazy, they’re certainly physical, capable of fighting just as a normal man, and capable of dying like a normal man. One should not underestimate them, for they are still all capable warriors, bandits and hunters. If taken with Man’s Best Friends, ‘phantoms’ of animals you’ve uplifted and befriended will start to manifest alongside the ‘phantoms’ of old Forest Hunters."
1268,,400,Mob Network,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control,"You start to notice these... peculiar characters haunting the battlefields with their gloomy tents and sickly yellow lanterns. When you speak to them, you find that they’re merchants here to honor the dead. They offer you a deal that you accept. If you invest in them, you will get returns in the form of either useful items or useful knowledge. You can also trade with them. They deal in material products and information. You can find these “Mob Merchants” anywhere where great conflict is found. It doesn’t even need to be physical conflicts like battlefields. It could be political battles like a royal court, or more mundane ones such as tournaments. Their stock isn’t restricted to depending on where they are. Their stock is universal and even if you find something that isn’t useful now, you’ll have a need for it in the future. If you want to find these merchants in more not-medieval settings, keep an eye out for vendors, or people in corners or alleyways with... a noticeable congregation of crows."
1269,,400,Tibia Mariner,Elden Ring,Control,"The dead have long been left to wander. What they need is leadership-and now, you can grant it to them. The mindless undead now fall under your will, in amounts roughly proportionate to your overall power-but even a dead man could summon hordes of ghosts or skeletons of great stature to his side. You may also raise the dead with the reserve of deathly energy within you, granting them purpose and direction under your leadership. Your grip on them is strong enough to contest with other magical abilities that may seek to usurp your control the undead-though with this alone, you lack any innate ability to wrest control of undead summoned or raised by others.

This perk also comes a boat just big enough to carry you in, and a tibia bone large enough to serve as a paddle. Some odd magic lets it sail on land as well as it does in water, teleport short distances and splash “water” made of deathly magic that can deal significant harm to your foes."
1270,,400,Serpentine Ambition ,Elden Ring,Control,"Rykard’s vow to secure true immortality for himself and his defiance against all confinement are one and the same. So it is for you, who perhaps have been touched by his power in the past as a gesture of favour. For every method you have of gathering spiritual energy or souls is drastically more effective now; fallen foes yield more runes, souls that could otherwise fight back are drawn into you as if envenomed and constricted by the coils of a serpent, and normally corruptive forces sit well in you. This perverse symbiosis could soon lead to strange distortions of your form if done in excess- but the power granted is undeniable, and it seems your twisted ambitions inspire a perversely familial loyalty in other seekers of power and prestige who are drawn to your goals like flies to a corpse. Last but not least, when you are devoured by something greater than yourself there is a significant chance that instead of dying you will merge with and consume it in turn-taking on its superior strength and form while forcibly manifesting your own powers through it. This gift is not infallible, but with it a demigod could wrest control of a god- devouring serpent’s body. And a Tarnished could certainly become Lord of the Frenzied Flame without yielding their will to it."
1271,,400,Talk With the Animals,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Control,"You and beasts just get along. For one thing they seem to understand human speech when it’s from you and for another they seem unusually inclined to make friends with you, even if their nature is usually vicious and aggressive. You also have a nose for when an animal (or monster) is being mistreated and can zero in on their location with unerring accuracy. Beasts rescued will recognise you as their saviour and become very loyal."
1272,,400,Awakened Amalgam ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A construct born of a mix of the golden city’s defenses and a construct created by one of the World Wakers, the Amalgam is somehow capable of channelling both the power of the golden city’s advanced magic as well as the primal mystical energies allowed by Jade - this loyal towering creature passively draws mana from all lands it has pieces of integrated into its body, becoming more grand and powerful as it integrates new forms of energy and expressions - notably, it also can integrate pieces of cities and other settelements, tapping into their power as well. While starting off relatively meager, it can become a titan, capable of crashing through garrisons as it collects more pieces of the various lands and regions of Ixalan and beyond, both settled or otherwise. Though lands that are TOO similar, culturally or geographically, will have any gains made by them greatly diminished - the power comes from the diverse nature of the lands gathered, not the sheer number."
1273,,400,Bonded Beast ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A megaraptor (A horse sized dinosaur with deadly sharp claws that can rip into scaly hide easily) or a spineback (a thagomizer-wielding creature with thick hide) that is magically bonded to you, it is oddly easy to channel your energy into it and cast spells that modify it - it can also be transformed into pure magic energy for safekeeping.

Finally, any magical enhancements performed on one of you will be mirrored on the other: though spells targetting both of you at once will still have their normal effect, if one of you were to be healed for example, the other would heal a similar amount. The same works for spells which increase your physical might or speed, or similarly enhancing magic."
1274,,400,Condemner ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"Those who know life must know death, and those who know light must know shadow. You are now one of the Legion’s dark magi, a Condemner, capable of utilizing dark magics that summon and bind beings of necrotic shadow known as Shades to your service - your knowledge of the darkness allows you to directly sap mana from the land and from mages, and in a pinch cause exsanguination via the tear ducts of your foes with dark mana drawn from places of rot and decay, such as a swamp."
1275,,400,Tilonalli’s Summoner ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"The veneration of the Threefold Sun extends to the magical arts of the Empire, and thus the manipulation of sunlight and flame is a key part of much of the higher level magic of its people. You are now trained in the creation and commanding of Sunfire elementals from “red” mana gained from mountainous and rocky terrain, firey elemental spirits born from the heat and light of the sun."
1276,,400,Eternal Servants,MtG - Amonkhet,Control,"Six of Nicol Bolas’s Eternals, undead warriors that can drain the life out of anyone they can grab. They are ruthless, adaptable, tactical, resilient, and fanatically loyal to you. Their undead state also allows them to transcend some of their mortal limitations, each one is an elite warrior, the best of a caste that was trained to kill from birth, though their skills alone are not superhuman. Unlike Nicol Bolas’s Dreadhorde, they cannot perform the Elder Spell proper, nor can you learn it from them, but they respawn three days after they are destroyed."
1277,,400,Crop ,MtG - Amonkhet,Control,"Twenty armed warriors, each one of which is resilient, courageous, and skilled. These fighters are followers, not companions, but further training and upgrades made to them carry over. Each and every one of these warriors would die for you, and would then respawn after a week."
1278,,400,Sorcerer’s Broom,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"Created once by a mischevious “king” among the faeries, this broom-resembling golem has a simple yet potent enchantment. When exposed to magic and given the order…it can replicate itself, consuming mana to do so. Given a big enough source of mana…well, it truly could be an army to sweep your enemies away, wouldn’t it?"
1279,,400,Enchanted Carriage,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"Another product of the Faerie Guidemother, this pumpkin-like carriage is almost self-propelling (only requiring the help of any living creature, even mice, to ‘guide’ where it goes) and can move from nearly the edge of Ardenvale right to its castle and back within a night...it’s rather sturdy, able to survive the high speeds it moves at and any unexpected bumps!"
1280,,400,Gilded Goose,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"A singular being among the natives of the Wilds, this goose has feathers burnished gold and lays golden eggs - eggs solid gold shells with a delicious yolk that invigorates your body’s stamina and restores mana! Of course, letting the eggs hatch may result in having more geese...so, perhaps practice patience?"
1281,,400,Shadow Steed,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"A good steed will lead you to glory, but a great steed will take you home. But the best steed can do either from even the depths of the wilds. You now have a powerful raven-like faerie beast as a mount, capable of taking high into the sky and having a keen sense for how to best escape danger, even if it takes...somewhat harrowing paths to get there."
1282,,400,Irencrag Feat,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Control,"The Irencrag’s power over courage and heat is often one that simply manifests in the searing strikes that its knights can perform, but every so often a Knight is something truly special. Beyond simply calling upon the flame, they are capable of mastering fear itself - stirring it in their foes beyond the wildest understanding or even transforming their own fear into focus and magical power...enough power to wield the flames and heat as if it was an extension of their own body.

Boosted: Irencrag Feat - > Fireborn Knight
Beyond flame and light, you have tapped into a power of the heart that grants you the power of the heavens itself - you can call down lightning with similar capabilities as the Silverflame, and wreathe your weapon in the same - in turn, enhancing the speed and power of your strikes to resemble that of the very electricity you call upon. 

Boost Requires Adamant(MtG - Throne of Eldraine)"
1283,,400,The Lady’s Path ,MtG - Homelands,Control ,"Between the Koskun Mountains and the pioneer settlement of An-Havva is one path, one singular trade route opened up through the forest for Aysen, An-Havva, and Koskun alike. Where the road intersects a huge raging river, she had the faeries construct a large bridge, then set them to guard it against any invaders or warparties. This way the Lady and her faeries ensured that no side could send their invasion forces through the forest.

Now the authority over the River Bridge falls to you, along with the host of faeries guarding it. At a single command from you, the faeries and sprites will drive any invaders from the bridge into the rushing waters and to their deaths. In other worlds, the faeries will take over a trade route of similar import, so that all who wish to cross it require your permission.

As an aside, you might end up noticing six inch tall doppelgangers of your enemies amongst the ranks of the faeries. Making a joke of them, and unnerving your enemies."
1284,,400,Ring of the Shade,MtG - Homelands,Control ,"An old signet ring, cast in the style of the Serrans. Bound to it is the soul of a former paladin of Aysen, one of the greatest champions of the Serra faith. Powerful spells drawing on the magic of the swamps have been used to enslave this paladin's spirit as they died, turning them into a helpless spirit, a shade bound in thrall to whoever owned the ring.

The shade you now command will serve and follow whatever orders you give them, as a guardian and ally, friend and companion for all of the days to come. They appear like a huge giant with glowing red eyes entirely clad in gleaming, black armour that is the repainted suit of full plate they once wore as a paladin of Serra. Previously one of the greatest warriors of that order, they have become only more powerful as your ghostly servant and champion, retaining their skills and strength while shedding the weaknesses of a mortal form.

They also retain their sanity and noble spirit, their heart breaking each time they are ordered to perform some atrocity. But perhaps you will be a less cruel master than the Baron?"
1285,,400,Gargoyles ,MtG - Homelands,Control ,"Fearsome creatures with bodies similar to gryphons and dark stony hides. These gargoyles are complicated mana constructs instead of true beings, leaving them tireless and without the need to eat or drink. They have sharp claws, can fly despite their stony nature, and are tough enough to be immune to fire and sword-blows. They are also somewhat empathic, able to easily discern individuals suffering mental instability, guilt, anger or sadness.

Serra gifted a great number of these to the city of Onella long ago, to guard against orc and goblin raids. In times of peace, these same gargoyles also make for an excellent police force, ceaseless in their quest to seek out wrongdoing. You have been granted a similar number of them, enough to guard an entire city and its surroundings. And these gargoyles follow whatever orders you give them, so you could use them for other purposes too. "
1286,,400,Summoning Spells,MtG - Homelands,Control ,"Spells of summoning and binding have shaped much of Ulgrotha's history. Many of the races got their start by being displaced to here, others were wiped out as they were torn away from their homes, and Feroz' Ban was raised specifically to shield the world from these abuses. Few still remember the existence of these spells today, but the wizards of the floating isle were taught enough for them to learn and rediscover them for themselves. Whether you leaped ahead of these wizards’ research or were taught by a passing planeswalker, you are quite skilled in the use of summoning spells and enslavement curses both.

Combining these together, you will be able to pull something or someone you are familiar with through the aether, and force them to fight by your side. While summoning simple things or creatures is pretty easy for you now, this gets more costly in terms of mana if you try to call greater beings, or ones you are less familiar with. Similarly, more powerful or more willful creatures may prove more of a challenge to control with binding magic. Of course, there’s always the option of simply summoning creatures already loyal to you."
1287,,400,In One Name,MtG - Shandalar,Control ,"White mana draws from order and virtue, and those who master it stand as part of a perfect, absolute hierarchy. Any being you summon through magic, be it using the spells found in Shandalar or through other methods, is guaranteed to come into being or arrive such that they are unfailingly loyal to you. No magical spells will wrest control of them away from you, no treachery or trickery will befall you unless you blatantly act such to deserve it, and even the most righteous and authoritative lords will find their commands unheeded by those under your command if they conflict with your own, stated, wishes."
1288,,400,Sword of Light and Shadow,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control ,"Larger than any of the other blades, this weapon glows with an unearthly darkness, contrasted by divine light. Defeating foes with it seems to imbue their bodies with a fraction of the shadow, allowing the wielder to spend some of their energy to raise them as obedient dead- and the divine light seems to shield the user as they cleave through enemies, keeping their wounds from reopening or bleeding,no matter how dire. It seems to grow to its true strength when facing divine or infernal beasts-or what used to be that way."
1289,,400,Sword of Body and Mind,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control ,"A sword with a thick guard and horns sprouting from beneath the sides of the blade, a blue and green sheen illuminating its split blade. Whenever a foe is struck, the green glow flows into the air, forming ghostly wolves that follow your orders until the battle is over, before promptly vanishing, each bite breaking the enemy's concentration, as if eating the ideas right out of their mind. It seems to be even more powerful when used against schemers and great beasts."
1290,,400,Symbiotic Organism,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control ,"Like Sheoldred, you have come into possession of a mindless, neural-linked body you can fit yourself into and control as an extension of your own- be it a spider-like lower body like hers, a sort of exoskeleton, or perhaps something else, it really improves your mobility in treacherous terrain, allowing you to effortlessly navigate through the most dangerous parts of New Phyrexia without having to worry about sinking deep into the ground…"
1291,,400,Pact Of Ancients,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control ,"The various Kami that reside within Jukai sit at the center of a network of pacts, contracts, bargains, and deals almost as old as the Empire, and in some cases older than the forest itself. Most of these understandings are between the Kami and the various servants they have blessed with one power or another, but some are with each other as well - mutual defense pacts that have not seen use in hundreds of years, but are still very much active. What you have here are a series of truly ancient and all but faded scrolls that represent some of the favors that have been extracted from the Kami by their minders over the years. Specifically, upon opening the scrolls, reading a short chant, and offering a decent chunk of mana, you may call a number of decently powerful spirits to your aid for whatever you may require. Most of these spirits are little more than beatsticks, warriors who once served in life and continue to serve in death, meant to defend the forest from those who would see it cut down. Not all, however. The geothermal Kami is a favorite of most trainees, though they usually lack the authority to call upon it."
1292,,400,Kami in All Things ,MtG - Kamigawa,Control ,"As with the beings like the Unspeakable you have learned how to pass on a series of spells or rituals that facilitate instant communication between yourself and the users of these techniques. This ability also allows you to be instantly summoned, if you are willing to be summoned at the time, as well as allows you to have a strong knowledge of the inner nature of anyone who makes claim to worship you, to the point that any who invoke your godly blessing/curses will be as known to you as if you had observed them for a few months."
1293,,400,Summoning ,MtG - Kamigawa,Control ,"The art of Summoning can allow a mage to make a deal with the Kami, or other beings of spirit, so that they can be Summoned. In addition this magic can be used to Summon forth and command the Summoner’s lessers in a very timely manner, though to command someone or thing you must be of a stronger will and power to do so.

At its higher forms this even allows for one to simply create beings that the summoner is familiar with wholly from Mana, but this is draining to the average magic user, who find such things difficult without crutches like mana bonds. Beings Summoned this way are temporary creatures born of the Aether and usually don’t last more than a few hours outside the battlefield.

Boosted: Whilst Summoning from whole cloth is difficult, when this is taken with Jumper of Spirit and Flesh this magic becomes easy. You could power through a few summons before needing to tap into outside sources, and use less energy even then.

Boost Requires Jumper of Spirit and Flesh(MtG-Kamigawa)"
1294,,400,Elemental Golem ,MtG - Lorwyn,Control ,"At first glance this would have looked like a bare cliff face, a piece of the mountain like any other. But from a few steps back it was easy to see lines and fissures upon the surface of the stone. The lines forming shapes in the cliff face. Two legs, two arms, a head.

If you press a hand against the stone, the wall comes to life. The shape seen in the wall glowing with golden light, light that burned hotter still until it was purest white, white tinged - but only just - with blue. It would pull itself out of the cliff face like a sculpture popping out of the mold, except this sculpture was a walking chunk of the mountainside fifty feet tall.  

The stone giant's form is roughly simian - long arms and squat, with its head resembling nothing so much as six feet of stone column with a face, set with unblinking eyes that glow a silvery white. It has huge, toeless stone feet and mittlike hands the size of kithkin houses. The thing could cover half its height in a single stride, each step shaking the ground. 

And now it's yours, waiting for you to wake and command it. It will serve you well as a massive living engine of destruction and perhaps a guardian. But aside from that, its simple mind and clumsy mittlike fists would be capable of little more than crude labour."
1295,,400,Cervin,MtG - Lorwyn,Control ,"The steed of choice for elves, the cervin resembles a long-legged deer. Sleek and elegant, with overlong limbs that placed the cervin's back anywhere from ten to fifteen feet off the
ground on a typical ride. Smooth foreheads gave way to the soft fuzzy antlers both male and female cervins sported. Their silky coats were a pale tapestry of woody brown and sunrise orange, and mature cervins sported white, catlike whiskers on their muzzles, lending their faces a noble air of wisdom and experience.

Their limber, stilt-like legs allowed them to negotiate the most treacherous woodland terrain without slowing their remarkable pace, the flexible set of limbs far stronger than they appeared. To an onlooker, a sprinting cervin navigating a large obstacle often resembled some strange insect or snake, not so much hurdling or climbing the impediment as flowing over it with its graceful movements.

Certain bloodlines and breeding stock are reserved for high-caste elves; anyone of a lower caste or tribe risks execution for so much as touching one of these rare and beautiful creatures. Accordingly, your own mount is as fine a specimen as might possibly be appropriate for your caste."
1296,,400,Moonsilver Spear,MtG - Innistrad,Control ,"A replica of Avacyn's spear, able to call a single angel of moderate power to your aid, once a day. They can only stay for a few minutes, and will not aid in doing evil. You may choose whether the same angel is summoned each time or a new one."
1297,,400,Kalad’s Phantoms ,Warbreaker,Control ,"One thousand ornate statues of soldiers, which are secretly a thousand Lifeless, animated bone armored in stone, with weapons and armor to match. Significantly faster, and far sturdier than regular Lifeless, as tireless and fearless as all their breed. A most fearsome army, that obeys whoever knows their custom command phrase, and is repaired or replaced every month."
1298,,400,CALL THE PACK ,Wolfwalkers,Control ,"When you howl, wolves all over the surrounding area drop what they’re doing and rush to your side. Wolves are generally far more likely to listen to your advice and commands."
1299,,400,Gist,Skulduggery Pleasant,Control ,"Allows you to summon a nigh-invulnerable ghostly demon version of yourself. This Gist is connected to your body by a ghostly umbilical cord. While terrifyingly powerful, this power is incredibly taxing to use, to the point that keeping your Gist out for several minutes is exhausting. Aside from the demands it places on your magical reserves, if your Gist remains out for too long, you’ll end up possessed, with the Gist gaining control of your body.

Boosted:  Gistlord: Your power has now risen beyond others of your kind, making you much more closely attuned with your Gist. Not only does this reduce the strain using your power places on your body by a dramatic margin, but it also all but negates the risk of your Gist possessing you due to extended use. The longer your Gist is active, the stronger it becomes, mutating to grow larger and better adapted for combat against your current foes, though the more monstrous it becomes, the greater the energy required to maintain it. With practice and training, this cost can be cut down, and you can eventually learn to summon multiple Gists at once.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
1300,,400,Memphis Lightning,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Control ,"There’s no lack of mighty, lumbering brutes in this world, but what good is overwhelming physical power if you’re so slow that you can’t even hit your foes in the first place? With this in mind, it seems you’ve undergone a process similar to Memphis, one of Barbarossa’s four Heavenly Generals, in which your body has been augmented by the power of the Dungeons. In particular, this augmentation has gifted you the ability to move at blistering speeds. Though you’re not any stronger than normal, you can run so fast that the ground cracks beneath your feet and your form appears to blur... if they can follow your movements at all. But it’s not just your running speed that’s enhanced, but the speed at which you can act and react too, letting you rain ten blows down on someone in the time it takes a skilled swordsman to make one. Without a doubt, you’re one of the fastest beings in the world, so quick that an adult Fanalis would struggle to keep up with you."
1301,,400,Air Fleet ,Magi: Alma Torran,Control ,"The magic of this world is far more advanced than that of the next, and little demonstrates this more than one area. In the main world of Magi, the best sort of Magic Tool they have for flight are flying carpets, and those are exceedingly rare. In Alma Torran? They have armadas of heavily-armed flying fortesses. Usually, only the Orthodox Church would have access to these, but it seems an exception has been made for you.

You now own a whole fleet of these arrowhead-shaped airships, numbering about a dozen in total, each larger than an aircraft carrier and appearing far more futuristic than something in this world should be. Aside from each being large enough to carry a small army and armed with cannons capable of firing off enormous blasts of fire and lightning. Not only that, but they’re also capable of emitting the same kind of mind-destroying waves as the Gunuds, able to turn those without strong wills caught within into mindless slaves, though the waves they emit are nowhere near as powerful or far-reaching. Be warned, though, that they’re not the sturdiest of things."
1302,,400,A Promise Unforgotten,Campione,Control ,"Geasses and contracts are curious things, not even the most powerful are free from their influence. While not an artifact by itself, this gift is still useful for those who value contacts over direct power. To put it simply, this is a favor owned by a powerful and resourceful God and lend to you by me, maybe you can exchange it for their assistance once or ask them for a powerful item in compensation. They will comply as long as it's in the realm of possibility for them to do it. I’ll give you one more each jump, leading to being of similar power and influence."
1303,,400,Killer Queen,Campione,Control ,"Once Pandora’s binding fades from the minds of the Divine Ancestors, there can be only one thought that crosses their mind. To reclaim their missing power. Thus far, there have been only mild successes, with most failing altogether or worse, coming down with a severe case of inbound Campione. Should you find something lost to you, sealed away, stolen, or something else altogether, you will find it far easier than it ought to be to either reclaim that missing power, or to steal something equal in value from another. It should also be noted that you also possess the skills at politics and backstabbing to gain assistance from other Divine Ancestors, and that your attempts are always more successful - and rewarding - than theirs. In fact, why don’t you go ahead and calculate the interest on this forced loan? Because that too will be yours in time. In short? The farther you fall, the farther you rise."
1304,,400,Heroic Avatar,Fate/Extella,Control ,"Doing things right might be best done by yourself but you won’t always be able to get out there in the field. If like a certain Titan, you’re bound up in a prison cave and prevented from directly interacting with the world, what is there to do? Somehow, you’re able to create an avatar to act for you regardless of how you’ve been bound or prevented from acting. A Heroic Spirit who you can act through, like a lesser body, which possesses only a small fraction of your overall power. You can freely perceive through and control them, even if normally restrained from movement or sensory input. More power can temporarily be channeled to your avatar but it risks damaging the fragment of your being to do so. There is no limit on range and, with a great deal of practice, you may even learn to create more than one and control them simultaneously. "
1305,,400,Servant,Fate/Extra CCC,Control ,"What is a Master without a Servant? As you might expect, you now have a Servant at your command, a spirit of legend with great power. Well, there are differences in power between Servants, but it’s nothing that can’t be surmounted with the right strategy. You may build yourself a custom Servant by using existing Servant matrixes as a guide, or simply pick any canon ‘standard’ Servant in the Fate franchise. No gods or full Heroic Spirits, simple Servants, as they are supposed to be.

If you dislike this restriction, for a payment of 400cp you may choose a ‘non-standard’ Servant. Perhaps you’ve somehow made a contract with a legend in the flesh who happened to be sleeping on the far side of the Moon, or maybe you’ve caught the eye of a goddess who decided to manifest at your side. You may pick Divine Spirits with this option, maybe a certain vampire, or perhaps even Foreigners, whatever you pick, they’ll be restricted to the power of a less extraordinary Servant, but should you have the means, you’ll be able to unlock their Origin for great power. There’s nothing stopping you from unlocking their potential by other means, of course, but their restrictions are quite tight, and it would take quite a powerful ritual to do so. Gotta pay some lip service to playing fair, right?

Either way, you may choose to have some pre-existing relationship with your Servant, a holdover from the Holy Grail War of the near side of the Moon Cell that was stopped in its tracks. Maybe you would like romance, friendship, or perhaps your Servant doesn’t really like you all that much. It’s your decision what kind of relationship you had with your Servant, and it’s up to you to maintain that relationship, but your Servant is no stranger to you, and neither are you to them.

Requires Command Seals"
1306,,400,Cyber Creation,Fate/Extra,Control ,"A strange skill you picked up here, one that allows you to create simple enemies out of your energy. Using this, you'll be able to create low level creatures that serve you loyally, mooks and bots if you will, and can set them simple orders such as guarding a place or attacking an enemy. The more you create and the stronger they are, the bigger the drain will become on you. An ordinary human would make a dozen or so at most, each with the power of a hunting dog. Those with more power could of course, create more bots and stronger ones at that. "
1307,,400,Magic Rider,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"You’ll never fight alone if you take your best friend into battle. That best friend being the dread
Cerberus isn’t anyone’s business but your own, right up until it eats everyone else. You’re a rider of
beasts almost without peer, taking your skill to the level of outright magic. You have supernatural
skills in riding anything, from things that are actually ridden like horses and monsters, to only
vaguely related vehicles, like riding a enormous sailing ship or a catapulted rock. You can make that
horse gallop along walls or across the water and skim that sailing ship across the waves like a
skipping stone.

When you really put in some effort, you’ll let your mount accomplish supernatural feats and
enhance them to magical levels in the process, like enabling your sailing ship to fire dozens of
homing anchors at the enemy like harpoons, regardless of if the ship originally had that ability. You
can’t make your mounts do anything, it does have to be somewhat related to the scope and level of
the ride, but most people that see you take flight in a rowboat are going to accuse you of being a
witch at least. To help out with your skill in using the mounts, you’ll find you’re rather superb at
actually taming animals and beasts, even magical ones aren’t too hard for you to teach once you’ve
beaten them, and in learning to properly control new vehicles that don’t exist here, like the vehicles
of the modern world."
1308,,400,Mirror Evil,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Control ,"As Mara is to Kama, you too have a corrupted mirror. A Demon to your God, a Bodhissatva to your
Demon. This is a new being that positions itself as an opposite to you, like a new version of you that
takes on many mirrored traits and abilities. Where you seek to and are able to corrupt, they can
purify and redeem. Where you burn with holy fire, they mutilate with the frost of the hells. But
despite taking an opposing mirror to yourself, they remain on your side. A part of you, as much as
your left hand is connect to your right hand, and they seek to aid you and your goals through their
own methods. Remaining a part of you and growing as you do, they can act as a second aspect of
your body or split off to help you from a distance in their own form. Talking to them can often reveal
aspects of yourself you would not normally acknowledge, helping to understand yourself better. Since you act as two halves to the same whole, you each survive with the presence of the other, making it only possible to die if both of you are killed. Else one will return in time from the body of
the other. "
1309,,400,Flag of Sincerity,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"A flag decorated with a symbol of your organisation, faith or just something that shows the bond
between you and your allies. When raised up, it allows you to summon phantasmal copies of those
who consider themselves your allies to fight alongside you. Their combat ability is significantly
reduced and they will often lack their most potent abilities or items but up to two hundred
comrades can appear through the flag at a time, remaining for several hours before vanishing. Only
those who would be willing to fight and die alongside you in your current goal will answer. A strange
effect of the flag is that those summoned are influenced by your perceptions of them, altering the
personalities and appearances of the illusory warriors to fit your perspective. Someone you find
intimidating could grow taller and broader than they are in real life, while a warrior you see as brutal
might now carry a serrated sword."
1310,,400,Youkai Clan,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"Not all youkai live alone, as much of their kind come to spend their lives. Some still gather in clans like the humans, which results in much the same situation, of youkai nobility. You yourself are a particularly highly regarded member of one such clan of youkai. Much respect and deference is accorded across the supernatural community and especially others of your own race. But more useful is the large retinue of your own kind that you have, personally loyal servants one and all. They number eight hundred and eight in total. Eight hundred and three of these servants are only around as strong as an adult human, albeit with a wide variety of skills and functions. Messengers, household servants such as maids or cooks, more than enough to leave any royal happy. Four of these servants are quite powerful members of your species, enough to pose a problem for powerful demon hunters or Oni. Primarily warriors, like a royal guard of sorts. The last is a mighty youkai and right hand man, someone who could at least stall one of the Three Great Youkai for a few minutes and even leave a few wounds. These family familiars can be summoned at will and will serve loyally if you treat them well, though they are not slaves. You may bring this clan forward as companions, followers or find a new family of similar description in other worlds. "
1311,,400,Katou Sensei,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"An advanced combat doll, of the same make and potentially even same appearance as Katou Danzou. A highly capable warrior and assassin, this doll is a loyal servant to your cause. But in truth, her real
value is not in her physical form but the exhaustive database of martial, ninja and even some related
magi techniques that have been uploaded to her mind. Centuries of data and teachings on these
subjects, enough to bring even a complete amateur to the level of a master with enough time spent. The doll is an exceptional teacher, able to teach in both theoretical and practical terms to any of her
students. Oddly enough, the doll prefers to wear glasses while teaching too. In future worlds, similar
information can be found in the doll’s database on local martial and ninja techniques, excluding
unique or particularly hard to find information. "
1312,,400,Lord of the Hunt,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"Perhaps because of the legend you have already created, you’ve earned the right to make a special
call into the wilds. While the act is heavily draining on you to maintain, you may summon the Wild
Hunt to sail behind you in battle for a time.

Manifesting as a ghostly legion of warriors on land or sea, it is made up of many fairies, spirits of
knights and warriors who could not reach heaven or hell and led by the faint ghosts of great figures, perhaps a glimpse of Arthur, Odin or Cain might be present, though far from their full glory. The
ghostly warriors are not limited by the bonds of the earth, able to fly and rain destruction without
regard for ammunition, unleashing a horde of violent fae against the target. The greater your wealth
at the current time of calling on the Wild Hunt, the more numerous and more impressive those who
answer will be. A wealthy pirate lord could summon dozens of spectral ships and many warriors of
note to crew them but hoarding even greater resources could see those weak ghosts of Arthur or
Odin become closer and closer to the originals, more ships joining you or even legions of flying fairy
knights charging alongside. The wealth may even allow for an extended presence of the Hunt. It’s
easy to get caught up in their wake though, as the Wild Hunt will eagerly take you along in their
battles against your enemies. No import."
1313,,400,Legend of the Seven Seas,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Control ,"A ship even the greatest of captains would be proud to have and who most others greedily lust over
the idea of possessing. A sea vessel of size and quality to surpass anything else that sailed the seas in
these times of piracy, it holds forty mighty cannons of unnatural power and travels on land and
through the sky as easily as it does the sea, requiring only for a crew member to supply it power. The
ship has room and facilities for far more crew than it would be able to hold from the outside. The
ship is truly blessed by the sea and skies, unhindered by the elements save for when the very divine
itself interferes, even then holding resistance against them.

Rather than a crew of flesh and blood, spirits will manifest to crew the ship. Immortal veterans of
many past adventures, they continually reform from your magical energy if slain, an undying crew to
plunder other ships with. The ship’s quality and the power of it’s weapons and ghostly crew
increases with the collective strength of yourself and any outside crew members you bring aboard
who agree to become part of the crew. The spirits grow stronger, the cannons hit harder and the
ship sails ever faster. As the true master of the vessel, you can also manifest it or parts of it wherever
you are, appearing to be animated by your will."
1314,,400,Big Sister,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Control,"You encountered something strange, something some might call of the third kind. When out
traveling through the countryside of France, you happened on a glowing monolith. Designed in a
way unlike any architecture you had seen in France till now, you approached. From the structure
appeared a young girl with strange features. White hair, dark brown skin and dark red eyes. Another
man might have shown fear to such features but something drove you to give her shelter. The girl
grew affectionate towards you and wishes to accompany you for a time. She is quiet but terribly
powerful and has a great deal of knowledge, even if seldom shared. Her purpose here is unknown, though you feel that she does not have hostile intentions. Not in this time period."
1315,,400,Merry Men,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"Your own band of merry men, fighting against oppression or just fighting for more shiny gold. You’ve got two options to choose from to see how this new band of 35 loyal, trained and powerful fighters you have manifests. The first is as a small contingent of Apache warriors, extraordinary hunters, warriors and shamans one and all. Each one could certainly take down a hundred normal men without a sweat and even kill minor supernatural threats on their own. Working together, they could even act as a powerful shaman, though not quite to the level of the 400CP perk of the Folk Hero line. 

The second choice is to have a band of outlaws, criminals and never-do-wells. They don’t have any magic or strange mystic bullshit but they’re one and all brilliant in a brawl or a shoot-out. You could take on a small army and win with just these men or set up a racket stretching across half the country. They’re all armed with gun and horse but what makes each man special is that they all have a unique skill taken to near supernatural levels. One man can pick even magical locks with pure skill, another can take down a fortress with three sticks of dynamite, another can follow week old tracks through a hurricane. "
1316,,400,Strange Mud,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Control ,"A big barrel of black mud, the really stinky sort, that seems to refill every morning. Sometimes it
makes nasty faces at you but it doesn’t actually seem bad to touch. Not really like the mud at all, if
you know what it normally is. Maybe it’s got a specific function? Mix it with some food from a
certain country and you’ll definitely find out what that is. Doing that thing, mixing it with country- specific food, results in the creation of a heroic spirit coming from that country, like a hero or villain
or creature of note. They’re fairly strong, but far from being on the level of a great spirit or shaman
master or really too far beyond what a strong magus could do. They’re still pretty cool, given just
how wide and varied heroic spirits can be even when limited. They’ll follow your lead for the most
part but there can be troubles, since they’re a little weird when summoned this way. Very weird in
fact and often fairly psychotic and murderous, even excluding other various eccentricities. They look
a little strange too, more cartoon-like then they should in reality. Thankfully, they don’t last long, so
even if you accidentally cause them to go on a murderous rampage, they’ll turn back into mud after
a few days. At least they won’t be rampaging at you though, right? Also if you really want, you can
just throw the mud at people and unless they’re pretty badass when it comes to resisting nasty shit
in their minds, they won’t be having a fun time."
1317,,400,Feathers of God,Angel Notes,Control ,"You didn’t bring any other race with you when you travelled across space to come and cleanse Gaia
of the filth on her corpse’s skin. You had no need, given you carry an army with you wherever you go. You are able to create tiny, comparatively, and weak, comparatively, variations of whatever kind of
being you are, to an extent. At their very weakest, they would simply be ordinary humanoid beings, similar to humans, and be produced at a rate of up to a few dozen every day. Loyal, willing to die for
you but not terribly intelligent. That’s what something the size and strength of a human could do. A
great being like yourself, an Aristoteles, could produce millions to billions of alien beings each day
and have each be capable of slaughtering modern military units en-masse, though they remain
fodder compared to the powerful A Rays and Knights. The larger and stronger you get, the stronger,
larger and more numerous these fragments of you will become."
1318,,400,Students,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Control,"A group of six young and bright students that count as a single, collective companion. They’re fiercely loyal to you and more than willing to follow you on your adventures."
1319,,400,Servant ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Control,"You receive 1000 SP to spend on the Fate Servant Supplement, to build a Tier One servant. If you choose Iskandar, then you get Waver Velvet for free, and they share one companion slot."
1320,,400,An Unlucky One,Tsukihime,Control,"Is it possible for bad luck to circle back around into good luck? It’s hard to say, because this high school student doesn’t seem to get any sort of respect or friends - they’re incredibly clumsy, awkward, and have a difficult time talking to people. They do mean well, though, and have decided to follow you around in hopes of their luck somehow improving. Strangely, their luck seems to circle back around to ‘extremely’ useful as they quickly adapt to any powers or form you give them, giving them the benefits of ‘Exceptional And Lucky’, and they usually work behind the scenes to benefit you, even if their adventures sound outlandish and unlikely through ‘The Missing Heroine’s Route.’

For an extra 200 undiscounted points...they died! Except now they’re a Dead Apostle, with all the benefits thereof and very few of the drawbacks, as they have also gained the benefits of ‘Beyond Bane’. They don’t really like being a vampire, though. Isn’t it sad?"
1321,,400,A Poor Nerd,Tsukihime,Control,"An Agent of Atlas, the hand of justice, the slayer of evil...! They are! A hopeless nerd. An Alchemist from Atlas, with all the benefits thereof as they have training in both ‘Thought Acceleration’ and ‘Precision and Memory’, and have arrived to investigate the recent vampiric activity in Misaki. But really, that was the excuse. They actually have no idea or interest in things like Dead Apostles or even the looming threat of TATARI - they just wanted to get out of the Academy and waste time, maybe play some video games. They’re a bit obsessed with emerging pop culture, particularly anime, and tend to act like the hero/heroine of an action movie playing out in their minds, giving them the benefits of ‘Adorkable’. They’ve decided to follow you around and act as though you’re the ‘sidekick’ (or ‘buddy’, if they’re not delusional enough to believe you’re below them), also happily expositing in facts related to the world you’re in if you’re unfamiliar with the supernatural, though these lectures tend to devolve into useless trivia pretty quick.

For an extra undiscounted 200, their obsessions have channeled somewhat into their job - they’ve started making artifacts and items that bear more than a passing resemblance to what they watch on TV. They have the benefits of ‘Artificer’ and have particularly specialized in reverse-engineering magical items and objects you encounter in future worlds, all while adding an incredibly garish look to them that would make a rainbow look tame in comparison. They also possess ‘Pure Eyes of Fate’, which they often use to pull ‘that one trick’ of finishing someone else’s sentence for them. Whatever that means."
1322,,400,A Lonely Stare,Tsukihime,Control,"The heir or heiress to a wealthy family, they’re something of a grouch who usually keeps to themselves, being used to surrounded by other wealthy family members and not much in the way of social interaction, giving them the benefits of ‘Stop Being Stupid’. For whatever reason, they refuse to leave you alone, often making excuses like ‘SOMEONE needs to take care of an idiot like you’ or just making condescending insults in general...but beneath that, they care deeply about you, shown as they receive the benefits of ‘In My Heart’ and desperately want to keep you close, giving them a lesser version of ‘Don’t Leave Me’ that won’t affect companions or someone you have a sincere interest in, instead being focused on keeping away corruptive or deceptive influences that genuinely mean you harm. Though they won’t be happy about the former, either.

For an extra undiscounted 200, it turns out the reason they’re so protective of you is that they suffered a similar fate as the Tohno family, and every one of their siblings were killed for not ‘making the cut’ of their bloodline...with the exception of themselves and possibly you, if you are related by blood. They’ve sworn to protect you and desperately want to keep you close, willing to do just about anything in your name if it means you’ll still be there for them. Woe onto anyone who tries to get between them and you, for their have the benefits of ‘Crimson Red Vermillion’ and ‘Life Thief’, as well as ‘Mystic Eyes of Flame’. You won’t let them down, right?"
1323,,400,A Pious Soul ,Tsukihime,Control,"One day, someone wearing the garb of a priest (or a nun) had collapsed in front of your doorway. Before you could actually check if they were dead or not, their hand grabbed at you and they tearfully looked up at you, begging for something savory to eat. Reluctantly nourishing this stranger (or perhaps someone else did), they decided they were in your debt and swore themselves to your service. They’re a bit of a goofball and an airhead, but are good at looking wise when the moment counts, giving them the benefits of ‘Senpai’. They also have a talent for winning over others with just some well-placed banter, giving them the benefits of ‘Strange Friendship’. They received special training from the Holy Church itself, giving them a mean throwing arm with the ‘Iron Plate Effect’.

For an extra undiscounted 200, turns out they did die at your doorstep! Someone had killed them, but their mind somehow failed to process that they had died, as if Gaia itself couldn’t understand how airheaded this person was. They have the benefits of ‘Beautiful Blood’, meaning no matter how badly they’re hurt or their body is ‘killed’, they come back good as new moments later and don’t have any memory of the event! Except, that’s a lie. Though they continue to act stupid and oblivious, they know this means they will outlive everyone they know and love, and the Holy Church will happily exploit their immortality. Without solace in either faith or friends, they turned to you...to either share an immortal lifetime with so they won’t be alone, or to find a way to let themselves finally die."
1324,,400,A Sleepy Troublemaker ,Tsukihime,Control,"They just have no end of trouble. This is a normal high school student, for the most part - except they just want to sit back and enjoy life at their own stride. That’s hard to do when they have scores of admirers following them every day, like their lovelife had some kind of ‘switch’ permanently stuck in the on position, giving them the ‘benefits’ of the perk ‘Tohno Gland’. You are apparently the only person immune to their charms, and as such they appreciate your company - though they’re usually laid back and try to avoid trouble as much as possible, they have a vicious streak a mile wide when it comes to protecting you. Maybe that’s how they see it as returning the favor? They have the benefits of ‘Instinct’ and ‘Model Student’. When asked how they learned all of this, they just shrug and avoid the question.

For an extra undiscounted 200...well, that explains that. This ‘ordinary person’ is a missing member of the now-extinct Nanaya family, and that vicious streak was a powerful urge to kill anything supernatural around them. They only recently uncovered their memories and had no idea why they felt so violent and distrustful of everyone around them, but you were the sole exception to these murderous instincts, no matter whether you yourself fit the bill or not. They feel calmed by your presence, and are now undeniably loyal to you - enough that they’re willing to kill for you, should you ask. They have the benefits of ‘Nanaya’ and ‘False Eyes of Death Perception.’"
1325,,400,A Stray Cat ,Tsukihime,Control,"Another one? It looks like a familiar, namely one made from a fusion of a cat and a human. They’re capable of speech and understanding, though they have all the behavioral mannerisms of their components - they’re fickle, moody, and tend to ignore you most of the time until they’re convinced you’re ignoring them, then they won’t leave you alone and become both affectionate and curious. Despite that, they’re attached enough to you that they’re loyal and will help you when you need it. You could even make them your own familiar, if you really wanted. They come with the perks ‘Dream Manipulation’, ‘Starmine and Starbow’, and ‘True to Myself’.

For an extra undiscounted 200...well, apparently there was a litter instead of just one. There are four other cat familiars of various personalities, though they all share a certain mix of immaturity and fickle behavior, along with affection for you. How that affection manifests is up to you, but they all come with color-coordinated outfits and appearances. Are they trying to form a team? When working together in concert, they are considered to have the benefits of ‘High Speed Magus’ as they coordinate each other’s magecraft and abilities. They all share one companion slot, unless you imported pre-existing companions into this role."
1326,,400,Lord of the Castle ,Tsukihime,Control,"Entertainment is the bread and butter of a Dead Apostle’s existence, and there are few things more entertaining than making an army of Dead that do your bidding while you comfortable sip from a wine glass in some far-off castle...or an abandoned building, whatever works for you. Dead Apostles already possess the ability to create things like The Dead or control animal familiars using their blood, even possessing them directly as an extension of their will and receiving sustenance from all they consume. Now, that extends to all things you create by your own hands - any undead or artificial being you create is incapable of disobeying or turning against you, you possess full awareness of their thoughts and an ability to control their minds with a simple act of will, and all things they consume or absorb are sent directly to you, even if you were miles away during the act. In case you’d rather not starve them, you may decide how much you take from them at will, whether some or all or none of what they devour. Blood, meat, magical energy - whatever they devour, the spoils are given as tithe to the true Lord of the Castle.
"
1327,,400,Ether Lite ,Tsukihime,Control,"A wire-like substance meant to be used as a fake nervous system but can also be used as an extremely sharp, ridiculously long whip. If attached to another they can be used like a puppet and can read their thoughts as it manipulates their nerves. You may also release the limiter in someone’s brain, giving them a temporary massive boost to their physical abilities, after which they collapse, unable to move for a few hours. A true master can even copy or manipulate other memories with this technique. It can be used to replace damaged or destroyed nerves. An Alchemist with Memory and Partition receives this item for free.
"
1328,,400,Fujo Blood ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"The arts passed down through the Fujo clan of Demon Hunters, a rare and mostly faded family, have awakened within you. Likely the result of a distant ancestor if you’re not a clan member, it has several effects on your body and spirit. The first is an enhanced life-force, making it possible for you to survive wounds and illnesses that would kill normal humans quite quickly. Despite taking the same wounds, your body is unnaturally enduring. The second is an enormous natural talent for magecraft relating to the channeling and controlling of spirits, not enough to match a Risen Legend but enough to become quite well known should you be trained. More importantly, that talent is the basis of the core power of the Fujo. ESP, or the projection of their spirit from their bodies. Leaving your physical form resting behind you, you can move as a spirit in the world, your power dictated by your magical energy. Possessing and controlling humans directly becomes far easier and you already know how to bind the spirits of the recently dead to your service while in this form. More spiritual powers may appear with practice and power, though even now you’re able to rapidly cross all of the city while flying along as a ghost.


"
1329,,400,Sealed Demon ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A sealed case in your possession, such as a suitcase or video projector. Within is a potent combat familiar, the sort of creature that can tear through a whole gangs of thugs in seconds or pose a threat to a fairly powerful Magus, especially if it has the advantage of surprise. The primary example to use, in case you want to design a custom creature, is the sealed demons that Touko uses for combat due to her own degrading magic power. You might have a copy of her familiars, a freaky battle homunculus, a stitched together frankenstein beast or something less physical, like a bound fairy or a simulacrum made of living lightning. Whatever your familiar is, it’s oddly affectionate with you and acts like a loyal dog, puppy like towards your friends and vicious to enemies. If it gets hurt, just seal the case again and you’ll find it good as new in a few days time.
"
1330,,400,Ghoul Stone Velvet Bag ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Control,"The strange shop you’ve gotten all your toys from appeared to have this in a hidden section, but, it looks like you finally got it. This small bag, like one used to hold marbles, has a magical seal on the front. When you look inside, you can see a series of ashy stones...By throwing and shattering one against the ground, a loyal Gargoyle-like beast is created! These are “Ghouls”, creatures of despair that serve powerful Phantoms...however this bag gives you ownership of the Ghouls created from the stones inside the bag. The Bag itself can convert valuable gems into Ghoul Stones, at the very least they must be a precious stone to be turned. These ghouls are hardy warriors, resistant to small arms fire and explosions with only magic and supernatural energy guaranteeing easy defeat. You start with 30 Ghoul stones in the bag, which should let you repel many threats in this world!
"
1331,,400,Scapegoat ,Cultist Simulator,Control,"What’s the point of having followers if you alone have to bear a burden? Anytime you are forced to inflict harm on yourself or others in the name of a cause, a ritual, or a power, you may opt to inflict this harm unto someone or something else instead, effectively allowing you to substitute the target of your sacrifice with something of an equivalent value. This can be used to spare your assistant in favor of destroying a tool, maybe you wish to spare the tool in favor of a temporary influence, regardless, this perk will ensure that the proceedings complete without a hitch.
"
1332,,400,Dream​ ​Mirror​ ​Extraction​ ​,Sailor Moon,Control,"Dream Mirrors are part of a person’s soul, separate from their Star Seed. If a Star Seed is someone’s body and power, a Dream Mirror is their identity, creativity, and their desires for the future. A Dream Mirror carries much power for those who know how to turn it into energy, and you have the knowledge to extract a dream mirror.

Forcibly chaining someone to a magically appearing slab of stone, you shoot a blast at their heart, forcing out a dream mirror. You may gaze into the dream mirror by sticking your head into it, but this gives immense pain to the person. You’ll get a complete look at who they are and what their dreams are like. You could manipulate a person and find their emotional weaknesses with this sort of information, and stealing their dream mirror can turn them into an emotionless, drivenless husk of an empty vessel. They won’t die instantly, but they’ll slowly wither away as they neglect themselves.

You can also force out any entity sealed in someone or possessing them with this power, as the extraction process also forces beings out of the person.
"
1333,,400,Sealing​ ​Sword​ ​,Sailor Moon,Control,"On this jet black sword lies an old inscription “As the glory of the moon - shines bright and dispels shadows, so too may the one pierced with this sword become banished into a deep sleep.” Indeed, the sword is capable of sealing those sufficiently weakened who are pierced by it after the user chants this phrase. Upon sealage, the target will enter a deep sleep. It will take powerful magic to awaken them, and time will eventually weather away at the spell."
1334,,400,Summon and Bind​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"You’re a master of working with spirits and elementals. Summon them, bind them, use them to murderize your opponents, whatever. You can cast summons in a tenth of the time as anyone else, and are able to bind them almost without risk.
"
1335,,400,Reliquary​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"You should throw this away. Right now. Just... forget you ever had it, okay? No? Well, your choice. This is a demon’s reliquary, containing a bound succubus or incubus. Yes, they are bound to obey your orders. No, that will not make them even the slightest bit less dangerous. A single one showing up in a city is cause for an immediate panic, because they’ve taken down entire nations, alone. Not through raw power, but simply out of sheer, manipulative ability. Of course, if you don’t have a city that you want to take down, you could always have a reliquary without a succubus bound in it. Yes, you should do that.
"
1336,,400,Containment System​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"A containment system built to hold any demon short of an Archdemon, it will somehow fold into a carriable little box. Don’t ask. On the odd side, this is actually secure enough to dodge charges on carelessness while demon summoning, which is such a common event that the authorities practically take it for granted that they can charge you with it.
"
1337,,400,Bindings ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Control,"Do you want to keep someone from hurting themselves?​ Whether it’s ribbons, ropes, or chains, you are able to summon extremely tight and durable bindings from thin air. These are strong enough to completely restrain an unprepared Magical Girl and possibly even act as crowd control for a Wraith if used carefully. They need some energy to maintain, but the cost is fairly small.
"
1338,,400,Pet Stardust ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Control,"H...how did you get this? Why is it so docile and making tricks, like rolling over? And it’s...coming up close and “staring” at you (It doesn’t have eyes but you KNOW it’s looking at you), like it’s expecting pets? This is not the giant Vertexes you typically fight, but rather one of the many (still pretty big) white “cells” that combine to form the bodies of the Vertexes, called Stardust. By itself it can’t fuse with the other stardust, and you just cannot purchase enough for them to fuse into a typical giant Vertex the Heroes fight.

But still...that’s a monster that’s basically immune to stuff that isn’t supernatural/magical/divine/powered by ki in nature, and can tear through buildings like nothing with its giant mouth. And it’s completely docile around humans. It only listens to you and not the divine beings that would command its race. Surely that’s a good pet?

You’ll have to explain to the Taisha why you have this thing or keep it hidden. You’ll probably have to have a lot of funny little shenanigans. Stardusts do not need food, but they do like eating. They don’t have any waste products, so you don’t need to worry about stardust poop.
"
1339,,400,Tomb Swarm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"In the desert, not just the bodies of humans were reanimated by Nagash’s spell gone awry. The countless dead animals were returned to an undead state as well, a vast, invisible army of skeletal scorpions, scarabs, spiders and worms that crawl in great swarms to devour any flesh they can find. They seem drawn to you, perhaps the vast energy within your being soothes them? No matter where you are, a swarm of these ferocious bone insects and small animals can quickly gather to you and attack any of your foes, distracting and dealing countless small wounds. The swarm numbers are great enough that it could cover you completely and can travel at quite surprising speeds. An enterprising guardian could use them to travel.
"
1340,,400,Sealing ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Control,You have gained knowledge of how to seal knowledge and mystical abilities away. The target must either be willing or unconscious and extreme stress may awaken what you have locked away.

When activated it will cause any targets within a hundred metres to be affected with a gravitational force that will plunge them to the ground. It is not physical in nature but rather an attack of conceptual nature able to break through other magical defences. It can be activated selectively to allow avoiding it effecting allies. The force is powerful enough to leave those with strength greater than the strongest of mundane humanity by over forty times unable to move. Curiously its existence is a mystery to even Gilgamesh, the hero who owns all the treasures of the world."
1342,,400,In The Green Glades ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"The bond you have with the lady has linked you to the very land of Bretonnia itself. All the plants and animals of this country, and indeed most forms of genuine nature elsewhere, recognise you as one of their own and love you for it. You’ll never be harmed by a normal animal, even at the urging of its master, and often you’ll find yourself assisted by them. Animals will leap to your defence if they notice you in danger, provide you shelter in their own dens on stormy nights and even share their catches with you if you ask. This close connection with nature has also improved your spell casting in such places, bolstering your magic with added vigour and strength.
"
1343,,400,They Fey Must Be Fairies ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"The religion of Bretonnia is a powerful tool for the servants of the Lady to control and direct their ‘pet’ nation. The Elven act of inserting themselves into the mythos of this country has allowed them so much influence and whilst they may not have intended for you to do so, you learnt from their examples. You have an incredibly easy time inserting yourself into the religion of whatever location you are in, making yourself out to be a living saint or goddess and actually getting believers to believe you, as well as intensifying the fervour with which they believe in you over time. More sceptical people or widespread religions will be difficult, a lone and regular Damsel might only be able to take control of the religion of a few nearby villages. But, as your magical power grows, so too will the extent of this influence. Becoming a wizard on the level of the Fey Enchantress may let you enthral the religion of an entire country with just a few years work.

1344,,400,The Verdant Heart ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Control,"A pulsing, mossy stone with magical powers. The stone softly glows in the presence of plant life and at the command of its holder, can cause plants to rapidly grow and to move as the wielder wills. Decades of growth may be caused in just seconds and the plants can move in ways normally impossible to attack foes or defend the user of the Heart. The plants grown this way will count as having naturally done so and will continue to function normally afterwards.

1345,,400,Summoning Specialist ,Lyrical Nanoha,Control,"While you may be used to fighting on your own, doing EVERYTHING by yourself is a good way to get beaten up or killed. Luckily, you have some friends who can help you with this - namely, summons. By forming a bond or a pact with a willing magical being, you may summon that being forth and fight or work alongside them. You have a particular talent with this, letting you summon magical beings from this world and others so long as said connection exists and is established, generally being appropriate for what world you’re in. This also gives you a talent for transportation magic, letting you teleport items and people to you so long as you have some way to connect to them. Good for surprise parties!"
1346,,400,Noisemon ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Control,"Do you have too many summons and not enough time or capacity to summon them all? Well, with the power of Alchemy, it's possible to compress a summon or other creation into a small, crystalline cube using a simple process, essentially casting the summon in advance. When broken, the summon is released under the holder's control and will last for as long as it normally does or as long as it was charged beforehand with no cost to the user. If you’re willing to put together a really big crystal, you could even do this with much larger things, like say, a modified Russian battleship.

1347,,400,Insane Keyword Logic ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Control,"We’ll be honest with you, about ninety percent of alchemy is just cosmic bullshit that nobody actually understands. Most Alchemists just make it up as they go along, and tend to get varying levels of benefits from it. Everything you do tends to have a random extra benefit attached to it – you could make an anime based on real life events and it’ll actually work as a cover-up or create LiNKER that somehow also works as mind control. Alternatively, you may also choose to impose a random penalty on equipment you make, with a corresponding increase in power. Don’t ask us to explain how it works because we have no idea, and if we’re honest- neither do you.
"
1348,,400,The Miko’s Art ,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"Times have changed, and with it, norms have also changed. The Art of Mikos, once commonplace in this land, have now become a form of witchcraft that is no longer considered a norm. Still, it’s a skill that might be useful for you when it comes to helping another. The art itself might not be commonplace anymore, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t spirits that plague people from time to time.

As a Miko, one of your specialities lies in purging out these spirits, driving out the negative emotions dwelling inside a person. However, when it comes to wandering spirits and restless ghosts, you can also demonstrate a capacity to guide them into willing bodies and temporarily give them more than just a spectral form. If it is absolutely necessary – you can even form sacred boundaries to ward spirits away.
"
1349,,400,Release a Youkai to Stop a Youkai ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a good grasp at the old art of summoning a bigger threat to deal with a minor one. This will not backfire on you personally, and though whatever it was you released might go rampage elsewhere somehow events will conspire to prevent you coming into risk from your very bad idea. Fortunately, the bigger threat you released will simply overlook you and go rampage somewhere else. Unless you deliberately provoke it, but why would you do that?
"
1350,,400,Flame of Madness ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a mysterious stick with an ever-burning flame atop it. With this flame, you could easily send lifeforce out of control, sending people berserk as they act on every impulse they ever have, and even making localised changes to the seasons themselves. These effects rarely last longer than a single hour per application, though this is plenty of time to cause all kinds of trouble. You are naturally immune to this effect, as are anyone else you choose not to affect, so you need not worry about going crazy just carrying it around.
"
1351,,400,Komainu ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a komainu, a lion-dog statue that watches menacingly over wherever you wish to put it. When you need it, perhaps when trespassers try to break in, it will spring to life (and naturally, turn into a cute girl) to defend you. While in statue form, it’s semi-aware and can remember things such as who looked after the statue when it was not needed and keep a careful watch for potential enemies.
"
1352,,400,Think Like an Animal ,Peter Pan,Control,"Never Never Land is full of wild things, but there are ways to deal with each creature, however big or small. Due to Peter's guidance and your own wild nature, you have a knack for dealing with various wildlife on the island, and can identify specific actions that will drive them away, usually exploiting their simple nature. For instance, a wolf will run away in terror if you bend over and stare at them backwards with your head between your legs; if you draw a line in the dirt around yourself and dare anyone to cross it at their own peril, a full pride of lions will not pass over the barrier; and bears will hesitate to attack their own kind, even if it is just you in disguise or with a teddy bear. Please note that an animal sufficiently antagonized with you may push aside its qualms and still try to attack. Also, as the composition of the creature moves away from the natural end of the spectrum and more toward an alien or magical beast (since Neverland’s beasts are somewhat magical, the shift is less sharp on the magical end), the solutions become increasingly complicated; even so, the solution will always be within your capabilities.
"
1353,,400,Wonderland No More,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"Head-shaped plants (vines, mushrooms, grass, cacti, seaweed, etc.). They are all insane but follow your commands. Aside from different plant types, they come in two main variants. The Bloodsucking Foliates are aggressive and carnivorous. They use spores to leech life from prey to replenish their own health. Muttering Foliates are shy and photosynthetic, but still dangerous. Their spores are poisonous, and any vomit from someone who’s taken enough poison damage from them will produce a new Foliate. Both kinds of Foliates can also spit a sap-like substance at targets to make their appendages stick together. Foliates can grow even on rocks, and they can merge with whatever they’re planted in to reappear up to 60 feet away.
"
1354,,400,Fallen Throne ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A throne made out of a Fallen Star. Please note that this item does not trigger chaotic Star Surges with magic casting unless you want it to. Instead, the throne enhances charisma and mind control-oriented powers when sitting upon it.
"
1355,,400,Gecko Puppet ,Neverland: The RPG,Control,"A towering wooden puppet (it can be shaped after either your favorite reptile or whatever reptile freaked you out the most as a kid). Each appendage has a hole bored into it and contains a cat-sized gecko piloting that appendage. Together, the geckos form a hive mind to run the puppet as a whole. If part of the wooden puppet is carved and repurposed into something else, the gecko piloting it will instinctively know how to use the new carving accordingly. The lizards also can cast some mind control spells. Both the lizards and the puppet are immune to electricity, though the puppet is weak against fire.
"
1356,,400,Luck of the Draw ,Wonderland No More,Control,"This perk comes into play whenever you are taking an action that randomly selects between several options (for instance, if you are using a perk where the specific effect is randomly selected from several distinct possibilities, or you are using a magic item that randomly chooses between several different results). Now, for that random selection, there is now an extra option that acts as a “Joker”. If the randomly selected effect is the Joker, then you are allowed to pick the specific result from the specific options given. In the case that there is already a joker-like option in the rolls, then the Joker is still added in as a separate extra option, increasing your chances of rolling at least one of the joker options. Please note that this does not affect Jumpchain meta like rolling for location in a jump.
"
1357,,400,Painting Book ,Wonderland No More,Control,"A watercolor set (with case, brush and paints) that comes with a couple-dozen-page book full of outlined drawings of various Wonderland beings and landscapes, waiting to be colored in. Once you’ve fully colored in the picture, the subject “comes to life” just as it was painted, right in front of the painter. These painting creations are fully loyal to the painter, though you can command them to behave like the real-life versions would. Each colored picture is replaced by a new drawing outline in a day (the random pictures all generally depict various things from Wonderland).
"
1358,,400,GIANT BEAR ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Control,"You walked into the woods as Boris Ursus did and when your body was found you were sleeping in the snow with a giant bear guarding you. The bear itself is unusually intelligent, unshakably loyal to you and is always large enough for you to ride. Its strength is immense and its speed frightening, even taking into account its fearsome form, and it’s claws and teeth are blessed by Ursun himself to easily rend armour and the flesh of daemons. It also has fine, enchanted armour covered with glyphs of protection.
"
1359,,400,Thunder Tusk ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Control,"Gigantic mammoths, covered in tusks and horns, entwined with the magic of the ice wastes. Thunder Tusks have little to do with actual thunder, save for the booming sound made as they charge across the mountains. Each beast can carry a trio of Ogres on its back with ease, though it takes a brave Ogre to try. This is due to the powerful frost magic a Thunder Tusk exudes, an aura of sub-zero temperatures that freeze all around the creature. Their magical natures allow them to focus this icy aura into jagged blades and boulders of ice, spitting them across a battlefield at any foe. Irritable in the summer and sun, they will often create a cocoon of ice to hibernate through such times, bursting free once it is cold enough. They’re also known to be good at keeping meat fresh. You have a pet Thunder Tusk, tamed with much effort that seems to take care not to freeze you.
"
1360,,400,Binding the Beast ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Through the power of Ghur, an Amber Wizard may come to an understanding with the great beasts of the wild. That is to say, they may come to recognize you as their superior, the leader of their herd or pack. You are especially adept at this, able to sway several packs of wolves or flocks of birds to your cause at a time. Furthermore, under your influence, normally solitary animals such as bears become cooperative enough to coordinate their attacks, and skittish creatures like deer gain the courage to stand against the horrors of Chaos. This is not absolute obedience, but unless you do something detrimental to the creatures in question they will have little reason to oppose you. This is less likely to work on prouder creatures, such as wild dragons, but even they are not entirely beyond your reach.
"
1361,,400,Bind and Seal ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"What the White Wizards cannot destroy or banish, they lock away where it can never escape. The Vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light are full of such creatures and artifacts. You have learned well from this, and now your mind is rife with knowledge of how to imprison what you cannot kill, mundane and magical alike. Not only do you have the architectural sense necessary to design prisons that no mortal in this world could escape without arcane aid, you are also versed instinctively in sealing spells taught to the Light Order by Teclis himself, strong enough to chain the Chaos Dragon Baudros in the depths of the vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light."
1362,,400,Scroll of Binding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"Much like the scrolls created by the old wizard Kadon, this scroll allows you to leash a great creature of the wilds to your will. The use of it is simple enough. Focus the wind of Ghur into the scroll, and call out the name of the beast within your sight. Pit your will against that of the beast. Prove yours stronger, and the beast will obey you until you decide to release it, command it to act in a manner that is truly against its nature, or allow it to suffer sufficient injury that it flees. Luckily, very few beasts truly have a distaste for war. This will certainly make it easier to call the greatest of beasts to your side.
"
1363,,400,Carmine Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Control,"To think such a creature might actually exist is terrifying enough. To think that it willingly serves you would be laughable were it not cause for one to die of fright. Even so, here we are. This deep red monstrosity, whose breath rusts metal to nothing and turns flesh to dust as if millennia struck them in seconds, deigns to act as your steed in times of war. Though it is as young as a dragon can be while still being useful for battle now, it is more than a match for most of the world’s creatures. A swift mount in the air and a potent combatant, this dragon serves its purpose well. As it ages, of course, it will only grow larger and more powerful with each century. The loyalty of such a creature is a difficult thing to earn. Be sure not to waste it.
"
1364,,400,Elemental Beings ,Endless Legend,Control,"You know how to summon great elementals formed of nature. These giants, while simple minded, will obey your instructions to the best of their ability, and can be very reliable if guided properly. You may only bind one elemental at a time, but you can teach others how to do it. It is not easy, expect a high washout rate and maybe some fatalities. Each elemental is roughly 10 meters tall, humanoid shaped, and comprised of your chosen element.
"
1365,,400­,Familiar (Embodied Familiar) ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Control,"A familiar is a spirit, a being native to the astral plane which may enter the coterminous realm of twilight. To become a familiar, a ritual occurs in which a mage mystically bonds the familiar to their soul, allowing them to see through the familiar’s eyes and have it perform tasks on their behalf. Spirits in turn may use the mage as an anchor to stay in the material world for prolonged periods of time, experiencing all they have to offer. Spirits come in one of two forms:

Embodied familiars possess all the same benefits as Ephemeral familiars save that they also have a physical form (usually that of a small animal) allowing them to interact with the fallen world as any flesh and blood creature would without the need to spend the mystical energy to do so. Familiars may also help to aid in dealings with other spirits, acting as messengers or go­-betweens. If time and effort is invested into a familiar they may become more spiritually powerful. This however is a task best suited for those with a deep and thorough understanding of Spirits and the Spirit Arcana."
1366,,400,Hearts And Minds ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Darkness calls to the weak of mind and heart, to the greedy and the shallow. The lure of power, wealth and reward, reaching far and wide. How else do you think Ganon forged his army? And yet, not all of them willingly serve him. Agahnim also did something to the palace guards at Castle Hyrule to ensure they would not care enough to save Zelda - to assist him, even. You’ve mastered the art of forcibly invoking dark energy inside a person, turning even honest and kind men into a lazy and easy to trick fools. It helps if you can justify yourself, the great and powerful wizard who saved Hyrule a dozen times is only trying to help, and the king needed to die to do it. But with enough power, even that can fall to the wayside. Be careful though, some hearts are just too pure to stain with darkness.
"
1367,,400,Vaati’s Old News! ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"I can’t emphasize enough how obsessed with power the forces of darkness are. Vaati, despite being a centuries-old demon lord, had his throne stolen by Ganon, a relative upstart, simply because of the latter’s power. His forces bent the knee, and so did he. With this perk, you’ll have a similar ability to obtain loyalty with power, convincing the legions of mooks and minions to swear allegiance to you with a show of might. Greater evils like Vaati might need to be bested in battle first before they join you, but once you do they’ll loyally serve. Do note, this loyalty is based on power, and should you lack it, you might find yourself suffering Vaati’s fate: a mere has-been. In addition to this, against particularly strong enemies you best in single combat you may Curse them, much like how the Knights who once served Hyrule were turned into exceptionally large Stalfos. This does depend on how much energy you put into a fallen foe, little energy will create a weak form after all.
"
1368,,400,Dark Mirror ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"Long ago, the Dark Mirror was used to seal away a dark tribe that invaded Hyrule. The mirror was then hidden in the Temple of Darkness to sever its connection to the world once stolen by Ganon. It works by exposing the evil or doubts that lie within a person, bringing them to life in a shadow’s guise. This one is a copy of the one Ganon used to create up to four Shadow Links to plague the Four Links on their quest. Please note that the strength of the shadow is actually inversely proportional to the light that cast it - a peskily pure hero would create a powerful but fragile shadow, while a true villain would be abysmally hard to be rid of. Sadly, the shadow cannot eclipse the light that cast it, and so outside of dumping ever more magical energy into it, the copies will only ever be a match for their original. Still, even that has its uses. As somewhat of a drawback, the mirror only generates enough darkness for a single use each jump. Anything past that you’ll have to power yourself.
"
1369,,400,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"The legendary Four Sword, created by the usage of the Picori Blade and the four Elements, and an equal to the even more legendary Master Sword. When wielding this blade, the user will be split into four versions of themselves! ...I hope you like yourself, because they've historically not gotten along very well. Each of the four versions of you has a mild difference, usually a color and a personality trait, sometimes a favored weapon. As something of a catch, each version of you shares the same amount of health - killing one of you kills all of you. Well, unless you have a friendly Fairy on standby to provide healing. Normally, upon refusion back into a cohesive whole, only one version of the wielder would remain, the memories of the other three lost to the aether. You won't have that problem, though you will find your personality altered slightly to match whichever version of yourself was the one to initiate the merge."
1370,,400,Armor of Arrogance ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Control,"Well, villains of your caliber do tend to have an ego as large as their army, so I suppose it makes sense that you would have a statue or two of yourself floating around. Wait, is it a statue? Or is it a suit of armor designed to let your fragile mage body tank a few more hits than you would normally expect? Of course, it could always be both. Specifically designed to allow you to resist holy power in general, and any weapon that has bested you before in specific, this statue is stupidly easy for you to automate or flat out possess. It should serve as a decent deterrent to any foolish hero who thinks you don’t prepare countermeasures to being sealed away again.
"
1371,,400,Heart Attack ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"The corrupted sorceress Cia was able to draw on the darkness within Link’s darkness to conjure copies of him, “Dark Link.” Just like her, you are able to sense and grab what lurks within the hearts of monster and man. 

This perk essentially allows you to sense darkness or light within someone’s heart, whatever makes up the minority, and draw it out. Supplemented with your own magic, you are able to make temporary copies of an enemy made of their darkness or light and assault them with them. 

You are able to summon more as time goes on, but there are caveats. The dark/light clones are not truly permanent and although not insanely costly, they do take effort to sustain. 

Additionally, if your target is able to somehow eliminate the darkness or light within their heart, you will be unable to use this magical power on them, as there will be nothing to draw on.
"
1372,,400,Quirk of a Copy ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Lana is the personified light that once existed within Cia, before Cia was completely overcome by darkness and that light was forced away. Because of her nature as a being born of emotion and magic rather than flesh, she has a strong ability. 

This perk gives you that ability as well. This allows you through magical power to divide your power into two or more equal copies. These parts are all equally you and yet not you. In this way, death will only truly come if all the versions of you are slain. 

This allows you to split up and run if you face certain death. That said, you will be unable to return to your full power until all versions of you have either fused back into one being, or there is only one of you left. If the other yous died to get to one remaining, your power will come back slowly, over time.
"
1373,,400,Emperor of the Damned ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"A dark art wielded by Cia, a dark power shared by Ganondorf. Extensively used when he came into power to build his army, Ganondorf raised the dead to serve as the rank and file, every enemy slain only adding to his forces. 

You now have the ability to raise the dead, quite well actually. When it comes to expendable pawns like Stalchild, you can spawn entire platoons at a time. Greater under like Big Poe and Stalfas take more effort at first, only one or two at a time being possible. 

Who knows what will happen if left alone long enough, maybe you can build your own army. You are right now unable to raise anything more powerful than a Stalmaster, but just give it some time and then we’ll see.
"
1374,,400,Shadows In Your Soul ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Control,"Veran is a sorceress of no small amount of power, casting fireballs, teleporting circles around her foes, summoning spiders to harass them, and turning into a shadow to ignore most attacks. But her most terrifying ability, one you now share, is her ability to possess people. By merging her shadowy state with someone’s shadow, she can take over their body and use their powers as her own. Make no mistake, you can be forced out of their body, but seemingly not by holy power. Instead, this ability is weak to ‘natural’ power. You know, like trees and stuff. Enough power and will on the target's half can prevent you from taking them over, but apparently a blessing from a goddess isn’t enough.
"
1375,,400,Blessings From Four Spirits ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Control,"Din’s power over the seasons seems to rely on the spirits of those seasons. The Rod certainly did, and it stands to reason that if it can be depowered so can she. Not that it matters since Onox put her in a prison meant to hold her full power. That said, it means that Din - and presumably, the long line of Din’s that she comes from - have been receiving a blessing from those four spirits for generations. Weather you’re calming them down from their antics, seeking the same blessing as your parents, or even making a contract for the first time, you are now extremely skilled at negotiating with spirits, gods, etc etc, as you convince them to actually give you that blessing. It’s also extremely easy to get that blessing, possibly even more, if you have a legacy to lean on.
"
1376,,400,Fragment Of A Crystal Prison ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Control,"A piece of the unusual material that Din was imprisoned in. Much in the same way that her captivity threw the seasons out of whack and began to tear apart Holodrum, anything that you imprison in here with start to have some serious issues. Not to the same extent, not unless you get someone really important or really powerful. But if you lock away, let’s say a pyromancer, then suddenly all fire magic and fire related things will begin to malfunction, backfire, or simply fail to work at all. In a roundabout way I suppose it’s sort of an anti-magic effect. Truth be told, I think it’s funnier for their spells to backfire than fail.
"
1377,,400,What A Horrible Night For A Curse ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Control,"Truth be told, the only demon worth slaying is the king of demons. Anything else will simply return to life sooner or later, brought back by the full moon or the snap of the demon kings fingers. Some of them overflow with his Malice to the point that they come back right away, the ‘Stal’ monsters. If they have even more, they’ll come back cursed. Or rather, so soaked in Malice that they practically beath the stuff, a dark mist made of raw hatred. When a normal person comes into contact with this cursed mist, it tends to shut down their abilities and powers. Light magic cannot be cast, a holy sword loses its luster, some people will even find themselves unable to find the strength or courage to even draw their blade. Unfortunately this cursed mist will only last for a few moments, returning the victim to normal in a short period of time. For now, there are three ways to use this ‘Curse’ element. As a defensive aura of sorts, as a breath weapon, or to simply soak the air so heavily there’s more curse than air.
"
1378,,400,Prayer to Valoo ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker - Ch.IV,Control,"The Rito were once the Zora, but over time evolved to their new form. Somehow. In the here and now, they have a contract with the sky spirit Valoo - they attend to him, and he provides them with his scales. Those same scales are the ones they need to fully grow their wings and allow them to fly. Similarly, you now have a level of skill at negotiating such a contract with the supernatural, as well as a mix of luck and brashness to allow you to find them and actually be heard out."
1379,,400,Clock ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Control,"A strange device, this “Stopwatch” when clicked will forcibly drain your magical energy(about two or three “Magic Containers” worth) or otherwise leave you tired - but in exchange, a wave of power washes around you within around 50 feet. The wave will “stun” and “Freeze” enemies in place, making it a simple matter to brutalize even a group of foes who’ve tried to surround you. When a minute has passed since the Stopwatch was activated, the enemies will automatically return to being mobile.
"
1380,,400,Invisible Hand,TES: Magic,Control,"Arguably one of the most useful spells, there is a lot of versatility
to be found in telekinesis, especially if the caster is a master like yourself. You barely
use any magicka when lifting an object the size of a child, and could lift a horse with
relative ease. But most astonishing is your precision and control, allowing you to thread
a needle with ease, or fight with weapons from a distance."
1381,,400,Puppet Master        ,TES: Magic,Control,"The path of the summoner is all about control, of enforcing your
will onto another entity, and there are fewer who are as skilled as you. You have total
control over each and every action your summons take, from how they move and fight
to when they breathe and speak. In addition to your peerless control, you are able to
experience the world through their senses, with no chance of sensory overload."
1382,,400,Masque of Clavicus Vile ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"A Daedric Artifact of Clavicus Vile, Daedric Prince of Trickery, this metallic helmet is useful for the sweet talkers of Tamriel. When wearing this, you will find yourself to be extremely persuasive and skilled at bartering. You could literally talk a poor man out of all of his worldly possessions."
1383,,400,Staff of Worms ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"The staff was once owned by the King of Worms, Mannimarco. Not only does it empower any necromantic spells channeled through it, but it makes any of your undead far more physically capable than they otherwise would have been, along with enhancing the length of time they can be active."
1384,,400,Amulet of Articulation ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"A powerful enchanted amulet, this can be a thief's best friend for talking themselves out of trouble. You can persuade people to do almost anything, especially letting you get away with a crime."
1385,,400,Beast Rod ,Konosuba,Control,"The royal family has gathered many strange items of power, more than a few were lost by adventurers coming to this world with personal cheat items. This one is a magic staff, a rod that is capable of summoning monsters. Which monsters? Any that exist in the world. From the lowest level slimes to the generals of the Demon King. There’s a random chance of summoning any existing monster within your current world. The fact that there is a very strong compulsion to obey you on those summoned helps greatly. It won’t force everyone to obey you unconditionally, against any of the Demon King’s Bosses it’d just be a fairly strong influence instead of absolute commands, but it does allow you to put your summoned monsters to good use."
1386,,500,Manton,Worm CYOA v17,Control,"You can create a projection that's the physical manifestation of an unstoppable force and immovable object. While the projection cannot delete matter, its attacks are unblockable save for perfect defenses. Similarily, nothing short of a ""perfect"" attack can harm it. As an immovable object, hostile teleportation powers do not function, and the projection has the ability to ""lock"" herself in space relative to the Earth, giving the appearance of supersonic flight as the Earth continues to move throughout space. These properties can be extended to anyone the projection touches, with the exception of yourself. The projection can be in any shape and form you wish, you can alter it’s form at any time when summoning it."
1387,,500,Call of Themyscira,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"""Call of Themyscira"" is the powerful Semblance that Diana unlocked, channeling the
might and legacy of the Amazon warriors. This Semblance allows you to summon an
army of red spectral Amazons, each as formidable as their real counterparts. Should
any of these warriors fall, you can effortlessly summon them again, ensuring an endless
wave of reinforcements. While each warrior requires a small amount of energy to
summon, they do not need additional energy to sustain their presence once summoned.
This allows you to maintain a persistent, powerful force without draining your reserves."
1388,,500,Alluring Whisper: Siren's Song,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Your voice is supernaturally compelling. As an active effect, you can empower your words to give specific commands to individuals, or rally a crowd with a song. Beings with sufficient willpower can resist or even block this lure. It will never affect someone who lacks a sense of hearing.

Requires Alluring Whisper to purchase."
1389,,500,Bookmaker,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"You are able to create a special object now, such as a large screw or sword or spear. This object must
have a sharp point of some type because when it pierces a being by even a little, it will stick in them
and bring them down to your level. Power, intelligence, skill, everything will be lowered to match
you or risen to match you. They’ll become just as bad as you in everything and their hair will turn
white too. The effect will wear off over time however. You can create several dozen of these objects
at a time. "
1390,,500,Marching Bad,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"Never let go of your friends and family. Even after they’ve passed on and it’s long since become
unhealthy, cling to them forever more. You have the ability to raise and control any dead body that
you touch as horrifying zombies. These undead beings are able to follow orders that you give them
but do not take any initiative on their own. They do however possess all the abilities and skill that
they had in life, at least while they remain in good shape. The more the body of the zombie you have
raised rots away, the weaker their powers will become and the less will remain of their former skills. On the other hand, this does mean you can make a zombie out of any part of a once living creature, even just a skull or a bony hand. "
1391,,500,Friendly World,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Control,"The hero was right all along. You guys should be friends. Just on your terms. Those that feel hatred
for you will soon wish they didn’t as negative feelings towards you are reversed into being positive
feelings...without removing the negative feelings. The more someone dislikes you, the more they
can’t help but like you. When someone truly hates you, they find themselves truly loving you at the
same time. If you do nothing, they’ll likely become violently obsessed with you but giving them
attention while they fall into this love-hate madness can allow you to shape them quite easily, twisting their hate towards those that would opposed the one they love. But maybe you might just
break them instead, leaving them a mad wreck that only knows love for you and hatred for
themselves. "
1392,,500,Long Gui ,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"Well...I’m at a loss here – because it’s literally a full grown Long Gui. I didn’t even know my store had that much space. Unlike the one granted by Titan’s Boon, this Long Gui is feral, and if you set it loose, it will basically wander about and not listen to a word anybody says. It is resistant to all spells and conditions, but will go down under heavy firepower. You get one per jump. It has a bad tendency of showing up in cities randomly."
1393,,500,Mato Kuroi/Black★Rock Shooter,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Ah yes, the protagonist, excitable and outgoing, though sort of awkward around people she hasn’t had time to warm up to and fond of philosophical musings, often muttering about the world around to no-one in particular. She has no particular hate for anyone and as such it is kinda difficult for others to bring themselves to hate her as well. Mato acts in the belief of helping others and trying to alleviate sorrow at the cost of making herself hurt without any particular care or focus on her own until it is forced upon her. She is the one who has the gall to say she wants to be hurt in front of her Otherself and mean it.

All-in-all a true friend, a genuinely decent person and a bit of a tomboy with various interests in sports and other things though has a particular love for The Tiny Birds & The Colors book. She goes to Dawn Middle School with her friend Yuu Koutari and is about to make a friend or try to make a friend with Yomi Takanashi, from which the rest of the events of the story will take place.

Black★Rock Shooter on the other-hand, is extremely violent and deadly, even for an Otherself, and dedicated to Mato’s goal of ridding the world of suffering, and how she comes to understand that goal is to kill every single Otherself, as their death causes the grief, memories, and emotions relating to the source of the real self’s pain to be removed completely, in the short-term it solves the problem but it also effectively performs a miniature lobotomy on the person and does a shit-ton of other problems later down the line so while it seems like she’s a good person, she is most certainly not.

Her personality compared to Mato is blunt and prideful and while she says she has no emotions and goes on instincts she has an unprecedented savagery and enjoyment of battle and believes herself nigh unbeatable, becoming easily frustrated if a fight does not appear to be going her way. If it wasn’t for her going insane however, she’d probably be a lot more friendly and peaceful to Mato’s change of heart regarding not killing the Otherselves, still in the end, she does continue to fight on but seemingly in a more... rational manner rather than just trying to kill everyone.

If you’ve companioned Mato as a Student or Shadow then you’ve been childhood friends with her alongside Yuu (and can remember Yuu if you can’t already), and are just about to enter the first year of Dawn Middle School with her and Yuu. If you're a Counselor, then you’ve managed to catch her eye in Dawn Consulting and helped her with a personal issue or two of hers enough that she considers you a great friend despite being an adult.

If you’ve companioned Mato as an Otherself than you have somehow, before the end of the series, managed to befriend Black★Rock Shooter and mayhaps even managed to get her to change her ways on killing the Otherselves and the entire Otherworld, either that, or she’s saving you for last and you’re going to have to see the series through with Insane Black★Rock Shooter’s destruction to get her as a proper companion. But this particular option could have the entire plot be thrown into disarray if you want it to be like that.

Mato Kuroi has the entire Student perk-line and the entire Student item line save for the Mansion item. She also has The Tiny Bird & The Colors item as well. Alongside this she has the Friends In The Least Likely Places from The Shadow perk-line. 

Black★Rock Shooter has the entire Otherside perk-line, including Insanity of the Other. Though she only has the ★ Outfits item.

Both of them have Drawn By Huke.

Both Mato Kuroi and Black★Rock Shooter count as one companion. They do not have any remaining CP to spend unless gained by drawbacks, nor TP or OP as well. Unless you want to spend your own."
1394,,500,The Princess,Slay the Princess,Control,"I feel something different here, a presence amidst the silence...but different. ...Oh. Hello there. I take it you're not from around here, though I'm not quite sure where ‘here’ is to begin with. I suppose you want me to come along with you? Sure, anything is better than being trapped down here with no one to talk to forever. But I hope you understand that I am no ‘ordinary’ Princess either."
1395,,500,Touched by Destruction,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Control,"You jumped into the pitch black waters of Darkness and prevailed. As such you are now one with Destruction and seen as a kin by the God of Darknesses creations. Grimm and creatures of Darkness and Doom will see you not only as an ally but as someone to pledge obedience too. But more than that you can even control such creatures, force your will on them and even alter or summon them with time. You are as the Black Queen Salem herself could one day become. Why fear the Darkness? You are part of it."
1396,,500,Custom Miraculous(Tier 1),Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"This is a pretty straightforward customization system. You can choose an animal or other theme to have your Miraculous’ Kwami based on, as well as an appropriate activation phrase for your Miraculous. You can also choose a form for your Miraculous (has to be small enough to be comfortably held by normal humans). The Tool cannot be a sci-fi or magical device outside of the normal effects of being a Miraculous Tool. Any but not all of those can be copied off of another Miraculous (such as having a pig necklace with the tool of a staff but you can’t have a cat ring with the tool of a staff). As for the power it holds, that’s up to you. 

A Miraculous with a situational ability like the Dog or Pig, costs only 300 CP. 

For 200 additional CP, your Miraculous Tool can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures just like the Ladybug Miraculous. This can be one of the Miraculous that have been shown but has not been used in the show.

You can import a magical artifact to become a Miraculous assuming that it is a valid form for a Miraculous."
1397,,500,Mimir,God Of War (2018),Control,"A talking head! While it is a bit morbid, Mimir is quite happy with this better than being stuck in a tree for eternity at any rate. He gives very good advice and you find that he has a gift for telling funny stories, and stories that often carry a lesson. Furthermore, while he is blind in one eye his other eye is a functional Bifrost Eye. Meaning that while he cannot create portals to other realms, he can show what is happening in nearby realms to others as well as peer into nearby realms himself. You cannot take this eye for yourself. Should you keep him as a head, and he remains on your person, you will find that he is seemingly incapable of being injured. Not that he can’t be hurt but more like any potential injury seems to just miss him. An arrow aimed at him? It will hit the spot right above him. You go tumbling down a hill? He’ll never be caught between you and the hill, though he may be a bit dizzy. Should you purchase the 400 CP version, which is free for those who have purchased The Smartest Man Alive, then any world you enter Mimir will know the true history of it, knowing who really ruled that kingdom, how that person really died, etc. The only downside is that he cannot tell you a being's fatal weakness, for instance if they needed to be struck by silver under the full moon to be rendered killable Mimir would not be able to tell you this until you yourself found the weakness. You can, if you desire, provide Mimir with a body though how you get one will be up to you. For a purchase of 100 CP, 500 total if purchased without The Smartest man alive, Mimir will have both of his Bifrost eyes and will be able to create portals to any realm that he is aware of."
1398,,500,Thunderbird,Wizarding World,Control,"Unlike its inspiration of Hogwarts, the Ilvermony School of Witchcraft and Wizardry bases its four Houses upon four different magical beasts. These fours beasts were the mighty Horned Serpent, the tricky Wampus Cat, the ever-helpful Pukwudgie, and the majestic Thunderbird, a relative to the fiery Phoeniex. And now, you can discover just how majestic and beautiful the Thunderbird is for yourself.

Dwarfing its lesser kin, the Thunderbird is, quite simply, superior to the many mundane birds of prey that roam the world. With its six wings, a Thunderbird strikes a wondrous sight as it soars through the skies, its iridescent feathers shifting colors from a luminous gold to an electrifying blue and so much more.

And yet, such beauty is only a footnote to the Thunderbird’s own magical capabilities. You see, there have only been a rare number of witches and wizards who have ever been able to change the weather. But a mighty feat for humanity is but a casual deed for a Thunderbird. With a flap of its vast wings, the Thunderbird can bring forth a storm, complete with lightning and thunder. And if you had something such as the venom of a Swooping Evil, you could even add its properties to the storms of the Thunderbird.

As for its other ability, while it may not be as grandiose as a storm, a Thunderbird is capable of sensing danger quite accurately which is very useful and only an idiot thinks otherwise. If needed, your Thunderbird can subtly warn you of people and things that may pose a threat to you and your companions.

Finally, should you have need of it, the feathers of a Thunderbird can serve as powerful wand cores, especially when it comes to matters of Transfiguration. In fact, wands wherein a Thunderbird’s feather resides are often capable of warning their wielders of dangers or even cast curses on their own."
1399,,500,Nundu,Wizarding World,Control,"When one thinks of a dangerous magical beast, more often than not, the first thing to pop into their minds would be a dragon. And many would say that it is the dragon that is most dangerous magical beast of all. These people are wrong.

No, the honor of the “most dangerous creature” goes to the Nundu, a beast native to the land of Africa. Resembling a cross between a pufferfish and a jaguar or a lion, depending on whether or not its “mane” is puffed up, if said feline was as large as an elephant, the Nundu is truly monstrous.

Even despite its size, a Nundu can move as swiftly and silently as a shadow. But mere stealth would not afford the Nundu of its title. For you see, this beast’s most potent weapon lies in its noxious and poisonous breath. Filled with all manners of plagues and diseases, there are more than a few villages whose entire population found themselves wiped out by a Nundu’s virulent breath. 

Of course, if this was the only thing they had at their disposal, Nundus wouldn’t be quite so feared. No, beyond all else, a Nundo possesses a hide so tough and enduring that it outshines all other creatures in this world. Whereas a dragon can find itself brought low by half a dozen highly trained wizards, the number of times a Nundu has been taken down with anything less than a hundred wizards working in concert can be counted on one hand and still have plenty of fingers to spare.

Rest assured, if you want a beast that it’ll deliver death to your foes and remain standing after facing a veritable army, the Nundu is the beast for you."
1400,,500,Basilisk,Wizarding World,Control,"There are countless beasts and monsters that roam this land of ours and yet, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, the veritable King of Serpents. The Basilisk’s roots can be traced back to Ancient Greece and the machinations of the one of the most infamous Dark Wizards of all time, Herpo the Foul. Through his mastery of the Dark Arts and of the language of serpents, Herpo the Foul forced a chicken egg to hatch underneath a toad, bringing forth the very first Basilisk.

And following in the footsteps of Herpo the Foul and Salazar Slytherin, you are the proud parent of a Basilisk of your own. Still young and possessing none of the fearsomeness an adult Basilisk has at its disposal, it will grow rapidly. In a year or two, the beast shall grow to a size of over thirty feet and by your tenth year here, it shall be utterly gigantic, possessing a length of fifty to sixty feet. More than that, the basilisk shall possess a hide as mighty and as enduring as a dragon’s.

But more importantly, by your second year here, its magical abilities shall be fully realized. Its fangs shall deliver a venom so deadly and vile that only the tears of a phoenix could ever heal one bitten by a Basilisk. All other attempts to heal such a thing will certainly fail. And yet, poison is perhaps the least of its death-dealing abilities.

For all those who gaze upon the Basilisk’s eyes, they shall suffer a certain and instant death. This is the true might of a Basilisk. Even gazing upon its eyes indirectly will be enough for one to be affected, becoming afflicted with petrification rather than death. Nevertheless, a petrified foe is quite vulnerable to a Basilisk’s predations.

And so, I implore you to be careful. While the Basilisk shall never harm you on purpose, even instinctively closing its eyes whenever it is in your presence, the rest of the world shall not be so fortunate. Of course, you should protect your serpent as well. Basilisks have one fatal weakness, the cry of a rooster. Try and find a way to stop that, for the sake of your beast."
1401,,500,Acromantula,Wizarding World,Control,"Spiders have always been a common fear within the hearts of men. Wizards and witches are no different and, in their case, such fear is considerably more justified. After all, unlike Muggles, wizards and witches have to deal with spiders the size of cars, and those spiders aren’t even fully grown! And like the spiders of Muggles, there are many kinds of magical spiders out there but there are none more famous and none more vicious than the terrifying Acromantula, a terrifying magical spider closer in size to a house.

Native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, Acromantulas are wizard-bred spiders that were made to guard the treasure troves and homes of many a wizard in the past. Unfortunately for many, these spiders possessed a taste for human flesh and could easily snap a man in half with a single bite from its massive pincers. And if they survived that, they’d need to contend with the spider’s vicious venom. To make matters worse, Acromantulas were, unlike many other spiders in the world, social creatures. Where Acromantula made its home, there would be dozens more nearby.

More importantly, Acromantulas are dreadfully intelligent, more than enough to converse and
match wits with the people of the world. They could even speak if they wanted to. And like people, they can learn to develop a bond with each other. Perhaps that is how this wondrous specimen of an Acromantula came to stand by your side.

On a final note, if your Acromantula is female and gets pregnant, be prepared to care for a nest of spiders hundreds strong. And while they won’t attack either you or your Companions, the young spiders can be very aggressive when in search of a meal."
1402,,500,Dragon,Wizarding World,Control,"Classified as an XXXXX Beast by the British Ministry of Magic, dragons may not be the deadliest of such beasts, but they are certainly one of, if not the most well-known amongst them. Owing to their size and hides, a dragon is nigh-impervious to most spells, requiring almost half a dozen trained witches and wizards in order to merely stun them. And while XXXXX Beasts are said to be untamable, you have always been a special sort.

Though there are a vast variety of dragons in this world, they share many things in common. Monstrous in size, mighty in strength and possessing a hide durable enough that only a dozen skilled wizards working in concert could hope to stun it, a dragon is a beast of magic that few could ever hope to match. Even the very components of a dragon are sought after by many for all the magical properties they possess, from their flesh, their scales, their blood, their claws and more.

You may decide what exactly the species of your new pet dragon is, from the monstrous Hungarian Horntail to the more peaceful Antipodean Opaleye. Just know that taking care of a dragon is no easy task. You’ll need to think of food, of space, and of so much more. But rest assured. A dragon is well worth the price. Still, I wish you luck."
1403,,500,Doc Magmanite,Invincible,Control,"You have gained several powers through a mystical empowerment. You gain the ability to control and produce potent sonic blasts, enough that you could kill a young Viltrumite with some effort or destroy a building, as well as increased physical ability to the point that you could match the Immortal. Finally you are able to summon and control the Magmanites wherever you are. These are a race of earthen creatures that can be summoned by you to break out of the ground while following your every order."
1404,,500,Spell of Imprisonment,Moon Knight,Control,"The Spell to Imprison of the Gods, which many of the Egyptian Pantheon have fallen victim to by the Ennead. Usually only an Avatar, or two at least, could make use of such a thing or a group of Gods. But for you we make an exception. You can bind a God to a Ushabti (receiving one automatically when you decide on a target), imprisoning them in something they are unable to escape from. Breaking the Ushabti will set them free once more however. Alternatively you can bind the God or Goddess in question to a mortal host and in killing them you destroy the divinity you bound to them permanently. To imprison a God you must however either channel the power of one that is comparable to them, or have the power to content with them."
1405,,500,"""Dragon Welp""",Dark Souls 3 ,Control,"Everlasting Dragons, rulers of a bygone era from before the Age of Fire. They were once driven to near extinction by the gods with only a few survivors that went into hiding, but have since resurrected in a weaker state. By purchasing this, you obtain the loyalty and friendship of a dragon, a welp at any rate. The dragon you gain the loyalty of is young, no bigger than a rhinoceros. It possesses hide like stone, a long, serpentine neck covered with twisting horns, flight and the ability to breathe long streams of flame. It’s an intelligent creature, though not quite as much as its ancient predecessors, and when it reaches maturity it will dwarf most other beings you find in these lands. Although young, even at this stage it remains a formidable ally. It can be killed, having a particularly notable vulnerability to lightning, but will respawn if killed like after a week."
1406,,500,"""Wolf Pack""",Dark Souls 3 ,Control,"Years of allegiance to wolf blood has seen that loyalty returned and your advancement from a brother or sister to a leader, an alpha. By purchasing this option, you acquire the loyalty of a pack of ten great wolves. Each wolf is intelligent and about the size of a man when fully grown. They're about as dangerous as you would expect pack of huge, smart, loyal wolves to be. Open to new tricks and tactics, and can teach and communicate with each other. Not quite companions, but will not die naturally of old age. Whenever one does actually fall, usually in battle, a new wolf will spawn to take its place a day later."
1407,,500,Little Moon,Elden Ring,Control,"How curious. A smaller moon, one perhaps tenfold as large as those that Carian royalty can conjure, seems to be following you around at a respectful distance. And occasionally going off on its own, but somehow extremely hard to notice by others when it doesn’t want to be even in broad daylight-and never far from you when you’re looking for it. Not the great patron of Ranni, but perhaps the equivalent to it of what the Fingers are to the Erdtree.

When it’s light shines down upon you, your magic is greatly empowered-hails of glintstone shards raining down with the effort needed to cast one. Magics and supernatural powers associated with the moon are particularly bolstered in both raw power and complexity; if you, for example, uncontrollably turned into a feral werewolf in the moonlight this moon could help you retain your human mind during the process. Inspiration for magical studies and insight into supernatural matters of all sorts comes naturally to you naturally of all sorts-and when it’s light shines down on you your luck is greatly increased too. And the magic or alien powers of your enemies are greatly weakened by its presence- and though the moon is not invulnerable, it is still a great floating ball of stone that resurrects like a Tarnished during the next full moon. Last but not least, it can also supply you with an endless flow of the frost native to the moon which it shapes as if an extension of its own will-whether conjuring a blizzard at your foes, or enchanting weapons and storing it in pots for you to use later. Or just keeping drinks cold.

Finally, through this moon you can summon and commune with the alien beings of this world through various rituals. Simply calling forth quantities of glintstone will be relatively easy. Summoning hordes of Alabaster Lords or alien beasts, a moderately taxing task aided by the moon lending you great authority among these beings. And while it is possible to summon truly potent entities that embody the stars themselves, be wary-even with the moon’s support, such beings can be unpredictable and dangerous."
1408,,500,Tomb Kingdom ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Control,"There are far more than just a few squads of skeleton warriors resting within your tomb. Upon your death, your entire army was buried alongside you, thousands of warriors committing ritual suicide so that they could accompany you to the next world. Along with them are chariots, golems, beasts of all kinds. And that’s just with the smallest of tombs. The larger your tomb, the larger your army grows. Can you imagine the undead legions that would emerge from something the size of the Black Pyramid? (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
1409,,500,Coral of Corruption* ,Peter Pan,Control,"The tales of mermaids are diverse, and some say that the mermaids ultimately seek to enslave all of Neverland with their charms. A sacred statue of rainbow coral is a key to their plan. When the coral is placed in a body of water, it will spread a continual magical effect within a 50 foot radius; however, the power cannot extend to any water past that distance, and any water that moves from one side to the other will change to match the setting. The magic causes all those who touch the affected water to be bound to a geis to serve the mermaids’ every command. In the case that the corrupted individual is sapient, the water will additionally wash away all of the person’s goodness and leave a bubble of evil instead. The effects of the coral can be resisted and removed with significant spiritual power, though.
"
1410,,500,Bronze Collar of Khorne ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Control,"The collar that signifies the wearer is a slave of the Blood God, the collar is Khorne’s loathing of sorcery made manifest. Any magics cast against the wearer simply fail, be they hostile or benign, though any attempt by the wearer to use magic themselves will be doomed to failure as well."
1411,,500,Key to the Eternity Chamber ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Control,"Inlaid with intricate wards that slow the very passage of time. Against slower opponents it appears to do nothing but when fighting an opponent faster than yourself, with the key in your possession, they will be slowed to your own pace."
1412,,500,Call Upon the Guardians ,Endless Legend,Control,"There exist five elemental titans. One of earth, fire, air, water, and Dust. They are the Guardians of Auriga. Each has unimaginable power. Earthquakes that shake continents, firestorms that make it rain ash for weeks, floods that wash away mountains, gales that uproot castle, and Dust storms that rip flesh from bone. You can upon them and they will heed your call. Once. They will assist you for one week each, before returning to their duties. They will not heed you a second time."
1413,,600,Seeker of Names,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Control,"You’re capable of seeing the true
names of any supernatural creature
you encounter, and know the names
of many that you haven’t, making it
easier to summon, control, bind, or
banish these beasts. You know a
summon for almost any situation, and
controlling a being not of the natural
world becomes easier. Finally your
mastery is such that when you invoke
your pacts with greater beings such
as Aeons or Great Beasts, you will
have no need to follow the terms;
their power shall be yours to use
without restriction."
1414,,600,Prime Corrupt,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"In a manner similar to the Prime Minister Honest, you’re a
walking beacon of corruption with an influence so dark that would be able to taint
and rot entire countries with your schemes. You’re not only a master of conventional
politics, but also a master of political corruption, being a true specialist when it
comes to getting people to serve your policies, collecting bribes or just identifying
people within an existing power structure that would be ideal to swap out to support
your ends. You’re also particularly talented at discovering people that are willingly to
join your corrupt schemes and at finding the heart/brain of an organization and
corrupting it directly in a way that better suits your purposes, like manipulating a
country’s ruler in order to make them completely loyal to you while being blind to
their own nation’s real situation."
1415,,600,The Reaper of Oarburgh,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"The Wrigglers are insect-type Danger Beasts
that the leaders of the Oarburgh clan have passed down for generations and were
created by the same alchemists that came to the Empire to engineer the Teigu a
thousand years ago. However, after the fall of the Oarburgh clan, you managed to
acquire the last eggs of each type of Wrigglers and implanted them into yourself,
achieving a symbiotic relationship with them by becoming their “hive”.
These insects, once matured, can be controlled and moved according to the will of
their operator, that is, your will, however, in addition to being their operator, you’re
also partially their hive, as, while they won’t incubate inside you, you acquired the
ability to multiply their eggs within your body and then implant them into other living
beings through your natural weapons, such as infecting your opponents’ wounds
with eggs by slashing at them with your nails or by biting them for example. Once
inside a living being, the eggs will then begin to propagate and multiply at an
incredibly fast speed as they are incubated by their victim’s body heat and you need
only to give the signal and they will hatch all together, tearing their ""incubator"" apart
from the inside out as they flew out of the victim’s body and leaving it a mangled
mess.
Furthermore, the Wrigglers themselves come in a variety of different types, all of
whom possess some sort of unique function that makes them deadly in combat,
such as beetles with claws specialized on tearing flesh apart, explosive ants, beetles
with incredibly tough shells, bees that possess a powerful paralysis-type poison,
poisonous moths, special butterflies attracted by the scent of blood, fly-like Wrigglers
used for communication and centipedes used on tortures. Fortunately, as many of
these insects possess powerful poisons, your condition as their hive also enhances
your body to grant you complete immunity to their effects.
Additionally, as the Wrigglers share the same origin as the Teigu, despite not being
one, they also possess their own trump card: you can wrap yourself in a cocoon
made from the silk fired by a special type of Caterpillar Wrigglers, where your body
will be completely rebuild in order to transform you into a human/butterfly-Wriggler
hybrid. In this new form, all of your physical abilities will be enhanced and you’ll be
given several insect-based powers, such as creating web-like silk from the tips of
your fingers to entangle your targets, flying using your butterfly wings, shapeshift
your arms into insect-like scythes and even the ability to create a scale-like dust
substance that causes damage on your victims’ eyesight. Additionally, another
benefit to this form is the fact that, as the transformation not only changes and
enhances your body but completely rebuilds it, all of your current wounds will be
completely healed, even those that normally couldn’t be healed through regular
ways, as they aren’t actually being “fixed” but technically replaced by your new body.
However, a major drawback to this trump card is that there is an unspecified set time
limit on how long you’ll be able to maintain this form before being forced to revert
back to your normal body.
Lastly, despite the Wrigglers being Danger Beasts, they were so heavily modified by
the alchemists that even Teigu with the power to control such creatures won’t have
any effect over your insects, as their loyalty for you is so powerful to point of being
able to overcome any attempt of controlling or manipulating them to act against your
will, however, you can still order a portion of the horde of your insects to obey
someone else’s commands if you want to share them due to some reason."
1416,,600,The True Owner,Akame ga Kill!,Control,"Normally, a person’s compatibility with a specific Teigu is
heavily affected by their first impression of the item in question as, for example,
someone that just accidentally thought that a Teigu looks ugly will probably have a
poor compatibility with it and will hardly be able to use it for more than a few minutes
at best. However, you’re a special individual, as you seem to possess a naturally
high compatibility with every Teigu and other similar weapons, with your first
impression and opinion about them having no influence on how well you can use
them. Additionally, this universally high compatibility also works for the Teigu and
other weapons that also have special personality requirements they “seek” on their
users to be compatible with them, even if you don’t fulfill such requirements, allowing
you to even wield a weapon like Mjolnir without needing to be worthy for example."
1417,,600,Idol Diplomacy,A Mage of Sorothustra,Control,"Talented diplomats walk through the world, or worlds in this case,
seeming to love multiple places equally. A truly talented ambassador, like you, could be
mistaken as loving the places you visit as much, or even more, than you love Sorothustra, and
this, in turn, has led to those places loving you back. The Mystic Mother has certainly blessed
you in one respect: you are loved and adored by the people whose worlds you visit, and your
celebrity is a powerful tool in many respects. You are a type of idol and influencer and can
leverage your status to both help the natives of the places you visit and to subtly advance the
interests of Sorothustra, and in future jump wherever else you opt to call home. You can, of
course, use this status to more easily and skillfully engage in trysts of various sorts with all sorts
of foreigners and/or aliens."

potential threat posed by Supers. This group has a vast array of resources including
super powered cloning, advanced weapons, an army's worth of soldiers, scientists and
other assets. Additionally, this group has numerous hidden bases throughout the world
and wealth larger than most countries. By purchasing this option you can either take
command of Cadmus or create your own equally powerful organization. They are a
force perfect for supporting you in the background. The group will be led by a team of
specialists each of whom are masters in their field. For example, your scientist will be
led by someone as intelligent as Emil Hamilton. Post-Jump you can take the
organization with you inserting them into the new Jump."

Though some believe that they are androids or creations of another Shard. In this case
the final option is true as you are capable of summoning them. Each Blasphemy excels
in different areas of technology and warfare, creating advanced weaponry, defensive
systems, and psychological devices. The Blasphemies can resurrect endlessly, provided
at least one of them remains alive, ensuring their continuous presence on the battlefield.
As their summoner, you also share in their revival power, allowing you to resurrect as
long as one of the Blasphemies is still standing. You can deploy them individually or as
a cohesive unit, leveraging their tinkering genius to dominate any conflict."

As with the lesser tier, this range can be expanded through dedicated training and
practice, allowing you to exert your influence over increasingly larger areas."
1421,,600,You're Mine,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"In another world Heartbreaker would be considered one of the most feared and hated
villains due to his powers. He may have been killed early on here, but it seems that his
power lives on having been passed to you. This power allows you to control the
emotions and actions of others through direct eye contact. Once you've established eye
contact, you can make the target intensely fall in love with you, causing them to become
entirely devoted to your will. This control is deep and pervasive, affecting their thoughts,
desires, and actions, making it impossible for them to resist or even consider betraying
you. While this power is exceptionally potent, it requires careful use, as those under
your control can become obsessively loyal, often going to extreme lengths for your
sake. Lastly, keep in mind this power doesn’t actually enhance your body so you can
still be killed easily even if you somehow mind controlled a powerful group of supers."

with such complexity that you can foresee and manipulate events with an almost
supernatural precision, allowing you to sow distrust among allies.
Friends shall turn against each other and fractures will develop in even the strongest of

rewrite the minds of others. With just a word, so long as your target has a physical brain, you can
command them to do whatever you want without a chance of them resisting. Only by approaching
your level of power can they have a chance of resisting these immediate commands. By totally
focusing on someone however, you can brainwash them over time even if they’re as strong as you, though they can try to resist or fight back against you. Once brainwashed, they’ll act like however
you wanted them to, though it’s possible to be broken out of the brainwash by someone else. You

members of our clan, Kaguya used the victims of the Infinite Tsukuyomi that stayed

surfaces, are capable of draining chakra through physical contact, have limited
control over their forms (letting them to open their bodies or even merge with other
White Zetsu), are capable of assimilating properties of any nearby material and can
use Wood Release to a lesser degree. Despite all these abilities, their main weapon
to be used in a war is the Substitute Technique, which allows them to perfectly copy
the appearance, the chakra signature and even the smell of any individual. While this
doesn’t copy their power level, this technique also allows the White Zetsu to mimic
their target’s techniques and abilities. The White Zetsu count as your followers.

Medusa’s severed head. You gain a copy of this golden item that holds a special enchantment
that any non-sentient creature (animal) that you manage to get the bridle on will become a fiat
backed pet. There is a small catch to this process: the bridle must remain on the creature for
twelve days and nights, and with each passing day the animal will grow more restless while trying to
remove the bridle. It may even call upon allies (other animals or monsters)
to its aid, but upon the end of the last day or night (depending when you put the bridle on) the
creature will be loyal to you. Once the Bridle is no longer in use you can reuse it."

It is well trained in all areas of combat and war leading up to the 1300's, fully prepared in the tactical advantages that are provided by the more fantastic elements of your army, and is ready to engage in end of the world Ragnarok style combat and events. Your army can easily be combined with any other armies you've purchased or acquired providing the benefits of both forces to each other. You can summon forth your army to and from any sea, ocean, or even lake flooding the lands from the shore upon which they emerge.

If no one has the authority to sell something to you, the cost can be sacrificed as a kind of ritual removing it from the world. Everyone knows what you've purchased is yours and you know if someone tries to steal your stuff.  This extends to services also but it can't force someone to do something if they absolutely wouldn't do it under any circumstances, otherwise, you know exactly how much this service costs, unless it involves selling you something, then they have to sell it. As a nice aside you no longer need to track down the owner of the items, just yell out in the museum that you are purchasing a painting and just like Batman acquiring a fancy hotel on a whim it will work itself out. You hold power over the things you own and may wield them completely and freely as you wish. You may  place any arbitrary restrictions on that which you own and it can never be used against you unless you permit it to be so; all that is yours can be revoked and returned to you with ease. Objects, ideas, powers, gifts, thoughts, and skills acquired on loan or temporary trade count as yours for the full  duration of the deal and can not be revoked and under deals or offers set for indeterminate durations they are permanent and irrevocable even if the contract is violated as they are now yours completely and utterly, I pity the fool who lets you borrow their hammer. "
1440,,600,Faithful and Favoured (3),DC Comics,Control,"It seems your religion has survived better into the modern age than that of many deities-or if
you’re mortal, then you’ve somehow built a successful cult from the nearest group of mortals to
your starting location. Fervent and zealous in a way mostly lost to the modern world, your
followers also happen to be quite good at either blending into mundane society or putting up a
front for your religion as a relatively respectable faith. Make no mistake though, every man
woman and child would fall on their sword for you-and in future worlds a similar faith will arise,
though you may choose those you find righteous in your eyes from this one to accompany your
exodus. For 600 CP your followers are numerous enough to rival any major world faith, signifying a revival in a perhaps-old fashioned religion.

Requires Faithful and Favoured (2)"
1441,,600,Cult XCUTION,Bleach,Control,"Contrary to what you might believe with the multiple other dimensions and the sheer number of
spiritual beings, most of the world is completely ignorant of the supernatural. There’s some attempt
to cover up Shinigami activity, but not that much. So, when someone with special powers comes
along, they start to make waves. The shape of this wave is a cult with about seven hundred and
seventy thousand people in its fanatical membership, and they all look to you as a new god. It takes
only a word to drive them into a murderous frenzy on your behalf. Your followers will not follow you
between worlds, however the religion itself will, manifesting itself all over again with around a
roughly equivalent amount of that world’s populace quickly falling sway to your influence."
1442,,600,The Power to Share,Bleach,Control,"Every one hundred years, they say, a special Quincy is born. Born crippled, without their senses and
in a fragile state. Born without the ability to make use of the energy around them. In ages past, these poor things were often killed early on in superstitious fear. Their family had no idea of their true potential. But you survived, the true nature of your power slowly restoring and empowering
your body, until your wounds disappeared and you regained the Quincy powers that are your
birthright. With a touch and acceptance from each side, you can impart a fragment of your soul to another
being. All ailments of the recipient, be they physical or mental or spiritual, will be healed by the
process. In return, the fragment would be engraved with all the knowledge, skills and talents of the person who received the fragment. The price? A severe reduction in lifespan for the recipient and on their death, the fragment would return to you with all it has gathered. Not just the mental traits but
also the stolen lifespan and even a significant amount of the spiritual energy the host once held. These fragments can only be gathered and absorbed in your sleep, the dead treasures combining into your being once you enter the slumber. If you go beyond mere contact, and trade a drop of your blood, you can awaken the powers of a
Quincy in another individual. While this only grants the base traits of a pure Quincy, and is quite
incompatible with Hollow Reiryoku, it also binds them to you. Resisting your commands will prove a
terrible struggle if bound and you may find a way to sustain your life so long as your bound Quincy
remain. Your presence will do them more than enough good to pay recompense, as one who can
share as you do will naturally reinforce greatly the speed at which Quincy develop. Both their Quincy
powers and spiritually in general. The final step you have available is to allow Quincy to drink deeply of a cup of your blood, imbued
with a significant fraction of your soul. This ritual will inscribed a Letter into their spirit, allowing
them to awaken a unique power suited to the Letter and their own personality. The potential for
these ‘Schrift’ varies, based half on overall spiritual power and half on affinity for Quincy abilities. While all Schrift start weak and must be developed, some will end as merely a hardening of the skin or manipulation of fire. Others reach a stranger height, even making the imaginary into reality. There is a downside to your nature. You must continue to share and reclaim from others or else face the prospect of slowly returning to your natural state. Blind, deaf, dumb and helpless in every way. Though it will never kill you, you must always be aware that you rely on the spirits of others to maintain your existence. Hardly fitting for a King. With time and experimentation, it may be possible to uncover new ways to use this power. Yhwach would eventually create techniques that allowed him to resurrect from death so long as the Quincy baring his soul fragments still lived, as well as a method to steal back the fragments and Quincy power in general to redistribute as pleased."
1443,,600,Clone Demon,Bleach,Control,"An army unto oneself, without relying on weakling souls that were already devoured. Even in a
sealed Arrancar form, you have the ability to rapidly produce more of yourself. These clones, of
which dozens can be made in less than a minute, are not perfectly accurate in power. While they
possess the same abilities, appearance, mind and gear that you do, their spiritual levels are
significantly lower. Each has only a fraction of your spiritual energy. An Arrancar that gave a decent
fight to a moderately strong Captain could create clones that Captain would scythe through with
ease or that lieutenant would find somewhat difficult to defeat. However, hundreds or even
thousands of these clones can be made without becoming even weaker, and they have the ability to
remotely transfer back any energy or souls they devour. Additionally, the clones have the power to perfectly imitate the body and mind of any soul they
specifically have devoured. While it only lasts until they send the soul to you, and they cannot
replicate powers outright, it makes for the perfect lure or spy. Especially with how it takes close
observation with specialised tools to discover the Hollow reiatsu of these clones."
1444,,600,Blood of Kings,The Lord of the Rings,Control,"The blood of kings flows through your veins. Your leadership skills and charisma are off the charts; convincing total strangers to follow you into certain death is as easy as drinking a glass of water. Further, certain death isn’t all that certain when you’re in charge; you have a great mastery of tactics and strategy, and the blood of kings enhances your lifespan and retards your aging."
1445,,600,Titan’s Boon,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"Titan favours the strong, and you are certainly strong. To this end, he has chosen to provide you with a little gift.

Actually it’s a huge gift. It’s an adamantortoise, a hulking walking elephant with a shell that could probably withstand sustained artillery fire.

It is loyal to you and tries its best to listen to you, but frankly the thing is so big that you can just barely fit it inside your warehouse. It also moves ridiculously slowly, and when it bellows...well...hope you’re wearing earplugs. It is impervious to most forms of physical damage."
1446,,600,Pompa Sancta What’s fun?,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"A parade, that’s what! You can conjure a parade out of thin air, provided there is enough space for the floats (about the size of a car) to exist. While the parade is going on, everybody’s attention is drawn to the procession and you can slip away. You can create as many floats as you have energy for, but while you are creating them, you may not move. (A normal human could create about 5)

It fails to work if you attempt to cast it repeatedly – after a while even parades get boring!"
1447,,600,Stray Cat ,Final Fantasy XIII,Control,"They won’t suspect a cat...they won’t suspect a thing... You conjure up a cat and it will find its way to a crowd of people you are targeting.

Except it wasn’t a cat. It was a bomb, and it explodes when it reaches its designated point. Four cats are spawned, and each explodes after a minute. It might be one thing to want to rebel, but are you really so heartless as to set off cat shaped bombs on people?

Don’t try to set one off without waiting at least an hour in between – or it may backlash on you."
1448,,600,Breath​ ​Of​ ​Life​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"It was the Asharu that breathed life into all things, and some part of you still remembers the steps. By expending a significant amount of Faith, once per jump you may breathe the divine spark of life into an object or body. This is true life, the birth of a Soul. While some normally inanimate objects simply gain sentience, other might become ambulatory in their forms or even become flesh. A sword gains a soul and may speak to it’s wielder, and even guide the blade. A doll may stand, move and speak. A clay bird could become flesh. All life created in this way knows one language that you speak and is given a rudimentary personality that is thematic to it’s form. This ability is not limited by size, but does not work on things which already have a soul. Life created this way can be taken as a companion. This means yes, your Star Destroyer can be your new Waifu."
1449,,600,Deal​ ​With​ ​The​ ​Devil,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"It’s dangerous to get into a bargain with you. If you will it any deal you make can be backed with Divine Fiat. Nobody would dare willingly renege on a deal with you. Why? They simply can’t. This doesn’t stop you from backing out of a deal in progress, but expect your reputation to take a well deserved hit. Deals can be cancelled if both parties agree to it amicably, of course. If the deal does fall apart and your victim can no longer go through with the deal, you gain power over them as if they were your thrall, and you may ravage them for Faith at your leisure."
1450,,600,New​ ​Host​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Control,"Upon death, most Jumpers are unable to transfer between hosts like other Demons. For them, it is one-and-done until you get your spark, but not you. When your body dies, you may immediately and permanently take over the body of one of your thralled companions once per jump. You do not gain any supernatural abilities they possessed, just their physical form. The companion’s essence is cut from it’s own body and sent back to its home dimension and is not recoverable until post-spark. This removes a companion permanently. Do your friends love you enough to die to keep you alive? They don’t have to be willing."
1451,,600,The Strength of the Weak ,Cradle V1,Control,"Once, you were weak, simply a small fish in a smaller pond. But now, after all your adventures, you have been made strong. You gain an objective sense of how strong you are and lose any lingering feelings of inadequacy or fear from any of your abilities. In addition, you can now project that strength outward, radiating an aura that forces others to understand and acknowledge how powerful you truly are."
1452,,600,Presence,Cradle V1,Control,"You gain a baby presence of the Abidan, similar to Dross. This one has been bonded to you, body and soul. It will naturally learn more about the world as you explore the cradle, and other jumps, and eventually be capable of detailed battle plans, complex real- time simulations and more as it observes the world. Give this baby a few thousand years, and you might have a real presence that can go toe to toe with any of the Judges."
1453,,600,God-Holding Box,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"An irresistible trap for a god. This magnificently-decorated chest is precisely sized for a single god of your choice to fit into. Should the target god see the box, they will definitely step inside it and lie down. 

Once inside they will realize their folly as their godly powers desert them and the box’s lid slams shut, sealing itself with molten lead, putting them completely at your mercy.

The empty box may be re-sized by acquiring the exact measurements of your next target, causing only that god to be drawn into the box and sealed. Be careful you don’t carelessly re-open the lid, or you may find an extremely angry god with its full powers once more."
1454,,600,Divine Inception,Egyptian Mythology,Control,"Mortals give power to the neter through worship, but from where did neter arise? By constructing a shrine, defining the new god’s existence, and making matching offerings and prayers, you may find that in a while a new god has arisen to heed your worship.

The rate of this birth will depend on how narrowly you define its aspect: a god of a specific hill or tree might arise within a moon’s cycle or less, while attempting to bring forth a new god of knowledge when Thoth already holds that title is likely to take a year or more.

This newborn deity is barely of the same strength as a mortal, and may take a long time to grow into its power; again, depending on how many turn to its worship, whether it is competing with similar gods, and how strictly its methods of worship are obeyed."
1455,,600,Master of Magnetism ,Marvel Zombies,Control,"Let’s give credit where it’s due. Magneto was one of the last survivors of Earth-2149. Before the zombies got him, he set up what was to become the last human settlement, sent three survivors and an alternate-universe Reed Richards out of the universe, and held off the superhuman undead. And now, you share his power. As you might expect from the name, you manipulate magnetism. You can manipulate almost every metal out there, fly and create force fields, and much more. Honestly, this is probably the most versatile thing offered so far. You have incredible adroitness and range with this, able to manipulate hundreds of things at once. At your best, you might be able to reach across a star system to affect something, though, again, those showings are less expected in a Marvel Zombies book and more in an X-Men book. and you can expand the breadth of your power into controlling electromagnetism in general."
1456,,600,The Walls Have Blades,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"You’ve learnt the same abilities that the ancient shrine keepers used to protect their holy domain. As long as a wall is present, you may enchant it to become a Wall Demon. If the wall is not durable enough however, it will crumble away.

The Wall Demon’s durability and strength is based off of the material of the wall. It attacks with a pair of swords and claws, all made out of the wall’s material. It normally crawls at a slow pace, but it can merge with walls of similar material and quickly warp itself to another position.

It also has a nasty tendency to try and teleport people away from itself. Especially those who try to taunt it by staying out of range."
1457,,600,Keeper of Precepts,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"With the blessing of the Preceptor, you may bring forth a Level 1 or a Level 2 Esper into permanent existence and they become your companion, with 600 CP to spend. They may not pick a race, but they can pick a background.

It’s an oddity, but should you decide to bring forth Mateus or Zalera, you can’t convince them to part with their long time hostages. The two beings will still count as a single one, as people have been referring to them as such for years. You’ll also find it nearly impossible to free the hostages, at least until they’ve truly become your companion."
1458,,600,Order of Ambrosia,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"The highest amongst all in the Clan, hailed as heroes by all. Their success, a testament to their efforts as a team. Their strength, greatest when they are together. When you and your companions are together, you may move without restriction amongst each other.

The allies together form a “link”, which breaks if the ally moves more than 15 meters away from another. Within that range, allies can teleport freely once per minute. You may also swap places with another ally in the chain freely as long as both of you are not doing anything.

By taking this perk, every companion on hand gets 200 CP for skills. This only applies in this world and does not carry over to any place."
1459,,600,Empyreal Soul ,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"It’s an innocent orb of light in your hands, but if you toss it at a foe, it will summon a flock of Red Chocobos to rush the foe which was struck. About twelve Chocobos in all arrive, and each one will cast a spell to drop twelve meteors on the enemy – enough to level the surrounding area."
1460,,600,Omega...Mark ??,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"You’ve studied mimics intricately, and you’ve figured out how they switch between their box form and their active form. You understand the underlying magic – enough to create your own. With this, you can transform a chest into a companion – with quirks.

You need a chest, of course. The material of the chest will determine how strong the mimic is, the better the material the better the outcome. This form of the chest will also be the static form of the mimic.

You may put up to five items in the chest. The mimic will be able to use those items freely, but cannot recreate them or generate duplicates. You may ask it to store more items of course, but it refuses to use more than five at once. If defeated, the mimic will revert to its chest form and hide as it recovers."
1461,,600,Action: Constraint,Final Fantasy XII,Control,"You curse an enemy with a Gambit that prevents them from acting unless a certain condition is met. While they will be unaware of the constraint except for a faint inclination to perform the task, the constraint itself will wear off after three minutes. You may not directly order them to die off in this way, or place a condition that is impossible for them to achieve."
1462,,600,Legends of the Beast,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Control,"The funny thing about this world is that the greatest threats are always the biggest. And is it wrong, truly? Your previous size constraints are lifted up to that of your average sports stadium, along with the strength and power to match. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that at this point it would take an entire team of heroes to take you down, and it would be quite possible to take a god on if you were to meet them one on one. Aside from this, you will find that other examples of your species will follow you on instinct, recognizing you as their leader and following your instructions to the letter (or at least, as much as a monster can). In addition, you may choose upon entering other worlds if your legend will continue, inserting your story into myth and spawning a small collection of said monsters into the world.

normal formation of the trauma and grief that happens to all other people who get an Otherself.
This has stabilized your Otherself greatly, and the connection between you and them are greater
than most, able to use them like a proxy to help you with your goals and perhaps even help
those with unstable connections as well.

As long as you’re aware of a thing or person’s connection to your mind or soul (as per Merge With Transcedence’s rules), you may attempt to command them as if they were a proxy of your will, through this you need not feel the pain and backlash of trying to possess them like Merge With Transcendence but they’ll be able to interpret the orders and commands you give more vaguely than you might like with some more following the spirit of the orders than others. Of course, if they’re much more powerful than you and if the connection isn’t strong enough then they’ll be able to shrug off commands that much more easily.

For those successfully commanded by this perk, their abilities and powers increase if the task-in-question is beyond their normal ability, possibly not enough to match the intent of the order but enough to give it a try and have a chance, if however small, of completing it. This power fades when their orders are complete.

Another useful thing this Rekindling has granted you is your words hold a dispelling property related to possessions, able to knock controlling spirits and demons from the host with a heart-felt sentence or two about trying to get the person to take back control of their body. This also works on the opposite, allowing you to increase the chance of a person successfully taking control of the entity they’re trying to possess via similar means. This property of the perk seems to increase in significance if you use a commanded proxy to address them for some reason, seems quite ironic, no?

Due to the nature of their being, your Otherself is seen as an easy target for this perk no matter what."
1464,,600,Swapping Lives,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"Your real self couldn’t take it, the stress, the pressure, the laughs and the jeers at their expense... it almost broke them and so they left it, the pain, the suffering of the real world, switching places with you in the process and... it has taken a little while, but you think you understand the trick they did in-order to do this and can now replicate it.

As long as you’re aware of a thing or person’s connection to your mind or soul (as per Merge With Transcedence’s rules), you can swap both their location and lives with your own and vice-versa, including across dimensional and universal barriers. With how powerful and how insecure this connection is making it more difficult to pull off, next to impossible depending on certain beings though you can strengthen your chances by being close to their power or finding a way to strengthen their connection. While you can choose to simply teleport to them or have them teleport to you with a somewhat less difficult chance to do so, the main part of this perk is swapping each other’s lives.

It is as it says, when you swap their lives, they become you and gain any abilities you allow them to gain in that moment and they are forced to take on your perspective, emotions, and personality to a fault though not all of them are overridden. When you swap with them, you gain their memories and their powers but you are not beholden to their morality like you are and even if you were to switch them back, they’d still have aspects of your personality and morality interfering and overriding their own... though you may disable that portion if you so wish if you’re wishing it to be less invasive.

If one of you are killed or are otherwise erased from existence, you or they snap back to their original life.

Due to the nature of this, your real self or Otherself count as incredibly easy to swap with and could allow an Otherself to get into the real world. Due to the fact that you can now potentially access the Otherworld in its entirety with this, as well as become your Otherself by swapping lives, you gain access to the Otherworld Territory creator and 500 TP to spend as well as the Otherself Creation table and 500 OP to use. This may be purchased multiple times.

1465,,600,Merge In Transcendence,Black★Rock Shooter,Control,"The bond between an Otherself and their real counterpart is often one that is not readily realized from the real part, but once you do know it's hard to not realize it or the intense love that the Otherself feels for you. You are instinctively aware of any beings that are attached by even the smallest amount to your soul or mind and how they are utilizing this connection. Want to know if Khrone can use your hatred and rage for himself or any of the other Chaos Gods? This connection will tell you and it will thankfully not be noticed by any of them unless explicitly told.

The two major powers this perk grants is you now can start to merge and utilize the powers of those ‘connected’ to you, by concentrating upon this connection you can either try to take possession of their body and use it as you will, with how well they’re connected and how powerful they are in comparison to yourself increasing the difficulty. You cannot be harmed by this possession other than feeling their pain, but... trying to take control of something like Khorne with just this perk alone is pretty much impossible, possessing your Otherself on the other hand is much easier.

You may also utilize a portion of their power for yourself instead of straight-up possessing them, coming with none of the drawbacks of having to fight to get them under control but typically being weaker than them. The more powerful they are, as well as how loose this connection is, the more time it takes to begin using their abilities.

Due to the nature of this connection and how you’ve opened yourself up so heavily to your Otherself, the Otherself Creation Table is now open to you and you gain 500 OP to spend on it. This may be purchased multiple times.

And yet, as you are entangled in a teeming mass of vines and thorns, bound to your will even as they bind you ever more tightly to make you feel and ounce of the shame and hurt you've subjected others to, you can't help but feel a little bit of - eugh - hope for a brighter future for yourself. The more this hope grows inside you, the greater you feel your control becomes - the thorns and the shapes they make becoming more consistent as your determination swells. It is not the strongest ability or the most devastating, but as a reflection of who you want to be, it is more than enough. The thorns may cut you or others, but if you want, they can become blossoms and be a gift to the world rather than a thing that takes from it."

But the nature of the prison is one of perception, and so long as you perceive them as anything at all, flaws in the nature of the prison may emerge. A limitation, but a necessary one - if it did not exist, then the prison could not function. It would crumble away like dust and all this would be for naught."

The good news is that you have developed a legion of fully realized Voices who are all just as powerful as you are and have the ability to impose lasting effects upon the world as well as possess a single body or multiple bodies to interact with the world. The bad news is that they're all just as powerful as you and have their own personalities distinct from you. Whilst they'll generally agree with whatever you go with, they have their own thoughts and opinions, and they will gladly make them known by doing things you didn't plan for. So even though they may all collectively agree to kill or cause endless trouble for one person in particular if that's your wish, someone who might even be trying to help you throughout this whole ordeal speaking hypothetically, they might also decide to do something else for whatever silly reason.

Dragons however can grow very large with time so your ability to call and dismiss your pet has been upgraded, allowing you to dismiss and call back your pet from wherever it goes between calls even in other worlds.

1470,,600,Sirens Song,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"A bard is not a bard if they cannot hold a tune, sure you could play an instrument well enough, blow a flute, strum a guitar, but then when the chips are down you have what it really takes. A voice that is beguiling and glorious to hear no matter the specific tone and the ability to sing for hours without break if need be. Sing to your hearts content. Though you may not think your voice is all that amazing those who hear you would heartily disagree, the sound of your voice has a bewitching quality to it causing all who hear it to stop and stare in rapt attention as they are caught in the sirens call of your song. You can choose when this ability is active and may choose not to apply it if you wish, though if used in battle those around you are not likely to be effected as they will have much more pressing issues at hand."
1471,,600,Beast Friend Forever,Final Fantasy XI,Control,"Often times a beastmaster will charm a wild beast to fight with him, other times he will summon a beast from carefully crafted items called jugs, both of these kinds of familiars have their strengths and weaknesses, whichever way you prefer you can now cause a creature to become your familiar above all other familiars you control. This beast can be called at any time and you may change it if you choose, however this beast will grow stronger the longer the two of you fight together slowly growing and becoming stronger just as you do. As you grow so does it and the same goes for when it grows allowing you both to become stronger in a much shorter time. This familiar bond has more uses than one may expect, for instance your beast will often go out of its way to try to please you and when injured it will heal extremely quickly simply by being close to you and you will do the same when close to it."

Your family has some special things about it, notably that your parents were astonishingly powerful members of the supernatural community of this world. In some way, they are tied in quite deeply to the story of the world, though not nearly enough to change it on their own, and they possess a large amount of power. Whatever their ties are to other groups in this world, they love you far more and would even betray their former comrades to protect their child. In future worlds, your parents will be similarly powerful and connected to the story, also sharing this same care for you."

Executioners had to be recruited to carry out the job of the man in charge, now that he could no longer manage it on his own. You too can create deputies like this, though yours are quite special. You are able to designate other people, provided they are willing, as Executioners for you. They will then count as if they were you for the purposes of growth, acting as proxies for your own growth. What they learn will become what you learn, the souls they devour will instead be transferred to you, the training they do empower your own body and so on. The reverse is not true, they serve you after all, but their work will make you able to manage all the easier. You may only create up to eight Executioners at a time. "

Almost another you. This other you is in actuality a simple clone, much like the sort that are created through techniques that exist elsewhere in this world. Only this clone is alive. Not just independent, but really, truly and permanently alive. Their personality resembles yours but there’s a good number of major differences, enough that people could definitely tell you apart by talking to both of you. For the most part, they’re a perfect clone of you. They have all your abilities and powers, even your weapons and armour, though these are of lower quality. They don’t have any other items and the further they get from you, the weaker they’ll become in comparison to you. They’ll only weaken down to a certain point and any power that they gain on their own won’t suffer from distance between the two of you. They count as a new companion and they’re very loyal to the original, that being you.

Boosted: You've got a brotherhood now, a brotherhood of your own twin brothers. The singular perfect clone you had before now becomes nine individual clones, a band of brethren that have a bond to you stronger than their own instinct for self-preservation. They count as a single group companion, without imports being divided equally in some way amongst them, and their combined nature allows them to range much further away from you than normal before their power will start to fade from being equal to your own.

You can throw around cars like tennis balls and as you grow in the power of your life energy, so too will the strength of your telekinesis grow. Your control will increase as you train it and there’s little upper limit to your finesse, eventually you might even be able to control matter on the atomic level, waving your hand to transmute objects into entirely different things."
1476,,600,Overlord,The God of High School Jump,Control,"The minds of mortals are petty little things, all too easy for a God to force to submit. Your innate power involves the domination and control of the minds of others.

At first, you will be limited to those you can see but as your power increases, your range and the difficulty or resisting you will grow."

King of the Earth allows for a multitude of powerful abilities. First is the summoning of angels and Nephilim in great numbers, who will come to loyally aid the user against any foes. The Charyeok’s second and most useful ability is the power to create matter from nothing but life energy. From a large number of swords, or simple a very large sword, to instantly restoring severed limbs or healing terrible wounds on the bodies of people around you, your potential is only really limited by your imagination, your understanding and your energy. King of the Earth is also able to teleport its user and those around them over long distances, as well as create powerful energy shields to defend its partner."
1478,,600,Lingering Will,Final Fantasy X,Control,"With enough dead, with enough lingering sentiments, that which rises again will be more than just a shuffling corpse. Whether it is an intense and focused hatred or the shackles of sorrow and regret that ties the dead together, as long as there are enough dead around you and you can supply the necessary spiritual energy, you can gather their lingering sentiments to create a fiend.

The size and capability of the fiend naturally are determined by the strength of these sentiments as well as the quantity. Massacring a city will provide you with a plentiful amount of spirits – killing them brutally enough will create strong enough sentiments. The only question left to be answered is...why would you want to do this?"
1479,,600,Rejecting the False Tradition,Final Fantasy X,Control,"The Fayth that will speak to you will warn you of what is to come – and to face the real threat you’ll need to gather the resolve inside you to break away from tradition. The tradition that Yu Yevon set in place is nothing but a lie...a lie that will perpetuate itself if you don’t reject it.

You shouldn’t be alive, you shouldn’t be walking, but somehow you are. Memories of being struck down at Zanarkand linger in your mind, but you know only one thing – you’re still alive somehow, with fragments of strength still clinging to you. Though Yu Yevon has made it so that the Fayth of Spira will never speak to you again, you still possess a fragment of their strength.

Of the Aeons you have gathered, those available in Spira, you still possess three. You may decide whether they become companions or remain as summons, but all three possess the capacity for growth regardless of how you treat them. Unlike the Dark Aeon however, this trio will only grow as they are exposed to your strength, and very slowly at that."
1480,,600,The Final Aeon,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Perhaps you already reached Zanarkand once. Perhaps this is your last moment of preparation before Sin. But fate is cruel. The Aeons you have collected will all be butchered and Sin will be reborn. From among the masses of Aeons that you have already come to possess – out of those available in Spira, you may pick a single one. The corruption of Yu Yevon lingers on them, and they’ll become a Heretic Aeon, but you may decide whether they are a summon or companion.

The Dark Aeon is a forbidden force, and you’ll find that though they start off already very strong – they also grow steadily as they consume spirits of the same nature as them."

You gain their body as an alt-form permanently but cannot traditionally swap alt-forms for the rest of that Jump. Perks that allow you to manifest/combine alt-form traits ignore this restriction. As you practice this you can utilize it on corpses further removed from human physiology. You can use this to automatically escape death but it consumes any available charges and doesn’t work for any other chain failure condition."

Either underneath a property you own or simply in an out of the way location near your starting point, lies an underground set of tombs. These tombs are filled with nests, each dedicated to spawning a specific sort of supernatural vermin. Whatever one sort they make is up to you but they only need a bit of biomass and some tender love and care to start producing. Whether you want Worms, Spiders, Rats or some other creepy crawly, they all share several supernatural properties. You can see through the eyes of any of your vermin as long as they are not more than 100 kilometres from you. Each one is about as deadly as a Japanese Giant Hornet, they obey any command you give them and more importantly, each one functions as its own magical circuit, which can be placed inside another person and they can use it as if it were their own. Unlike Zouken's Worms, these do not put undue stress on the user’s body to use, though they do take up space so you can only fit as many in as physically possible. They also won't require any unsavoury attentions to grow properly."
1483,,600,Domination,Fate/Stay Night,Control,"It was the Makiri family who created the Command Seal spell that would become so integral to the operation of the Grail Wars. Only the ancient head of that family, Zouken, may still remember how to create new ones, though others have since figured out how to transfer existing ones. Not only can you make new ones as good as Zouken in his prime but you are not limited to creating these for just Servants in the Grail War. Whilst expensive and time consuming to craft, you are able to apply these Command Seals to any target willing, or simply unable to resist, to take them. The wielder of these Command Seals is either yourself or a person of your choice and the bond between the wielder and the target automatically forms. The spells work exactly as they would as if they were the normal set of 3 Seals any Master gets, the only difference being the targets, wielder and number are now chosen by you, as long as you go through the effort of their creation.

Boosted: Domination gives you the ability to pre-make Command Seals for later, instant use. The process is the same in time, effort and materials required but once complete, the Seals may be stored on a containing medium such as paper or leather. These may be used by the wielder to boost their own power as if they were on the user’s body or be placed on someone to instantly create a bond between that person and the seal that came into contact with them. For all intents and purposes, this is like you have created a Command Seal linking them to you as the Master in an instant, though the usual limitation of them resisting if they have enough power still exists.

A new friend made at school turns out to be a powerful young heir to an ancient magic family, for instance or a teacher who has a secret past of being a powerful enforcer for the supernatural dark side of the city. You'll frequently encounter these people, ones with special abilities or incredible skills, as you go through life and find that most of them are easily befriended or allied with by you. While often powerful or in possession of useful skills, these people would not change the course of the world on their own. Not without you there to push them into action.

Boosted: Fated Encounters gives you an uncanny ability to also encounter existing characters in the world's you go to in favourable situations. These pre-existing characters often find their own reasons to like you, as long as you aren't anything or don't do anything to make it otherwise, and adding any of your own charisma to the situation can result in fast friendships. You'll find that it's quite easy to join up with any protagonists and become a trusted friend, with only a little work.

Ozma, now Ozpin, is one of them, given a means of immortality to allow him to guide humanity throughout the ages. Alas... I am sure the Old Man regrets his decision by now. You have a similar means of resurrection.

Once per Jump, in the event of your death, you will be able to reincarnate into the body of a random character inside your current world. Bit by bit, your souls will merge, leaving you as the dominant force. At first you’re only a voice in their head but will soon be able to take control from them and bit by bit, your old powers will return. The more you use your powers the quicker this process becomes and the sooner you two will merge. Post-Jump, they may be given their own body back and you are free to take them with you as a companion. The Character you incarnate into will never be a ‘major’ or even ‘known’ character of the World. With you in their head, they are bound to get involved in the greater events though.

Should you be... disturbed by the implications, you may choose to instead reincarnate into an empty, sentient less body that will be created ex nihilo. However you will still have to work your way up to get used to your powers again."
1486,,600,Black Waltz ,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"When Black Mages were created for the purpose of war, the Black Waltz was also part of the project, but due to a more complex creation purpose, they were never officially mass produced. To date, it is assumed that there was a very limited amount of them produced.

At a glance, they appear to be winged Black Mages, though seen in action it quickly becomes apparent that these units would have most likely served as field commanders or specialists. Certainly, they are rather adept at ambushing enemies. You can conjure these into existence one at a time.

Though they’re rather durable and they’re reluctantly subservient to you at first, their presence alone saps your energy somewhat, and the pool of energy they cast spells from draws out of your own. Unless you have substantial micromanagement capabilities and a massive energy pool – managing more than one at once will prove to be very draining. Perhaps in line with their nature as specialists, they function best in small groups."
1487,,600,White Waltz ,Final Fantasy IX,Control,"No one remembers anymore exactly how the Black Mages came to be, neither the when nor the how. It is known however, that a great deal of experimentation came to pass, and many different prototypes were created. The Waltz series seems to be significantly more advanced than the standard Black Mage, having a more substantial physical presence and greater magic repertoire. Each time you travel to a foreign locale, a White Waltz will be present to greet you – though it usually veils itself under a different guise.

The White Waltz is a defensive variation of a Black Waltz, clothed in white robes. Proficient in all manners of White Magic from basic to advanced spells, this automaton is capable of teaching others in rudimentary elements of its trade. It isn’t just an expert in healing – it also has layers upon layers of defensive magic for external attacks. That however, comes at a toll on its body.

Unless you can rectify the issues with its limited life span, the White Waltz won’t be able to hold together for the entire ten years. Each White Waltz is its own unique entity however, and its fragile nature prevents you from dragging it along with you between worlds."

1489,,600,Actualization,Final Fantasy VIII,Control,"Drawing from a person's mind, you can crystalize their fears, beliefs and imagination into their image of the most powerful spirit or creature. This being works like a Guardian Force made flesh, and far stronger than GFs usually are. It can exist on its own indefinitely, never needing to retreat to your mind to recharge or gather its energy to act on the outside world, fully capable of independent thought and completely under your control. If the person you drew this GF from is awed or frightened by this manifestation, then it steadily grows in power, its strength building through its bind to their mind and its existence born from their thoughts. The greater their fear or beliefs about this creature, the greater the power. You may even Junction with it like you would a normal GF, only this is instead a physical process. Both of you bind together into a new, monstrous form which greatly increases the GF's powers as well as your own magic. You instantly gain understanding of how to use the GF's power and this new body, and may even shift its appearance somewhat. You can only have one of these creatures active at a time, but the only cooldown between dismissing one and summoning another is the amount of time it takes to tap into the opponent's imagination."
1490,,600,My Masterpieces ,Solo Leveling,Control,"The terrifying stone statues on the Double Dungeon were one of the mightiest creations of the Architect. These monsters in the shape of statues are much more than regular golems, and it shows in their power. To begin with, each statue is as strong as an S-Rank Hunter, easily capable of annihilating in a moment anything but the strongest A-Rank Hunters, who may stall them for a few seconds. Not only that, but they display a toughness that seems to be above their level, with only the strongest S-Rank Hunters being able to do lasting damage.

Among them, there are two special statues. One, a giant statue, being multiple stories tall made in the image of ‘God’. It displays a strength and speed that enters the realm of National Ranked Hunters, and is capable of using laser beams that can atomize all but the strongest S-Ranked Hunters in an instant. The second statue, one in the image of an ‘Angel’ that closely resembles the Rulers, seems to be even stronger than the Statue God in physical terms, having reflexes, speed and strength that can cause a serious trouble to a National Ranked Hunter. Not only that, but this ‘Angel’ statue is also capable of using the signature ability of the Rulers, the Telekinesis known as ‘Ruler’s Hand’.

An equivalent set of all of these is now in your possession. Either by being added to your Warehouse or another propriety of your choice, a door leading to a room similar to the one that contained these statues will be made available to you at the beginning of each Jump. There, you can ‘link up’ with these Statues just like the Architect did, allowing yourself to give free mental commands to these Statues, and even being able to use the ‘Angel’ statue as an avatar of sorts. Once you are linked up, you can even use the magical infused stone to repair the statues with a single though, but if the Angel Statue is destroyed, you will lose control to all the statues and won’t be able to use them until the next month, where a new set will appear in the same room that you use to link up.

It should also be noted that pain is transmitted through the Angel statue, although its death won’t really harm you. Maybe a design flaw from the Architect, maybe a feature that you can use to your benefit."
1491,,600,Star of Extinction: Celestial Predator        ,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"A small planetoid, reminiscent of the Household of the Arch-Demon Khvarenah. In fact, it looks exactly like him and his followers, save for the fact that it is of the size of a medium-sized moon and not yet of the size of a massive planet. Whether a failed member of Saurva that wandered off, or another creation entirely of the Forge of Ruin, this small planetoid has latched onto you, and designated you as its new master. Its intelligence is close to that of a human, albeit in a more animalistic way, and its power below that of a Star Spirit, at least for now, is not that far from that of the Special-Ranked Daeva.

Its more remarkable trait, besides the capability of teleporting like an actual Star Spirit and moving through space at faster than light speeds, is its capability to grow and reproduce. If it can consume matter via its gargantuan mouths, it could indefinitely grow in size, perhaps one day reaching the size of its distant cousins of the Star Cluster of Extinction, and once it grows big enough, it can reproduce on its own and create a small copy of itself, again of the size of a small moon. Then, the process will repeat. Any of these beings are as loyal as the first one, and all of them will follow you in your future adventures, being able to be called at any location, and by default spawning somewhere in your stellar vicinity.

You can communicate with them regardless of distance via telepathy, and they are quite adept at coordinating, even with their immense size."
1492,,600,The Holy King: Rogue Terminal,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"You have undertaken a Commandment similar to the one taken by the Holy King Sirius. That is, you have become one of the prime leaders of the Yazata, a King like the one that rules Wahman Yasht, becoming similarly blessed by an Ashavan Star Spirit of great might. And just like him, instead of just succumbing to the will of the Star Spirit and becoming its terminal, you pushed through it and tamed the Star Spirit.

While it will remain up to you to see what effect this actually has on the current state of the universe and the war between good and evil, this great status comes with several abilities: first, you are able to distribute and recharge blessings similar to the feathers granted by Vohu Manah. This also allows you to track everyone who has been gifted with these blessings, as well, just take them away or undo any techniques performed by them.

Not only that, but you also gain an Authority over every creature of good that comes to live under your lands, similar to a Star Spirit. Each of their names and faces become engraved in your memory, which has become basically limitless for this aspect, and when they swear to become warriors of Good under your name, you gain an almost total control over them, except for extremely strong individuals. You can order them to sleep, or even take away their life force to power yourself in times of extreme distress. More than that, in times of great peril, you are able to call unto the full power of the Star Spirit, partially manifesting them to aid you in battle.

Finally, as one of the pillars of the Wahman Yast, you carry an imposing effect: you find that whenever you end the life of one of the leaders of an opposing faction, the numbers of your own faction increase as well, and their forces have a much harder time recomposing themselves."
1493,,600,Lady of Shadows,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"Death’s not something to be feared. It’s not an absolute, not to the truly powerful. To some, it’s a matter of becoming so strong that death is just extremely unlikely. To others, it’s more of a dependence on another thing. A link that forms between two things that become important to one another. A woman who became strong enough to slay Gods and the World itself, for example. Your link is nothing so special but still a great boon. You may choose a single willing being or object that you own to link your life to. So long as that being lives and remains in the same world as you, you can’t die. You can be hurt and ravaged and reduced to uselessness but you won’t be killed. Your linked partner can however, be killed. If they cease to be able to be killed or harmed, the link between the two of you will break and you’ll need to swap to another partner.

Boosted: You can create a chain of links now, each one needing to be killed in proper order to unlock the death of the next person. You are able to create a chain of up to 8 such links at a time in sequential order, beginning with yourself and going through each other person.

1494,,600,Phantom of the Order,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"A Phantom is a unique existence amongst Servants. A being that ordinarily would not be sufficient to qualify as a Heroic Spirit yet has been summoned and bound to an existing, more qualified Servant to change it and grant it greater power. This process has been done to you, even if you’re a human, binding a Phantom to your soul and granting you certain abilities alongside it. You gain 500 Servant Points to spend in the Servant Supplement that may only be spent on Skills or Noble Phantasms. These points are entirely independent of any existing purchases there, meaning that there are no freebies or discounts with these points and they cannot upgrade what you have there already. While these points can grant a lot of power, they must be based on a qualifying spirit. Phantoms take much inspiration from Urban Legends and other low renown legends, one of which you must choose to base your purchases on. The phantom will likely give some alteration to your body or even mind when in use, such as appearing as a great wolf mount for you to ride or making you far more bloodthirsty when its powers are used. Through this process, you also gain knowledge of how to do the same in the future, fusing phantoms or similar spirits to other beings to create combinations like yourself, though you are given no way of accessing such spirits or phantoms through just this."
1495,,600,Grand Summoning,Fate/Grand Order,Control,"The Throne of Heroes can be quite capricious with those it chooses to release into the hands of a Master. You might aim for a Servant and get them in their elderly years or as a youth, before their great achievements. You might get them sans their most legendary equipment or in a flawed, berserk state. You’ve perfected your rituals however and learnt a method to always summon the greatest possible version of your target, combining their most suitable bodies, minds, equipment and powers for you. You’ll summon your Servant or other summon with their most powerful gear, their fittest and most appropriate physical body, their best abilities and their most suitable mental state. Your summons are effectively working at their peak ability at all times."
1496,,600,Yesterday’s Promise,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Control,"Contracts, probably the most important concept in the City, everyone bar some Syndicates operates via some kind of contract, be they Fixers who get paid per job or workers for a business which pays a salary. And the idea of fine print is a very common way that people get screwed over and end up signing away more than they were willing to give. You were burned by this as well, correct? They say the devil is in the details after all, so why not give it a try yourself? Write up some contracts, they have to look nice and unique, so how about illuminated letters? Now, before terms are made how will those who violate their obligation be punished? Well putting their entire body up as collateral is a bit overkill but fair, how about letting the wronged party have a free pick of their organs? You now can write completely binding contracts, with those who break the contract being punished in whichever way is written, with you temporarily gaining abilities to punish the offender, though these powers only work on the target and will minimize collateral damage on their own. And don’t worry about someone actually reading the contract fully, since fine print can be as small as the subatomic scale, or even written in a ciphered message on that scale. They’ll probably call bullshit on this, but they already signed it, so it’s really their fault for not reading it well enough."

It has 3 forms, a human sized humanoid(though it may not look fully human), a book form (which seems to match your preferences of aesthetics) and a beast form which will be similar to Serpents in both size and ability. It can grow stronger in time with knowledge, training and things to absorb but it doesn’t need to. You can summon it at will as it will be completely obedient to you."
1498,,600,Harbinger of Fate,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Control,"Sometimes protecting the timeline involves taking drastic actions. When Sephiroth killed Barrett, the Whispers resurrected him, knowing Avalanche’s leader was needed for the One-Winged Man’s eventual downfall. You too may resurrect someone who has been killed in the last minute. You may only do this once per day, and only if their survival is essential to your long-term goals, but sometimes a second chance is all you need. You can also resurrect yourself, although you are limited to doing this once per jump.

You can also subtly “nudge” people towards desired outcomes, encouraging small changes in their choices and actions to steer them towards their destiny. You can even send your own spectres to exert minor forces on their environment. With all these minute changes, one might question this power’s impact on free will. But when destiny itself is at stake, can you afford to leave things to chance?

Boosted: Breaking Destiny
 
Or perhaps you walk the path of the One-Winged Man, out to shatter the confines of fate. Causality holds little sway over you, making you immune to time-paradoxes and other effects that would overwrite your existence. You are the sole determinant of your life’s outcome. Your power to intervene has also greatly expanded. Instead of using unseen spectres to gently push others along, you may summon more tangible aid to reach your goals. You may pull a formerly-dead soldier from a neighboring timeline to fight once more. Or maybe you want to summon future versions of those pesky heroes to stop them from making a mistake they don’t even understand. So long as you can find assistance in the myriad of timelines, you can bring them to your world, for a time. See the Notes section for additional details.

1499,,600,Shadow Bugs,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Control,"You have obtained a large supply of Shadow Bugs. These small purple spheres typically must be extracted from Mr. Game & Watch, or another of his kind; fortunately, this step has already been taken care of. Your supply is equal in number to the quantity possessed by Tabuu prior to the attack on Midair Stadium.

Shadow Bugs are capable of combining together to create various creatures, most common amongst them being the simple Primid and its variations. By briefly enveloping another creature, the Shadow Bugs are able to form into a false clone of that creature, replicating its form and techniques. Such clones emit a distinct purple aura, making it easy to tell the clone from the original. This process can be resisted, meaning the Shadow Bugs can only do this with a willing party, or one unable to fight back (such as a Fighter in their Trophy Form). Occasionally, they can even create a clone by replicating technology; they were able to use Samus’ Power Suit in order to create Samus clones. The strongest being Shadow Bugs were able to become was Duon, which could be defeated by six Fighters working together, and took an excessive amount of Shadow Bugs to create. Generally, it is more useful to employ them as fodder troops rather than high powered threats.

Shadow Bugs provided by this item are completely loyal to you, though depending on their form complex orders may be beyond them. These Shadow Bugs do not count as either followers or companions, and as such will not be able to follow you between jumps under the power of this item alone. At the start of each new jump, you may choose to receive a new supply of Shadow Bugs. Post-chain, you may choose to receive a new supply of Shadow Bugs once every ten years.

As for the power it holds, that’s up to you. 

A Miraculous with a useful ability like the Horse or Dragon, costs 400 CP.

1504,,600,This Is My Town,High School DxD,Control,"‘Let sleeping Dragons lie’ are wise words that have been uttered in the past. Whether or not you’re a Dragon yourself, you have a naturally intimidating aura around yourself, a cloud of killing intent that wards away potential foes and makes even those stronger than you hesitate, if briefly. What’s more, any deeds or actions that you take which become public knowledge are blown out of proportion - if you saved a man, you are called a great hero. If you slew a couple Devils, you are feared by many of their kin as though you were a holy avenger. Your reputation will snowball until you can barely live up to what they say about you - your foes will shake in terror at your name, and powerful allies will flock to your side. You can even ‘ride’ the power of this infamy in battle, using it to make your opponents doubt their superiority, or cause a stronger foe to stumble because he is uncertain if you’re just toying with him. Just...take care when someone inevitably calls your bluff. Actions speak louder than words, after all."
1505,,600,Rika,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"As the result of some event in your past, a special grade cursed spirit has become bound to you, and a rather powerful one at that. Though their exact appearance and personality are up to you, one thing is certain: they’re incredibly loyal to you, perhaps to an obsessive degree. They possess no cursed technique of their own, but more than make up for this with their incredible physical ability, strong enough to effortlessly restrain even those with superhuman strength like Itadori, crush an overpass into rubble with a single blow, or reduce lesser cursed spirits into a splatter of blood, as well as get hit hard enough to be sent flying through buildings with little harm to show for it.

Most of the time they lie dormant within your soul and only manifest into the outside world when you will them to, though they can automatically emerge and act of their own accord when you’re in danger. As such, though they’ll unfailingly follow your orders they also possess a good degree of autonomy, which is aided by the fact that they can remain manifested even many hundreds of metres away from you, and perhaps even further still.

All of the above feats are only when they are partially manifested, however. By taking some kind of symbolic action – such as putting on a ring, or chanting a specific incantation – you can cause your cursed spirit to fully manifest, opening up a vast array of uses. The first is that you may use them as a battery for cursed energy of sorts, storing energy within them whenever you like and withdrawing it during their full manifestation, letting you far exceed your usual limits. Their storage capacity is endless, but it’s not just energy they can stockpile. They’re also capable of storing objects within an extradimensional space inside their body, which you can take out while manifested.

Fully manifesting your cursed spirit also increases its physical abilities by a good deal, and allows both you and it to fire off beams of cursed energy similar to Cursed Energy Discharge (though definitely not to the same level of power). None of these are the greatest draw of this. No, that would be the way it enables you to copy the cursed techniques of others. By having your cursed spirit eat part of the body of another person, such as their arm, you’re able to copy their cursed technique. So long as your cursed spirit is fully manifested, you can freely use any copied cursed techniques as your own, though it’ll be up to you to master them. There’s also no limit to the number of cursed techniques you can copy using this.

The only downside to this is that full manifestation has a limited duration, lasting for only five minutes before it can’t be sustained anymore. Your cursed spirit can also theoretically be killed, though if this happens it’ll just retreat to inside your soul to heal for a while, unable to be used for a few days."
1506,,600,Cursed Spirit Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"An incredibly rare but potent technique, you have the ability to control cursed spirits. So long as you defeat them or leave them too weak to resist – or you’re strong enough that defeating them would be completely effortless – you can convert them into a small orb of cursed energy. By swallowing this orb you absorb the cursed spirit into yourself, allowing you to summon them at any time with just a thought from black portals you can manifest around your body. Summoned cursed spirits are completely obedient to you, following your mental commands without question and dying for you without a second thought if ordered to.

There’s no limit to the number of cursed spirits you can absorb with this technique as well as no limit how strong they can be, though their power cannot grow any further after they’ve been absorbed. Naturally, this technique’s greatest strength is the sheer breadth of abilities it gives the user access to – absorbed cursed spirits retain the abilities they had before, so absorbing one with a cursed technique effectively allows you to wield it as your own through them. You’re also not limited in how many you can summon at once, so drowning someone in a horde of curses is certainly possible. Of course, if one of your summoned cursed spirits is killed it’s gone for good, so some prudence may be advised.

This technique works on beings similar to cursed spirits in other worlds as well – so long as it’s vaguely spiritual in nature, you can use this technique to absorb it. In addition, whenever you enter a new Jump you may choose to have cursed spirits naturally occur there too, behaving just as they do here. Depending on the setting, they may be primarily concentrated in a single broad location (such as a country) with sparse appearances elsewhere or occur evenly across the world."
1507,,600,Star Rage,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You have the ability to add virtual mass to yourself. Due to its imaginary nature, any mass gained through this technique doesn’t slow your movements or hinder your mobility at all, but instead vastly increases the power of your blows. With a single punch using this you could exorcise a special grade cursed spirit, or severely injure a special grade sorcerer and send them flying despite using their cursed energy to reinforce their body. As such, your striking power is completely unparalleled.

There’s no limit to the amount of mass you can add to yourself, the amount that you gain only being restricted by the cursed energy you put in. However, although it is almost immeasurably high, there is a point at which you start to become affected by the virtual mass you add: the point at which you become so heavy that your body condenses into a black hole. Though by your will you can suppress it so that it only affects a certain radius around you and disappears after a certain amount of time, unrestrained this is a true black hole, able to destroy the entire world. Unless you have some way to survive this, it’s probably best to keep it in reserve as a last resort.

Your cursed technique also inherently comes with a shikigami: a bony, serpentine creature known as Garuda, with eight small wings that allow it to fly. The main use of Garuda is to enhance the variety of your own attacks, as you can also apply Star Rage’s effects to it. You could grasp it by the tail and swing it like a whip, make it roll up into a ball and throw it as a projectile, or command it to ensnare someone and weigh them down. It’s also capable of attacking separately from you, and to great effect if you use your technique to bolster it. Though it can be killed, it will revive after 24 hours if this happens.

The only real downside to this technique is that, because the mass it adds is virtual, your tensile strength doesn’t increase with it, making you only as durable as you would normally be."
1508,,600,Jujutsu House,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"Three great houses dominate the political landscape of jujutsu society: the Zenin, Kamo, and Gojo clans. Now, however, you’ve become the head of a clan of jujutsu sorcerers of your own, one every bit the equal of the Big Three. Your power is such that you could exert great leverage on the way Japan’s jujutsu community functions, from being able to implement new regulations and imposing punishments upon your rivals to even having some influence over the nation’s Prime Minister himself. While you may not be the direct leader of the jujutsu community, it’d be hard for them to get much of anything done without your assent.

It's not just political might that you wield – the actual family who make up your clan are nothing to scoff at, either. A hundred or so members make up your clan, all of whom are sorcerers in their own right. While most will generally hover around the grade 3 mark, and many won’t even have a cursed technique of their own, there are about a dozen members ranked at semi-grade 1 or above, each of whom possess varied and unusual techniques of their own. These more powerful members form the leadership under you, and manage the affairs of the clan decently competently in your absence. Of course, it’d be a waste not to mention the clan’s headquarters too: a stunning, almost palatial complex built in a traditional Japanese architectural style, with plenty of room for its members to live in, training grounds, and even a stockpile of decently powerful cursed tools.

Aside from this, the structure, culture, and demographics of your clan are all up to you. While most of the existing ones are rather conservative in their outlook, this need not be the case for yours. In addition, if you possess a cursed technique you may opt for it to become an inherited technique, one associated with the very clan itself and passed down through its members for centuries. While most members of this family will still possess techniques of their own, there’ll be at least a few other than you who’ll be able to use it.

If you wish, you may instead choose to become the head of an existing clan if you have a certain cursed technique. These are: Blood Manipulation for the Kamo Clan, Limitless for the Gojo Clan, Ten Shadows Technique or Projection Sorcery for the Zenin Clan, or Cursed Speech for the Inumaki Clan."
1509,,600,Prison Realm,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"A red, fleshy cube, each face covered in ever-staring eyes, Prison Realm is an unusual thing made from the body of the monk Genshin. A special grade cursed object, it has a power worthy of that ranking: the ability to seal anyone, imprisoning them within a pocket dimension within itself, from which escape from the inside is impossible. That said, there are quite a few steps needed to get Prison Realm to activate.

First, the user must chant a short incantation to open Prison Realm, causing it to expand into a mass of meat as tall as a man, stretched out between four cubic corners with a bleeding, unblinking eye in the very centre. Once opened, whoever you wish to seal must be kept within a four-metre radius of it for one minute – though, notably, this doesn’t have to be a minute in real time: just a minute from the perception of the target. As such, someone reminiscing about a series of events in the past can cause it to trigger, even if mere moments passed in the real world.

As soon as this condition is met, Prison Realm morphs into a set of cubes surrounding the target, from which sinewy protrusions instantaneously shoot forth to bind to their body. This not only completely restrains the target, preventing them from moving or breaking free, but also renders them unable to use cursed energy, or any other supernatural abilities for that matter. The only step that remains is a final short incantation, causing the Prison Realm to snap shut and return to its original form, sealing the target within.

The pocket dimension inside of the cursed object is little more than an impossibly deep pit lined with endless amounts of skeletal remains. Though the sealed target always remains conscious, time does not pass in that place – they do not age at all, and the only way they can die is if they take their own life.

There are only two ways to release someone from the Prison Realm: one, if the owner of it wills the person sealed within to be released. Two, if it is targeted by an effect that nullifies cursed techniques. Otherwise, it is wholly inviolable and indestructible. 

While it being targeted by a cursed technique nullifying effect will destroy it, if such a thing happens you will receive a new copy after ten years or at the start of the next Jump, whichever comes first."
1510,,600,Brainjaku,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You’re able to steal the bodies of other people. So long as they’re unable to resist – be it due to being unconscious or simply dead – you’re able to transplant your brain into their skull with your technique. By doing so, you’re capable of extending your life indefinitely by switching bodies every few decades. It’s not just their body that you get, though: you also receive all of the target’s memories as well as their cursed energy, making you indistinguishable from the original even to a user of the Six Eyes. The only indication that you’ve stolen someone’s body is a scar along the forehead, a remnant from you entering their skull.

But it’s not just the target’s memories you receive when you steal someone’s body – you also receive the cursed technique they had in life. Not only can you use it as your own, but it becomes an inherent part of you, allowing you to keep using it even if you transfer into another body afterwards. It’s said, though, that one can only possess a certain amount of cursed techniques before their brain overloads. By default, you can copy up to three techniques (not including this one) using this, though you can always delete one you don’t want if you come across something else you want."
1511,,600,Ten Shadows Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"You’ve gained access to the hereditary cursed technique of the Zenin Clan, which focuses on summoning shikigami (familiars similar to cursed spirits, often with abilities of their own) using specific hand signs and one’s shadow as a medium. As its name implies, the Ten Shadows Technique has ten shikigami that can be summoned through it, with more powerful shikigami requiring more cursed energy to summon.

By default a user begins with only the first available to them: the Divine Dogs, a pair of wolves, one black and one white, that can be used to defeat weaker curses and for tracking. To gain access to the other nine shikigami, the user must first summon them using a ritual. When brought out in this way they will initially be hostile, but will fall under the user’s command if they can defeat them without any outside help. Eight of the other shikigami are as follows, with the ninth currently being unknown:

Nue, a masked bird large enough to lift someone into the air and carry them for a short distance. Aside from its ability to fly decently fast, the main draw of Nue is its ability to produce electricity from its wings that it fire off at-will, which can hit hard enough to exorcise weaker opponents and even stun relatively strong ones for a while.

Toad is a man-sized version of exactly what its name implies. It doesn’t have any impressive abilities, its only notable feature beings its tongue, which extends relatively quickly and is strong enough to lift and throw human targets with ease.

Great Serpent is an enormous white snake, large enough for a human to easily fit within its mouth and long enough to reach dozens of metres into the air. If it has any special abilities, they aren’t known.

Max Elephant is a pink elephant with the ability to output large amounts of water from its trunk, enough to flood a wide corridor or a room in moments, and with enough force to barrel a man off his feet. It also happens to be rather heavy, more than enough to crush someone if you dropped it on them from above.

Rabbit Escape is a swarm of hundreds of white rabbits. They’re each about as strong as a regular rabbit, so this shikigami is mainly used to distract or confuse an opponent. They can be directed to work together though, piling up on each other to create simple structures like walls or hollow balls.

Round Deer is a four-eyed deer large enough to fill a corridor. Its main use lies not in direct combat, but in its ability to use reverse cursed technique, which can be used to both heal the user and counteract cursed energy used against them.

Piercing Ox is rather simple, taking the form of a black ox. It doesn’t have any abilities other than charging straight towards things to ram them and it can only move in a straight line, but the longer it charges the more powerful it becomes, to the point that it can knock back one of the most powerful sorcerers of the Heian era with a brief windup.

Mahoraga is the strongest shikigami by far, taking the form of a large, powerfully- built humanoid with two feathered wings in place of each eye, a blade attached to its right arm, a snake-like tail extending from the back of its head, and an eight-pronged wheel hovering above its back. Even with its physical abilities alone it’s a threat to even the strongest sorcerers, hitting hard enough to punch its foes through several buildings, and the blade on its arm, the Sword of Extermination, is a cursed tool coated in positive energy, which is anathema to cursed energy and especially cursed spirits.

Its most powerful ability, though, is its power to adapt to the whatever it faces. If it or its user is hit by an attack, the wheel above its head will begin to rotate, and when it has made a full revolution it will have fully adapted. An attack that worked on it before will no longer affect it – similarly, if it encounters a defence it can’t pierce it will adapt in order to overcome it. It doesn’t just stop at once it has though, but instead continues to search for better, more effective adaptations. For example, when it initially came into contact with Gojo’s Limitless, it first changed the very nature of its cursed energy to overcome it, then switched to cutting space itself to bypass its defence entirely. As a result of this power, though, no sorcerer of the Zenin family has ever succeeded in subjugating it. 

In addition to the shikigami above, it’s possible to temporarily fuse several shikigami into a single summon, combining their forms and abilities at the cost of increased cursed energy usage. Users are also capable of using their own shadow to store objects, though they still experience the weight of anything kept inside, and even entering other shadows in order to hide inside of them.

Aside from the aforementioned limitation on which shikigami can be summoned, there is another major flaw: any shikigami that is destroyed will be unable to be summoned again. Fortunately, it’s possible to dismiss any shikigami with a thought, whereupon they will be fully healed when resummoned, and the energy of any dead shikigami will be inherited by the others who survive, empowering them proportional to the defeated one’s strength. Merged shikigami are also not subject to this, their constituent shikigami not being permanently destroyed upon the fusion’s death. Any dead shikigami will optionally be restored after ten years or at the start of the next Jump, whichever comes first."
1512,,600,Judgeman,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"With your cursed technique you’re able to summon a shikigami known as Judgeman, a large figure in a black cloak shaped like the scales of justice, with a white mask for a face. It has no combat ability on its own, but is instead a vital part of Deadly Sentencing, the Domain Expansion that is inherent to your technique. Upon activating your Domain, you and your target are brought into a courtroom where all violence is forbidden, with all parties being completely unable to harm the other.

Instead of physical combat, however, those within are forced to engage in a trial, with you as a prosecutor, the target the defendant, and Judgeman as the impartial judge. Judgeman inherently knows everything about everyone in the Domain (though you do not share this knowledge), and will use this knowledge to accuse the defendant of a crime they committed. Furthermore, as the prosecutor you will also be given an envelope containing evidence related to the trial, though it is not necessarily conclusive, and only you will know that is inside. This evidence could, for example, be a photograph of the defendant at the scene of the crime they were accused of committing.

Without knowing the evidence, the defendant is tasked with making a statement to prove their innocence, though they may choose to remain silent or confess if they see fit. You may then use the evidence given to you to present a rebuttal. Once both statements have been made, Judgeman will render a verdict based solely on them. If the defendant is deemed innocent, the Domain will end. If they are found guilty, however, Judgeman will sentence the defendant, resulting in a punishment. Though more severe crimes tend to result in worse punishments, even you can’t be sure which one it will be.

One sentence given by Judgeman is confiscation, which will cause the defendant to lose access to their cursed technique – or, if they lack one, their cursed energy. The harshest is the death penalty with confiscation, which will not only apply the above effect but also give you the Executioner’s Sword – a blade of light that will instantly kill anyone cut by it without exception, though it can only be used upon the defendant given the death sentence.

In addition to the above, you’re also able to summon a special cursed tool with your technique in the form of a gavel. This cursed tool can change its shape according to your will, such as by extending its handle for greater range, turning it into an enormous mallet to crush your foes, or even giving it a level of fluidity, allowing it to weave past their defences and catch them with a hooked head. So long as it’s still vaguely hammer-like, it’s possible. You can also summon and dispel it with a thought.

There are only a few limitations to this technique. One is that in order to use Deadly Sentencing, you must explain the rules of the Domain to the defendant. The other is that so long as the target denies their guilt they may request a retrial, which will forcibly open the Domain once again, though they will be tried on a different charge the second time around."
1513,,600,Vessel,Jujutsu Kaisen,Control,"Many centuries ago, some of the most powerful sorcerers in the world decided to cheat death. They became cursed objects, nigh-indestructible remnants of their former bodies imbued with their cursed energy, designed to last throughout the ages. Then, no matter how much time passes, if someone decides to ingest the cursed object, the cursed energy within will overwhelm the consumer, the host’s body being completely being taken over, and the sorcerer of old incarnating anew. Except, sometimes a host has a strong enough will to suppress their would-be possessor, gaining great power in the process.

Now, like Yuji Itadori or Hana Kurusu, you are another such case, having consumed a cursed object and, against the odds, subjugated the cursed energy within. Strangely enough, though, the sorcerer the cursed object belonged to doesn’t seem too bothered by this turn of events. Unlike others, they have now have no desire to take control of your body for themselves, and are content to live in symbiosis with you.

The personality, history, and other such details of this incarnated sorcerer are free for you to determine as you see fit. They’re little more than a passenger within your body, and as such are unable to use any of the abilities they had in life. At most, they can use their power to harmlessly manifest a mouth on your body, which they can use to verbally communicate with you and others. They can also draw your mind into their innate domain, an ‘inner world’ of their mind and soul of sorts, to talk with you face-to-face, though naturally this won’t be done without your consent.

There are a number of benefits to having an ancient sorcerer sharing your body. The first is that their levels of cursed energy have now been added to yours – which, given that their amount of cursed energy exceeds the vast majority of modern sorcerers, is nothing to sneeze at. The second is that their presence offers a measure of protection to your mind and soul. Anyone trying to control, manipulate, or otherwise affect them against your will will face far greater resistance than usual as your symbiotic partner does their best to defend you, making it so even an exceptionally powerful special grade curse would struggle to do much of anything to you.

Eventually, it may even be possible for you to learn how to use the innate cursed technique of the incarnated sorcerer within you. Such a thing will not be easy achieved, however, and will require not just a very strong rapport, but a great amount of training and experimentation before it even begins to be possible, and being able to use it proficiently will be further off still. You may purchase a technique from the Cursed Technique section at a discount, to represent their cursed technique. Otherwise, it will either be impossible for you to use their cursed technique, or they never possessed one to begin with."
1514,,600,Jumper Electric Company ,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"Sort of. See, a not small number of people within Shinra are a little tired of how things are run. Maybe it's because their hometown got burned down (that happens a lot here). Maybe it's because they don't earn enough to justify their daily stress. Maybe it's members of SOLDIER who have gone a bit batty from the voices in their heads going on about Reunion and the pension doesn't cover insanity. Regardless, a lot of people are unhappy with the monolithic company and are looking for a way out...a way out they see in you. 

Whether you're a member of Shinra with your own ambitions or opposed to them, this is a collection of skilled scientists, two regiments of SOLDIER, and various executives and desk jockeys that would have otherwise gone unnoticed in this world that have decided to join you. They bring oodles of stolen equipment and data with them, easily enough to make the bedrock of your own rival company to Shinra or just your own little slice of it. The SOLDIER members may be a little bit loopy from hearing voices and mumbling about Reunions, yet are remarkably skilled at holding onto their personalities and still being able to carry out missions for you both effectively and with loyalty. With all of these resources and individuals, it would be easy to either recreate your own version of Shinra or make something entirely new. These followers can also be assimilated into any organizations, companies or military forces you already own if you would rather just add them to something you already have. They are also able to recruit more people or replenish their numbers if more should perish for whatever reason, gaining replacements for any killed in action the following month."
1515,,600,REUNION,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"The final ingredient. It's not enough to merely be a monster or a dangerous individual lifeform. No, you are truly a disease upon the Planet, something that not even physical destruction will see the end of. Your will is no longer limited to nerves, neurons, or your brain for a copy of your genetic 'will' exists within each cell of your body. A side effect of this is that destruction of your brain or major organs won't spell your death or erasure, restoration with magic or extremely effective healing still being possible even if you're reduced to a puddle of gore. This also means you are able to physically control other beings containing your cells through a genetic link, letting you manipulate their bodies from the inside and creating new sensations or agonies for them through act of will alone.

The true horror comes when your physical body is well and truly annihilated, yet genetic links to you still exist in the world. Able-bodied individuals who hold your cells within their body will rapidly mutate into Remnants, beings that resemble you in appearance and hold aspects of your personality, extinguishing the people they used to be. This effect will primarily target those already weak of mind or already devoted to you in some way, enough that they would be willing to die for you, and work its way down if no such hosts are available. These Remnants will single-mindedly seek your resurrection and completion through any means possible, often using fragments of your own abilities to do so. Should no method exist, they will work to instead collect as many of your cells or missing parts as possible, and absorb them into their bodies. When a Remnant has matured or collected enough of these wayward parts, they will change into a perfect copy of your body, whole mind and all as your consciousness re-awakens within them. Thus, so long as some tiny part of you infests the world, you will never be a mere memory.

If you are still dead, your Remnants killed or neutralized, or if they fail in their mission by the time the jump has ended, that's still considered game over if you lack some other way of cheating death."
1516,,600,ADVENT,Final Fantasy VII,Control,"What one giveth, one taketh away. Or something like that. When you bestow a biological 'gift' upon others, whether from anything like a blood transfusion or the effects of HERITAGE, it has curious effects on their mind. The more of these 'blessings' you choose to give them, the more malleable their minds become as their thoughts and life goals are overwritten by your own desires, making them increasingly fanatical towards you. Those who succumb to your mutations from lack of will or choosing to give themselves up to you are the most vulnerable, often turning into mindless drones following whatever will you order them to follow. Those who retain their minds will often call you Father or Mother, revering you like a deity. There often isn't much left of the people they were before, so take care on who you use this on...you may 'dial back' the effects to little or nothing on a case by case basis, if you wish."
1517,,600,Celestial Dragon Nest ,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"Well, you hit the jackpot, Jumper. This is a Celestial Dragon nest, containing several eggs. Any dragon born in this nest will be infallibly loyal to you. All species of Celestial Dragon are present, from the humble Whiteflame Protector to the mighty (and mightily dangerous) Infinite Mindsplitter. Sure, it will take years for the eggs to hatch, and even more before the dragon's reach adult form, but when they do, you’ll have a force that nobody on Runeterra can command. Only Aurelion Sol, the Star Forger, can call the Celestial Dragons to war... except the ones here, of course."
1518,,600,Targon’s Bindings,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"The most impressive feat the Targonia ever pulled off was the creation of the golden crown on Aurelion Sol’s head, and it’s not even close. Somehow, these people managed to create an artifact that not even a dragon that can craft stars was able to remove, and the place of that very same dragon under their control, on the threat that every disobedience will extinguish one of his creations. You now possess the same amazing talent for bindings and control, both magical and not. Binding and sealing magic will drastically increase in power, while you’ll also innately know what to do and say to force people to obey your will. Just be careful to now go overboard and make too many enemies, because even the mighty chains of Targon can slip."
1519,,600,Mist Manipulation,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"Necromancy is pretty common in Runeterra, but nobody can control the dead like the Ruined King, the origin of the Black Mist. Until you came, of course. You don’t have the sheer range of the Ruined King, but you’re still able to control the Black Mist and even produce small quantities of it. With the Black Mist comes the ability to trap souls inside it and use those same souls to create specters and other undead monstrosities. Be careful Jumper, for such a power will make you the target of several powerful people. Of course, you have another power: you can transform your Black Mist into Sacred Mist, the opposite of the Black Mist and the perfect counter to it, for it returns the lost souls to their afterlife. In future Jumps, you could also be able to infuse other elements in your Mist."
1520,,600,Thrall Master,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"The ancient witch Lissandra froze the Watchers and their thralls under the Howling Abyss, and when needed, she freed the servants of the Watchers to fight for her. These massive, troll-like creatures obey her will despite being her mortal enemies. Now, you too have this power. When defeating an enemy, you can put them in stasis and free them later to make them fight for you. In time, your power will seep into their body, so when freed, they will fight to the death and will manifest power related to you. Build your army and conquer Runeterra... or use them as butlers, as you prefer."
1521,,600,Exemplar,Legends of Runeterra,Control,"You’re larger than life. Your charisma skyrockets, letting you sway entire crowds with a couple of words (DEMACIAAAAA!!! is particularly appropriate) and convince even the most stubborn of people that you may have a point. All the people that fight alongside you are invigorated by your sheer presence, able to fight harder and longer than it would normally be possible, while your enemies are discouraged just by seeing you appear on the battlefield. Furthermore, until you fight for a cause you truly believe in, the effect of the Perks you possess are increased. So strife forward, Jumper."
1522,,600,Eldunarí,Inheritance Cycle,Control,"The true center of a dragon, disgorged permanently from their body. While their body may have continued to function until its death this gem contains the Dragon’s very heart and soul. It is however blind and deaf to the world and can only communicate through direct mental contact. As it no longer needs to support its body, all of its magic and power remains concentrated eternally within this crystal. If one can make mental contact with the dragon it may aid you, providing you with an incredible amount of magical energy with which to fuel your spells. It is also a highly sage being, bearing knowledge and wisdom from bygone era’s. It may yet contain many secrets that the riders sought to hide away from the world."
1523,,600,Dragon,Inheritance Cycle,Control,"A Dragon is a powerful and intelligent creature that will continue to grow until the day it dies. Note that this growth is very slow after the first year or two, a Dragon hundreds of years old is maybe 50% larger than one that is a year and a half old. Incredibly powerful physically and magically, though their magic can only be used sporadically and not even they can control it. For Riders you established a Mental Bond with the dragon immediately after it hatched from an egg, you and the Dragon share a mental connection and share everything, they can even lend you their strength for Magic. For others you are simply close friends with a Dragon, and they are willing to help you solve problems using their brute strength. May import a companion into this role."
1524,,600,Honkai Beast(600),Honkai Impact 3rd,Control,"You have a Honkai Beast that is either shown in canon, or custom-designed by you, for a Companion. For 200cp, this Honkai Beast is little more than a small-fry, being mostly like a pet, except strong enough to tear through most ordinary zombies. For 400cp, this Honkai Beast is an Emperor-Class Honkai Beast. For 600cp, however, this Honkai beast is a Judgment-Class Honkai Beast, which is also a Pseudo-Herrscher like Benares, who is also called Bella by Sirin."
1525,,600,The Jumper Organization ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control,"You have a world-saving organization of your very own, like Anti-Entropy, Schicksal, and World Serpent (well, that last one’s very debatable.) While it is definitely small, similar to Anti-Entropy, it has extremely talented members on the same level as Welt Yang (Joachim Nokiavirtanen), Lieserl Albert Einstein, and Frederica Nikola Tesla. However, this organization also has extreme potential. If you spend even a single decade trying to increase its range, it can grow to become an equal, or even superior (depending on your economic skills, luck, and leadership skill) to Schicksal."
1526,,600,Absurd Charisma,Honkai Impact 3rd,Control,"You have a penchant for charming people. Not only are you an inherently likable person with an attractive appearance, you also have good social skills, good time-management skills, and can maintain relationships with an indefinite amount of people without making any of them feeling starved for your affection and/or time. Your charisma and beauty are enough that even Honkai Beasts will outright refuse to harm you unless explicitly ordered to do so. Even Herrschers that unerringly hate the rest of humanity will feel extremely hesitant to order your death.

Boosted: Your charisma has been elevated to even more ridiculous levels. Now, even the Will of the Honkai likes you too much to corrupt you. Basically, unless you act like a complete and total asshole and do your best to snub everyone’s face in, you’re going to be getting a lot of allies and making a lot of friends, and even godlike forces will favor you to unbelievable levels. Even if you do act like a smug bastard, you’d still have a lot of secret admirers and masochistic fans.

1527,,600,Control,Final Fantasy VI,Control,"Art imitates life, or so the saying goes. With magic added to the mix it’s entirely possible for the opposite to become true as well. For paint and canvas, or more exotic mediums, to be used to capture the will of a creature and force it to do as you wish. Provided that you can actually paint well enough to render what you wish to control.

While normally only obtainable by those with glorious mustaches, you have already mastered this use of sympathetic magic. Your ability to control those you depict will be directly linked to just how expertly portrayed the subject is. Crude stick figures will net you only a suggestion whispered in the ear. Masterpieces will allow you to turn a creature on its allies and control it completely. So practice those brush strokes.

Three notes to this ability. The first is that pain can cause the links controlling an individual to
be severed, so take care that your puppet isn’t damaged unnecessarily. Secondly, it takes a lot of concentration to maintain this subtle art. You will not be doing much else while holding the will of a creature. Third, your control works best on monsters and simple creatures. More willful people will be harder to snare in the first place and even harder to keep under control."
1528,,600,Wisdom of the Vanir,God Of War (2018),Control,"A part of what makes the Vanir so powerful is their connection to nature and magic, with almost every member of their race having the potential to become a decently powerful mage. You however stand out even amongst them. Your connection to nature is such that you are able to speak to animals and even listen to the world around you to learn of important things that are happening such as a god walking the world and where they would roughly be. You find that all beings attuned to nature such as animals or forest spirits will quickly take a liking to you should you not harm them. Even gods and beings who embody nature would find themselves taking a liking to you. You can easily manipulate how nature grows around you, such as making a house on the back of a giant turtle. Finally you find that you have a talent for medicine and remedies, be they mundane or divine. Though keep in mind that the more powerful the remedy or medicine you seek to make the more dangerous the location you’ll have to get the ingredient from."

1533,,600,The Big One,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Control,"They might have an army, but you have...oh dear. I’m not sure anyone’s supposed to have this, but if you’re paying for it then I suppose it’s fair. What you have here is the almost entirely complete Golem Keter Malkuth, an attempt to copy the Primordial Human Adam. Exactly why the designer considered Adam to look like a monster with multiple eyes more than 15 metres tall is a mystery. Normally this would take a particular golden-masked Caster two months of work to finalize, finished off by a three-day attunement process, but you’re paying a lot for it so you can skip that for now. While having a gigantic golem to punch through castle walls and roar with enough power to deflect projectiles from Archer Servants is all well and good, that’s not the most interesting feature. It’s essentially an autonomous Reality Marble with the ability to continually repaint the world into ‘Paradise’ for as long as it exists. Just by stepping on the ground it is able to supply itself with energy, which it needs on a constant basis to keep working, converting its surroundings into ‘Eden’, and as long as its feet are on the ground it will endlessly regenerate at a rapid pace – so make sure it doesn’t get tripped over or launched into the air or oceans. While it starts off as a ‘mere’ fifteen-meter sized giant that could be defeated by most Servants, once it gets going and the ‘Eden’ it creates expands, this giant’s size will change and multiply till it reaches a thousand metres in height. At that point, you’d need a group of first-rate Servants to be able to destroy it. The speed of growth can be enhanced via absorbing certain magical materials, such as homunculi or other golems. This creature is non-sentient, and you can control it by riding on its shoulder or giving it instructions beforehand, and if destroyed will reappear in the form of a stone eye in your Warehouse that will take two months to regrow once planted somewhere with sufficient resources available, though it will be ready to go at the start of each Jump. To start it off in either case, you’ll need something potent for the core equal to a first-class magus. You could make do with less, but it’ll be considerably less powerful the less perfect the core is, and why wouldn’t you want the best golem you could have? Since it’s technically based on a work-in- progress, it’ll even retain and re-develop any enhancements or changes you make to it, so long as you want it to keep them. It’s 100% loyal to you, can’t be hijacked or turned against yourself or your allies, and you and any allies are unaffected by any negative effects that might occur due to the ‘Eden’ it creates."
1534,,600,Those who are Faithful and Trustworthy,Library of Ruina,Control,"Some might assume that the entire purpose of the City is to erode the identity of its denizens, polish them down to smooth stones, or interchangeable gears. Of course, the Light, and EGO stand in direct opposition to the disease of the mind that causes that mindset to be so prevalent, the inability to escape the cage of society and choose one’s own path to a brighter future, instead of resigning oneself to a mediocre at best present. Those you work for and with seem to begin to embody this, gaining their own unique quirks and style regardless of position, and developing into individuals instead of faceless mooks. In short, they will aspire to greatness, and actually find it. Sure, people on the outside might comment about how your janitor dresses in full plate, and wields mops in sword forms, but the floors will be spotless, and in the event that he needs to actually fight, he may just stand a chance instead of being gunned down like a mook. Of course, to a degree this requires them to seek out the strength, and have individuality to work off of and enhance in the first place. But anyone with those prerequisites will be able to go quite far, and forge their own stories and paths.

Boosted: So, you remember how you were a former employee of Lobotomy Corporation’s main branch? Well, you probably don’t actually do so in full, recalling a paltry fifty day stretch. But you were truly exceptional as an agent back in the day, someone most of the iterations of Ayin would recruit day one to go as far as possible before they fell to the hatred of the Sephirah. And now your EGO draws upon that time of endless struggle, letting you tap into the skills that allowed you to get through it, a bit over ten millenia caring for Abnormalities and fighting for your life when they broke free. In short, you know how to use every EGO the Corporation ever made like the back of your hand, tapping into functions the other employees would never have considered. Even better, you can extend the principles you learned to be able to wield the EGO of other humans as though it were your own, as well as similar weapons formed of self. On a side note, drawing upon this trial by fire has somehow expanded the other effect of this perk, so that terrible and unsafe working conditions speed up the growth of your allies into an extreme overdrive.

1535,,600,From Break and Ruin        ,Library of Ruina,Control,"The most beautiful performance begins. Your destruction is oddly melodious, a building crumbling to the beat as you take out its support columns, accentuated by the screams of your victims. This eerie display is sure to inspire horror in your foes, ensuring that they can’t fight at their best as they unknowingly fall into your rhythm, becoming merely another instrument for you to play. But what’s more interesting is the reaction it will inspire in select onlookers and bystanders, giving them an undying urge to create more of your music and further your goals, and gaining an echo of this perk as they practice more. Even more interestingly, so long as they can hear the gruesome melodies which they seek, they’ll constantly grow in skill, as though you were personally teaching them how to fight, or do any number

Boosted: Your EGO is a bloodthirsty thing isn’t it? In the style of the Red Mist, or perhaps more akin to the Pianist, it actively feeds on and recreates that which you kill and destroy into more of its form, increasing the potency of its effects and size of its attacks while growing no more physically unwieldy, in face becoming more and more readily controlled as it progresses and feeds. Unfortunately, with such a victoriously growth oriented mindset, there is a drawback, if you don’t continuously feed it enough carnage and destruction, the mental strain of wielding the EGO will increase massively, and in proportion to how much you have fed it, until it collapses under its own weight and returns to its original form.

As a result, Fixers tend to avoid forming strong bonds, or worst of all, a relationship with their colleagues. Exceptions exist, but eventually one leaves the business one way or another. But people’s hearts are not so easily swayed by matters of practicality, and these kinds of bonds are easily formed with those you’ve come to trust to fight by your side. But this needn’t remain a complete disadvantage. Should you have an individual who shares a sufficiently strong bond with you, platonic or romantic, your determination and will to act in defence of it grows by such leaps and bounds that you could completely disregard a hail of lethal blows through the single-minded desire to protect what lies behind you. And if your beloved is deceased or severely incapacitated this is effectively overclocked to the point that a rampage through half the City could be sustained for days without stamina or stranger energy pools running anywhere close to dry. Finally, should you fight directly beside the target of your bond, both of you will coordinate effortlessly in the heat of combat as though you two had spent several lifetimes dedicated to just that, skills perfectly complimenting each other and shoring up the other’s weaknesses. At the peak of the battle even echoes of one anothers attacks could move to fill in gaps in your techniques.

Boosted: When you’ve refused to let your feelings show for so long it’s only natural to let them air out. The catharsis alone is powerful, but in the City it’s unlikely that whatever prompted this burst of emotions was entirely benign. EGO, however, resonates strongly in times like these, and though you may not see ahead, perhaps it will guide your steps through the darkness. In times when great emotional turmoil is finally aired you may don a temporary form of distortion, one that sits on the edge of fully falling to your desires yet retains your faculties still. This new form and its assorted abilities will be heavily based on your already existing combat style yet altered by the specific nature of what led you to this breaking point.

This boost may seem mild at first, mostly if used trivially, but the longer you’ve held yourself back from displaying your emotions the greater the strength your new form displays. Even a few weeks to a month would render a significant boost, while something close to a year would be truly monumental, to the point where even one of the middling ability could fell a Star of the City this form is ultimately temporary and though it may leave vestiges, these will be minor or purely aesthetic, the rush of power fading once the immediate conflict does. If some aspect of your capabilities is heavily linked to emotional expression, such as EGO, perhaps holding its expression back instead of emotions would suffice should you be unwilling to go through a full character arc just touse this. Pairing both however, would bring you far.

You have a certain, shining presence, the kind not found since ██████ went from the backstreets to the axis around which the now defunct Lobotomy Corp turned around until, and even after, her end. When it comes to your direct interactions, you’ll find that even the most jaded of cynics tend to lend you an ear to your ideals, whether or not the circumstances mean they really should pay any attention to begin with. And once they’re pulled, you’ll find that even death won’t necessarily end your machinations, one way or another, given their almost religious, nigh unshakeable fixation on advancing your dream, perhaps pushing them to great and terrible wonders with the determination their angel has bestowed upon them. What’s even worse is how normal and sane you and your followers make it sound. Sure, you might be trapping everyone in an eternal hell, but it’s for a good and noble cause, and that’s what matters. The usual signs and warnings of fanaticism just don’t show up, they’re just weird and quirky people who happen to share your goals.

Boosted: Your soul is too grand to be encompassed as a single outfit and weapon. Instead, it takes the form of a space cut off from normal reality. Within this space, some of the laws of physics are bent in your favor, perhaps time distorts to accelerate your manufacturing, servants form to carry out tasks, and you can work the light into solid form there.

You can spawn off innumerable monsters, each as diverse as there are stars in the sky, if you choose for them to be so, and each unflinchingly loyal beyond the point of sanity. The only downside to this ability is that all of your children must be weaker than yourself. But really, quantity is a quality all of its own, for who needs a powerful sword when you can drown your enemies in bodies and blood."
1545,,600,Army of Hades,God of War,Control,"Though there are numerous stories of daring individuals who venture down into the realm of the dead, they quickly learn that it is a lot easier getting in than out. Yet you seem to be a window into the land of the living, capable of summoning the shades of all whom you have killed. Every man, woman, child, beast, machine, monster, and god who has fallen to your blade now follows your commands, though slightly weaker than what they were in life, there is no limit to how many you can summon. Should they be slain again, you will be incapable of summoning them for a week afterwards. A small price to pay for an army of the damned at your beck and call."
1546,,600,Magical Pet/Sibling,Adventure Time,Control,"You have a magical animal step- sibling with shape-shifting abilities. Loyal, powerful and fun to be around but easily distracted and a little dim. You may import an existing companion into this role."
1547,,600,Elemental Monarch,Adventure Time,Control,"You have the power to spontaneously produce, intricately manipulate and even create elementals of one of the four basic elements of existence (ice, fire, candy and slime). Creating a whole kingdom will likely not take too long."
1548,,600,The Lost Summons,Final Fantasy III,Control,"Odin, Leviathan, Bahamut. These are names from legend, ones that inspire fear and awe. The warriors of light would have to go on a grand quest and best these three beings in order to acquire their aid. You on the other hand have been marked by them, capable of summoning all three. In fact, you can use both the evoker and summoner variations of them at full power even when not set to the proper class. These spells are enough to obliterate most foes here, so wield this gift with care."
1549,,600,Gaia's blessing,Xena - Hercules,Control,"Scattered and hunted, the descendants of the amazon nation rely mainly on staying hidden to keep themselves safe. When you wish, the very world will shift to hide your passage, concealing tracks and scent, confusing sensors and distracting sentries. Where you rest and build, nature grows hostile to discourage unwelcome travelers. Short of getting up and walking, animals, plants and the elements will react in concert to destroy evidence of your presence and discourage pursuers. This could be as subtle as a gust of wind throwing up leaves and debris, or rocks shifting underfoot to make someone stumble. It could be as blatant as lightning from a storm striking those that target you, or a sudden solar flare flooding an area of space with radiation."
1550,,600,Jumper Clan,Fate/Apocrypha,Control,"The Yggdmillennia is a rather large and influential Magus family. Well, rather than a single family, it’s more like a conglomeration of families united under a single banner, with members all over the world. It might not be on the level of the Mage’s Association, but it’s certainly the same type of group. With this purchase, there’s now a third group of Magi, one under your control. Just like the Yggdmillennia, your Magi clan has plenty of Magus families under you, most of them downtrodden families just starting to rise to power again thanks to a recent wave of talented heirs. And of course, you have your headquarters in a castle built on top of incredibly high quality leylines, certainly worthy of being used as the center of your new clan. You can choose where in this world the castle is, although of course it’s recommended you at least place it in Europe for the sake of being near the Great Holy Grail War. Perhaps you’ll secede from the Association as well? While Darnic failed to do so due to several casualties in the Yggdmillennia group during the Great Holy Grail War, perhaps you’ll fare better?"
1551,,600,Don't touch (me)! ,Lobotomy Corporation,Control,"You have the ability to cause all systems to fail simultaneously and all Abnormalities in the facility to immediately go berserk. Effectively allowing everything to escape their cells and cause chaos, all the while rendering energy gathered inert. After the jump, this ability activates in a radius around you and its effects extends to animals, otherworldly beings and any potential prisoners. The range and how long everything remains deactivated is determined by how much energy you put into activation. If you lack an energy source, it by default can be activated once a week in a 100m radius."
1552,,600,The Abnormality Whisperer,Lobotomy Corporation,Control,"Humanoid or monster, when it comes to these otherworldly things, you'll develop the ability to instinctively understand how they ""feel"" and understand the best means of working with them. ALEPH Abnormalities eventually feel like ZAYAN to you. Spend enough time with a particular Abnormality and you'll find yourself becoming immune to its negative effects."
1553,,600,"Gods of Olympus, Hear My Call! ",Hades,Control,"Heroes of the Underworld are often those who were favored by one god or another. Sometimes several of them at once. Their death rarely does much to diminish the admiration the divines have for their chosen few. Even in the arenas of Elysium the power of the Olympians can still reach those heroes when it is called for, if briefly.

Nomatter what your situation in the afterlife is like, you have a similar link to the local divines. You can call upon them to bless you or smite your foes simply by raising your weapon to the skies and calling for them. Youmay call upon specific deities or simply send the call out and see who answers. The gods may not always send the help you ask for, but they will assist you when called. Just don’t call too often or for unnecessary reasons. The divines do not take kindly to those who lean too heavily upon their gifts."
1554,,600,A Home Beneath ,Hades,Control,"Chaos is the mother and father of the universe. They are forever fated to view their creation from the outside, to know but not experience all that was made by their hands. Still, even the few remaining Titans would be butmotes in the wind should they confront Chaos in their void-filled domain. While you may not have the raw power of an entity of creation, you may draw inspiration from Chaos nonetheless. By sequestering yourself deep below the ground, remaining in one place, and concentrating your power within a small area, you will discover that your abilities grow in leaps and bounds. Inside your zone of control your power would become truly impressive. So long as you never leave."
1555,,600,Mind Control,Final Fantasy II,Control,"While others require time or effort to sway the masses to their banner, you don’t need to worry about that. You can, en masse, mind control others to do your bidding. Those who have less willpower are more easily controlled, such as an entire town of villagers. Of course, the more you practice this talent, the stronger it will become, and with enough practice your power can break down the resistance of those with significant will."
1556,,600,Necromancy,Hellblazer,Control,"You are able to communicate with the dead, imbue dead bodies with movement, and bind spirits to your service. Requires mana."
1557,,600,Demonology ,Hellblazer,Control,You are able to summon and exorcise demons. You know how to draw protective circles and symbols needed for either of these techniques. You learn a great deal about contract law. Requires mana.
1558,,600,Jumper Family,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"The Scladio Family was one of the most influential criminal organizations in the United States. It not only had immense economical power due to its criminal activities that had existed for more than a century now, but due to their many ties with the magi world, they have even been recognized by the US Government as a faction that would be better appeased and negotiated with.

Now, you are the head of a similar organization, or perhaps you have been recognized as the true successor of Galvarosso Scladio, whether through blood ties or another method. Not only do you command immense material resources, but you also have a powerful hand over the magical world. Much like the Scaldio family, your organization has become a safe haven for rogue magi and the most undesirable elements of the magi society. This has lead to a strange symbiotic relationship, in which while you don’t really hold direct command over these magi, you find them protecting and aiding you into your every endeavor, and even sometimes sharing the fruits of their research with you. However, some powerful magi among this organization are truly loyal to yourself, being fully integrated into your criminal organization and devoted to you.

Finally, there is your family residence. A large mansion that has been turned into a magical fortress. When it comes to magical defenses, the only places that surpass it in the current era are the headquarters of the large magic organizations, such as the Spiral Manor, the Wandering Sea, the Atlas Institute or the headquarters of the Clock Tower in London.

You will find yourself the master of a similar organization in future worlds, as well as having a headquarters on the same level of defense as your current one."
1559,,600,BOSS BOSS BOSS,Katana Zero,Control,"Ohh, sometimes you get those ungrateful little fucks who just don’t seem to want to follow your orders. And sometimes those disobedient pawns turn their blades on you. Shame on them, then, because while you may or may not be able to fight them physically, you sure can beat their minds to a pulp otherwise; after all, Chronos was not the only combat ‘stimulant’ New Mecca produced, and one of those has made you an offensive psychic.

You can force your opponent into a mental landscape that ostensibly appears the same as ‘reality’, and while in this state you gain a illusory set of powers based on how you’re seen by the person in question; a manipulative bastard might be able to manifest hands and further play with their perception of ‘reality’, a bloodthirsty warrior attacks with blood and steel honed beyond any natural means.

Just keep in mind, this is a test of your will against theirs. You beat them, they’ll be rendered catatonic but alive, in case you need them for later, but if they beat you, that’s lights out for you. Permanently; they’ll probably leave a sword in your skull by the end of it."
1560,,600,That Old Black Magic,Final Fantasy I,Control,"You know what shuts people up the fastest? Raw. Magical. Power. You’re a really scary person now, able to use your own magical power as a force of intimidation, quickly scaring away lesser men and beasts alike should you have enough mana and spell power to back it up, letting you save your strength and avoid unnecessary battles. They should be right to fear you, as well - your offensive and destructive spells now cost less in terms of spent energy, and strike with greater force than before. No one will ever laugh at you and your hat ever again."
1561,,600,Under the Sea,The Little Mermaid,Control,"Not all sea creatures are as lucky as you. They can’t talk or sing, and most aren’t exactly sapient. They spend their short lives trying to find food and avoiding being someone else's food. So it’s a good thing that your sapience is practically infectious. With a little song and dance you can bring colour into their humdrum lives and pull them up to your level. Soon they’ll be carrying a tune as they set off for a grand adventure. This also gives them a more Disney appropriate look. Their newfound awareness lasts however long you want, but they cannot spread it themselves.

This does not guarantee that they will be happy with their situation. Also, they have to be physically present for the song and dance in order to be affected."
1562,,600,Giant Stone Jaguar,The Road to El Dorado,Control,"Well, it’s called the “Age of the Jaguar” for a reason after all. This giant stone statue of a jaguar has been magically linked to you Jumper, allowing you to control it like a puppet. In terms of offense this thing packs a punch, after all you are hitting someone with several tons of stone. Defensively, the jaguar can survive a brief submersion into lava without having to worry about melting. In the event that the statue is ever destroyed, you’ll receive a replacement after a year."
1563,,600,Chyornyj Oprichniki,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"When it comes to dreaded soldiers and bodyguards, few manage to leave a mark on the country like the Oprichnik. Established by the Terrible Tsar, you have now your own version of his greatest soldiers. Dressed in all black and riding dark horses, with their broom-shaped whips they are completely loyal to you and will not rest until your enemies are killed. While individually they are not as impressive, in a group they are a true nightmare known for painful and cruel deaths that do not come quickly. Hundreds of men strong, any who die will reappear the next time you dream for this is what they are truly made of. Lastly their true strength is in direct relation to you and how close they are to you physically. Should you rest in your capital, they each would be able to match a low-rank servant blow for blow within."
1564,,600,Viy Viy Viy,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Control,"It seems you too made a contract with a certain elemental. Though you yourself may be ordinary and not have much in the way of ability, this contract has given you two powers allowing you to truly make your mark on history. One of them is control over ice and cold. Ice and snow bends to your whim, able to reach temperatures of below -100 °C. While that alone would make fighting you akin to facing a Blizzard, the real benefit is within your eyes. The mystic eyes of clairvoyance are descended from Balor and a devolution from those granting Death perception. Your eyes can, when properly used, break down boundary fields and even find weaknesses in fortresses. Any Russian Tsar would be happy to have you at their side, knowing the sheer advantage you could give them in a siege. Finally the elemental has attached itself to your shadow and can itself be summoned to your aid, freezing all your enemies with its chilling stare."
1565,,600,The Court of The Jumping Chain ,Godbound,Control,"The masked revellers caper and revel for your pleasure, plying you with blood-red wine with notes of dried roses and old books or the macabre bounties of their pleasure gardens. The endless carnival these creatures perform belies a mastery of theurgic principles, alchemic putrefaction and stagecraft great even among their kind. Under a sanguine sky dotted with black stars, the dream-like haze permeating this city guides you through a city coloured only in those shades held as sacred in classical alchemy. The faceless, supple Ambassador of this baroque city earnestly encourages you to take your throne.

By some inexplicable twist of fate, a great court of the Uncreated have decided to hold you as their unquestioned lord and master. Their obedience to you is akin to that of insects to a hive’s queen. Your court is especially powerful among the Uncreated, for while most of your denizens are of the common make of Uncreated beings a handful could match Godbound of moderate experience blow for blow-and one dread creature who styles itself your lieutenant could lay waste to a whole pantheon of them."
1566,,600,Spirit Board,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"An odd noticeboard has appeared in your Warehouse, or if you prefer, close to your starting location. On the noticeboard are ten large posters, each detailing a Spirit, its class, its associated Spirit battle, and a timer, which is slowly ticking down.

By touching one of the posters, you are sent to a special space where you participate in the listed Spirit battle. By winning the battle, and severing the connection between the Puppet Fighter and the Spirit with your Spirit Gun, you may collect the Spirit, and have it join you in your journey as a follower. For Spirits made up of multiple characters (such as Articuno, Zapdos, & Moltres) you may elect to acquire a Spirit of only one of the characters if you would like. In this case, such a Spirit would lose any “enhanceability” they possessed (see On Enhanceable Spirits in the Notes section for details). All Spirits earned in such a manner are absolutely loyal to you. All Spirits appearing on this board are copies, so there’s no need to worry about displacing someone or robbing them of their body. You may bring in whatever items you feel are needed, as well as any Spirits you are using to power yourself up. You may only take out what you bring in, as well as the Spirit if you earned it, and you can never lose anything in these spaces. If you are defeated, you return without the Spirit, but you will never suffer true death or chain failure by losing one of these battles, so feel free to challenge yourself.

You may also bring in up to three additional people to help you in these battles, but if you do so any of you being defeated will cause all of you to be ejected from the space.

Spirits are broken down into four classes: Novice, Advanced, Ace and Legend. The higher the class, the rarer it is for the Spirit to appear on the board, and the tougher the Spirit battle generally is.

All posters with Spirits in the Ace class or below are replaced every 5 minutes. Legend class Spirits instead stay up for 15 minutes. Spirits may appear multiple times, so collecting multiples is possible if you are patient or lucky enough.

Every few weeks or so, the Spirit Board will host an event. During the event, Spirits which meet a specific criterion appear more often than usual. ‘Characters wearing glasses’, or ‘characters from the Fire Emblem series’ are examples of the events the board could choose to hold. The events usually last over the weekend.

During this jump, only Spirits which appear on the Spirit Board in Super Smash Bros. will appear on this board. Post-jump, any Spirit which appeared in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate may appear here. Use your best judgement to determine which class Spirits without a class (Fighter Spirits and Master Spirits) slot into.

Additionally, post-jump, the Spirit Board will add a handful of new Spirits for each new jump you visit, based on important characters from that setting. It will also retroactively do this for jumps you had visited prior to this one. Spirit battles featuring these new Spirits can include any of the rules and gimmicks standard Spirit battles do, but they could also make you fight a Puppet Fighter of any individual you have fought before in your chain. These new Spirits will be a mix of classes, and the difficulty of the related battles will scale to these classes, rather than being determined by the usual strength of either the character(s) used in the Spirit battle or the character(s) the Spirit is representing.

Should your Spirit Board be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours.

Requires Spirit Gun to Purchase"
1567,,600,Handful of Hands,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"A group of 6 Giant Hands have rallied to your cause. They may be all Master Hands, all Crazy Hands, or a mix of the two. Perhaps they managed to hide away, or shake themselves free of Galeem or Dharkon’s control. Regardless, purchasing this will not diminish the forces of either Galeem or Dharkon, even if you have taken a background; these hands have essentially sprung up out of nowhere to follow you.

Unlike the armies controlled by Galeem and Dharkon, these hands genuinely wish to serve you, and are absolutely loyal to you. They will join you on your journey as followers. They will sacrifice themselves for your sake, should you ask it of them."
1568,,600,Puppet Master        ,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Control,"You have gained the ability to create Puppet Fighters. In order to do you must first have a target to copy (you cannot copy yourself). The target must either be willing, or in a state of unconsciousness, as any resistance by the target will prevent the copying from occurring. First, you must spread your energy over the target, covering them completely. Next, whilst still maintaining the spread of energy over the target, you must push in additional energy which forms into the copy. Finally, you split the copy from the original.

By default, the Puppet Fighters you create appear the same as the target, but with darker clothing and glowing red eyes. You may change this if you wish, as long as you comply with the following rules:
• The Puppet Fighters are distinct enough from the original that anyone familiar with the original knows it’s a fake.
• The Puppet Fighters are close enough to the original that anyone familiar with the original would know what the copy is of.
• The distinction between the copies and originals is uniform across all of your Puppet Fighters. This includes both Puppet Fighters created with the Puppet Master perk, and ones you have purchased individually.

Puppet Fighters you create are absolutely loyal to you. They are capable of independent movement, but are by themselves very weak. Their true strength is drawn out when they are taken control of by a Spirit, bringing them only a step below the original. A single Spirit may control multiple Puppet Fighters, but the power of each is weakened for every additional Puppet Fighter beyond the first they control.

You may create a copy of anything you have already copied before, without using the original as a template, but this has its drawbacks. A Puppet Fighter created in this way is entirely a single colour (you may decide which, but it must be uniform across all Puppet Fighters created in this way), and is highly unstable, lasting for a few moments before exploding.

There is no limit on the number of Puppet Fighters you can create, provided you have the time and energy to do so. All Puppet Fighters you create are considered followers, and may continue on to future jumps with you."
1569,,600,Governmental Aid,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Control,"​You were contacted by the Queen of England to ‘Bring their
wayward subjects under control’. Why a race of casual reality warpers is supposed to be
beholden to a muggle utterly irrelevant even in her own world is a mystery, but it is true all the
same.
You now have complete support from the local government, meaning a lot of people with guns at
your back, a lot of people in lab coats ready to work at your projects, all of whom you command.
To top all this off, you have an annual budget well into the tens of millions of british pounds at
minimum.
In future jumps, you can rely on having extensive support from any mundane governments or
organisations against any magical or otherwise supernatural communities or forces, regardless of
whether it makes sense or not."
1570,,600,Resurrection Stone ,Wizarding World,Control,"In a sense, it could be said that the Resurrection Stone is the most powerful and unique of the three Deathly Hallows. After all, invisibility cloaks and wands are a dime a dozen and despite all the tales told of their power and might, in the end, both of them are simply stronger versions of tools that already exist within this world. But is there any other artifact that allows one to commune with those who have already passed?

The Resurrection Stone is one-of-a-kind, even if it may seem like it. After all, to the uninitiated, the stone is merely a well-crafted black jewel. Pretty to look at but such things are quite common to both Muggles and magical folk. But all you have to do is to think of a dead soul and turn the Stone in your hand thrice. And voila! You have summoned forth a soul from the beyond!

More solid than a ghost, these spirits can be likened to that of the echoes called upon in the rare instances of Priori Incantatem. You could even see a resemblance to the Patronus, especially once you consider that these images repel Dementors with their very same effectiveness. But more importantly, these spirits are truly who they appear to be. They have all their memories, all their knowledge, all their secrets.

And while they may not be able to bring it bear, especially when only the bearer of the Stone can even see or sense them, the vast majority of them will always be willing to share. No longer shall the secrets of others ever be lost to the cold hands of death. But be careful not to fall into the same trap as Cadmus Peverell. It does not do to dwell on those who have passed and might have been."
1571,,600,Magic Bagpipes of Enchantment,Gummi Bears,Control,"Play this bagpipe once a day and watch what will unfold. For all who hear its pleasant tune will do as they are told.

Sapient beings who hear this will act zombie-like and will do what anyone tells them to do. The effect lasts for a day, you can replay the bagpipes at the same time daily and keep people under its enchantment."
1572,,600,Bring Me Her Heart,Disney’s Snow White,Control,"There is magic in this world, but no branch is as dangerous as that of curses. This is magic relating to the heart - both literal and physical. After many years of study you have learned how to rip out someone’s heart without killing them, granting you complete control of them. Your victim becomes an emotionless husk of their former self. You can safely store the heart so that it does not decay or wither. Crushing their heart will cause them to die immediately. If, instead of making them your puppet, you ritualistically consume their heart you can gain their power, positive traits, and memories instead."
1573,,600,Adult Card,Blue Archive,Control,"A black card the size and shape of a credit card. By paying a portion of your life force, this card will temporarily summon copies of your allies no matter how far away they might be. This card can also summon allies from the future of your current jump that you might not have met yet, although they will not possess knowledge of the future. Alternatively, you can use this card to temporarily empower yourself."
1574,,600,Mirror of the Soul,Wizard 101,Control,"You have awakened to the highest mysteries of Necromancy, and know now beyond all doubt the world we live in is nothing but a Mirror of the true world our Souls inhabit. Merle Ambrose himself respects the nephrite-black light of your soul. Where the bolts of Storm crack the frigid walls of Ice, that is where Death dwells, and you know every twist and turn of its ethereal passage. Assuming you have an intact body, and the soul is willing and able, you are now capable of manifesting a True Resurrection. This is an incredibly intensive procedure that goes against every law the world holds itself to, but as a true Master of Death you are above such things. Additionally, you may create legions of greater undead, such as vampires and wraiths, at will. All things that are no longer among the living, yet neither are among the dead, shall look to you as their master, no matter their sapience. They may still disobey you, for their will is not truly shackled, but they recognise and are in awe of the power you bear. Your soul carries within it a fog that naturally drains the life of the things around you, healing you by exactly what is taken. You may select certain entities to be immune to this effect, and may toggle the fog at will."
1575,,600,Heart of the Body,Wizard 101,Control,"You have awakened to the highest mysteries of Theurgy, and know now beyond all doubt the world we live in is a living being unto itself, and you know its Heart and Body as well as you know your own. Merle Ambrose himself respects the vital power in your bones. In the violent clashing between Storm and Fire does the spark of Life dwell, and by knowing that spark well, the power of nature is yours to command. When you call, nature will answer. You may command any non-sapient living creature to do your will, including plant and sea life. By your will may forests rise and cities fall, for the power of any nature or life based magics are doubled in power. You are bursting with vital energy, giving you an extremely healthy, almost fae color to your skin, and flowers may spring up about your feet as you trod upon the ground. You may stem this vital flow at will."
1576,,600,Eye of the Mind,Wizard 101,Control,"You have awakened to the highest mysteries of Conjury, and know now beyond all doubt that the world we live in is defined only in the Mind’s Eye. Merle Ambrose himself respects the weight of your imagination. Deep in the shadows ‘twixt Fire and Ice, old stories still live, and you know them all. You may now make Spell Cards out of any myth, legend, fable, or tall tale you know. All summoning magics are doubled in power, and should you be capable of creating minions you may now make twice as many. You are shrouded in an aura of mist and Mythic energy, as if you had simply stepped off an ancient fresco into the world, and all works of art seem to gain vibrancy in your presence. You may toggle this aura at will."
1577,,600,Collar,The Owl House,Control,"What’s this now? Just a simple dog collar? Far from it, friend. This small item is laced with a powerful binding enchantment. Placing it on a creature would sequester all of their powers away, leaving them as harmless as a housepet. Once placed on their person, its size will adjust to fit their new, much less dangerous form. Only you can will the collar to unlock, giving you leverage over whatever creature you manage to capture. You’ll still need to get the collar on in the first place, but once you do your quarry will be powerless.

Alternatively, you can wear the collar yourself. When used in this fashion, the collar won’t suppress your powers so much as grant you more fine control over them. Impossible acts of precision and willpower will be much more manageable with this collar as a mediator.

In addition, this collar is etched with a rune more ancient than anything else in the Boiling Isles. This glyph, left behind by the Titan, renders the wearer immune to all forms of unwanted detection. Spells created to trace and identify would fail outright, and the wearer would even be rendered invisible to beings of supreme power. You may waive this protection should you wish to become visible, however reestablishing the veil takes a few seconds, and for powerful beings that may be all the time they need."
1578,,600,You can't go to the ball looking like that.,Cinderella,Control,"Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you simply can’t make things work out on your own. In those times, the aid of another is needed. This perk will help you get such aid.

While you are suffering great despair, or your life is in imminent danger, benevolent powerful and/or magical beings are drawn towards you, as if you were some kind of karmic magnet. These beings will be naturally inclined to help you out of these situations, though this is not a compulsion and they may choose not to do so for their own reasons.

Beings that are already hostile towards you are not drawn in by the effect of this perk, ensuring that a bad situation will not immediately be made worse."
1579,,600,Genie,Disney Princess,Control,"Three wishes, no killing people, no making people love you, no reviving the dead, no immortality, no rewriting history, no wishing for more wishes, no wishing for Choice Points. If you wish for more genies, those genies will kick your ass and free their brother, who will also kick your ass. Genies are not omnipotent, but they are relatively powerful."
1580,,600,The Cavalry,Disney Princess,Control,"If someone is headed for trouble, you can call upon up to a dozen allies to defend them or attack the cause of the trouble. These allies are always people you've worked with before who have skills that would help the situation, with a preference for companions you did not take into your current jump. Cannot summon allies more powerful than the person you're helping, and using it more than five times in one month will disable the ability for one month."
1581,,600,Everlasting Vestige,Dark Souls: Covenants,Control,"No matter how long time moves forward, no matter how few are actually left, the world cannot possibly forget the existence of dragons, their memory and legacy too grand to simply fade away. You can call upon the memories of the world, allowing you to conjure spectral manifestations of draconic limbs with but a thought. Rake your foes with a dragon’s talons, or conjure their head to bite your enemies in two.

Boosted: So, you have walked down the end of this road, and have taken your rightful place as a true Everlasting Dragon. You can take on this form at any time you wish, though you will find, strangely, that all of your other draconic perks and abilities are now thrice as potent as before.

Boost Requires Covenant Leader to Activate"
1582,,600,Warriors,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Control,"And speaking of which... For such a substantial price, this purchase grants you the loyal manpower you need to forge a new destiny in the conflict to come. The size of this army is slightly variable, allowing you to trade sheer quantity for individual troop strength. Upon purchase, you may choose to receive an entire brigade of modern mortals. Each of these 5,000 mundane soldiers may be nothing special, but at least you’ll have plenty of bodies to throw at most of your problems. Instead, you may choose to recruit 1,000 specialists. These can be members of the Special Air Service, Iscariot Order, or even the Papal Paladin Orders, but their advanced training and specialized equipment will make them a deadly, if more-focused force. Finally, you can choose to purchase a full company of artificial vampires; pairing supernatural surgical enhancements to elite training and extensive combat experience. 100 of Millennium's man-made monsters may not seem like much, but considering that the Major waged his grand war with only 1000 of such creatures, this company makes for an especially potent miitary unit. 

But perhaps you need even more soldiers. Maybe you want to take a crack at starting World War 4, or just cement your faction as the most powerful around. By purchasing this item for a second time, at full price, you may multiply the number of soldiers granted to you by a factor of five. Command an entire army corps of normal meatsacks, or shake the Earth with a battalion of vampire panzergrenadiers. This is nowhere close to the 2,000,000 souls of Alucard’s #lifehack, but it is more than any other faction ever managed to bring to bear. Let all tremble before the might of your armies!

1583,,600,Master of the Monster        ,Hellsing,Control,"To defeat the beast is one matter. Such demons should be destroyed, many argue, their merest existence a stain on this world. A common line of thought from the Catholics, who like to use it on anything they dislike. But a more pragmatic man would realise the benefits to humanity if these inhuman creatures could be turned to our side. Through the application of extensive occult rituals, strange science, alchemical substances and perhaps even some form of magic, the Helsing patriarch managed to tame dreaded Dracula into a servant of man. These various disciplines and the skills to use them for the same purposes now avails themselves to you. 

Methods to bind, weaken and enslave other beings are all viable through these arts. Most potent on monsters, effecting even an eldritch thing like Dracula in a weakened state, they allow for the creation of loyal dogs to you and others you bind as masters, potentially your family line or other groups. These techniques can also be used for similar purposes, such as sealing or warding locations to imprison or keep out monsters. With further research, one can even use the various sciences and occult arts to modify these demonic beings, and perhaps other life too, to make them even more effective servants. Enhancing their natural abilities, unlocking new traits or reducing the vulnerabilities they face."
1584,,600,Nega-Split,Darkwing Duck,Control,"Thanks to intense bombardment from one of Megavolt's tronsplitter exploding, you have the ability to split a person into the Positive and Negative halves. Whichever version defeats the other becomes the new dominant self. This ability is a way to reform Villains or to corrupt Heroes."
1585,,600,Frequency Fiend Beam,Darkwing Duck,Control,"You have been hit with an energy blast that allows you to at will, summon and dispel a trio of Red (Heat Wave), Green (Radio Wave), and Yellow (Light Wave) Frequency Fiends that are under your control. Thankfully unlike Gosalyns these energy beings while independent from you, are subservient and under your complete control. Though they might still have a bit of an attitude. They can shoot energy beams, physically interact with people, form solid objects, and combine into a large three headed form."
1586,,600,Stunt Double,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Control,"A curious ability; you’ve learned to create your own stunt doubles, which are pretty much exact copies of your body with their own mind. While you can have only one active at a time, they retain your physical attributes and any Toon abilities (with the exception of this one) and are absolutely loyal to you."
1587,,600,Druun Gem,Raya and the Last Dragon,Control,"A suspicious-looking gem.

If it is shattered, a single Druun will appear nearby. It will behave as Druun typically do, immediately trying to turn people to stone, and in turn multiply. Very quickly, you’ll have a mindless plague of them on your hands. Are you sure you want this?

Druun are immune to conventional harm, but avoid water and can be repelled (or even banished) by certain kinds of magic. They have an unusual form that resembles dark purple and black clouds. The Druun are allegedly born from human discord, and have been part of Kumandra as long as dragons, waiting for their moment to strike.

If your gem was shattered, you will receive a new one at the start of the next jump. Post-chain, this occurs every ten years. If your gem was lost, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
1588,,600,Fairest One of All,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Control,"You are exceedingly attractive, Jumper. On purchase, you may choose whether this manifests as beauty on par with Snow White or an equivalent handsomeness. Be warned, such beauty may draw the ire of the Evil Queen.

Beyond this, you passively give off an aura of purity and innocence. In addition to the general impression that you give off, this aura provides two other benefits. First, it will sow doubt into the hearts of those who seek to kill you, causing them to hesitate at crucial moments or give up entirely. This effect is not absolute, and is far less effective against truly wicked individuals.

Second, it will draw in nearby non-hostile animals, such as deer, squirrels, and small birds. Animals that are at a human-level of intelligence or greater are not affected. You will find that you can communicate with these animals in broad terms, and get them to help you out in various ways, such as getting them to bring you things or take you to a nearby residence. If you are in danger, they will try to help out, either by confronting the danger directly, or running off to someone that can help and trying to bring them back to you.

You may toggle the impression, doubt, or animal effects of this aura on or off as you please without impacting the parts of the perk you would like to keep on."
1589,,600,Follow the Wisps,Brave,Control,"When you are in need, you will encounter Will O' the Wisps, small blue flames that float in the air.

These wisps are intangible, and cannot be interacted with. When you approach one, it will vanish, and others will appear, forming a pathway.

Where the Will O' the Wisps lead you will depend on your needs. If you were lost in the woods, they can lead you back to civilisation. If you were racing to reach a destination in time, they could show you the quickest route there. If you were stuck in a situation you were desperate to escape from, they could take you to someone capable of helping you out. You do not need to know where they are leading you, or who they are leading you to, for them to provide you with a path. With their aid, even overcoming a bad fate is possible. You can always tell that these Will O' the Wisps are in fact from this perk, ensuring that similar creatures in other worlds cannot take advantage of their presence to fool you.

You can toggle this perk on or off as you like, in case you ever wanted a break from these little guys."
1590,,600,Force of Nature,Moana,Control,"As you pass through the world, you leave bits of yourself behind, smaller parts of your whole. These could be seeds of thousands of plants that swirl through the air behind you, or an aura of smoke and ash, or swirls and whirls of mist. These minor elemental fragments serve to fulfil your elemental nature, each in their own way. A life elemental‟s fragments would seek out desolation and restore it. A fire elemental‟s fragments would burn and devour. These fragments shed naturally when you are in your elemental form and normally don‟t have much of a life of their own. But by sacrificing some of yourself, be it blood or hair or something similar, you can bring them to life for a short time. The more you give, the longer they will last, and if you sacrifice some part of yourself that is important to you (a hand, a finger, an eye) you could potentially bring that fragment to permanent life."
1591,,600,Spirit Animal,Moana,Control,"You have a large tattoo of some natural animal on your back, and have a special bond with those animals. They tend to flock around, and will listen to your requests as long as you don‟t abuse this connection. Once, per jump, when / if you would normally die, you may come back, transformed into the form of your chosen animal tattoo. Your form is a particularly grand and large version of that ani- mal, and becomes an alt-form from then on. Each jump, you may change your tattoo to something appropriate. You can be all glowy if you like."
1592,,600,Deal ‘n Steal,Disney’s Hercules,Control,"Bargains and deals, stealing and cheating, all these are the stock in trade for any self-respecting villain, and they’re for you as well. You have some very curious abilities, ones that could land you in trouble if the wrong people heard about them.

You can make bets or bargains affecting any and all things, such as souls, magic, favors or some such, even specific powers. These bargains need to be entered into freely by both sides, but once entered they’re self-enforcing. But be careful, as this applies to all parts of the bargain, and penalties or consequences for broken terms come into effect automatically too.

Besides this, you have the curious ability to ‘steal’ powers and abilities from people. Simply put, you can target things like Godly Domains or Magical Powers just as you would any physical things, always being able to find some way of taking them for yourself. This doesn’t make the theft any easier than it would ordinarily be, mind."
1593,,600,Delusions of Unity,Bloodborne: Covenants,Control,"The leader of this covenant, Valtr, has managed to create an entire group of people dedicated to the collection and destruction of vermin only they can see, bringing into question the authenticity of their existence. Regardless of his sanity, though, you share in his superb charisma, drawing people to you and your cause like moths to a flame, making them eternally loyal regardless of their actual thoughts on the matter.

Boosted: Your power to gather allies has manifested in quite the unique and wondrous way. With a wave of your hand and just a bit of concentration, you can summon apparitions of past friends and allies to come to your aid, regardless of how much time has passed and what worlds they inhabit. The only drawback is that while manifested, they will be unable to exceed you in power, but surely your cooperation could bring down any vermin before you.

1594,,600,Creature Tamer,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Control,You have an aura around you that pacifies both supernatural and mundane creatures. Domesticated animals will always follow your commands and wild animals will ignore you until you either provoke or befriend them.
1595,,600,Living Relic,Symphogear,Control,"Some Relics, like the Nephilim, have anatomy similar to living creatures. You’ve now got your own pet Nephilim, or a similarly powerful non-canon mythological creature. It is loyal and will obey you."
1596,,600,Solomon’s Cane,Symphogear,Control,"With this purchase you have both the Solomon’s Cane, a relic that can summon and control a large number of Noise, and a connected copy of the Treasury of Babylonia, where the Noise reside. The Cane can be used to create a portal into or out of the Treasury, but there are too many Noise inside to be controlled with the Cane. Any destroyed Noise replenish at regular intervals, once per the shorter of ten years or one jump"
1597,,600,One More Deal,Marvel Magic,Control,"Speaking of souls, it is somewhat amusing how eager many mortals are to simply trade theirs away in return for trifling rewards. You may make infernal contracts with mortals, a binding exchange of goods and services. It doesn’t even have to be souls you trade for, you could trade in powers, love, memories, and so on. The contract is magically binding for them, but keep in mind that it is also binding for you as well as the fact that it is bound to the letter of the agreement, not the intent. This contract will bind any being who openly agrees to it, no matter their power unless they are truly all-powerful. As a final boon to make this easier, you may focus any magic you possess through these deals, foregoing any rituals or incantations to accomplish things with a simple snap of your fingers just so long as it actually is possible to do so with the magic."
1598,,600,Deal with the Devil,Ghost Rider,Control,"Through strange magic, you’re capable of brokering deals with others; transferals of power (both ways), magically enforcing servitude, and more. Trades can only be done with the things that one owns; if you were to make a deal with a king, you could acquire his kingdom, but not a single coin that belongs to someone else. Things like marriages which are equally owned by two people can be traded, but instead of being transferred they would fall apart. You’re also capable of brokering deals between other parties, essentially being their middle man. Deals made in this way must be made willingly; you can coerce, lie, cheat, or even threaten, but you can’t force someone to make a deal with you using mind control or other means.

Boosted: Faustian Bargain- The magic that allows you to make deals has been strengthened; where once you would’ve gained a kingdom, it would now appear to others that you had ruled it since the beginning; where once a marriage would have fallen apart, now it would never have existed. Barring any other entities that might have awareness of such changes,

1599,,600,Alioth,Loki,Control,"An interesting and rather terrifying choice of pet, this trans-temporal entity can serve as both guardian and weapon. Created from innumerable tears in reality and capable of consuming time and space itself on a vast scale, you can use this smoke-like being to devour and totally destroy any form of matter or energy. The only limitation of this particular beast is things that are specifically Fiat-Backed as being indestructible, as it can easily destroy anything less even if it should be indestructible within the setting. Fortunately, this creature is well trained so it won’t destroy anything you don’t want it to, so you don’t need to worry about leaving it by itself and coming back to find it’s eaten everyone and everything in the vicinity and can safely interact with things without consuming them. Useful if you want to pet it without losing an arm. You can also direct it to go after specific prey, as it won’t get distracted by the largest possible meal nearby and potentially lured away from your actual target. If you’re not using it as the ultimate rubbish disposal system or a weapon to consume entire timelines and universes, you can have it remain in one area and essentially ‘contain’ vast locations inside itself, such as the Citadel At The End Of Time, making it a powerful guardian at the expense of mobility. This takes a bit of time to establish or detach from, but you can choose to essentially ‘Import’ a location you own into a suitable location with your Alioth already in its guardian position at the start of the Jump to save time. Finally, as you might not have a lot of space to keep such a vast creature, given a bit of time your version of Alioth is capable of shrinking itself down to the size of an ordinary dog. It might still look like a living tempest, but you might find it more convenient to have your pet fit into a single room rather than tower over entire mountains all the time. You don’t really need to feed it, but if you do it isn’t picky and can’t actually become ill from eating anything, so feel free to treat it with anything you don’t want to leave lying around. Should you want to teach it to play fetch or not have an indestructible chew toy on hand for your new pet, we’ve included something else it would use for such a purpose. Come to think of it, the toy looks a lot like a corroded metal horn..."
1600,,600,Jovial Jumper ,Marvel Primal,Control,"The third and final magic, Arcanum Exo, is the summoning, banishing and treating with spirits. Agamotto eventually becomes All-Seeing Agamotto, one of a trio of benevolent spirits called the Vishanti, along with Omnipotent Oshtur and Hoary Hoggoth. Spirits and eldritch beings regard you well, and are happy to do you small favors or make bargains weighted in your favor, or let you invoke their names."
1601,,600,Clutch of Dragon Eggs,Pet Avengers,Control,"These 7 eggs each will hatch at some point in the next 10 years into dragons. It will take them some more time to grow to full size, but they will eventually be powerful and large enough to put up a noticeable fight against the likes of the Avengers - including Carol Danvers, Iron-Man, and Thor - at least as a group. If one of the dragons is killed you will regain the matching egg and it will hatch, and grow, again once more taking some time to reach full size and power."
1602,,600,Cosmic Telepath,Pet Avengers,Control,"Like a certain Russian dog, you possess telepathic powers. You are able to read minds, communicate telepathically, create mental links, communicate telepathically across the better part of the universe, shield minds against mental corruption, and even have limited influence - primarily brute force - over other minds. This influence is closer to things like temporarily paralyzing a body, or putting someone to sleep than any fine tuned manipulations of their thoughts and personality."
1603,,600,Mind Gem,Marvel Cosmic,Control,"The Mind Stone gives its wielder powers over the mind. It can augment or grant any mental powers such as telekinesis or telepathy. It can link its wielder to other minds and manipulate them as one sees fit. It forms a feedback loop and is empowered by the Soul Stone, and further emperors the Power Stone. It is usually blue."
1604,,600,Telepath,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Control,"You’ve got the classic “psychic” set of powers; telepathy, telekinesis, mind reading, and mind control. You can send others mental messages, speaking directly to their minds and even projecting images into their minds, or can attempt to overwhelm their minds with mental trauma, inflicting anguish throughout their mind. Your telekinesis starts out with the strength to slowly lift a car, but can grow to the point you can lift a house. You can passively scan the minds of a crowd, listening to their active thoughts or “filtering” for certain words and phrases, or can actively search through the memories of a handful of people at a time. Finally, you can dominate the mind of up to one person at a time, though this carries risks to both the person you’re controlling if they fight it, and you if harm comes to them, which can cause brain damage in yourself. Attempting to attack or control the minds of those with strong wills, or those who are telepaths as well, has a high chance of failure."
1605,,600,Enchantment,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Control,"You can bend others to your will; layering your words with power, you can cause others to trust or become infatuated with you. Doing this, you can easily brainwash others; inciting them to fight or work on your behalf. The strong willed can fight this off, and this might not work on extremely powerful beings, but once someone is under your control it won’t wear off; someone will need to snap them out of it or you’ll need to release them or lose power over them."
1606,,600,Attunement,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Control,"By focusing on a mental image of an object that you own, you can summon it to you, bringing it towards you through the quickest available route. The more complete the mental image, the quicker it will respond to your call and the faster it will fly. As an added bonus, you can summon objects from your Warehouse; where they will appear in the nearest unobserved place and fly to you as normal. If you have Companions active, you can also open portals that will allow them to come to you or vice versa; this also works across dimensions/planes of existence."
1607,,600,One Extra Line,Fate/Zero,Control,"The cost and strain of summoning can harshly what and whom a Master might summon as a Servant and moving beyond the Master’s limits can have disastrous effects on them over time. Now, you at least may worry less on this limitation. When you summon something, you pay only half of the initial cost in energy to do so but when it comes to maintaining and supplying energy to an active summon, your costs are only a tenth of what they would normally be. Your summoned being still receives the full benefit of whatever mana you would normally need to give to them but it ultimately only takes a tenth of that amount from you, no matter what they gain in the end.

Boosted:Rather than going through a lengthy ritual, possibly filled with horribly rare and expensive sacrifices, requirements and components...you can just choose to not bother. What really matters, beyond will, intent and raw energy? So long as you know what you wish to summon, you may bypass any ritual, material components, chants, durations or waiting times and simply supply enough magical energy to make up for all of them former. The harder, more complex, more expensive or more powerful, the more energy it will take, but if you can pay. And if you can gather that energy up, then you’ll also bypass anything that would normally block you from summoning something specific, though this will not allow summoning things from across jumps that you would not normally be able to summon.

1608,,600,The Thousand Siblings ,Toaruverse,Control,"While it is true that you donated your DNA when you were a child to create twenty thousand clones, it was deemed a failure by the scientist due to some unknown reason and decided to dump them. What they don’t know is those twenty thousand clones of your preferred gender and ages are telepathically connected to you with an unbreakable connection with you being the prime mind. Should your body be killed or your soul destroyed you automatically transfer your consciousness to one of the clones making you unkillable unless all twenty thousand clones along with you are killed. Each of the clones are capable of independent action and they also gain one tenth of all your powers, perks, abilities and complete knowledge that you knew and this updates automatically every time you gain something new. This also allows you to gain your own Misaka Network and processing power that it gives along with you as the administrator. Dead clones or those that you took over are replenished within one per hour or a month if all twenty thousand are killed except your jumper. By default all clones are incredibly loyal to you and each of them has distinctive personality and appearance making it that there’s no identical clones. They are all followers and cannot be imported as companions."
1609,,600,Dark Communion,Darkest Dungeon,Control,"“Let me share with you the terrible wonders I have come to know…” An arcane ritual; a pact with something from beyond time and space. Having struck a bargain with some fickle entity of the abyss, you now have the ability to direct it in battle; summoning tendrils- an insignificant portion of the beast’s true form- from hellish portals to batter your enemies into submission, pull them from their ranks, and flatten them with the eldritch force imbued in each grasping limb. Or, if this servitude is unagreeable then you can set yourself as a master of the living dead instead. Although your necromantic powers will have yet to grow to maturity you can still cause the dead to burst forth from the ground to grasp the ankles of your enemies, pulling them out of line or simply tearing them limb from limb… with enough time to “negotiate” or further your studies, you may conjure even greater things to do your bidding- or even make them fight alongside you autonomously, rather than merely following your commandments. Lastly, you may commune with this being- or the spirits of the dead- to petition them in warding your camp, strengthening an ally, or even bringing one back from death’s door… at increasing cost to both the light of your campfire and the sanity of yourself and your fellows, as a price for their meddling in mortal affairs. So long as they don’t differ from these principals, you may choose something aside from the eldritch or the undead to command, as well- perhaps plant-life that grows and wilts with unnatural speed, or swarms of rats to gnaw your foes to death?"
1610,,600,Punitive Expedition,Ragna Crimson,Control,"9000 low class dragons. 1000 middle class dragons, among which there are 40 mature dragons, who are capable of using magic. This large force has now been put under your command, probably to end some fools who tried to oppose your Bloodline. These dragons are all loyal to you, but besides the middle-class dragons, their intelligence is fairly low bordering on the animalistic. And even among the middle-class dragons, they aren’t really that bright. If any of them get killed, they will get replaced in a month. All of these dragons count as followers and will come with you in future worlds. Keep in mind that they are still weak to sunlight, so you probably will need to find something or some place to shield them from it."
1611,,600,Darkness Magic,Ragna Crimson,Control,"In its initial form, this magic grants the user the ability to control shadows. By using the shadow of the user or any other shadow around them, the user may create shadowy snakes or tentacles that allow them to carry heavy objects, immobilize targets or even attack those same targets. The user may also use the shadows around them to freely move without being detected, either hiding in someone’s shadow, or even in the shadows of others.

With mastery and sufficient magical power, another ability arises: World Collapse. This technique allows the user to completely crush a target area with their shadows, ignoring most defenses and even crushing in sealed spaces. However, using this technique may also damage the body of the user."

Born from this collision of forces are the Capture Beasts, mysterious creatures which each begin with the 100-point abilities of a Job of your choice. You start with two. More information about how Capture Beasts work, how they develop, how you create them, and what is necessary to both create them as well as utilize the most of their powers can be found in the “Capture Beasts and you” section of the notes. The most important parts to know right now is that as you are bonded with and grow closer to the Capture Beasts, they will eventually reach Mastery in their job. However, they cannot use the effects of their Mastery job perk unless they are fused with someone they consider their “Master”."
1614,,600,Bound Titan,Dresden Files,Control,"Oh. Um, no one expected this I think.

You have at your beck and call a Titan of the old blood, a full-powered being of the same power and age as Ethniu or Hyperion or Cronus or any of the others, the generation of Divinity that preceded most known Pagan pantheons. They’re bound to obey your will, and are surprisingly cool with the arrangement in that they see you as an equal and a ticket out of this reality. All of their nightmarish levels of power, skill and knowledge is at your disposal, though trying to treat them like a menial servant or calling on them too often can make them annoyed with you.

Fun, eh?"
1615,,600,Blackened Denarius,The Dresden Files,Control,"Without a doubt the most dangerous thing on this list, I can't recommend enough that you just pretend you didn't see this one. Each of the thirty Blackened Denarii contains one of the Fallen, one of the rebel angels who the Devil himself was afraid to keep around. This particular one contains one of nine Denarians we haven't met yet, who will be oh-so-happy to make your acquaintance and offer you all manner of goodies to be your partner. An inhumanly powerful form, immense knowledge, magical ability, and all it costs is a timeshare in your immortal soul. Who knows, it might even be a fair partnership, just like Anduriel and Nicky. Or they'll gradually start redecorating, until you can't even recognize who you were before and have no desire to ever go back.

Of course, if you don't want to go the whole distance, your new friend will be happy to bide their time. Rather than getting an interest in your soul, they'll just be a permanent houseguest. They can talk, and they might be able to get some influence over your perceptions, but they're completely incapable of exercising power over you directly. But believe you me, they'll be doing a hell of a lot of talking. After all, they've got a lot of time, and so much to offer if you're interested. Knowledge of all earthly languages, perfect eidetic memory, and a little power called Hellfire. This unholy flame is useful on its own, but its real trick is drastically boosting the power of any magic you fuel it with, especially its destructive elements. It'll be harder to control and using it heavily is seriously exhausting, but adding a bit of infernal gasoline to your flames can be seriously handy in a pinch. The best thing is, none of these powers will come at any cost to you at all... except the knowledge that there's so much more you could be getting, and eventually, you'll be in a situation bad enough that letting your helpful friend take that next step sounds like a really good idea.

It should be noted that this is completely incompatible with Soulfire, so unless you've got a thing for wasting points or have a friend who really shouldn't be calling you that, you should reconsider buying this if you already have that Ability. Or at all, really. Either way, you're only getting one of the two Discounts."

They've even learned to weaponize that understanding, and now, you've learned the same trick. With a thought, you can unleash a hint of your alien hatred into a foe's mind, leaving them reeling. With more concerted effort, you can unleash a blast of psychic horror, less an attack than an inevitability, designed to incapacitate the mind by overwhelming it with a perfect cocktail of the worst emotions the mind has to offer. It's hard to sustain, but only the strongest wills can hope to hold out even that brief time."
1617,,600,Kiss of Death,The Dresden Files,Control,"Not all demons are created equal, and you've got an especially powerful one. Any method you use to overcome the wills of others or manipulate their emotions has been drastically improved, letting you subvert, control, or influence all but the strongest wills. You've also drastically enhanced your ability to manipulate life force, to the point where you copy Lord Raith's trick of devouring a person's entire life force with a single kiss. Of course, all these these tricks require a way to manipulate minds, emotions, or life force, so if you're not White Court, Phage, or Warlock they might be of limited use."

Enough that they’re willing to do a whole lot for you with very little other than your love in return. Perhaps they’d be willing to use normally secret magics to help out your friends or roll up to assist you in a battle. They won’t do quite anything for you but they do think of you as a loved family member. There’s a few dozen members in this group and while they won’t be changing the world on their own, they’ve got a fair few powers to offer.

Perhaps due to the unspeakable means used to produce a worthy heir, the boy was cursed from birth. His brother Lorian was mighty, however, and he even went on to defeat the Demon Prince, dooming demon-kind to extinction. However, Lorian decided to share in his brother’s curse. Losing his ability to walk on two legs and even being stricken mute, if only so he could help ease the pain his brother’s curse caused them both. This act linked their souls, and made them nearly inseparable. You possess the ability to do something similar; linking your life to someone else’s, taking their frailties and faults into yourself in order to make them more bearable for their sake. This selfless act is not without benefit. Weakened though you may be, the strength of your bond prevents you from being truly slain so long as your counterpart still stands, with the same happening if they are slain first. You will instead enter a near-death state, from which you may be revived- the link between you and the person you are linked to makes them an ideal candidate to do this, as you can both sense the state of each other’s health. It is only when you are both slain simultaneously or in quick succession that you will truly die. In addition, you have gained the ability to teleport through the use of holy summoning circles which can be shared with the person you are connected to. The distance is short- across a large room at most- but will allow you to be at each other’s side quickly as they only require a few seconds to work. It is said that no paladin inside Lothric castle could fall, owing to the divine protection they enjoyed, and this miraculous ability lends credit to that idea."

Although their strength as giants is great, they primarily wield a peculiar, yet potent magic in the goddess’s defense instead. The Ruin Knights, sent by an ancient king to seek the Dark Soul, learned of this magic all too late- and were later held to serve it, or risk annihilation. You are capable of summoning the phantoms of those who have entered your service for a few moments; just long enough to perform a single attack, or a few if they’re particularly fast. Both those who serve you willingly and those who are forced to enter your service can be summoned in this way, and in potentially great numbers- though you can only summon one “type” of phantom at a time. If you pressed a company of soldiers into your service, then all of them could be summoned at once for those few seconds; but while you can accept the service of any number of knights into your phantasmal army, only one may be summoned at a time if they belong to separate orders. These phantoms can be summoned long after you leave the world they originated from, and indeed long after the death of the person they are based on, as they are merely magical constructs and not living beings."
1621,,600,"""Painted Shadow""",Dark Souls 3 ,Control,"The Pontiff possesses an unusual ability, perhaps based off of the echoes of those knights of Irithyll who were sent off to fulfill the Pontiff’s duties, becoming feral beasts in the process; or maybe instead off of the ability to summon others as phantom when they write messages with certain soapstones. Whatever the cause or source of this strange power, the fact remains that he has somehow learned to summon a dark shade of himself... and so have you. This phantom, even if wielding a fraction of your vitality and durability, is no less dangerous than you are, and is otherwise hampered only by its lack of initiative- rather than fighting alongside you as a duplicate, it mirrors your movements before you make them. When you think to charge, it is already rushing forward; when you wish to cast a spell, it has already done so. This is not to say that your actions are exactly the same; because you can see the phantom’s actions, it is possible for you to adjust your own in reaction. If they miss, you can strike somewhere else; if they stumble, you can avoid their mistake. They may only be a few seconds “ahead” of you, but in the heat of combat even that can be enough. Your phantom duplicate is fragile in nature, and will disappear if struck too many times. That being said, it is summoned with only a few seconds of concentration, and can be dismissed just as easily."
1622,,600,Dearest Pets ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Duke Tseldora was possessed by obsession. He was a learned man with a passion for spiders. Wealth, power and knowledge meant little to him compared to his pets. With the discovery of a powerful soul and ancient texts, he was able to give his love what he felt it deserved. You may lay claim to a single beast or creature as your ‘pet.’ This creature gains the power to grow, mutate and become ever stronger as it feasts on larger and stronger prey. Should it have already been your pet or loyal, it will eternally return that love, following your commands and never harming you. In addition to the above ability, you are also bestowed a wide variety of knowledge once belonging to the scholar Aldia, discovered during his research. You able to make freakish abominations spliced from existing beings in your lab, and brews that allow creatures to grow much larger than natural.”"
1623,,600,Real Fucking Nito ,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Great kings are often described as larger than life. If the same holds true for you then you must be larger than life. If larger, then greater, and if greater, then it too may follow your commands in a manner of thought. You have the potential to bring new life into the world by your hand alone, splitting off a fraction of your soul and surrounding it with a more substantial form. At the time of creation, you may bestow this new life with all manner of abilities reflecting the weight of your sacrifice and the nature of your being.” Your soul aligned with death would allow the creation of beings that could sing songs that soothe the dead, even if you had no such ability. Power collected through vigorous honing of your physical form may allow for the creation of beings tireless and true. The greater your sacrifice, the greater the life.”"
1624,,600,Little Chums,Dark Souls 2,Control,"“Though they started as nothing but wood, iron and leather, your compatriots fight beside you. Powerful and strange magics animated their forms and continue to do so long after the deaths of those who first gave them life. You too now have this power. You have the ability to animate constructs in great numbers that act upon your will. Each are fully intelligent and designed with the personalities you desire at their creation. Physically quite strong for whatever size they are. Altering them once they have a will of their own isn’t in the cards I’m afraid. Your small friends, or big friends, or whatever size they may be cannot be persuaded from the goals you gave them by anyone but yourself. Their loyalty is eternal. What’s more, constructs brought to life by this ability have the ability to supplement their numbers with the same power.”"
1625,,600,“Mark of Calamity”,Dark Souls 1,Control,"An accursed power possessed by no drake. No, this belongs to something far more sinister and hair raising, a beast Anor Londo feared long ago. This is the power of the Black Dragon, Kalameet. On purchase, you gain a kind of short range telekinesis. With it, you could pick up knights and beasts of matching size within range and sight, and toss them about like a child would an abused doll. Those grabbed with your power become prone to a much more terrifying power though, a curse only you and the black dragon can apply. Any enemy struck by this curse becomes vulnerable to the world around them, intensifying damage inflicted to them by twice over for a time. Purchased with Legendary Blades, and you can spawn weapons of even greater power than before, or optionally turn small things like claws or fangs into jewelry that carries this curse on its own while drawing curiosity and greed."
1626,,600,“Origin of Centipede”,Dark Souls 1,Control,"Ceaseless Discharges, cursed with defects from birth that caused him to ooze magma from open sores and pustules. Granted a ring by his mother, the Witch of Izalith, and his sisters that would soothe his pain, he would lose it and see both himself and the ring become monsters. You have been bestowed an incredible ability inspired by this tragic tale which happened long ago in this world, linked in nature to the life-giving properties of your progenitor’s twisted soul. You have the ability to transform objects into seeds of life that will grow into demons. Simply focus upon an object in hand to transfer a bit of this power into it and cast it away. The object will then grow, based on its environment and whatever abilities the object had into a demon of its own. Demons will naturally be attuned to stone or fire, but given unique circumstances may develop into something entirely different, such as lightning or perhaps even water. The more powerful the magic or spiritual abilities present in the object, the greater the demon that will grow from it. The original object that formed them can also be recovered from their corpse once slain, but oddly isn’t present on the inside until they actually die. When purchase with Skill of Capra, your demons will default to seeing you as a mother or father due to the role you played in their birth, and open towards the training allowed by said perk."
1627,,600,“Eye of Death”,Dark Souls 1,Control,"Nito, bane of all that lives in this world, epitome of death itself. You have been bestowed great curses and necromantic power reminiscent of what he holds in order to further his agenda, an end to all things. On purchase, you gain the ability to raise the dead as unliving yet animated constructs to do your bidding. Following Nito’s lead, you’re most adept at raising and controlling corpses that have long since been rendered as nothing but bones. Additionally, you have the ability to apply a curse that causes random spirits of the dead from the area around the cursed individual to raise as strong, aggressive phantoms. The only caveats are you must remain nearby to maintain it, and you begin leaking black smoke, marking you as suspicious. If purchased with Gravelord Vassal, you have the capacity to cast a Miracle known as “Black Phantom” allowing you to summon a random spirit of the dead to attack an enemy nearby without relying on a curse that tends to draw attention to you."
1628,,600,The Rejuvenating Waters ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Control,"There is said to be cursed waters in Ashina. They taste no different from normal waters and look no different. Some say these waters come from Senpo Temple, from the “strange rituals” that they began conducting there. You drank of such water and died out in the battlefield, but then awoke one day. Your wound is still there. It healed somewhat, but it turned into an ugly scar. It even still looks infected, but all you feel is a soreness from it. In fact, your sensation of pain is dulled. You did not become immortal; well, in a sense you did. You have become a form of undead with permanent red glowing eyes (which you can toggle after the Jump), cursed by the centipede that is now hosted in your stomach, which also eliminates your need for water, food, and sleep. In order to restore your body, you would need to drink more of the Rejuvenating Waters, but the more you do, the more you feel your mind literally rotting away and the centipede within you grows bigger and seems to have more influence over your actions. When you start a new Jump, the centipede will return to the size of a maggot. Know that if your body has rot enough and the centipede grows enough to completely take over your body, your chain will not end, but if the centipede dies, you shall die too which WILL result in your chain ending. As an added bonus, since you are now undead, your physical abilities are no longer capped by mortal limitations. You can go well beyond your physical limit, which will result in your muscles shredding and your bones breaking, but your sensation of pain is dulled so you might not notice at first.

Cannot be Taken with Dragon’s Heritage"
1629,,600,Rooted in Death ,Elden Ring,Control,"Godwyn the Golden’s body gave rise to the Deathroot that brings movement and a semblance of life to Those Who Live In Death. And it seems in you at least, the roots have taken on a life of their own- for you have the ability to spread and control the Deathroot embedded in your body to a short distance around you. Snap it off, and in time you may bring about more undead beings in other worlds. These new undead will instinctively regard you as their progenitor, and feel a strong compulsion to submit to you and serve your wishes even if they lack sentience. Retain your physical connection to it, and you can impale or block attacks with it as tendrils steeped in death’s power. Though not particularly sturdy compared to steel, the tendrils and your body permit you to spread Death Blight: A corruption with a significant chance of inflicting instant death on any living target, and severely corrupting even those powerful enough to resist it. Even dragons should fear prolonged exposure to your presence, unless your remains are thoroughly purged with flame or other elemental power-for it holds the potential to remake them into creatures of death themselves, and scour their minds of thought over time. Let every grave be made unquiet, as new life germinates within it."
1630,,600,The Glory of the Clash ,Elden Ring,Control,"Even among nominal rivals or strangers, even after the ultimate downfall of their general, the Redmane Legion remains a beacon of hope in the lands between. Yours is a grand charisma and talent for inspiration-able to say just the right things to keep your soldier’s spirits up in the direst of battles and a bravery that rouses both glory and loyalty from those who fight at your side. Those who fight for and with you wring out reserves of talent, courage and perseverance beyond what they normally find yourself capable of, strangers find themselves drawn to your cause from far and wide, and even nominal enemies can be converted into fast friends by finding common cause or values. In the heat of battle, cohesion is maintained even in the face of odds as dire as another demigod leading an army-and defeat will not stop your forces from carrying out your legacy. This even extends to animals you treat with all the respect due to fellow soldiers, who will go above and beyond the call of duty to do you proud."
1631,,600,Fell Flagship,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A flagship, average in its capabilities besides being intimidating and well made. However, it has a curse on it...though one that’s not necessarily a negative - any ships that fly the same flag as the Fell Flagship with the flag dabbed with that ship’s captain’s blood will become part of its “fleet”, becoming bound to it. This cursed ship can withdraw the crew and ships that join its fleet within its shadow, and release them from beneath the waves when the time is right - and what’s worse, ships that sink while under it’s banner are repaired and raised, though ships without crews must find a new crew - luckily, one can easily withdraw the ghost ship into the Flagship’s shadow until needed once again."
1632,,600,Waker of the Wilds,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"By infusing a heavy amount of magic into the natural landscape around you, you can awaken elemental guardians that will follow your will, though they are disinclined and will refuse to act if their actions would directly destroy the very nature they arise from - in any other sense, they are mighty and enduring guardians, towering over many of the foes in this world with sheer majesty. "
1633,,600,Nest Tender,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A true instrument of life and growth...you are capable of coalescing mana into stone to create mystical eggs for powerful creatures, the forms of which are mysteries to you - but for some reason, creatures of magical origin in this world tend to manifest as large powerful dinosaurs, and the creatures of the eggs are no different. The use of other forms of magic or energy to nurture these eggs may change what kinds of creatures they create, but you are capable of having them feed on ambient mana within the land to enhance the strength of the creatures within. Creatures emerge from the eggs fully formed, ready to battle or protect at your leisure."
1634,,600,Priest of the Threefold Sun,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"A true paragon of the Sun Empire, you are able to use astronomical amounts of mana to call upon “Avatars”, beings of primal forces such as the Tides, Hunger, or the cycle of Death, and give them a physical form with both the physical and potentially magical might to match their titles - the power they hold often enough to easily crash through this land’s cities and reap through their fleets with the force of a natural disaster - though be wary, you have very little control over what they decide to do when created - once you unleash the manifestation of destruction onto a land, it is foolish behavior to expect it to simply dance to your tune without any other plans to command their obedience. "
1635,,600,Grim Captain's Call ,MtG - Ixalan,Control,"There is a whispered fear in the land. A figure who steals the souls of pirates and makes them his crew. The Grim Captain, this land’s Davy Jones. It appears you may either be that Captain or one of their disciples, as a dark magic that allows you to resurrect the dead as skeletal and zombified undead now comes frighteningly naturally to you - even working on the bones of dinosaurs, or the ichor that forms from their bodies deep underground. "
1636,,600,A Feast For The Gods,MtG - Zendikar,Control,"After much intense study of the gods, you have come to understand the principals by which they are drawn to mana. With this you understand how to draw them to your location with some preparation of the local mana - a rather arduous process involving the rearranging of landmarks and hedrons manually should you lack some form of magic to ease the process. Through your study of the gods your knowledge of the eldrazi has grown deep enough that you have learned the summoning patterns of the lesser members of the brood, along with that of a small number of Demi-Titans, including the Breaker of Armies and Worldbreaker. In later jumps this will allow you to draw one Titan into the world you are in by rearranging the local mana, through whatever means you have, though getting them to do what you want is another matter."
1637,,600,Serra's Angels ,MtG - Homelands,Control,"While the lady Serra did not intentionally take on the mantle of a goddess, her abilities and works made the assumption quite easy. With this, you share in her aptitude for the most famous of her powers, the creation of complicated constructs of white mana. Used to its fullest potential, this is the power and skill that allowed Serra to create her angels.

While you are perfectly capable of replicating that feat, using complicated magic to create angels as powerful manifestations of white mana, this use of your power is very taxing. You will become more adept at doing so with practise, but for now a somewhat faster method of creating angels is perhaps more practically useful to you. By creating only the physical body of an angel from pure white mana, you may allow a war-spirit to possess this construct and fight in your name. The soul of a fallen warrior, given new form in white mana. Regardless of your exact methods, your angels suffer no lasting damage if their physical body is destroyed. Their spirits will eventually return to you to be reformed, or they may simply journey to a place of abundant white mana to take physical form again.

Beyond the creation of angels, you may also create lesser constructs of white mana like the abbey gargoyles created to guard the city of Onella and police its people, with stony hides, sharp claws, and functional wings. Such creatures may not be as impressive or versatile as an actual angel, but would still be fearsome and could easily be seen as walking miracles by the populace of whatever places you set them to guard.

As a final minor benefit, you may surround yourself with a gently flickering nimbus of light and white mana. Illuminating your surroundings and giving yourself an understated but distinctively divine appearance."
1638,,600,DREDGE,MtG - Ravnica,Control,"Necromancy is no easy feat. Many of those who practice it within the Golgari Swarm are only able to create mindless, shambling servants. However, your talent for necromancy goes far beyond that. You can bring back creatures with intelligence and power equal to that which they possessed while still alive. You can also choose to add the zombie creature type to your own, becoming an undead version of whatever you were before - perhaps as a regular zombie, or maybe as a Lich, or something of a similar nature."
1639,,600,AFTERLIFE ,MtG - Ravnica,Control,"People have debts, and these debts must be paid. Even beyond death. You possess the ability to form contracts which bind people’s souls so they are forced to pay off their debts. If they happen to die with debts unpaid, then they are forced to come back in as a spirit to work them off. And spirits are subject to many bylaws which make their “lives” particularly... manipulable. Even in other worlds, where this sort of practice may not be customary, you find it decidedly easier to get people to sign their souls over to you."
1640,,600,Contract of Geth ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"The contacts made by the Lord of the Vault Geth bind the signers not by their word, but by their will. Whoever breaks one of these contracts would normally find their will falling entirely under Geth’s control--but this set of Eldritch metallic tablets in your possession belong to you, and it is you who may make these sorts of contracts using them. Perfect for contracts between distrusting parties--though beware, breaking the contracts yourself is Ill advised…"
1641,,600,Perfection Through Ambition,MtG - New Phyrexia,Control,"You've attained perfection to stand above all else, to obtain whatever you desire. Not only do you have great skill at misdirection, you can easily trick your enemies into falling for each other's traps, even inciting resentment among them to ensure their squabbling will make them unable to even come close to actually harming you. You have also gained the respect of some of the more... “adept” players in the shadows, which, while it wont prevent you from getting backstabbed by them if they're opposing you, will ensure they won’́t while they're working FOR you. The effects of “The Oil”, if you have it, are boosted, making you even stronger while covered by it, and can glean information from those infected by it, giving you knowledge of their secrets."
1642,,600,Cloudsteel Kirin ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"There are gods aplenty in these lands, but precious few miracles that do not involve them in some form. This mechanical horse is one that was crafted by human hands, though admittedly with some materials acquired from helpful Kami. The Cloudsteel Kirin is, simply put, victory forged into the shape of a horse. Beyond simply being able to fly whilst riding upon it, you will find that fortune favors you to an absurd extent while you do. Arrows divert their path, angry Kami are turned aside, and the morale of your forces skyrockets so absurdly that Samurai who are all but dead will find it within themselves to keep fighting long after their bodies should have broken. It would be no exaggeration to proclaim that no amount of force could cause you to fail at whatever task you have set out to accomplish. Be warned, however, that this only lasts for as long as you sit upon its back. Take but a single step off, be thrown, or even should the Kirin be destroyed then you will find reality crashing back into you as the fate you had been warding off suddenly comes true."
1643,,600,Favorite Child Of The Forests,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"Without exception, every member of the Order of Jukai is sworn to one Kami or another. It’s part of how the Order exerts influence over the Kami, and gains the power to exert influence over the rest of Kamigawa. However, it needs to be said - they are only sworn to one Kami. For you however, this need not be true. You are for one reason or another, somehow considered to be a perfect or nigh incomparable minion for Kami to have. They would seek you out instead of needing to be sought, they would give you gifts instead of needing to be gifted, and if their need was great enough or your tongue quick enough you might even be able to host contracts from several of them at once. Even when they are not actively pursuing you as a channeler, it becomes vastly easier to negotiate with them as something akin to an equal instead of being a petitioner. With even minor favors and blessings from a handful of Kami, you would become a very large source of political power. Perhaps you could even conjure an entire faction into being using those favors?"
1644,,600,Black Prince Amongst The Fallen,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Control,"Supposedly, one of the highest leaders of the current generation of Reckoners is a member of clan Umezawa, a descendant of the original Reckoner and hero of the Kami War. Supposedly. There’s no proof, but also no one willing to contradict the man. Except maybe for you, another supposed descendant of an equally famous and or infamous individual from that same era. Yes, that claim is a bit nebulous, but see above - no one is willing to contradict you on your claims of ancestry. This grants you an in with almost every criminal organization that exists, and no small amount of weight to your requests, “requests”, and any orders you may give you. More importantly at the moment, this weight to your existence allows you to assume a level of command over spirits and Kami where no other mortal would try to do so without a heavy bribe and a good dose of begging. The downsides of channeling a Kami are probably not worth it to you, but having a few trustworthy minions empowered by a few blackhearted Kami is something that would lend you an absurd level of reputation even aside from their newfound utility."
1645,,600,Shadowgate,MtG - Kamigawa,Control,"A mirror which is seemingly made of Obsidian bathed in oil. This mysterious artifact allows its possessor to travel through the shadows as if they were doors to another world and using this shadow realm one could easily infiltrate even the most secure of places with time and effort, or so the folk around here say. In truth, this allows teleportation to any shadow in any location that the user knows well enough to give a thorough overview of it’s general description. If you don’t have such knowledge ahead of time then you could try dipping into the shadows for hours at a time, finding the general location before stepping out of the shadows. Two things makes this artifact stand above others. First it has no cost. Second, it is unlimited in the distance it crosses as long as the location is in the same Plane."
1646,,600,Seedling ,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"A single seedbody, large enough to fill an elf’s hands. Perhaps a compact, segmented cone or an oaknut in its shell. Most likely matching your species of tree, or one of choice if you are not a treefolk yourself. It holds the next generation of your line, old rituals ensuring that it is all but guaranteed to go through the Rising. More impressively, it shall be in possession of all your knowledge, though lacking your long lifetime of habits, opinions, and quirks.

Already the casing has cracked, revealing tantalizing slivers of green within. It is ready to sprout. If you plant this seedling just before your death, the sapling grown from it will strive to faithfully carry on your plans and preserve your memory and knowledge. So long as this sapling has sprouted and remains alive, you will not count your death as a failure of your chain, being revived at the start of the next jump. Your offspring’s naivety might prove a hindrance to actually carrying out whatever plans you might have had though, no matter how much knowledge you pass on. Alternatively, you could simply plant it and raise a reverent sapling possessing of all your knowledge, if not your wisdom and experience. Either way, you will receive a new seedbody at the start of the next jump after planting it. And should you wait to plant it, it shall be patient in kind, its development frozen as long as you wish."
1647,,600,Cloudgoat,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"Especially wide-ranging giant travelers keep enormous winged goats as pets and steeds. Being just about the only creatures on Lorwyn that could possibly carry the weight of a giant, barring an elemental incarnation lowering itself to so mundane a purpose, these creatures serve as trusty mounts that allow giants to fly to Lorwyn's most distant mountain ranges, and perhaps even beyond the mountains to regions unknown.

Now you have gained one of these rare creatures yourself, a gleaming, white-furred goat that towers amongst the clouds, almost indistinguishable from them from the perspective of smaller folk. It is more than large enough for a giant forty feet tall to ride, far larger, in fact, such that it could easily seat an entire trio of such giants and still lift itself into the air on titanic wings. This immense goat steed will allow you to ride it, and otherwise follows you around with an aloofness that only a stubborn, horn-headed herbivore could muster. Maybe you could use the cloudy white wool for something too?"
1648,,600,Greater Elemental ,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"On Lorwyn, abstract entities such as hopes, fears, dreams, and nightmares are just as real as the grass and the trees. A feeling of hope, for example, can lurk in the heart of a single kithkin, or it can manifest into a glorious, shining creature - an elemental of hope.
 
Elementals are manifestations of the highest form of magic, power so strong that it becomes a living, immortal thing. Vastly different in form from other worlds' elementals, the greater elementals take the form of bizarre combinations of natural animals, many of colossal size. Sometimes elementals on Lorwyn vary in prevalence just like the abstract idea underlying them. If elves wage war on giantkind, then many-clawed elementals of warfare and strife can be seen with greater frequency. On the other hand, if bloodshed keeps to a minimum across the plane, elementals of violent death may themselves die out until their time comes again. As beings of elemental flame themselves the flamekin feel a connection to these great elemental spirits. They regard them as totems or demigods that inspire their creative impulses, or frustrate their understanding. You now share this connection, a singular elemental deeply connected to you. They shall guide you on your path and endeavors for now, and share their power once you find them and deepen your connection."
1649,,600,Vinebred ,MtG - Lorwyn,Control,"Under the direction of the Exquisite leadership, elf druids spent months or sometimes years rearing and tending the vinebred. Virtually any living thing could be controlled by the special magic nettlevines that were the key to the process, taking root in the spine and spreading across their host's entire body until the original creature was entirely encased in tough, flexible braids. Tiny thorns along the vines pierced the skin of the host, feeding on its blood even as the vines returned nutrients and powerful, strength-enhancing magic back in the host body. Retaining the same rough shapes as the creatures they once had been, it was easier to spot the host body within the tendrils, moss, and flexible wooden musculature when they were in motion.

Once enshrouded, the vinebred creature was magically bound to obey the commands of all elves. The higher that elf ranked, the stronger his control over his puppet warriors. Vinebred creatures were not mindless, and they were not the product of necromancy. They were alive, and the most useful were intelligent and aware of their abilities and place in the order of Lorwyn. As perfect slaves they were not just willing to follow orders, but actively wanted to and often made extraordinary efforts to achieve the goals set for them.

You now retain the services of two dozen of these exalted creatures for yourself, a honor guard of elite vinebred made from your choice of whatever host creatures you might want. Whether they were boggarts, kithkin, or even cast-out elves who had been blighted like the most perfect of elite vinebred are made of. You might even choose to take vinebred giants, though each of those massive eyeblights would take the place of eight smaller creatures. Should they fall in battle, or live out their nettlevine-shortened lifespans, they may be quickly replaced with new vinebred of choice."
1650,,600,Elbrus the Binding Blade,MtG - Innistrad,Control,"A blade of bone that once held the demon Withengar, a greater demon and one of the many worshipped by the Skirsdaag cult. The demon was released by a deceived Saint Traft, who was tricked into slaying a group of cultists that had led him into a trap. By recreating this ritual that led to his freedom, granting someone unwitting the blade and having them slay their enemies, Withengar can be summoned in future jumps."
1651,,600,The Beginning Of A Bloodline ,MtG - Innistrad,Control,"You are the vilest foulest being I have ever had the displeasure to encounter. And unlike your predecessor, you cannot claim famine as an excuse. Flimsy as even that is, against the atrocity you have committed upon the world in doing this. By exsanguinating an angel, or another being of similar holiness and purity, with the vilest of demon gotten blood magics, you are able to transform humans into vampires. Creating a new first generation of vampires, able to start a whole new bloodline and a whole new blight upon our land. (You may use any vampire alt form you possess, or standard Innistardi vampires). You may summon magical copy of vampires created by this perk using red and black mana."
1652,,600,Heads of the Hydra,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Control,"Nature proliferates and grows. Usually this is as a whole becoming an environment and an ecosystem. But there are certain creatures that buck this trend, not merely apex predators but creatures outside the natural formula yet borne from it. You have an affinity with such creatures, hydras. Not only are you able to tame such animals with regularity and with far less difficulty than even advanced civilization could, achieving the feat through skill rather than a need for magic. You also gain some fragment of their power of regeneration, letting you heal most wounds overnight assuming you survive them, including the regrowing of limbs and organs.

In addition, you are capable of mutating non-sapient creatures into hydras of some form using a large quantity of Green mana. The power of the creature will depend on the type of creature and how much power it had before the process. The more powerful the end result of this process, the more skill you need and mana you are required to put into it. A general rule of thumb when creating such creatures is that the more heads it grows the more powerful it becomes. A great wolf twice the size of a man when mutated may only have it grow two to three heads like a cerberus without the ability to breathe fire. Where as a great sea serpent that can sink whole fleets may grow nine heads easily."
1653,,600,Lying With Demons ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Control,"Demons are beings of corruption and evil, borne of Black Mana and plaguing the Abyss. You now hold a particular affinity with them, a dark association to be sure. It is incredibly easy to understand demons, and while they might not find you likable you can control them with far greater ease. Even some powerful demon lords would feel understandably nervous of you, wanting to be on your good side in fear that you might usurp them.

To some people your mastery in handling demons might seem like you have one whispering in your ear. That might be more true than they realise, for you see you have an entity within you. It is formed of a massive amount of Black Mana though regardless of whether this voice is your own or another being it is intrinsically bonded to you and has your best interests at heart. This being can act as an advisor with a more cruel viewpoint, boosts your Black Mana aligned magics and actively provides you with a very unique boon.

Specifically, it lets you use this vast quantity of Black Mana to forcibly engage in contracts with demons subjugating them in blatantly unfair terms, making them slaves and binding them to your service. This form of subjugation usually only works on demons clearly weaker than you, but even when engaging in a voluntary contract with a powerful demon this power can let you shrug off some conditions of a contract such that you might get away with trading another powerful soul instead of your own like originally agreed upon."
1654,,600,Walking With Angels,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Control,"Angels are beings of beauty and faith, borne of White Mana and defending the ideals of morality. You now hold a particular affinity with them, like Serra before you. It is incredibly easy to form bonds with angels, as they seem to just understand you and find you inherently likable. It is also easy for you to also convert angels to corruption or be able to redeem fallen angels.

In addition your Mana finds the shape of angels incredibly comfortable, as such you are able to birth them with ease that even powerful Planeswalkers would find baffling. It would be easy to create a group of five angels at a time for the cost of one of equal power, letting you create great armies to protect entire realms. Individuals of greater power, however, are much more difficult, as creating archangels or more powerful angels like Avacyn will still strain you even after years of effort and study, though less so than most Planeswalkers. The angels you form tend to conform to the values you teach them, and even find themselves as related to each other, meaning they will never truly feel as the only of their kind as other artificial angels feel. Serra was seen as a goddess for this gift, will you be worthy of it?"

This ship is a bit smaller than a Trireme, but what it doesn’t have in size it has in speed and maneuverablity. This ship is incredibly fast able to leagues of distance within a couple of days and it’s able to make turns that would break other ships in half. The ship is a surprisingly adapatable thing too. You may even find a way to turn the masts and sails of the ship into a makeshift glider. Be warned doing this may push even the unusual durability of this ship to the breaking point. The ship also comes with an empty armory, galley, storage area, brig, and crew quarters. Hope you have some way of filling all that space."

many things normally considered impossible, like the Mind, Body and Soul each existing
independently of one another. It happened to you as it does to Hakuno but you gained the ability to
do it at will, splitting your being into three individuals that represent these three traits. Each one is
equal to your full self, though with certain differences. The Soul is more submissive and easily led, the mind is physically weaker and less adept at combat, with the body lacking good forward thinking
and planning abilities. However, each one otherwise possesses all your abilities and remains as you,
just in three different perceptions of you. Should one die, it causes the forced fusion of the
remaining two to survive, leaving the splitting ability unable to activate for a few days. Death of one

Unlocked events can be changed once again, no longer set in stone, for good or ill. While there is no restriction on how many times the key can unlock something, it can also create a Quantum Timelock to guarantee that a specific event cannot be changed and will be present in every alternate world, regardless of the means to attempt to divert history. This locking can only be used once per ten years, relative to you rather than any time travel or manipulation."
1658,,600,Jumper Number,Fate/Extra CCC,Control ,"What’s better than one Jumper? Nine of them, of course. See, there’s this little phenomenon in this world, that powerful enough beings can make offshoots of themselves based on parts and fragments of their personalities, which gain a full mind, will, and ego of their own. These avatars can be given some measure of power to begin with, and they can even grow on their own, due to being a technically separate being now. Of course, such beings are still very vulnerable to things that utilize their connection to their creator, such as sympathetic magic, but they can be very handy sometimes.

You now possess this capability, even if you’re not very strong. Unlike normal, it doesn’t diminish you, at least until you make eight avatars, at which point you’ll start to actually have to sacrifice power to make more of them. They are based on parts of yourself, and so aren’t guaranteed to be loyal or get along with you or each other, and sadly you can’t really dismiss them at will, but should you manage to control them they might be useful as subordinates. Their actual power will vary, never being stronger than you to begin with, but you can choose freely how much power you give them, up to about half of the power you can bring to bear. That said, at their weakest they’ll be on the level of an average human being, so you don’t need to worry about making crippled avatars if you’re too weak."
1659,,600,Army of the Soul,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Control ,"The reality marble is the manifestation of your soul, the deepest expression of your personal reality
projected onto the world around you, granting you new powers and capabilities within that
projection and without it.However, you’re something of a special case, as your Reality Marble is not
quite the same. Rather than something reflecting your own unique soul, and thus not taking the
place of any potentially forming natural Reality marble should you have the potential, is something
representing a collective.

You are able to project a vast landscape around you, similar to other reality marbles, that takes you
and anyone within a moderate range into a dimension pocket that is difficult, but not impossible, to
break out of. Within this world, taking the form of a battlefield such as an empty plain or desert
fields, is your army. The army of those beings that have pledged their loyalty to you in battle, even if
only for a short time, as that action creates a spiritual replica of that person stored within your soul. This replica is the same as that person at the peak of the time that they served you, with their
memories, power, equipment and so on. There is no limit to the replicas that can be stored within
your spirit this way and it costs you nothing to do so, each of them acting to your will when you
project the Reality Marble. Even outside of the full projection, you are able to summon individuals or
small groups of these replicas to aid you in the normal world and can potentially learn to accomplish
new things, such as taking on the abilities of those replicas or summoning them in combined forms.

It is costly to fully project and create a dimension pocket, especially to maintain it, but your mana
reserves have been increased to allow for easy maintenance of your full Reality Marble for several
hours before exhausting yourself. It is less costly to make use of the partial summonings and other
lesser abilities described earlier but still notable."

These battle sisters were raised alongside you since you were all born, training to act in perfect harmony with each other and with you, their chosen leader. In fact, such was the loyalty and love that they grew up into feeling for you that they are even willing to abandon the Amazon kingdom and follow only you. Each one is a lesser hero in their own right, the equal of a small army, and equipped with several moderately powerful pieces of magical equipment. While the twelve women each have their own specialties in combat, such as a potent archer or steadfast shieldbearer, and out of it, the team’s wonderful cook or their favoured bard, the true power of these twelve manifests in the way that they can take on a portion of your own powers. No more than ten percent at the very most but it allows them to always perform as the royal guard they were born to be for you. The group acts as a companion together and imports will be either divided among them or focused on singular individuals."

Greek Mythology and may be anything from one of the greatest winged horses, the Cerberus that
guarded the underworld itself or some monstrosity like the Chimera. While it’s not quite strong
enough to kill a dragon, the beast is able to contend with some of the most powerful heroes and
monsters in Greece, their battles capable of destroying entire mountains. It will most certainly have
unique traits and abilities of it’s own, such as the blinding speed of the Pegasus and it’s almighty
charge or the poison and nigh-immortal regeneration of one of the great Hydras. Surprisingly, you
appear immune to the special abilities of your pet, useful in case of things like Hydras. The Divine

1662,,600,Drenched Consort,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Control ,"When people think of evil spirits, they think of beings that spread bad luck, simply misfortune or who bear grudges against the living. Rarely do they encounter, even dare to think of, a creature as vile as the one you claim heritage from. A parent, spiritual ancestor, teacher or even just who you were a few years ago; you learned from the cursed fox witch Da Ji in China the ways to toy with the hearts of men. Sneaking into the homes of kings and queens, having them fall for your schemes and wiles, binding men with mad lust and leading whole kingdoms in your wake. Infiltration, political manipulation, deceit and the seduction of rulers are all your bread and butter. Even a great hero is far more vulnerable to your words than to any rampaging beast and those who discover your cruel nature beyond the lies can often be twisted away to a new target, it proving easy to pretend to be innocent and little threat. 

The many ways to cause agony to the body, mind and soul and great experience in their use has also given you potential for something much more important to the world. Your extensive torture experience, including with a variety of magecraft spells suited to such, has given you the first hints of evolving into a Evil of Humanity. Da Ji’s evil is something you can claim to match and this potential could develop should you continue to perform worse and worse crimes against mankind. The more evil you commit, the more your power will grow and the closer you get to becoming a Beast. Already, you possess a natural understanding of the nature of mankind, part of what makes your ability to manipulate them above come so close to magical effectiveness."

takes the focus of history, the figures whose decisions change the fate of nations, and their servants
are often forgotten behind them. For you though, the idea of these unseen allies is quite a bit more
literal. Those who form a bond with you in their lives, even an antagonistic one, can be summoned
by you to act as a Servant for your cause. The target must accept to aid you, making it rare but not
impossible for your enemies to give aid, but manifest immediately to you if they do. Normally, each
summoned Servant would require a hefty price of mana as upkeep to remain summoned even for
weaker allies, but your chosen ones manifest within your shadow. This reduces the drain to a small
constant, making it possible for notably magical warriors to maintain up to seven useful allies
without feeling much strain. 

Within the shadow, they are each aware of your surroundings and able to communicate with you
mentally to provide advice or warnings, though you must verbally respond for them to hear you. They can briefly and partially manifest from the shadow at a small cost of energy, handing you tools
they have access to or even firing off attacks and special techniques available to them. They can act
without input from you, shielding blindspots and weaknesses but all energy costs they must meet
come from your own stores. Full manifestation of these Servants is possible but would require you
to pay the entire cost of their upkeep, a hefty requirement for even a single ally. Within your shadow, each ally appears in a mental world of their choice, a place that you can mentally place yourself to
talk and interact ‘in person’, even taking others you are in contact with to the mental realm."

They say the ocean cannot be tamed, that the storm is a cruel mistress who you must go along with or else perish. They’re all bloody cowards that don’t even try to step up and tame the ocean for themselves. It takes a proper legend to become a master of the sea, one with the abilities that you possess. As a captain of a vessel, you are nearly unparalleled. Your skill with controlling the ship and crew, as well as fulfilling the individual roles on the ship, has reached a level some claim is the realm of magic. Under your command, a single ship of quality can lay low entire fleets of worthy enemies. Cannonfire tears into vital points, your ship dances like a spinning top on the waves, at times moving beyond what should be physically possible simply at your guidance. The ship becomes your weapon and an extension of your body, moving to your will and breaking the boundaries of physical laws. 

Those on your ship are near helpless against the charisma of it’s captain, a boundless energy that radiates from you when you are at the helm. To them, anything seems possible by following your path. It’s more true than they realise. Under your guiding hand, even the impossible becomes possible for voyages, exploration, journeys and all things to do with sailing ships. Storms that destroy all ships are passable by you, magical spells that should ward away your vessel break to allow you discovery of their treasures, even a mighty Divine Spirit might somehow fall before your loyal crew and cannon shot if they guarded a great treasure you sought. Your true talents is to realise the impossible when it fits within your purview as a legendary pirate and sailor of the seas."

With a fleet like this, there won’t be many people that tell you no when you claim the title. Forty two pirate vessels, many of which are massive galleons and warships that would be the proud flagship for a lesser crew, and a large number of much smaller ships that support them. Each one is stocked with a veteran crew loyal to you and your ideals, many of them having made minor names for themselves before entering your service. When not called to war under your flag, they raid, adventure and explore as pirates too. Each ship gladly gives a tithe of their earnings to the lord of the fleet, which has made you an enormously wealth individual. While the ships are not magical, those destroyed or who have lost their crew will find their way back to you after a few days, vessels sailing out of the mist or new crew eager to join your armada.

person. Some believe that, if anything, it is much more likely that it was a group who undertook his
crimes, connected or not. Whatever the truth is, you should be used by now to the idea that it’ll be
to your benefit. These careless theories mean that you can translate your being into the form of a
group, as Jack was believed to be.
By expending a small amount of your magical energy, you can create a fully identical clone of your
current form, controlled by your mind as your identity spreads across this group. The more energy
you spend, the more clones are made, and each one is a ‘main body’ as part of the Ripper. Even if
your original form is killed, one of your clones will immediately be treated as having always been
your primary body. It is even possible to draw on magical energy from outside sources to create
more clones. However, the cost of each clone will raise as your current form’s strength does. While
the cost is exceedingly efficient and the increases due to form power are minor, even a notable
magus of the modern age could support two hundred demonic Ripper forms for a time, it will
eventually begin to strain the source. Clones largely rely on the initial energy investment and take
only a small amount to maintain longer term, since they do not naturally produce more energy on
their own as most magi do, barring specific abilities you have. 

You can choose the ‘current form’ that the clones are replicated from, which decides how much
energy is required per clone. They might be of different alternate forms you can take on or just
weaker versions of your current one. "
1667,,600,Divine Horde,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Control,"An army of beasts descending from heaven to stand guard at your call. A legion of monstrous
servants fit for even the greatest of the gods, the beasts number well into the many thousands. Many of these are lesser monsters, each having the intelligence of humans but not being too far
beyond what a handful of veteran soldiers of the Age of Gods could take on together. While these
servitors act as useful agents, often with abilities to let them pass among humans such as being
vampires or spirits, you also hold the loyalty of a range of more powerful creatures. Several dozen
potent phantasmal creatures, such as lesser dragons, powerful demons, matured djinn or even
angelic heralds. These creatures are generally equal in power to the Deadly Creature tier of the Age
of Monsters perk.

The leader of these creatures is a member of the final tier of that option, by default set to be the
mythical Bull of Heaven Gugalanna. Greatest of Divine Beasts, the Bull of Heaven is a herald of the
end for any foe that displeases you. This pet beast that has bound itself to you is an enormous thing, standing as tall as a mountain, and has powers beyond any but the great gods themselves. Just
calling it to appear by your side can summon natural disasters, such as eight hundred kilometer wide
hurricanes and continent wide earthquakes, and the creature itself can annihilate entire cities with a
snort or shatter a kingdom with a stomp. It has the power to control the elements of the world, bringing about massive floods and turning the world around it to night, even call down falling stars
from the sky to turn mountains to dust. The creature could take you around the world in just
minutes and fly far above the clouds if desired. It is entirely intelligent, though the mind it has is
alien to any human thought, and uses it’s powers with cunning and forethought in any battle. It is
not invincible but there is very little on this world that could bring it to pause.

Rings of Solomon that lie on your fingers now represent supremacy over magic, allowing you
immense command over the arcane. Any and all existing magecraft is under your control, allowing
you to negate, create or control it as you wish no matter who uses it. Even the greatest human
magus is powerless before you. Magical spells that are not of magecraft are still affected by your rings however, though to a much lesser extent. You can control or negate the spells of any being
weaker than you as normal but magic users that equal you can still act, though at a greatly
weakened level. Those stronger than you will see less and less difficulty in casting magic. The Rings

magical resistance as the Saint option above but yours is powered by Unholy power. Perhaps from
some hell, a black demon or even your own hateful heart. You are also around as capable in martial
combat as the Saint, likely due more to your own efforts or from the teachings of someone that has
since betrayed you. While you lack the myriad moderate miracles of the Saint, you have a single
potent power of your own. You’ve got the title of Dragon Witch, granting you authority and
dominance over all dragons. Anything not significantly more powerful than you is forced to bow it’s
head and follow your commands, even those too strong to command are still influenced by you. This
ability also translates to great skill in riding dragons yourself, especially in turning them effectively to
military purposes. What use is the armies of God against a flight of dragons and their fire?
Possessing this and the Saint option will give you the abilities of both but you may only be holy or
unholy, not both. The one you pick will colour the second options nature."

decided to consider you as it’s master. A powerful beast more than capable of weaving between
massed firearm attacks with it’s speed and agility, along with having enough strength that even a
powerful paladin would be wary of it’s charge. But the real value of the Hippogriff comes from it’s
nature as an impossible existence, a trait which allows it to travel to and fro into the Reverse Side of
the World, where myths and phantasmal beasts reside. It is able to do this quite easily in a partial
manner, turning it and it’s rider invisible and untouchable to effects that cannot pass dimensional
barriers, or fully in order to genuinely travel to the Reverse Side until the creature makes it’s return
trip. In future worlds, the Hippogriff will be able to travel to similar alternate realities, filled with the
myths and legends of those worlds. The winged beast is quite intelligent, almost that of a human, and has a large store of personal magical energy that it uses mostly for it’s transportation ability. Given it’s intellect, it has already become very experienced in fighting with a knight rider, making the
use of a lance particularly effective."

now and then, especially if it’s the sort that likes tricks. Like that damn Coyote. But what it’ll also do
is act as a mighty weapon for you, attacking your enemies and automatically acting to protect you
form any foes. A Great Spirit of the rivers could crush and drown entire towns, the Great Spirit of the
mid-day sun may incinerate an entire army that seeks to attack you, Coyote himself could slip
through the shadows, tearing out the throats and hearts of dozens of men each second. Far from a

realm of the Divine Beasts. It is a creature capable of contending with the weaker Dragonkind and no
mortal army could threaten it. In mere physical power, the beast is incredible and in flight it can
cross the continent in less than an hour. It’s true power is the connection with the weather and
when wishing to do so, it can easily call up destructive storms, enormous tornadoes, massive
lightning strikes or supernatural heat or cold, even across all of Central America at once. A natural
power of it, the Quetzalcoatl can manipulate the weather at almost no cost to itself. While it has not

increased the power of the blade. The truth can be clouded at times but what is obvious is that you
possess such a power. You have the ability to place restrictions on your own powers and equipment, the more numerous and more severe the restrictions, the greater the ability or item becomes when
it meets them. A sword that unleashes a holy laser of mana may be made many times as powerful by
meeting 13 fairly strict requirements but layering on hundreds of easy to meet rules may only
provide a minor boost. Because it is sourced from yourself, the restrictions will be aware of what
rules are truly hard to meet for you and what can be easily adhered to, so it is impossible to cheat

Cycles of reincarnation have been dreamed about by religion and philosophers for a long time, but an eternal sticking point is the inevitable death of the ego as the soul passes between lifetimes. How fortunate you’ve found a way to preserve yourself, abilities and all, into the next life you appear within. Now, normally that's a timetable measured in generations, but since we don’t have that sort of time, I’ll throw you a bone. When you are completely slain, your spirit will flee to the nearest compatible vessel- usually human, but any other ‘race’ you possess a form for is also valid - and will quietly began to overtake their consciousness as they manifest your abilities and monstrous nature,assimilating their personalities into your own as you consume their being and add it to your own. You are able to wander for a time as a bodiless soul and choose your desirable vessel, if you so wish. This ordinarily takes years, but you can completely overtake an ordinary human being within weeks - you won’t even need to possess an infant to do so, you may overtake adults and teenagers just as easily. Once you are made whole and have assumed full control,you keep all the benefits your host gives you, and you are free to reincarnate once again should you be slain yet again.

Though I will warn you - while most humans you choose as a vessel in this world are doomed,stronger beings may excise you with ease or destroy your soul completely before you can take them, and that happening to you will make death will embrace you. While your soul incubates within its newest host, you are vulnerable, and should they be slain before you complete your rebirth, this immortality will not save you and you will truly die. Should your consciousness not take complete hold of the host before your time in the jump expires, it will be considered a failure. In addition, your soul remains vulnerable, and powerful magical weapons could burn it away completely. Until that day comes? Eternity is yours.

1677,,600,Master of Babel ,Kara no Kyokai,Control,"A relic of a bygone era, a pure expression of the idea that mystery, that age, that the very weight of history itself cannot be conquered by mortal humans. The Godword, the Unified Language, is the original tongue that existed, but not necessarily spoken, before all living things were separated and categorised, before humanity was divided from the beasts and the plants and the dirt and the dust. It is Truth, something no human can reject. They’d have to reject their very existence as a human to do so. Those who speak this language, impossible remnants of a time that does not exist in this history, can thus command humanity. 

As one of only two living users of the language, you can take dominance over any human that hears your words. It is impossible to resist for true humans, though those with a connection to the Root or similar traits can mitigate the commands. For all others, it acts as an absolute hypnosis that lasts until a day after they last heard your command. It goes much deeper than just the mind or body however. Telling someone that they cannot see you would render you invisible to them. Telling someone that their magic cannot affect you would cause it to fail. These are orders that imprint on the deepest part of someone’s being. Your words must be heard however and even simple earplugs can rob you of your power against someone. 

The Godword only applies to humans and even mixed heritage with non-humans grants the chance to resist, with non-humans ignoring it entirely. A sign some might take to prove humanity’s destiny for civilisation and dominance over others. It also relies on intent, your desire to order others. If you wish, you can simply communicate across all language barriers with other humans without the control.

However, due to...a few mishaps in the seal, the Phantom requires no mana to sustain itself. However, it does have a desire that you can help it fulfill. You see, this Mephisto Phantom wants nothing more than to bend other Phantoms to its will. While you may use some common magical rings(Connect, Chain, and Barrier) with this belt, it has a few specialties. For one thing, you are able to unlock and enter the Underworlds of Gates without needing to wait for them to enter a despairing state. And its greatest ability is the use of the “Pact” ring, which can seal a weakened Phantom or a Ghoul and enslave it to your will. Ghouls will become your servants while Phantoms are converted into rings themselves, which you are able to summon by passing them over the Hand Autor the same as any other magic ring. Phantoms stronger(or healthier, at least) than yourself will resist a Pact and can break out of the magic seal before being completely transformed. While this suit itself cannot fight well, the summons have no limit...so you don’t quite need to be that strong, do you?

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.)

Aha, you have the power of the Missing Piece?

Excellent. You see, Phantoms are not that common in this world...Relying on them for summons when a Rider is around defeating and destroying them...It’s not sustainable. Which is why now, you can force yourself into the Underworld of any person, not just a Gate, to bind their Phantom. They won’t become a Gate, but you’ll find SOMETHING to try and defeat in there, at Least.

Wait, if you’ve obtained the Missing Piece...Is it true?

Are you also the Sorcerer's Apprentice?

Then this art won’t be a stranger to you…

You’re not limited to forcing the Pact on Phantoms anymore, no. You can force other supernatural entities into the form of Summonable rings as long as they’re weaker than you(same as Phantoms), keeping them all in a safe and inescapable form as a Magic Ring. What a wonderful technique!

particularly bleak and pitiless view of reality. Some just want to watch the world burn, like you.
Your mannerisms, your very spoken word and way of comporting yourself has a corrupting
effect on everyone near you. Those who work under you are the most affected, becoming more
vicious and compliant to your will-the kind of scum that Gotham is infamous for. Telepaths and
empaths should be wary, for such is your vileness that there’s a non-zero chance you could turn
the tables and leave them screaming from the horrors of your broken mind. But even in civilized
society you bring out the darker angels of those caught in your wake and inspire fear-if not panic
when your dastardly deeds disrupt their safe little worlds. In a rare few, you might even awaken
a fanatic, depraved loyalty and burgeoning talent for supervillainy to further your dark work-
especially if you apply your personal talent for psychological warfare and gaslighting against
them. You have an uncanny intuition of how to conduct your evil schemes not just for
effectiveness-but to inspire the most heinous reactions possible, to break down the façade of
morality and restraint men need to avoid putting on clown paint and setting something on fire.
Or something else, if that’s not to your liking-as a side effect to all this, you easily spread and
enforce a certain fashion among your minions that distinctly marks them as yours."
1681,,600,The Secrets of Society,DC Comics,Control,"Running a criminal organization takes far more work than those self-righteous fools interrupting
you appreciate. You’re one such ideal taskmaster, able to sort out the logistics and effectively
manage the kind of secret lairs, hidden fortresses and space stations that supervillains with true
ambition tend to gravitate towards. Running a conspiracy is old hat to a mind as devious as
yours, from issuing missions to providing dead drops for your agents to hand in their reports.
Ensuring complex superweapons or experimental rituals get completed on a timely basis is also
well within your grasp. Furthermore yours is a menacing, elegant charisma from an older age,
and your sharp demeanor can disarm psychopaths and hardened killers into dutiful obedience
to your command-or bring out the killer in a once-righteous crusader to better suit them to your
goals, and ably mentor even experienced terrorists in the skills of your organization. Your
reputation as a formidable, uncompromising figure in the underworld strikes fear into the hearts
of many enemies or rivals, and swiftly builds up a great fanaticism in all guided by your hand.
Best of all, you know how to integrate both pawns and agents into proper civilization like hidden
blades. Once you’ve become a de-facto ruler of a government you’ve infiltrated at every level
your skills lend themselves just as well to improving the nation you control with good old-
fashioned logistics. It’s one thing to challenge heroes with an army of deadly assassins willing to
die for you. It’s another to cow them with the revelation of just how bad things would be without
you in power."
1682,,600,Carefully Chosen Words ,DC Occult,Control,"You know real magic isn't in fireballs or flashy explosions. No, real magic is in words. Words can drive a man mad, words can create or shatter nations, can make your bitterest enemy your dearest friend, and can drive a man to kill his brother. And your silver tongue knows more words than most. Whether it's convincing a serial killer that the real thrill would be to feel his own death or a group of mobsters to tear themselves apart, all you need is a few words.
"
1683,,600,Necromancy ,Libriomancer,Control,"No, this isn’t your classic “bones rising from the grave” Necromancy, this is “control the spirits of the dead” necromancy. You are a fledgling medium, able to see and talk to the dead as you please. They frequently speak in long dead languages and are generally confused but using your very particular brand of magic you can bend them to your will. Forcing them to divulge secrets or knowledge long passed from mortal memory is one of the more common practices of necromancy. You will of course have to find their spirit first. Smart money is either their place of death or burial. As you grow you will find that you can command these ghosts to do more for you, such as spying on your enemies and reporting back or alerting you to intruders. Eventually you may even be able to force them into the bodies of the recently deceased, granting them a physical form able to impact the world. What? You want to make devourers? Well, I guess you can but why would you want to? Stripping away the ghosts identity until it becomes a blank burning slate of raw hatred and magical chaos? Immune to magical ingres and capable of suppressing or destroying magic in its entirety through simple contact. A creature bent on devouring magic and turning all other magic users (save you of course) into inhuman souls like them. I hope you can live with yourself if you do that.
"
1684,,600,Familiar​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Control,"A minor spirit bound to your will, this being is both adorable and useful. Though you cannot command it mentally, it is perfectly obedient, and will reappear by your side if slain. By pouring power into it, it can switch from its portable form as a small animal made of an element into a large elemental. Finally, as you have a pact with it, it will provide a small but steady amount of power for your Fey magic, without any limitations on when it will permit that power to be used.
"
1685,,600,Decretum ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Control,"You were such an idiot. You’re not quite the Hero you want to be - you had some kind of ugliness or selfishness you didn’t recognize until it was too late. But that’s okay. That doesn’t mean you’ve given up on yourself, does it? You’ve accepted and recognized your faults, and this makes you completely untouchable by mind control or manipulation that tries to exploit your flaws and regrets. Seeing the worst day of your life play out in an illusion would hurt, but it would have a lot less power over you than your enemies would have hoped.

More than that, you have a tight enough hold on your inner demons that you can actually call yours forth...by spending a fair amount of magical energy, you may summon a representation of your despair and personal mistakes forward, creating a ‘Barrier’ around you and your foes. This beastly extension of yourself can isolate the battlefield in an eldritch location within this Barrier, and fight your foes alongside you. Eventually, it will disperse, though not before likely confusing and even laying low your enemies. As a side benefit, summoning this monster will immediately ‘refresh’ your mind of any scars or trauma, breaking the chains of any negative emotions that tried to hold you down. This shouldn’t be possible. You must be some kind of Witch, huh?
"
1686,,600,Casket of Souls ,Warhammer Fantasy,Control,"An ornate casket, summoned and dismissed at your will to appear before you at any time. Normally stored in some distant tomb, it is always accompanied by two elite undead guards. The Casket of Souls, one of many of its kind, was used to store away the souls of all of a Tomb Kings’ enemies, though only the greatest and richest of Kings could afford such an artefact. Among the most powerful magical items in Nehekhara, you are one of the Casket Keepers and thus have the right to summon it and its guards to your aid. Whenever it is summoned you find your magical energies empower significantly, though only once you incant a short ritual to open the Casket’s lid does its’ true nature become clear. Once opened, countless thousands of tormented, angry spirits will race out to devour the life force of any of the Casket Keeper’s enemies, leaving no physical wounds and yet destroying the souls of all but the truly powerful warriors and monsters. Even witnessing the light emitted from within the casket is enough to burn away at a man’s face, even if he is spared from the furious spirits within. Another incantation is all that is required for the spirits to be recalled to the Casket and sealed again. You also know the rituals to seal more souls into the casket, though be aware that its wards cannot hold everything, whether that is measured in power or quantity.
"
1687,,600,Kodou ~Perfect Harmony ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"When the seven Mermaid Princesses sing in harmony, with one heartbeat, they have the power to summon Aqua Regina, the queen and guardian all the oceans. She is incredibly powerful, able to bless her children with new magical abilities, seal away ancient kingdoms such as Panthalassa, and even reincarnate the recently dead as babies. However, she can only be summoned for a short time and generally can only be asked to perform one major task before her spirit fades away again, until the seven sing once more. Now, by combining your powers with six partners and singing in unison with full faith and passion, you can summon Aqua Regina. Even without summoning her, your unified powers become incredibly powerful, enough to overcome otherwise unstoppable foes.
"
1688,,600,Embraced in Wings ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Control,"You can extend your wings suddenly as energy bursts to absorb targets into yourself. If you are successful, each captured soul strengthens your power, and becomes an extra wing on your body. However, captured souls with strong determination may still be able to assert themselves inside your body and interact with your soul. Whenever you take enough damage, it is possible for small fragments of particularly stubborn souls to escape; if these pieces are reassembled together, in time it may be possible for the whole soul to break free and return to normal. You can also drain energy from targets on a lesser level, sapping their health or their memories, but you gain less energy this way.
"
1689,,600,Summon Champion ,Dog Days,Control,"Once per day you may summon a champion to help you do battle. The summoned champion will be your equal in one field. A mage will match you spell for spell, a warrior could match you in an arm wrestle or a scholar could think up plans and strategies just as fast as you. The more general the class and skills of the champion summoned, the weaker they will be in those skills. They can be as good as you are in one thing, or a third as good in three. When the battle has concluded the champion will disappear, fading into the wind in a swirl of blue particles.
"
1690,,600,Sealing Knife ,Dog Days,Control,"This knife amplifies and strengthens any magic used to seal a creature. It will act as the container for anything it seals, making sure anything that it seals cannot escape unless the blade is broken from the outside. It can be used to seal anything you have defeated and will act to purify them while sealed. You may choose to instead imbue this effect onto a weapon of your choice.
"
1691,,600,Hyakki Yagyou「百鬼夜行」,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"Some people might think that there can’t be shadows without light, but you’ve seen first hand that one shadow can call forth another. With but a short ritual, you can call forth other Mononoke, their presence will henceforth be permanent in the area until they physically expire. Though typically they seem inclined to parade about, when the ritual stabilizes the Youkai called forth will typically settle in an area and guard it.

The strength of these spirits is largely dependent on how much magic you would dedicate to them and thankfully, they’re friendly with all of your allies as well. Just be wary that regardless of how strong they are, all conjured Mononoke are weaker in the daytime than they are at night. The ritual works best when conjuring other Youkai of the same type as you.
"
1692,,600,Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai「百物語怪談会」,Golden Sky Stories,Control,"There are times and places where the reality and folklore intertwine, and with a little pull, things that used to be tall tales can come to life. Working off of rumours and myths, this ritual can bring them forward – though you’ll have to understand that they may not be as accurate to their mythical background as you might think.

Though this ritual can be performed without a catalyst, to give your conjured spirits a permanent hold on their surroundings, you’ll want to use a catalyst of a hundred candles. So long as at least one of the hundred candles remains lit, your field conjuring these mythical creatures will maintain itself. Should the creatures venture away from the field, be wary that they won’t last very long.
"
1693,,600,Fantasy Seal ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have great aptitude when it comes to creating barriers, sealing, and undoing those seals yourself. What this means is that anything, no matter how strong, can be sealed away by you. Even when you encounter the supposedly “invulnerable” and “unsealable” you will always be able to find a hidden gap, a secret weakness, that makes them vulnerable to your sealing.

Breaking seals can be a fiddly, fine process to do if you want to preserve whatever object was used as the sealing instrument, though if you don’t care about that you can always simply brute force it to instantly annihilate the seal. To be able to break any seal, no matter how powerful, is your “cheat skill”.
"
1694,,600,Trinitarian Rhapsody ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have the ability to be in three places at once. You may divide yourself up between three bodies, each at full strength and each existing in a different dimension simultaneously while your “core” personality continues to act in your original body. With this, you could act simultaneously in Hell, Gensokyo and on the Moon or within the Dream World, as an example. Each body may have minor aesthetic differences to tell them apart, if you wish. You may, at any point, switch places between any of your three bodies; should you get injured, for example, you may instantly switch places with an uninjured body to continue fighting at peak efficiency.
"
1695,,600,Dragon Stone ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Control,"You have a dragon’s stone of some kind, similar to an egg but made of stone. Should you allow it to hatch in a terribly destructive storm, the new dragon will be a loyal follower of yours. Alternatively, you could shave away the rocky exterior and see the beautiful light trapped within or use its natural constant wetness as a source of water. Note that dragons here are phenomenally powerful, a fully grown one mentioned as being capable of devouring the stars in the skies and making the heavens and earth tremble.
"
1696,,600,Crystal of King Kyros ,Peter Pan,Control,"A magical frozen crystal stolen from the Ice Realm of King Kyros. This crystal contains a fraction of Kyros’ power, and can draw on the powers of ice. With enough magic applied to it, it is possible to freeze a whole island. Also, you can bring target’s reflection off the ice to life, with the ice clone having the basic powers of the original as well as control over ice; however, it only has a limited consciousness, and must be directed by you.
"
1697,,600,Rainbow Wand ,Peter Pan,Control,"A copy of the magic wand used by the famous Pirate Princess. It has the handle of a cutlass, but extends into a pole with a diamond at the end. It can make rainbows – not just “real” ones, but ones as solid as roads. With enough work you may be able to discover more powers within the treasure. For starters, since rainbows always lead to a pot of gold, wherever you point the rainbow a pot of gold appears, albeit hidden somewhere in the vicinity. Plus, if you show enough magical prowess, the wand can change the inner “color” of a person, such that an evil witch with a black heart would be turned into a lighted-hearted and kindly mage; however, the target can resist the change. Outside of this purchase, you are unlikely to encounter the Pirate Princess, much less claim her prized treasure, unless you change the setting from the traditional story."
1698,,600,Full Projection ,Ib,Control,"You are not stuck in the artificial construct of your artwork anymore. Now you can project a full, human body for yourself outside of your actual art piece. This projection has all of the powers that you would normally have in your true body. Your projection has the solid, physical appearance of an average human, and spiritual and physiological examinations of you will also not find anything amiss. Even so, you cast no reflection in the mirror, so you may want to do something to cover that up. While you can travel as far away from your artwork as you wish, you are still bound to it, and damage to it hurts you in turn. On the plus side, as your projected body is not truly alive, you do not suffer from any potential afflictions such as hunger, thirst, or disease, and any damage to your projected body does not actually hurt you (though it might still be painful). For humans, you automatically enter an indefinite sleep/coma as long as you are projecting yourself, but you can also project yourself if you are in a petrified, inanimate, paralyzed, or otherwise immovable state (including your soul being trapped in some sort of item). When either your real body or your projection travels to a separate reality/location from your other self, the projection will end, but you can choose whether your projection will snap back and be reabsorbed into your real body or if your real body will instead teleport to your projection’s location and merge back together there.
"
1699,,600,Dispelled Proclamation ,Wonderland No More,Control,"All ways belong to the queen, so if she says a way is forbidden, that’s all there is to it. You may now make a royal proclamation that forbids a specific spell or ability from activating until your next unbirthday (or birthday, whichever is closer). You must specify the spell/ability from the start, meaning you’ll have to know of or seen the spell/ability in action. That said, you may immediately make a dispelling proclamation once you witness a spell or other power in action, even if the effect of the spell or power was supposed to be instantaneous, but only if you choose to do so that instant. In addition, you may only dispel a single spell, ability, or power at a time; if you make another proclamation before the first ban runs out, it will undo the previous prohibition. Also, please note that your proclamation forbids the spell or ability entirely, meaning that nobody can use it – even yourself or allies.
"
1700,,600,Ancient Frost Dragon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Control,"You might just be the first Ogre to ever tame a dragon. It’s not a baby dragon either, but an elder Frost Dragon of the Mountains. It took an epic struggle lasting multiple days and nights but you made the beast kneel to you. Big as a Stonehorn, with fangs and claws that slice through those beasts like a hot knife through butter and able to breathe out an icy gale that can render an entire tribe of Ogres into a single ice block. With this beast alone you could potentially lay claim to the Overtyrant’s throne. Certainly, it would take a whole tribe to defeat the two of you together.
"
1701,,600,"Murda’Deff, The Killingist ",Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Control,"Wyverns are cannibalistic predators that are known to be a distant off-shoot of the Dragon race. These creatures have been known to be opportunistic hunters, able to eat just about anything from rotting carcasses to bloated bodies amongst other filthy habits, making the Wyvern one of the most foul-smelling creatures to ever plague the World's Edge Mountains. These beasts are the most highly prized mounts within a Greenskin army, where only the most powerful Orc Warbosses or Great Shamans have the ability and unnatural bond to bind these cruel beast to his will, and this one is yours, it even seems to have a bit more dragon than most Wyvern in it.

In battle, Wyverns are voracious beast that always hunger for fresh meat, and would sometimes land right in the middle of an enemy unit and feast upon their flesh in droves while its rider hacks at the enemy that are still left. This is a terrifying event to behold and even stalwart souls find fear and flight in the face of such open brutality. In addition to that this Wyvern is able to breathe fire like the Sun Dragons, burninating the countryside as well as the people's.
"
1702,,600,Favor of Lords ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Control,"The Grey Seers keep, tightly locked under key and claw, the secret to creating the gnaw-holes into The Horned One’s realm. To call forth the greatest of the ratfolk in existence, the Greater Daemons of The Horned Rat - The Verminlords, as great and powerful as any of the northmen’s Princes. The Seers keep this tool not only to cow a clan or five with the threat of summoning one such Lord to the material realm - but also because the Verminlords are bloodthirsty and murderous creatures with their own millenia-long schemes and plans. The risk is always there that the first to die to a Verminlord is the Seer that summoned them.

Funny that the same doesn’t go for you. You, Seer, start out on “amicable” terms with the Verminlords in the Horned One’s Realm (as amicable as can be said for skavendom). You can contact the Lords for assistance or advice without need of lengthy and convoluted rituals, and can indeed summon them onto the field of battle without risk of being the first victim or meal. As well, you’ll find that this friendly relationship can be cultivated with other daemonic, aetherial, and similar otherworldly creatures with remarkable ease - such as the Greater Daemons, Daemon Princes, and servitors of the greater four Gods of Chaos. Though you may come to factor into their own plans and schemes as a pawn or goal, you’ll never need fear horrific death or torture at the hands of your newfound “allies.”
"
1703,,600,Lorule’s Magic ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Control,"“Though Yuga is slipping his bonds, I will try to keep you safe from him as long as I can.”

You have mastered the dark magic practised by Lorule’s Princess Hilda, which focuses on barriers and restrictions. You may form magical walls to block entrance ways from all but the most powerful wizards, and can fully trap individuals with magical bonds that even the most powerful heroes and villains would find a challenge to break free from. With time and training, you may come to find new aspects and uses of this form of magic.
"
1704,,600,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Control,"Well now, where did you acquire this particular artifact? I’ve not seen it for ages, ever since Vaati… Sorry, old news. Moving on, this sword has a rather interesting ability. Or it would, if it hadn’t been enshrined in the Dark World - specifically, in the Pyramid of Power, practically right underneath Ganon’s feet. It used to split the user into four. Now it creates four shadow copies of whomever you strike with the blade. Simply draw blood and watch as they are ganged up on by themselves. The only person this doesn’t work on is yourself - attempting that will create four ‘Dark Links’ instead. Beyond that, the sword can only be used once per day on a specific person, and only one person at a time.
"
1705,,600,To Seal The Darkness ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Control,"What great fortune this is, that the forces of light may count another among their ranks with this power! Like Zelda and the Maidens, you possess the magic of sealing, one capable of banishing evil from the world. This magic takes the form of a ball of light, surrounded by circles of energy and bursts of color. This magic will paralyze the target, and seal them away, though depending on the target you may need an item to seal them away inside. On that note, the stronger the target, the more power you will need to seal them away. Compare a defeated Vaati, who was sealed away by Zelda alone many years ago, to Ganon, who required the combined power of Zelda and the Maidens to imprison, after being left winded by the Four Sword Heroes and struck with an Arrow of Light. This magic can also be used to reinforce existing seals, which is handy given all the ancient evils here.
"
1706,,600,Friend of Fairies ,Hyrule Warriors,Control,"Fairies, magical nature spirits that favor the light, though fickle and unorganized beings with no shared culture or civilization. The threat of their magic potentially supporting Zelda’s armies was enough to have Cia begin hunting them at the dawn of the war.

In this world, fairies can be roughly divided into two groups of beings. Normal fairies like Link’s speaker Proxi resemble small girls that could fit in the palm of your hand, each with insect wings and a magnificent glow that makes them appear as balls of light to those not close enough. 

The other kind are Great Fairies, resembling giant red headed women with bizarre, revealing clothing and aquiline noses. Normal fairies live in the woods, while Great Fairies reside within fairy fountains and appear when prayed too. 

Now, they and any other nature spirit you may find just loves you. Outside of just not being tricked by the more mischievous ones, you’ll often find them coming to see you and generally being friendly unless you go out of your way to upset them. This is great, since both types have powerful magic, with Great Fairies turning the tides of numerous battles in the war.
"
1707,,600,Genie’s bottle ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Control,"A clay jug with a sort of eye pattern on it. The genie inside recognizes you as his master. Though he’s unable to grant wishes or perform other sorts of magic, he can still throw fireballs. Besides that, he can’t be killed as long as the bottle is intact, but he can’t move very far from it either. You may choose to evict him from the bottle if you’d rather have it instead, gaining the above abilities and restrictions. You (or the genie) can sort of hop about while inside the bottle to move it. If you try picking it up, it’s pretty heavy. A normal person couldn’t lift it.
"
1708,,600,To Cast Away the Dark ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Control,"One of the biggest responsibilities of the Sage, the ultimate wise man, is to seal away that which is too dangerous for the world and restore the world after the evil is defeated. This tradition is strong with you - the arts of sealing/banishing away beings of great power such as gods, their power or powerful monsters are in your hands. With this, you could leverage magical energy to seal away even a powerful sorcerer like Future Ganon with the power derived from the goddesses. Beyond that, using similar power to break curses, purify the land of corruption and restore it from a broken or rotten state is within your grasp. Of course, if you were doing this only a meadow at a time it’d be tiring, so with this comes the capability to spread such blessings and enchantments across the width of even an entire country such as Hyrule.
"
1709,,600,We Are Legion ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Control,"Personal power is great, but to have the hordes at your side is surely to be admired. You have an eye for picking out minions, and what’s more you can easily make your own either by using your magic to revive the dead(either as undead or fully formed, depending on how much energy you expend) as mindless and evil minions, using a similar amount of energy to seize control of existing creatures, or summoning from the depths of darkness beasts of shadow and evil. They are often simply brutes with the occasional one capable of skill and low cunning, you would personally have to attend to creating a powerful “Boss” that is miles more intelligent and a bit stronger than the average minion you acquire with these dread powers. You could even expand his power to spread across the breadth of a country, plaguing the land(save for places protected by divine or benevolent magic) with beasts and monsters - all of whom serve your will.
"
1710,,600,A Prison For The Damned ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Control,"One of Fi’s trump cards was not her ability to support link, but rather the fact that within herself existed a sort of... space. Not quite a pocket dimension, but close. A jail cell for all the dark and nasty creatures that she slayed while being wielded by Link, and eventually for Demise himself. Holding onto a spirit is as simple as killing them, assuming they have no tricks of their own to survive or resist such a thing after they’ve already died. And once you have them, you have two choices. If their affinity is in opposition to your own, you can very slowly purify, reduce, or even outright destroy them. Doing this is an insanely slow process, and will weaken your own affinity while it’s active. On the other hand, if you have an affinity in common with them, you can spend a decent chunk of energy and affinity to bring them back as your loyal slave."
1711,,600,Four Sword ,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Control,"This is a double-edged blade with a spear point at its tip and fuller hilt, a wide eye symbol upon the golden crossguard stares out.

When the Sword is drawn from its holder, it will cause its wielder to split apart into four separate versions of themselves, each nearly identical to the original. The sole physical differences between the different clones is the tones of their voices, some are deeper than others, and the color of their clothing (in Link's case, his different clones along with himself are colored the four aforementioned colors).

The great weakness of the Four Sword is the fact that you and your clone selves all carry the same life force into battle. Wounds on any one of the four are shared across all the four of you should one of them be fatally wounded you all will die. In addition you all share the same resources when it comes to things like your Mana/Ki/Psoinic Points/Etc.

You can have it so that like the non-canonical manga has depicted the Four Sword as causing the different colored clones to represent different sides of one's psyche as well. The four can work together as a team or they can work independently should the need arise as well. When drawn you may choose whether you split up or not.
"
1712,,600,Master of the Material,TES: Magic,Control,"To master Alteration is to understand that reality is just a
falsehood, a perception of greater forces impressed upon us for their amusement. As a
Master of Alteration, few know this fact better than you. Not only are you able to alter
the terrain around you with startling precision, such that you could create deep pits and
earthen spikes in seconds or lifelike murals in minutes, but you are capable of turning
others into mundane animals. Sure, you could turn yourself into a bull or a bird, but
there is some satisfaction to turning your enemies into newts."
1713,,600,Diadem of the Savant ,The Elder Scrolls,Control,"This golden circlet is gifted to anyone who is able to complete Shalidor's Maze, and overcome the trials within. It greatly decreases the amount of magicka your spells would otherwise cost, as well as allowing you to have ten times more summons active at once than you could before. Anything summoned while wearing this will be stronger, faster, and more durable than they otherwise would have been."
1714,,600,Ceremony Of Corruption ,Genshin Impact,Control,"The Abyss have had a long time to plan their war with the Archons. They have developed no end of tricks and traps to further their ends. They even went so far as to devise a ritual that would allow them to corrupt the minds of great spirits and old gods. This is what they had used on Dvalin, and what they had planned to use on Boreas. You have come into possession of a scroll detailing how to carry this ceremony out, as well as any items you might need to do so. While you will need to start the rite first, which is no easy feat against a god, once begun it would be near impossible for them to break free, barring outside interference. Once complete, you will find these once great beings much more... agreeable, to any cause you may have. How long the ceremony takes is entirely dependent on how strong the willpower of the victim."
1715,,700,Custom Miraculous(Tier 3),Miraculous Ladybug,Control,"This is a pretty straightforward customization system. You can choose an animal or other theme to have your Miraculous’ Kwami based on, as well as an appropriate activation phrase for your Miraculous. You can also choose a form for your Miraculous (has to be small enough to be comfortably held by normal humans). The Tool cannot be a sci-fi or magical device outside of the normal effects of being a Miraculous Tool. Any but not all of those can be copied off of another Miraculous (such as having a pig necklace with the tool of a staff but you can’t have a cat ring with the tool of a staff). As for the power it holds, that’s up to you. 

A Miraculous with a hax ability like the Snake, an ability which scales up like the Tiger, or which can be used on most anything like the Bee, costs 500 CP. 

For 200 additional CP, your Miraculous Tool can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures just like the Ladybug Miraculous. This can be one of the Miraculous that have been shown but has not been used in the show.

You can import a magical artifact to become a Miraculous assuming that it is a valid form for a Miraculous."
1716,,700,Oil Lamp,Disney’s Aladdin,Control,"An old, cheap looking lamp, with a permanent smudge at one side. Despite it’s ordinary appearance, though, it is a device of extraordinary power. For it holds a Djinni, an honest to god, massively powerful being of magic and spirit.

You may use this lamp to ask this Djinni for three wishes, and they may be anything, with a few limitations. You may not force anyone to fall in love with you, may not bring back the dead, and may not wish for the Djinni to directly kill someone. Nor may you wish for more wishes, or rewrite history or wish for CP or indeed, anything that can only be gotten from a Jump-doc.

1717,,700,Spell Singer ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"An Intoners song is a powerful brainwashing tool, but what if it could do more? By taking this perk, you can double the power and range of your song. If you weren’t an Intoner and didn’t have the power of Song before, boy howdy you do now. Not only that, but any spells you know or learn can be Sung instead of cast normally, letting you use the full power of an Intoner for your magic. A basic fireball spell will summon a giant flaming meteor and if you sing Avada Kedavra, you’ll kill every person who hears it. With this, you’ll go from one of the weakest Intoners to the strongest. 

As a bonus, you’ll gain a beautiful voice and a natural talent for singing normal, non-magical songs.

dozen big name heroes capable of matching the heavy hitters. Aside from your supers
you have a much larger number of soldiers, maintenance workers, medics, and
everyone else you could need to run this organization. Alternatively you could pick one
of the canon groups to run if you don’t want to make your own. Regardless of your

1719,,800,The Faerie Queen,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Control,"Inside of Worm, Glaistig Uaine was a parahuman surpassed only by the likes of Eidolon. Measured as a Trump 12+, Glaistig Uaine could manifest ghosts of any superpowered individual who died in her vicinity, wielding all the might they could bring to bear while alive, but under her control. Additionally, she possessed a Striker effect: a Death Touch. Upon activation, anyone sharing skin contact would instantly fall dead. Her only weakness was that she remained a baseline human, though your shades could remedy this should they have “buffing” powers. You would have these abilities, but…



This is not Worm. 



Glaistig Uaine has seen a qualitative upgrade in her abilities: her shades are no longer limited to three—in fact, they have no limit at all—and her Death Touch works even on the supposedly “immortal”, like Solomon Grundy. Moreover, she can sense supers from miles away, and nearly immortal, with a potent regenerative factor. Well, excepting conceptual death effects, which most certainly get the job done. You have all these powers now, too, jumper, so the heroes or other good-aligned forces better pray you're on their side."

1725,,800,Aura of the King,Bleach,Control,"A Fullbring, impressive as it is, is nothing but a distraction. They are not the culmination of the power
of the Fullbringer, anymore than a Bankai is the sum of what any Shinigami can reach. It is their most
basic function, to command souls, wherein lies their greatest power. All things in these worlds have
souls or are made of souls. A common Fullbringer could command the air soul to move at high speed
with Bringer Light or move small objects with telekinesis by moving that objects’ soul. But to take it
further, larger, greater. To command a falling castle the size of a city to hold itself aloft in the air, to
heal any wound or sickness by banishing the soul of the wound or commanding an injured spirit to
rejoin, even to counter the greatest of Hado spells with the souls of fire and earth twisted into
dragon-form. Not all Fullbringers could reach this potential. Only those with a powerful fragment of the King, like a large portion of his Soul Chain as you and one other have, can take it so far. But now the power and
potential is yours. By expending your own spiritual energy, you can command the spirits around you
to act to your will. Almost anything becomes possible through this. Effects that might require a Kido
master among Shinigami take a wave of the hand, a thought and power from you. Souls with a mind
of their own, like other living beings, can attempt to resist with their own energy. It’s often much
easier to crush them from without, turning the skies and seas and lands against them with terrible
force. The Spirit King organ inside of you has greatly increased the raw Reiryoku you have access to. You
have roughly twice as much as the average Captain, similar to Aizen Sosuke at the time of his
betrayal to Soul Society. Your training in the acts above is significant, enough to match the original
wielder of this power in two or three years of training. Aura Michibane’s feats above are impressive
but you still have the ability to destroy, change and repair much of the world around you. It is the
finer actions, like making yourself insubstantial or turning ordinary Plus souls into powerful hollow
warriors, that will take practice.

This dark power has one purpose: To Devour. It will eat up anything the user defeats or kills, taking their powers and abilities and passing them on to its user. There are few, if any, limits on the powers that Greed can assimilate through eating others. Divine Powers, Charyeok, even superhuman physical strength or speed may be taken if the user can kill their targets. The only limit is that the powers absorbed cannot be too far beyond the user’s own level or else they and the Charyeok embedded into them will be unable to withstand the power and spit it back out. It is able to extend from the users body to attack at range with great gaping maws and shadows or even lie in wait as traps. Even if Greed only partially devours something it can still gain some measure of power from it and if this stolen power originated from the target’s own body, such as Gods with their Divine Powers, then that target will be unable to regain their full powers until the user of Greed is dead."

Those who are destined for greatness swarm to you, practically begging for you to dominate and use them for whatever you fancy.

Finally, you are extraordinarily lucky when it comes to actually having your plans work out.

1728,,800,Gate Legion,Solo Leveling,Control,"When the Monarchs and Rulers go into war, they never do it alone. Among them, legions of tens of thousands of magical beasts come to do battle and kill each other in order to fulfill the vicious cycle of violence set up by the [Absolute] long ago.

It seems that you too, have been deemed worthy of possessing such a force that is comparable to the ones commanded by such mighty beings.

The exact reasons for your coming into the command of this force depends on your origin. For the Primal Fragments, this army was your own spawn or creations, naturally following you as your subjects. For Monsters, it seems that your Monarch has deemed to designate you as the Captain for their forces, and they have become mysteriously absent, leaving you with absolute command over the troops. For Hunters, the Rulers may have deemed that they need to intervene way earlier than expected and designated you as a commander of their scout forces. Whatever the case, these troops are unbreakably loyal to you and will follow your every order. If killed, they will be replaced with individuals of similar strength in the next jump.

For Monsters and Monarchs, this army will be composed of magical beasts related to their theme. The Shadow Monarch would gain an army of undead and the Shadow Legion. The Demon Monarch would gain an army of demons of all kinds and entire clans of Demon Knights. Whatever your theme is, the army will be roughly composed of 10 million monsters of varying degrees of strength. For a regular Hunter or Ruler, this option will instead supply you with a force 10 million angeloids in silver armor of varying degrees of skill and strength, being roughly equivalent in power to the other option.

An army of this size would surely be able to devastate the Earth on their own, but even with these numbers, without the support of a Monarch or Ruler it would be hard for them to stand a chance against another Monarch or Ruler.

Usually, the army is stored in a small pocket world that exists in the space between dimensions, which can be accessed at any time by opening a Gate to it. You gain the innate ability to call for these portals, but other beings with dimensional powers may be able to find your pocket world and open their own pathways to it. Additionally, this world will allow you to store other troops that have been created by your own powers, allowing them to follow you between future worlds, just like the Monarchs and Rulers did with their troops.

This item cannot be purchased by companions. It comes with a free purchase of the Commander companion option, which will act as this army’s marshal, if you are a Monarch or Ruler, or its deputy marshal, if you are a Monster or Hunter."

1730,,800,Stellar Princess: Failed Protagonist,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"Within you there is a very special light, one gifted by God herself. When that light peers through your most common actions, such as a simple smile, it becomes capable of charming almost all sentient beings with little effort. You become an idol, an object of worship, respect and protection for almost anyone who witnesses you. Only those with the strongest wills may be able to resist the natural charm of your existence.

This is not a coincidence or an exceptional occurrence. Originally, you were meant to be the Hero of this generation. The greatest good that would face off against the Kings of Evil, and bring change to the current cycle. At least, that was the plan. Instead, your rights were lost due to an unaccounted for anomaly. However, God, who originally bestowed you with such a role, saw fit to compensate you.

Instead of taking the role of the Hero, your new status made you become the most prominent person under the Heavens. That is, you had the ability to charm and command anyone but those who stand equal or above the Heavens, those with the wills to defy God or the Gods themselves.

This is especially potent when it comes to commanding nature itself. As extensions of the Avesta, Star Spirits, some of the mightiest existences of this universe, are completely under control. You are able to communicate with them even from across galactic or intergalactic distances, drawing them to you under your command. This is a control that transcends the Avesta, and only those with a latent universal divinity of their own may resist you.

Once you have put enough of these spirits under your control, your may condense all of existences into a singular point, allowing you to craft a weapon that contains the accumulated powers and abilities of all who were put under your command. This weapon is naturally just as subservient to your will as the spirits were, and can be freely summoned or diminished at will. In future jumps, your existence will be recognized as equally predominant, and those spirits and manifestations of the natural forces that are below the cosmic scale will be forced under you in the same way."

Any but not all of those can be copied off of another Miraculous (such as having a pig necklace with the tool of a staff but you can’t have a cat ring with the tool of a staff). As for the power it holds, that’s up to you.

For 200 additional CP, your Miraculous Tool can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures just like the Ladybug Miraculous. This can be one of the Miraculous that have been shown but has not been used in the show.

1732,,800,Letz Battallion        ,Hellsing,Control,"Perhaps the Colonel is a good title, given you rank beyond the Major now. As either a new leader for the modern era or the original founder of the group from years ago, you now take the helm of Millennium. This undead battalion is a terrifying force on the battlefield, with a thousand field members each empowered as Artificial Vampires. There are hundreds more staff involved in the organisation to support these soldiers, particularly to man the massive zeppelin fleet that carries much of this army around the world. While not a match for the Deus Ex Machina, each Hindenburg- sized airship can still ferry hundreds of troops across a continent at surprising speed. Within each ship is also a large complement of military weapons and vehicles, styled after Nazi Germany’s armory but with modernized capabilities. 

The most useful part of this organisation is not the large force of super soldiers but the uniquely powerful unit known as the Werewolves. While only one, The Captain, is an actual werewolf, the others are all uniquely powerful individuals. A number of artificial vampires with special powers, a catboy who can act as an unstoppable assassin and the Doktor himself, creator of the Artificial Vampirization process. Perhaps more valuable than the rest of the undead forces, this special unit could topple a nation on their own. And, as they did to the Major, they have all given you their loyalty unto death. The looks you get may be a bit strange if you move away from the warmongering rhetoric though. It’s best to remember that everyone here is either a devoted Nazi or has no issue with supporting such people.

Optionally, they don’t have to be Nazis. They can be a separate paramilitary organisation with similar resources but a different ideology and different specifics on their makeup. Perhaps a fleet of battleships and a thousand lesser werekin instead of Zeppelins and vampires. "
1733,,800,Iscariot Division,Hellsing,Control,"The Pope has recognised the growing insanity of Enrico Maxwell and decided that despite his charisma, the faith would pay too high a price were he to remain in power. Thus, a new leader of Iscariot has been appointed from it’s ranks, which just happens to be yourself. The secret faction within the Vatican is charged with investigating and destroying any threat to the church and it’s followers. This can range from heathen threats from other religions to supernatural monsters that terrorise innocents. 

To combat this, you have quite the force. Several dozen special agents trained in combat and the occult, each similar in power to an artificial vampire with some training. Examples of this can be found in Yumiko and Heinkel Wolff. Hundreds of trained soldiers beyond this, up to three thousand if an emergency crusade is called, able to be equipped with blessed military weaponry if need be. While individually no match for vampires, their ingenuity and equipment can let them remain a threat to the armies of darkness. And as part of the Vatican, you also have free access to their very extensive information network that stretches around the globe, the better to find your prey. 

Additionally, the Paladin Anderson is also under your command and may have even been the one to raise you up into this position from a child. He seems quite fond of you, enough to restrain his bloodlust with your orders, and act to your commands provided it not violate his moral code too deeply. The position of Archbishop does help, giving you quite a lot of public clout in the Church without needing to call on your agents. Finally, as the last resort of the Vatican, you are also able to requisition the use of powerful holy artefacts such as the Nail of Helena. However, these are invariably attached to horrible side effects and requirements for use, with the possibility of terrible backfires if used for corrupt or sinful goals. Best be careful with the works of the Lord. 

Alternatively, you may be the head of a new division of similar nature and scale within the Catholic Church or even be a similar arm of another religious organisation."

As either the elder sibling, or possibly even a previous generation member, to Integra or the last member of an entirely new line, you now head a faction who serves as your nation’s monster hunters. The ones who take care of things the public ought not to know of. You have the favour of your nations’ leaders, both the public ones and the real powers, and a fair amount of resources to start with. 

A expansive headquarters is a must, as is the few dozen trained soldiers to both guard and assist with missions given by your country. You’ve got a decent supply of military technology to support them and your family has gathered a large library of occult knowledge in their battle against the dark forces. As part of your position, you’ve even got a notable say in how your home country is really run, perhaps as part of the Convention of Twelve in Britain or an equivalent elsewhere. 

But these are ultimately minor gifts compared to the prize. Two servants of enormous power are part of the parcel here. Were you to replace Integra as the leader of the Hellsing family, this would be Walter C. Dornez and Alucard himself. If you are taking a new name, you’d instead be able to design equivalent servants, perhaps of kinds more fitting to your country of origin. Your left and right hands, as they are, have immense fondness and loyalty towards you. It’d be quite unlikely for either to ever willingly act against you, though their own personal problems may cause some issues if you don’t take action to help. In future jumps, you can bring along this family organisation as it is and has changed under your rule, though the connections to government will adjust to fit each new jump.

Optionally, you can choose to not be linked to any government and instead operate independently. You’ll lose the political favour and influence but have significantly greater freedom and financial resources at your call. There’s more profit to be made going it alone but you only have yourself to rely on."

1740,,900,A Pact ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"In the world of Drakengard, a magical Pact can be made between a human and a magical beast. The benefits are numerous: both parties are magically strengthened, any wounds they have at the time of the pact are healed including ones that would otherwise be lethal, the Pact Partners can hear each other's thoughts and feelings, the creature gets to feed off of the humans negative emotion and the human gets a magical bodyguard by way of  ‘If I die, you die too.’

Oh yeah, the negatives. Well, first of all, if either of the Pact Partners dies, the other dies too. They’re bound together for life. Also, Pacts have a price the human partner has to pay. They lose a physical part of themselves, one of personal importance. If you long to see your homeland again, there go your eyes. If your greatest joy is holding your child in your arms, guess what you lose? No, not the child. Your arms, smart guy. 

Why doesn’t the magical creature have to pay a similar price? Well, because life's unfair, Pumpkin. Go cry in the corner about it.

I can already tell what you’re thinking: That sounds kinda shit. Why am I spending 900 points on this when I can just find a creature during my ten years in this jump and form a Pact later. And I’m getting to that. 

First of all, do you know how hard it is to find a magical creature that’ll form a Pact with a human. They do have their Pride after all, and humans in Drakengard have a pretty shit reputation, what with all the genocide against sub-humans going on. And even if you do manage to form a Pact there’s no guarantee that your Partner will like you, be easy to work with, or in extreme cases, commit suicide just to get rid of you because they hate you that much. 

Which brings us to the first benefit of buying a Pact now. Your Pact Partner, whatever you chose, will be a good fit for you personality wise. You may butt heads, you may argue from time to time but you’ll always make up quick enough. Most of the time though, you’ll just enjoy each other’s company and work together well while you watch each other’s backs. Or you can make a Pact with an Imported Companion. I’m assuming you already have a good working relationship with them, right? 

The second extra benefit is that the healing energy from when the Pact was formed has stuck around and is providing a benefit. Now, instead of ‘if one of you dies, you both die’, it’s ‘neither of you die until both of you die’. It doesn’t matter how badly one of you is injured, until the other one is dealt a mortal wound as well, you’ll survive. Minor downside, you’ll be forced to endure all the torturous pain your Partner is in and vice versa until the injured party can heal, but that’s a small price to pay for not dying when killed, right?

Thirdly, your power sharing goes beyond the usual bland, nondescript power boost. Now you can actually use each other’s strengths and abilities. If your Partner is a dragon, congratulations! You’re as strong and tough as they are, you can breath fire and even fly under your own magic power. They’ll also gain access to all your abilities. Yes, including your Jumper Perks. Yes, really. 

And finally, you can bring your Pact Partner along when this Jump ends and you go to a different one. They’ll take up a Companion slot, but that’s fine right? Not only that, but each time you arrive in a new jump, you can add a new person or creature to your Pact, so long as they’re sapient. Let me make you read that right. I didn’t say ‘form a new Pact.’ I said ‘add a new Pact Partner’. So all three of you can share powers and all three of you need to die for you to stay dead. And the next Jump, it’s all four of you. And the one after that, all five. 

Now, you don’t have to keep adding Pact Partners in each Jump. You can, but it’s not required. Each new Pact Partner does take up another Companion slot, and if you ever enter a Jump without all your Pact Partners present, you and the Pact Partners that do join you lose the benefits of the Pact. But still, good deal, am I right?"
1741,,900,Whole Again ,Drakengard and Nier,Control,"Replicants and Gestalts. Body and Soul. Two halves of the same whole. The issue comes when Replicants develop their own minds and refuse to let the Gestalt back in. Think about it. You wouldn’t want to die just so some asshole you’ve never met claiming to be the “real” you  can use your body, right?

Well, you and… erm, you have managed to find a solution, somehow. By finding common ground, your Gestalt self and Replicant self have joined together once again. The results are impressive. Your body has been enhanced and you’re now able to use magic if you weren’t before. Similar to Kainé’s powers after getting possessed by a Shade, except you don’t have to worry about losing control and hurting people. After all, you are you. You’re one mind and soul, not two different minds fighting for control of one body. 

If you happen to miss being two separate entities for some reason though, you’re in luck. For a limited time, you can separate your Gestalt from your Replicant, letting the one fight as two. During this time, your Replicant loses the ability to use magic but keeps the enhanced physicality. Meanwhile, your Gestalt is a powerful one, similar to a Boss Shade, though not on the level of the Shadowlord. So of course it can wreck shop. Your Gestalt and Replicant may have different personalities while separated, however you’re still you, so you don’t have to worry about either half going rogue. When the timer is up, you’ll be forcefully re-merged unless something prevents the process. If that happens, you’ll both grow weak and vulnerable, until you eventually die. 

If you aren’t a Replicant and you take this perk, it still works. By strengthening your inner soul, you gain the power boost and magical abilities. When you separate, you summon your true self to fight alongside you. What? No, it’s not a Stand! Or a Persona! Shut up!

present bonds and connections you can see the life that they live and all the strands of
fate that they are connected to the brighter the thread the stronger the bond of fate are.
A hero destined to claim a legendary sword, Two lovers destined to be together, a villain
destined to die at the hands of a child, you can see the plot of fate and the paths it is
destined to take in your eyes fate is linear a set course of events, but your true power
lies in your knowledge of these events allowing you to act in a way that could rewrite the
course you had seen but you must be present at the event in order to change it. Once a
year you can change the path of fate without being there changing its course to one that
is more to your liking, but changing the image of the tapestry can cause the ending to
become clouded and out of your sight even with your intervention fate will proceed."
1743,,1000,Karasuki,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Control,"You receive a copy of the Karasuki, a sentient turtle-like artifact
created belonging to the Ōtsutsuki clan. The artifact has the power of transferring
people through time, enabling its user to travel to any point in the past or in the
future, but this requires a lot of chakra to work and those with access to space-time
ninjutsu can use it to intercept this technique and travel together with its user. The
turtle themself is ageless and considers you as their master, being loyal to you and
their main life objective is to serve you. Unfortunately, due to the rules imposed by
your Benefactor, the artifact can just be used to travel through time just twice per
Jump (the first one to the past or future and the second one to return to the present)
or decade, whichever comes sooner. This limitation is removed post-Spark. The
turtle counts as your follower and will be revived in the next Jump if killed.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."

Because of the holy aura, the nails are extremely effective against creatures of the night, while it also holds the capacity to not only alter perceptions but fully brainwash others under the right circumstances. Tyrant is indeed an apt name."

It can be used to enslave Dragons to the possessor's will as well as making them powerless or strengthening them. It also grants the user instinctive knowledge of Dragons and can be used to put them to sleep. This power over dragons goes to the point that it could control even the Great Red."
1747,,1000,Absolute Demise,HighSchool DxD,Control,"Another independent Longinus, it manifests as a three-meter-tall doll that is made entirely of ice. Its ability is simple but frightening - it can quickly generate cold and ice, enough to freeze over a small country in a short amount of time and can manipulate the element it uses freely. At its maximum range, it can lock an entire county within a crystal of ice as long as the user wishes to, and more."
1748,,1000,Canis Lykaon,HighSchool DxD,Control,"It’s the result of fusing two individual sources. One of them being the King of Arcadia, Lycaon who incurred the wrath of Zeus, causing the King to be turned into a wolf after being cursed; and Ame-no-Ohabari, the divine sword in Shintoism used to kill Hinokagutsuchi. As a result of the distortion caused by the union of both, it now appears as a black hound with a will and agency of its own, though purchasing it here makes it extremely loyal to you. The hound can manifest powerful blades and attacking weapons from darkness, as well as being able to transform itself into a sword. It can also attack through shadows freely, and other such powers."

As such, the more powerful the user's imagination, the more powerful the creature is upon its creation. It’s a heretical power that borders the limits of a god and capable of trampling over the world in the right hands. You can even create ‘anti-monsters’, monsters designed specifically to counter and defeat a type of foe, though you may require more setup time depending on their size and abilities. These monsters are loyal to your will and emerge as complete creatures once they are done being shaped."

And now, recognizing the unique opportunity you present to him, he also wants to accompany you on your journey. Right now, he could easily cover a planet in his light, and with enough time and energy (or perhaps willing sacrifices), he could potentially be a universe destroyer. Fortunately for you, he is somewhat willing to listen to you now, and will not consume all in future jumps if you tell him not to. If you let him do his work, he will spare you and those allied with you.

1752,,1000,Minion Creation and Corruption,Marvel Midnight Suns,Control,Sometimes you can’t fight your battles alone so with this perk you can gain minions. These soldiers can be created from nothing using your own pool of energy or you can bend the minds of living beings to your cause. This pool is separate from any of your power sources if you wish and recharges ambiently.
1753,,1000,Protector ,MtG - Innistrad,Control,"From the same family that produced its downfall, came man's salvation. The angel Avacyn. If I hadn’t read the Lunarch's journals myself, I would not believe that our savior was a creation of theirs. Like Sorin Markov, you have learned how to create an angel that will protect whatever you designate them to at the time of their creation. They are in possession of all perks in the Church tree and I am what I am and always will be, along with a boost in power to place them on par with Avacyn. However you may only create one each jump, they will not leave what they were created to defend behind, and should all their protectees die, they will become inconsolable with grief from which they will never recover. Post-spark you can make as many angels as you want.

If you set the angel to protect you, your family, or your companions, they may follow you across jumps. But you will be unable to make new angels in new jumps while they remain with you, and they don’t respond well to modification in any form.

This angel's appearance is completely up to you, as is their personality to a certain extent. They will always be protectors, but they may be distant or smotheringly compassionate. That kind of thing.

THIS CANNOT BE USED ON INNISTRAD WHILE AVACYN LIVES or alternatively until you complete Broken Faith."
1754,,1000,Avatar ,DC Occult,Control,"You are an Avatar and Guardian of either the Red, the Blue, the Green, the Black, or the Grey and tasked with the protection of a form of life.

The Red is a cosmic force which pervades nearly all organic animal life in the universe. As the guardian and avatar of it, you are able to communicate with, command, and transform into non-sapient animals. You can also draw on the aspects of animals near you, gaining speed from a cheetah, strength from a bull, the sense of smell of a bloodhound, and so on. Eventually, your mastery can extend to creating animal life from nothing, potentially calling forth even things long extinct.

The Blue is much the same as the Red, but concerns water and aquatic life instead. The power over and ability to transform into or create animals is the same, only now applying to things that dwell within the water. And, for that matter, you also possess power over and ability to transform into water itself.

The Green is similar yet distinct from the others. Where they are bound to animals, it is the source of all plant life. As the Avatar of the Green, you are able to control and create plant life, as well as fuse with the ecosystem of a planet, potentially appearing from or being aware of any and every plant in the world, or fusing with a tree in America and stepping out of a bush in Africa. With mastery of your powers, you may be able to create elementals to serve you or grow a forest in minutes.

The Black is the embodiment of death and decay. As the Avatar of the Black, you are an agent of death. Not the cute goth kind, either. Plagues, famine, rot, necromancy, you’re walking proof that all things come to an end. All those manifested at your will, allowing you to potentially devour the life of untold numbers of beings and then raise their remains or command their spirits to do your bidding. With time, killing half a nation and flooding the rest with the living dead is well within your capabilities.

The Grey is very similar to the Green, but instead serves as the source of fungus. Your abilities as the Avatar of the Grey are somewhere between those possessed by an Avatar of the Green and an Avatar of the Black, allowing you to consume life to rapidly spread your infectious fungus at terrifying rates. Nearly anything the Green can accomplish, so too can you, but with fungus instead. You also have the ability to infect other elementals and add them to a hive mind that you command.

1755,,1200,Rage Awakened,Final Fantasy X,Control,"Perhaps you should thank Yevon for establishing such a convenient system of control – herding the masses to willingly subject themselves into the wicked cycle undergone by Spira. Even those who would seek to break out are actively subjugated and eliminated – Omega, if you could converse with him, would certainly attest to that. But those who have died to maintain Yevon’s façade have not necessarily left Spira, and perhaps from them, you could learn a few things.

You know the power that “sentiment” possesses – you’ve probably manipulated it to create fiends even – but that’s not the full extent of what’s possible. Fiends are seen as monsters, beings that are threats to existence. Why not instead manipulate the living – giving the emotions and memories of the dead a living host to inhabit.

You’ll be hard pressed to find somebody willing to act as a live host of course – but if you force enough of the dead into them, if the sentiments are strong enough, the hosts will have to struggle hard in order to resist the dead’s grasp. And if they can’t...the loss of control over their body isn’t the only thing they have to worry about – if somebody else doesn’t banish the spirit corrupting them, sooner or later there will be nothing left of their identity to rescue.

The more concentrated the emotions, the more spirits you insert, the more quickly the living will succumb to corruption. But...do be wary of one thing – just because you can insert the dead...doesn’t mean you can control the dead...and if the memories and will of the dead are strong enough, they may have...other priorities they’ll seek to achieve before addressing yours."
1756,,1200,Pantheon: Army of Gods,Avesta of Black and White,Control,"The ability which is one of the keystones of the plan to fight against Naraka, the mysterious entity that threatens all existence, and which was the source of all kinds of wonders and misfortunes in the age before the Divine Throne System was put in place. 

This ability was originally held by Mithra’s Commander, an entity that should have been merely a passive observer. But first the anomaly known as Varhram, and now yourself, have gotten hold of this power as well.

The ability of Pantheon is the one that allows for the creation of Aeons. Aeons are copies of individuals based on the recollection of the Commander, and are shaped by their own impressions. Thus, you may use this power to recreate any sort of individual that you observe, either by your own eyes or via use of special powers such as clairvoyance, summoning them to fight at your side.

The Aeons wield any powers and ability that they may have originally had, but this is limited by your own perceptions. As a Commander, you act as a ‘projector’ of your own experiences and mentality, and without a complete and full understanding of those you are trying to reproduce, your Aeons will always be somewhat ‘off’. This may result in different personalities, skills and even power.

Even without a full understanding, it is not entirely useless. An Aeon that is not fully in-line with the original may instead be attuned to better combat different enemies, such as Varhram’s Aeons having an anti-Zero trait due to the former’s connection to the mysterious entity. Additionally, those copies that are somewhat off may be easier to control, while an Aeon closer to the original is much more likely to rebel or not respond well to merely being thrown into combat, and may even turn against their ‘Commander’. It is possible to further attune an Aeon once they have been summoned if your understanding or views on them change, and it takes no effort for you to unsummon them.

You may create Aeons of any individual that you witness, as long as they were actual people and not fictional or invented characters, but you may only summon one Aeon at a time of each person. This comes at no cost for you, and there is no limit on the level of power that you can recreate, but as said before, to recreate the highest power may require a deeper understanding than someone from a lower perspective may lack, and the most powerful individuals may be much harder to control if shaped in a true to their alive counterparts."
1757,,1200,A Disaster On Golden Legs,Fate/Strange Fake,Control,"The Bull of Heavens, Gugalanna. The Heavenly Noble Phantasm of the Gods. Its skin, flesh and armor is a hurricane that can cover hundreds of kilometers. Its skeleton is made of golden metals and precious gems from the age of gods, capable of easily stomping over cities with its casual moves. It commands the weather with the potency and scale that a great Divine Spirit may do so.

It's power is such that even a Chief God Class Divine Spirit would have trouble controlling it against its will (or yours), and even Great Heroes would need to at least face it in pairs to have a chance of slaying it in what should surely be a battle that would mark the greatest point in their legends.

Originally it only obeyed the Goddess Ishtar, rebelling and refusing to listen even to the other Great Gods from ancient Sumeria. Now, it seems that it follows you around as its beloved master and loyal friend. Are you perhaps an incarnation of the Goddess Immana?

If you prefer, you may have it be a Divine Beast of a similar power but different abilities.

Since it is a Noble Phantasm, its activation and maintenance in this world requires quite a lot of mana. A powerful Servant or weakened Divine Spirit would be able to keep it manifested, but for it to act at its full might, something on the scale of an Age of Gods manifested Divine Spirit is needed. However, as a Noble Phantasm, it would also be possible to empower it further under the right circumstances, so it may even face the White Titan of Tassili n'Ajjer in its early stages and come on top. If it is somehow slayed, it will be possible to rebuild it if a Temple and enough precious metals are assembled, but depending on the circumstances, it may end up as a weakened version of itself. Alternatively, you will be able to resummon this creature in the next jump at its full strength.

Regardless of whether it was slayed or not, you may summon it at no cost in a much smaller and cuter form to be beside you. At this scale its powers are reduced to that of powerful familiar, at least in terms of a modern human magus, but on a scale that even a weak heroic spirit will make short work out of it.

Finally, there is a fatal weakness of its control mechanism. This Divine Beast is closely tied to the divinity of a certain celestial body observable from the sky at the naked eye, and any other divinity with Authority over the same celestial body with a greater magical enegy than you will be able to temporally wrestle control over your heavenly pet, even ordering it to commit suicide or turn its attack on youbefore you regain control. For Gugalanna, this is the planet Venus, but if you are taking a different Divine Beast, you must choose another Celestial body for this effect."
1758,,1600,Life Equation Comprehension,DC Comics,Control,"First theorized by Darkseid’s studies of Anti-Life to be it’s equal and opposite force, the Life
Equation is a transcendent divine force which originally created the life, gods and other major
aspects of the positive matter multiverse. By changing it’s formula, it can restructure reality
entirely-including compelling obedience to a degree rivalling Anti-Life based on a new world
order in favour of life. Without fearing the New 52 iteration of Highfather’s mishaps from an
imperfect communion with the Life Equation, you can mold biological processes in ways that
would leave even gods in awe-creating armies of New Gods from the populations of galaxies or
gift other powers to those in your favor, and healing all wounds or even resurrecting dead
worlds. The very Source Wall bends to your will, being something you can manifest around
yourself or repair and banish the escape inhabitants trapped in it’s walls back to-or potentially,
bring them under your command. More benevolently the Life Equation can also mend others of
traumatic effects like deep despair, rage and ultimately Anti-Life itself. It’s power rivals and likely
exceeds that of Anti-Life, being capable of creating retroactive events or altering even significant
aspects of others’ identity should they not have powerful divine defenses-and even nullifying the
damage of a multiversal apocalypse.
Be warned: Controlling the blueprints of creation is incomprehensibly complex and challenging
to all but the greatest minds in all the cosmos. Improper use of the Life Equation can result in
undesirable effects like manifesting fears or anxieties into antagonistic entities-or working
changes on others you did not consciously desire. But with wisdom and mastery, creation itself
can become the tools of your workbench."
1759,,1600,Anti-Life Comprehension,DC Comics,Control,"It is the Anti-Life Equation, and it is fully known to you.
It is a transcendental mathematical formula that once fully grasped, manifests certain proof of
the futility of living-and thus subordinates the will of those before the wielders. Its primary effect
is to hollow out the souls and quell the resistance of others, making them little more than
extensions of your will. To make even gods fight and die without fear at your behest, to have
them sacrifice their lives on your behalf or quench their hopes so they are left with nothing but
hollow meaninglessness in their lives fit to be filled by your proclamations. As the master of the
Equation, this could manifest as anything from a true quenching of the spark of self-
determination or a subtle compunction that drives others to throw themselves into the
parademon factories or simply inflict conditions akin to clinical depression and post-traumatic
stress disorder on all but the most wicked and depraved mortals. At first you will require to
actually speak your commands, but with greater experience Anti-Life will respond simply to your
will. So sublime is the command in fact, that even physical and metaphysical conditions can be
controlled through the authority of Anti-Life; you may raise others from the dead and interrogate
them, perform resurrection with it or even command those already enslaved with Anti-Life to in
turn seek and enslave others as conduits to the Anti-Life’s power. Second, this formula renders you completely immune to any form of corruption, as you
have already embraced the deepest despair. Third, you are empowered by negative
emotions—fear, anger, despair—growing stronger as the negativity around you
intensifies. With enough negative energy, you could potentially obliterate the entire
universe with a mere gesture. Lastly, the Anti-Life Equation bestows a myriad of other
abilities, the full extent of which you must discover for yourself. You already possess the
complete equation; now it is up to you to master its dark potential."
