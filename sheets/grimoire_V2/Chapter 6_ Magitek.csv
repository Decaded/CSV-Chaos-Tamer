1,,Free,Private NWO Server,Bofuri,Magitek,"A server that allows for NWO to be played locally after the Jump. It can also be used for training and power testing. If you destroy the virtual environment too much, you can always reset the server. Like the real NWO, death in the VR environment will not cause any injury, let alone death, to the players.

While NWO is just code and someone with enough programming capability can change it, items won’t be fiat-backed (and therefore able to exist in reality) if too far from the vanilla rewards. And nerfing the difficulty will nerf your gains and drops, once removed from the VR environment.

You can increase the hostile mob level cap if you want, though. That’s a relatively simple tweak and you’ll be duly rewarded for your difficulty."
2,,Free,Puppetmaster,Final Fantasy XI,Magitek,"These wandering performers entertain crowds and confound their enemies with a customizable puppet known as an ""Automaton."" This puppet uses different frames, maneuvers and attachments to do a variety of different tasks. Puppetmasters can also fall back on Hand-to-Hand fighting skills that utilize the flexible movements of their art."
3,,Free,Weapon Creation,RWBY,Magitek,"Weapons aren’t just a tool to fight with around here. They are an extension of yourself. They are your closest ally you can rely on. Around these parts Weapons have the tendency to be exceptionally unique. They represent who you are and what you will become. So lets get into giving you your very own Grimm slaying new best friend. This may be purchased multiple times.

You have 400 WP (Weapon Points) to spend.

Note: Weapon Build in Associated Jump Document. "
4,,Free,Custom Robot ,Knight’s and Magic,Magitek,"You get a free robot that you can customize to your heart’s content with the supplement below. It also retains all the upgrades and modifications have done with it and you can also store it in your warehouse which would give you the ability to summon and instantly enter it without going to manually enter in the middle of battle. This may be purchased multiple times.

Note: Robot Build in Associated Jump Document. "
5,,Free,Inventor,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"Your mind is your weapon, and you use it to create incredibly complex machinery or powerful weapons. Your intelligence and ability to learn is improved to a great degree, you could be rightfully called a genius."
6,,Free,Type-Moon Mashu-class Clunker,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"The minimum for every proper adult in the Sapphire Galaxy. You have your own space clunker, a cheap ship that can barely fit you and a few friends. It won’t get you across the galaxy but it at least means you’re not trapped on one world anymore. There isn’t a warp drive but you can probably get to a new system in a few weeks. At least the clunker has a big fuel tank and some decent storage to it. It’s most people’s starting model, one few have good memories of and most try to quickly leave behind. While functional, it’s just not all that pleasant to use for that long."
7,,Free,Augmented: Canard,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Pretty much everyone in the City has some degree of augmentation, muscles that can carry oversized swords while retaining agility, eyes that see better in the dark, lungs that deal with most smog just fine, veins that cut off circulation In the event of being breached, or various other quality of life improvements. You have the basic form of the City’s augments, likely to not be too noticeable, unless you really want something better than the standard, In which case you can get something like a big clunky robot arm that lacks dexterity in exchange for far more strength, or your eyes replaced with cameras that have various extra vision modes in exchange for other flaws in the field of vision afforded."
8,,Free,Shittem Chest ,Blue Archive,Magitek,"A supernatural touch-screen tablet given to the Sensei of Kivotos. This tablet emanates a personal protective field, granting you a measure of protection against bullets and explosions, similar to a Halo. This field only has a certain amount of energy and requires time to recharge, so while you can survive being at ground-zero for a missile detonation you’ll be vulnerable to regular gunshots until the Chest can recharge. The tablet is unhackable, so any information stored on it is safe from prying eyes. Finally, it comes with an A.I. assistant. This can be ARONA or PLANA, or you could design your own AI assistant. They will join you as a follower unless you choose to import them as a companion now or in a later jump."
9,,Free,The Indomitable,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"You are a legendary sky pirate! Your airship has upgraded from a sky-brigantine to a galleon in size, with a crew to match in terms of size. Your airship’s cannons are now much larger, and your entire crew has access to gyropacks and magelocks, allowing you to fully live the pirate dream of raiding even the most confident of cities.

Requires Gadget Array(Super Dragon Sword), Blast Off(Super Dragon Sword), Fly With Me (Super Dragon Sword), Magelock Load-out (Super Dragon Sword) and Air Superiority(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
10,,Free,Super Armor,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"Your Landship now has the capability of transforming into a heavy armored humanoid not unlike a Machina. While in this state, you are fused with the Landship, gaining its defensive and offensive abilities.

Requires Landship Engineer(Super Dragon Sword), Maintenance and Logistics (Super Dragon Sword), Barrage Training(Super Dragon Sword), Thaumic Overhaul(Super Dragon Sword) and Ace Custom(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
11,,Free,Device ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"A Device could be seen as a high-tech magic wand. It aids with the complex math involved in manipulating Mana into spells. There are many different levels of power, intelligence and complexity. This grants you a base Device which you can customize with other perks. (CG Note: This is a Celestial Grimoire original perk. The Lyrical Nanoha jumpchain gives you a free Device, though it’s not listed as a perk, so I had to make one so the rest of Device related perks made sense.)
"
12,,Free,Wearable-type ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Devices that are worn somehow by the mage. This category can get... a little strange, admittedly. It can take the form of rings, capes or even more... strange ones, like roller skates. Additionally, armor that can be used as a weapon falls into this category, such as wrist-mounted blades or gauntlets. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. This perk precludes Weapon-type - Lyrical Nanoha and Auxiliary Control-type - Lyrical Nanoha.)"
13,,Free,Auxiliary Control-type ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This category is... admittedly a little strange. Devices that fall under this are those that simply perform their functions without directly being used in combat. Magical tomes, cameras, ceremonial knives and… stuffed animals belong in this category. If what you want doesn't fit in any other category, it most likely belongs in here. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. This perk precludes Wearable-type - Lyrical Nanoha and Weapon-type - Lyrical Nanoha.)
"
14,,Free,Standby Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Ever wonder why most mages have some sort of trinket on them? A card, a gen, a bracelet, earrings? More often than not, those are actually their Device in it's standby form, which is usually something representative of an aspect of its appearance in Device form.. While it isn't particularly useful for magic in this form, it's much more convenient to carry around like this, no? (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
15,,Free,Device Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Also called the 'Active' form, this is the form you're going to be seeing most of the time. Remember the 'Handling' option you chose above? Now you're going to get to put that to use! You get to pick something within the Handling category you chose to become the form of your weapon – not even necessarily within reason! Twin gatling guns have been seen in this category before! (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
16,,Free,Basic ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"...It's probably only polite to refer to this as 'intelligence'. While it's a bit doubtful as to whether it can even say anything other than the names of you attacks, it's also capable of relaying received electronic messages when telepathy isn't available. Other than that, it might as well be an inert piece of metal. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
17,,Free,Auto-Repair ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Devices are of a strange make. Other than the crystalline components that make up the very core of the Device, all of it’s parts – the blade, shaft and handles – are made of very simple, replaceable materials that can be regenerated through magic. In fact, a common combat tactic is burning large amounts of power to quickly regenerate damage in what’s called a ‘Recovery’. If a Device were to be damaged, it can enter an automated repair state once returned to Standby Mode, regenerating any damage to more superficial parts and light damage to the main body. Heavier damage would require taking the Device to a specialized technician – a Device Meister. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
18,,Free,Sheikah Slate (Basic) ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"A magical tablet the size of a hardcover book, and also the key to unlocking the true power of the ancient magitech that the pre-exile Sheikah left behind. In its most basic form, missing all but the essential Runes, this Sheikah Slate has a sophisticated mapping system where you can mark points of interest (Though you'll need to find a method of actually downloading maps onto the thing) and a digital zoom ""scope"" that both lets you scout out distant places and set map waypoints at wherever you're looking to keep you on track. Most importantly, the Sheikah Slate authenticates you as a valid user of ancient Sheikah tech, and as such you will be able to use the ancient Shrines and Towers that the Sheikah left behind, and it even includes a Sheikah Sensor function that will alert you of nearby Sheikah technology if you get within range."
19,,50,Assembly Protocol S/A/Z,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"The Jagd Panzer’s upgrade capabilities are largely dependent on your mechanical proficiency, but that doesn’t mean you can’t fiddle around with some Al Bhed help – well, my help really but who’s keeping track? These Assembly Protocols will amplify the Jagd Panzer in one field, respectively its special attack properties (related to magic), its general attack properties (related to its standard ordinance), and defensive properties (both physical and magical). Each one of these protocols adds a substantial boost to the Panzer – a good kick to its performance levels that is also applied to any drones present.

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
20,,50,Drone Factory – Attacker Models,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"The Jagd Panzer can create its surveillance “Watcher” drones by itself without any external modification on your part, but these Watcher drones do exactly what their name suggests and nothing else. However, you can configure the Jagd Panzer to create offensive drones instead – arming them with small magic cannons of their own that possess similar, but weaker capabilities to the main cannon of the Jagd Panzer.

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
21,,50,CAPTURE PODS,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Still not sure how to go about capturing monsters? Can’t seem to herd monsters into the pens? Monsters lingering about in places you can’t reach? Well this pod system might be able to help you out then. Though it has to be manually activated and deployed, once this is done you can just walk away and wait for a creature to be captured, at which time the pod will return to an empty pen.

Of course, without any real offensive capacity you probably won’t find the strongest creatures captured – but it does spare you quite a bit of effort in hunting beasts down. If you don’t have an empty pen, the capturing pod will deposit the captured monster in the nearest empty space – so be careful. You’ll get a fleet of five pods to start off with, ranging from XL to XS sizes. Use them carefully!

Requires The Monster Arena to Purchase"
22,,50,Cavall 2,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"Not all of you Servants can fly. Sure, running up a building can get you most places but what if you need to catch a friend falling from orbit, huh? Huh? That’s why you buy yourself a sweet air-bike like this. It can’t get outside of the atmosphere and there’s not much to protect you from collisions, but it’s otherwise flying like a dream. Zip around faster than any aerial vehicle from the modern age and it’s darn comfy too. It’ll take anything as fuel, from crude oil to Artorium to a greedy goddess’ special gem stash. The more valuable the fuel, the faster the bike will go."
23,,50,Stasis Preservation Box Set,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,A series of tupperware that actively preserves the stuff inside. Automatically sorts and repairs itself when left unused for a while. Food preserved can be kept as fresh for as long as the box is kept closed.
24,,50,Mantra Prayer Wheel         ,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This device lets you detect the ambient levels of mantra as well as its primary association. It can also direct you to greater sources of mantra (usually communities). If it is lost or destroyed, a replacement appears in the Warehouse. You also have the schematics."
25,,50,Impurity/Divinity Sensor,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have a handheld device that can detect either the concentrations of impurity representing Gohma or other angry spirits of the world, or the unique theotechno­signature of the Demigods or other prayer-­powered entities. It’s range is 10 miles, and will give you a directional bearing in 3­dimensional space. You also know how to construct more."
26,,50,Mantra Transmitter,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This device is a large statue, looking like some form of religious icon about fifteen feet tall.It allows mortals to direct prayer to you, waiving range/awareness limits. It can direct the Mantra of anyone within one mile, to a maximum of 10,000 mortals each, so you’ll need several such transmitters (and a bunch of praying people) to get the most out of them.

You get one such transmitter for 50cp, and the schematics instructing you how to make more. If destroyed a new transmitter appears in your Warehouse after a week."
27,,50,Armed ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This module allows the Device to perform basic situational analysis, warning you of incoming projectiles and advising you against attacks that you might have otherwise missed. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
28,,50,Storage ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Provides a significant boost to any computational ability it may have already possessed, and streamlines it in the process, significantly reducing the mana draw on you. Also allows the option of 'overclocking' it's processes with mana, at your discretion. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
29,,50,Defenser Plus ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Most spells have a natural ‘bleed’ loss, where a fraction of the energy put into casting the spell is lost as waste, within roughly half a rank’s worth of power. The natural solution is simply improving the algorithms used in the spells, which gives them more effective power. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
30,,50,Mana Boost ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"As with bits and the standalone flight mode, any spell designed to affect those outside direct contact are going to suffer a slight loss in energy spent to effective energy of the spell. Thankfully, this loss can be mitigated by simplifying the algorithms, which increases the coefficient between cost and result. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
31,,50,Efficiency Boost ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"A relatively simple modification, this streamlines some of the more critical processes in the Device, conferring a general increase to efficiency, although due to just making the modifications in the Device as a whole, it is simply a general boost, instead of a more potent boost to a specific aspect, as with the above enhancements. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
32,,50,Tier One Magic Rings ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical ring that provides a bonus depending on the material used. Limit one ring per hand.

Iron: Grants the wearer greatly increased vision, easily doubling their visual acuity, and doubles as a really nice set of knuckledusters

Dust: Fortifies the wearer's body with Dust, helping cushion impacts and slowing blood loss.

Titanium: Increases the wearer's overall strength. If you could bench 50kg, you could bench 60kg.

Glassteel: Increases the wearer's agility and reflexes. Go from juggling apples to knives.
"
33,,50,Tier One Talisman ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical necklace that provides bonus depending on the material used.

Iron: Increases the speed the wearer covers ground at roughly double the speed. This does not increase overall agility or reflexes, just how quickly they can chew through distance.

Dust: Grants the wearer regeneration. Bruises vanish in hours, not days, broken bones heal in days, not weeks.

Titanium: Fortifies the mind and resolve, helping to resist morale shaking effects and mind control.

Glassteel: Helps the wearer predict flight paths and improves over all accuracy. Go from a fifty cent piece to a quarter.
"
34,,50,Dust Mint ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You gain the equipment needed to extract and refine Dust from the environment.
"
35,,100,Displacer,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Magitek,"Forged by the Empire of Yehudah, these devices
reduce the effects of gravity and inertia on whatever they touch to 1/10. Objects or people of
great power find that the magic of the device fails upon them, however."
36,,100,Trisula,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"The Trisula is a spear-type Shingu that resembles either a
Chinese Guandao or a Japanese Naginata, with its most prominent feature being its
ability to extend its shaft, which allows for surprise attacks and long-range combat,
with its maximum size allowing the user to even cross a wide ravine."
37,,100,Yoco-bottoms,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"The Yocto-bottoms is a Shingu that takes the form of a
pair of trousers, more specifically its fabric, capable of increasing the user’s
acceleration and leg strength. However, unlike Teigu that also enhance their users’
physical abilities, the Yocto-bottoms’ enhancement isn't so significant, the user's
strength is still important in combat."
38,,100,Sidewinder,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Taking the form of a long whip-like object with a
snake-patterned handle, this Shingu moves in accordance to its user’s will in a way
similar to a snake, not only allowing for tricky moves but also making it considerably
unpredictable, however, precisely due to its unique combat style, this whip can be
difficult to maneuver, requiring some time to familiarize with it before being able to
effectively use it in combat. Lastly, this Shingu shares its traits with Kyoukotsu's
Meihou Spear, as they were possibly made using the same kind of Danger Beast."
39,,100,The Mysterious: Adayasu,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Like many Teigu that were during the
civil war, this scythe Teigu ended up in the rural countryside, with all of the records of
its previous users being long gone and thus causing its abilities to be shrouded in
mystery, however, there are versions of this Teigu available for you.
For 100 CP, you’ll receive a replica of Adayusu as it was shown in the story, being
sharp and durable on par with other similar melee weapon-type Teigu as well as
having the capacity to fold its blade close to its pole to increase its defensive
capabilities, however, it’s just this, with none special ability at all.
Alternatively, for 300 CP, your replica of Adayusu will now actually have its own
mysterious trump card, but such special ability is unknown for everyone, so it’ll be up
to you to discover what it is and if it’s something actually powerful or if it’s just slightly
useful."
40,,100,Sorothustran Space Yacht,A Mage of Sorothustra,Magitek,"No one says going about official business has to be all
work and no place. This is a luxurious and mobile palace that is capable of moving at speeds
that tremendously dwarf the speed of light. It is staffed with servants and staff who are slavishly
loyal to you, see to all of your needs, and fit your aesthetic preferences."
41,,100,The Ride,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Magitek,"​You know how to travel in style, now. This is your own flying motorbike or
car, complete with certain ‘defensive’ measures, such as an exhaust pipe that releases dragonfire
at the push of a button, along with walls, nets and other fun things. It goes hundreds of miles an
hour without any trouble, and can go higher if you want to push it. Oh, and has an invisibility
button that will never malfunction. Sidecar optional, and you may turn it into a broom at will. It doesn’t have the defensive measures as a broom, but the speed is doubled. And no matter how fast you go on this, in vehicle or broom
form, you will never suffer any adverse effects of the wind or the sheer speed. Has collision
warning spells, but actually preventing them is up to you."
42,,100,Snow's Apple,The Games We Play,Magitek,"This is a plain necklace, a simple thing with a crystal pendant. But that’s not
important. What’s important is what’s in the crystal. See, it’s a data storage device of
virtually unlimited capacity, which can be designed and engineered specifically to be
accessible to specific people.
You can designate whoever you want, and set the method of opening to a password,
or biometrics, or something else. Whatever you use, this protection cannot be
cheated, and nor can this device be hacked in any way. The designated user can see
the data as a hologram this locket projects, and that’s the only way to get info out of
this. Useful when you have some secrets to store securely, let’s just say."
43,,100,Resonating Echo Speaker,Naruto,Magitek,"A metal gauntlet that can be used to amplify or absorb sound waves caused by the movement of the arm it is located on. The sound waves can then be manipulated and directed with chakra, causing damage, blurred vision and dizziness as well as paralysis of the target."
44,,100,Vibrant Wardrobe,Bleach,Magitek,"A marvel of modern sciences, straight from the lab of Mayuri Kurotsuchi, is an array of clothing
made entirely of light producing fibers. Yes, every single thread of these outfits outputs light. Wearing any one of these outfits will erase all darkness and shadow around the user, and on the user, for whatever that’s worth. In the event of emergency, where a critical level of damage has
been sustained, the outfits will also explode like directional charges to give the wearer some space
to gather themselves. Whenever an outfit is destroyed, it takes several days to repair. "
45,,100,Climate Control Orb,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"A strange orb that lets you change the weather in a twenty kilometer radius area between sunny, rainy, overcast, and LIGHTNING. Actually the last part was just thunderstorms – but since the item got knocked about, the lightning has been pink ever since."
46,,100,Anti-Gravity Emitter,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,Personal anti-gravity emitter device. Allows you to expand a field of anti-gravity within a meter of yourself. Good for breaking falls.
47,,100,Summon Portal (S),Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,A small summon portal based on antimatter manipulation principle. Opens a wormhole that small objects (half a human’s size) can go through. Transport distance is 50 meters. Cannot be interfered with.
48,,100,Gear Wrench,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"“It’s a Wrench! The previous owner was from one of the guilds, said that with it she could repair any machine! Then again...she also managed to pick my locks with it. Thankfully it didn’t have any more abilities...”"
49,,100,Etoria Disciple,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"The art of Etoria, the technology which allowed for the creation of things like airships, has always fascinated you. You've noticed patterns in technology, and armed with that knowledge you adapt to new technology quickly. Your teacher has given you a skystone - the key to building your own airship in time, and you'll have no lack of resources."
50,,100,Repairs,Final Fantasy XI,Magitek,"A puppetmaster with no puppet is like a goblin without his mask. What do you mean whats a goblin look like with no mask? You know what happened to the last person who asked me that? ... well Im not telling you. Ok you can repair your puppet! You understand a bit of the workings of your puppet and the semi magical technology used to create it allowing you to repair it if it is damaged using little more than oil and scrap metal. Though this can be useful you still need to take care your puppet is not destroyed.

Requires Puppetmaster to Purchase"
51,,100,Garment Grid Sphere Slot Addition ,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"About as straightforward as it gets – if you want to add an additional slot to the Garment Grid, you can do so for 100 CP. This can be applied to any Garment Grid – though if you do this with the [JC] variation you’ll gain an additional Effect Slot for free. Each additional slot beyond the first costs an extra 50 CP, so the second additional slot will cost 150 CP, the third 200 CP, and so forth.

Requires GARMENT GRID [LM] VARIATION, GARMENT GRID [FF] VARIATION, DRESS GRID [MP] VARIATION, or GARMENT GRID [JC] VARIATION to Purchase

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
52,,100,Parallel Processing,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Have other Machina about? As long as the machina’s size is not larger than the Jagd Panzer – you can rig it up with this so that the Jagd Panzer can remote control it. This goes for the other two prototypes as well...though you’ll find something a bit weird with the Machina Maw – it’s sufficiently small enough that if you already possess the options of construction on board the Panzer...it can recreate the Machina Maw much like how it creates drones. It’ll take longer of course, but the result will operate autonomously.

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
53,,100,Spherimorph Capability,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Never settle for barrier drones when there’s something more effective available. The Al Bhed are masters of observing and replicating natural phenomena – and the Spherimorph’s advanced elemental properties are an excellent example of how nature defends itself. Allowing the Jagd Panzer to switch between elemental properties, this significantly improves its magically oriented defences. This affects any drones that are active as well.

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
54,,100,Drone Factory – Platoon Strength ,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"If you’re going to be taking this you might as well be declaring war on the Yevon clergy folks – since that’s essentially what this modification is best for. Allowing the Panzer unit to create small machina droids that can serve different roles (long ranged attacker, short ranged harassers, patrol units and such), the only issue happens to be that the Panzer is completely immobile while churning out these units – and the speed of production isn’t the best. Still, working in coordination with the Drones, you can field an army rather effectively. The Al Bhed will be really interested in you now...

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
55,,100,PROTOTYPE Α “MACHINA MAW 0”,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"A machine that’s been disassembled, but with some help or your own mechanical expertise you might be able to put it all back together, in which case it looks to be a bipedal walker, complete with twelve missile launchers, six ray cannons, and four forward anti-personnel guns. It’s got absolutely nothing for defence though... Whoever built this really just wanted to blow things up!"
56,,100,GARMENT GRID [LM] VARIATION,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"If I had to make a guess, this looks like technology from the far future, definitely not something from the current Spira anyways. The five receptacles here seem to be made for dress spheres – from what I understand of dress spheres and these grids, the grid can merge the abilities of the spheres together. It might not come with any dress spheres, but if you can find some, anyone bearing the grid will be able to use the power of the Spheres inside."
57,,100,EXPERIMENTAL CAPTURING DEVICE,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"This handheld device doubles as a net gun as well as a standard weapon. You can capture enemies with this, as long as you actually defeat the enemy. It works in conjunction with the Monster Arena if you possess it, as anything captured will be automatically sent to the holding cells within the Arena itself. It can’t capture unique individuals properly however, and bear in mind that you’ll have to subdue an enemy before capturing them."
58,,100,CREATURE CREATOR ,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"You can’t expect that you’d only keep the Arena as a petting zoo right? What’s the point of collecting and tending to monsters if you’re not going to help them grow a little? Maybe even experiment with perfecting breeds and creating better variants? That’s what this lab annex is here for anyways. It’s a very well-known fact that fiends in Spira are created with the absorption of Pyreflies, but in the absence of this, you can substitute spiritual energy as well. Following in the example set by our Crusader friends, unless you possess alternative abilities, it is still impossible to hybridize different monsters together.

The creature creator works in a very methodical fashion, using creatures you already have within pens as a “foundation” for either improvement or creation purposes. Modifications such as size and basic parameters are simple and don’t require a substantial amount of spiritual energy, but as modifications stack up, the results will become less apparent and come at greater cost. It’s best to keep a tight handle on things, and not let things go out of control.

It’s possible to make more substantial changes – like modifications towards a monster’s physical form and properties that would more resemble an evolution or mutation, but these will take substantial amounts of spiritual energy. However, it is possible for you to modify monsters with the use of material items along with spiritual energy, much like how the Guardians can modify their weapons. It’ll consume a substantial amount of items, but with this you can teach your pets new tricks.

Requires The Monster Arena to Purchase"
59,,100,Hell-Phone,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Magitek,"A Cell Phone that automatically updates to the best thing around, retains modifications, can call through dimensions such as from the earth to hell, has a shit ton of memory, and is all in all an awesome phone."
60,,100,Puffy Brume,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Smoke is an interesting thing in the City, from the Smoke War leaving room for L Corp with hundreds of corpses in its wake, to the smoke used by syndicates like the Smiling Faces. Workshops tend to have it in droves with their machinery but some go further by incorporating it into augments or equipment, having smoke cling to targets which makes them more vulnerable or on the user to add more force to strikes. You are also immune to any other adverse effects of smoke, be it regular or infused with extra effects. You can also modify any equipment you use to emit or consume Smoke to enhance itself."
61,,100,Energy Cycle Conversion,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"The security forces of W Corp and the soldiers of R Corp both use a “charge”
system within their equipment, this charge is used to power augmentations in their bodies or activate more powerful functions in their weapons. You now have access to a similar system within yourself with two modes, one builds charge from doing things such as swinging with a weapon or getting hit, and one that uses charge to enhance whatever you are trying to do. You can also just gain charge by absorbing it from an electrical source or battery. Charge can also serve as a go-between for other energy types but it loses a slight amount of power whenever something is turned into charge or vice versa.
"
62,,100,Magi Tech Artillery Cannon,Bibliomania,Magitek,Simply a massive artillery platform the size of a small car that is a single person military cannon capable of firing 1 laser shot with enough destructive power to destroy advanced military tanks in one shot. It has simple controls and can be aimed at a fairly fast rate as well as fire 1 shot every 3 seconds. The only issue of moving the cannon since it's intended to be mounted on a magi-tech tank to move it around or positioned at strategic positions.
63,,100,Drone Hub(Extras) ,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"Interesting choice. Are you familiar with Cait Sith, Jumper? The little cat riding on the back of a fat Moogle that claims to be a fortune teller? He's actually one of the leads of Shrina mentally controlling a robotic double. Taking from his example, this item consists of two portions. First, it's a psychically-linked mental interface you attach to yourself, letting you mentally control and direct a robot linked to the device. The second thing is the robot in question, which can be any sort of appearance or design matching the choices of the Unusual Biology perk. This robot will behave with a personality mirroring yours when left on automatic, but will otherwise follow mental commands and directions as though they were an extension of your body. In addition, they share all of your combat skills and abilities, though obviously they can only use equipment on their person. I hope you have the multitasking needed to make good use of this. After the initial purchase, you may spend an additional 100 (undiscounted) points to get an extra robot in case you need a backup right away or plan to use more...though note the multitasking increases dramatically with each one active at a time.

64,,100,PHS,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"A flip-phone with an interesting property to it. You may use it to contact any allies or companions regardless of distance or environment with this phone, with them miraculously able to answer your calls wherever they are, even if it's in the middle of nowhere. How? Don't worry about it. It's a handy way to keep in touch on the road, if nothing else. This only works on the same Planet, mind...no space phones here. You may add this feature to any phone or long-range communication device you own instead."
65,,100,Stylish Vehicle,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"What's the point of hitting the road without a good set of wheels? You have yourself a top-of-the-line personal vehicle you would see on the roads to Midgar. Whether it's a custom motorcycle or a rusty pick-up trick, you have yourself a ride that can carry up to four people or just yourself and a passenger. Strangely, it never runs out of fuel and handles like a dream in your hands, yet anyone else who tries to use it without your permission can barely get it to go over five miles per hour. You may import a vehicle of similar size you already own."
66,,100,Hextech Hoverboard,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"The latest trend of Piltover, this hoverboard is powered by Hextech and grants the user limited flying abilities. It’s not particularly fast and it doesn’t have a way to keep you on the board if you make a particularly fancy move, but it’s better than walking."
67,,100,Mechanical Aptitude,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"While not all the inhabitants of Piltover and Zaun are genius inventors, everyone gets at least a little experience with how hextech functions. So, you’re now a decent engineer, able to assemble simple mechanical objects. With time and study, you could make a career out of this. If you have the Inventor Perk, you’re instead a truly prolific engineer, able to come up with new designs on the fly."
68,,100,WFD,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"The headmaster’s gift to a prodigal student. This wristband can project a bubble of static reality in a wide area around the user, dragging them and any desired targets into an alternate version of their current environment. Referred to some as a Reality Marble Generation Device, it lets the user force any battle to occur in a safe place where innocents won’t be harmed and, more importantly, won’t be able to sue you for getting hurt. The bracelet can maintain the bubble until destroyed but can only manifest it’s power once each day."
69,,100,Quantum Navigation Device,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"This isn’t so much of an actual navigation device as it is a mental minimap. What it is is a complete, self-updating database connected to a neural interface that has recorded the geography of every single dimension in the universe in extreme detail. This allows an experienced user to use it to navigate even normally impossible to navigate places, such as the Sea of Quanta, and Bubble Universes. It is accessible via simply thinking of the destination one wants to go to, and has a rudimentary A.I. consciousness to help you find your way around."
70,,100,Stigmata Creation Set,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"Pfft, to think MEI was able to predict that the art of making Stigmata would degrade over time – I really shouldn’t have underestimated her. Regardless, she has wished for you who is inheriting Fire Moth’s legacy to also have the ability to create and integrate new Stigmata to replace the ones that have decayed over time or have been lost. This set contains simple, step-by-step instructions on how to craft a Stigmata out of Soulium, and also have all of the tools necessary to integrate said Stigmata into others. In future jumps, these Stigmata can grant people access to Magic Systems or other Power Systems."
71,,100,Time-Fracture Device,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"A small device that can be integrated into battlesuits or imported as another device. It has a unique ability that relies on consumption of a large amount of Honkai Energy to slow down time in the surroundings. Of course, it does not affect the user, because then its function would be pretty much useless for the amount of energy it consumes to use. Anyway, this Time-Fracture Device can also be modified to automatically activate when a certain condition is achieved, and can store 3 such activation condition modifications inside of itself at a time."
72,,100,Beholder Chamber,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A cylindrical chamber roughly two metres in diameter that you can stand in. When the chamber is closed, the user inside can see, hear and smell locations from far away. The chamber is mentally draining to use with longer distances tiring the mind faster. Those who have had training or are capable of remote viewing on their own feel none of these limitations and thus have unlimited ""reach""."
73,,100,Taboo Tattoo,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"Ink and tools to create tattoos. Although appropriate for artistic uses, if this ink is used in the application of a tattoo, the tattoos will have special properties. Some possibilities include enhancing the owner, affecting those who look at it, or both. The effectiveness of a tattoo depends on the skill level of the artist."
74,,100,Signature Sidearm,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A customisable melee weapon that maintains its own sharpness and durability. The weapon has a compact form for easy storage. Can be customised to use a blade, focus on blunt trauma, and even enhanced to include special effects like releasing explosions on impact or shocking targets with paralysis."
75,,100,Parts Bin,Final Fantasy VI,Magitek,"A genius without materials might as well be a madman for how useful he’ll be. So take this small box of gears, wires, metal plates, tubing, nuts, and bolts. It won’t have everything you’ll ever need for your inventions, but it will have a lot of the most common bits and bobs. Better yet, it will refill itself each week so you don’t have to go shopping yourself. More time for inventing."
76,,100,ARCANOTECHNICIAN,CthulhuTech,Magitek,"The Ashcroft Foundation pioneered the field of Arcanotechnology. You are trained at the art of maintaining and repairing arcanotechnology. This perk functions even if you don't know how the arcanotechnology works. After all, it probably destroyed the mind of the original arcanotech engineer to conceive of it."
77,,100,Purification Weapons,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have access to the grand armories of Shinkoku Trastrium­ You may select a heavy weapon like a prayer gatling or anti­-impurity weapon. The former is equivalent to a Gau­8 Avenger, while the latter is a large energy projection cannon, firing single explosive plasma bursts.

Both fire harnessed prayer projectiles, and as such do increased damage to impure spirits and similar things. They require Level 2 Mantra to fire.

If destroyed, a replacement will appear in your warehouse. You require Demigod Atelier to construct additional copies."
78,,100,Mantra Capacitors ,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"These devices allow you to contain Mantra either by meditating and directing it yourself, or by tapping into a Mantra Transmitter. In either case, a single capacitor can hold 1000 mantra charges, which equates to 5 minutes of Mantral Level 3 feats, or 12 hours of sustained use of Mantra level 1­ and 2 equipment. It takes 12 hours to recharge a capacitor to full."
79,,100,Rank and File Cybernetics,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have the basic cybernetic enhancements of the Demigod armies­ you do not age notably, and your body is effortlessly easy to repair by swapping intact parts for broken ones. You can be killed, but your tolerance for damage is much higher."
80,,100,Muh Laboratory,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"There’s no true researcher that can go without a well-stocked laboratory with the latest gadgets and almost infinite reserves of coffee. It’s just the bare minimum, man. That’s why I’ll give you this underground facility that has been tailored to be able to resist, contain, provide, and encourage any and all scientific and magical purview you undertake."
81,,100,Dinosaur With Dementia,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"This smartphone-looking artifact is actually a measurement device. It’s designed to scan an individual and give readings of their talents, skills, potential, affinities, etc. It’s not perfected just yet, but it can give a pretty accurate summary of what someone can do and excel at, while also giving an idea of what weaknesses or limitations they might have. Very convenient for recruiting powerful and talented people as minions."
82,,100,Colonel Olcott        ,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Magitek,"A researcher needs a proper assistant, don’t they? Worry not because you will never want for another right-hand man or maid with these miniature automata. Starting out at half a dozen in number but easy to replicate for you, they can fulfil whatever task you need of them, be it cleaning after you or sorting your things. They are however not suitable for combat."
83,,100,Archive of Knowledge        ,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Magitek,"What you have here is a digital archive in the form of a Datapad containing the complete database of every scientific, technological and magical development that has been created in the MCU multiverse. The archive comes with an intuitive search engine that allows you to find anything you want with ease. This archive will contain all the knowledge of any past jumps, as well as update in future jumps to add in a complete archive of all local technology, science and magic."
84,,100,Electromagnetic Static,Marvel 2099,Magitek,"You are able to create an electromagnetic jamming field around you. It won’t affect visible light, or more energetic frequencies, but it can shut down radio and microwave transmission, and even infrared out to several hundred feet around you."
85,,100,Blast Off,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"A unique item in this age, this cutting edge backpack device has enough power from a Mana Core within it to lift a human into the air with the freedom of a bird. You know how to create these packs, but they require extensive training to use without crashing every 5 seconds. Luckily, you have that training, and thus are capable of taking to the air in combat, making you incredibly evasive against ground-bound enemies."
86,,100,Gadget Array,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"As an inheritor to the machinists of old, you can utilize a series of trick-weapons that inflict unique and odd status effects. Your tricks can inflict status effects such as Exhaustion (which reduces the speed and strength of a foe), Oiled (receives vastly increased Fire Damage), Soaked (Receives vastly increased Air damage, but resistance against Fire damage), Frozen (Receives vastly more damage from blunt attacks but resists fire) or Withered (Vastly increased Fire and Water damage.)"
87,,100,Bishop,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"The best method of fighting is to cut off your enemy’s support. Easy enough for you. You have both a number of melee weapons as well as a “stun rifle” and electrified net-bombs on hand, each one of your weapons dealing Air damage and having high chances of inflicting Slow, Paralysis, and Stun. You also are capable of setting up traps with similar properties that are excellent at interrupting enemy actions."
88,,100,Rook,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"You won’t get very far in this world without a way of handling when times get tough. That’s what this beauty is for. You own and know how to construct an extremely strong tower shield, with a few bonus features created specifically for you. Firstly, you are capable of utilizing a built in floodlight to inflict the Blind status on enemies in front of you. Secondly, those that attempt to strike you in melee will have to resist the stunning electric shocks that will retaliate when you are attacked, inflicting Paralysis on those who cannot handle it. Lastly, built-in speakers allow you to force everything in front of you back with sheer sonic force, potentially Deafening them and knocking them Prone. Not bad. Not bad at all. "
89,,100,Landship Engineer,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"You own a Landship, an armored vehicle. Its speed is comparable to a horse’s sprint, though operation of the Landship requires mana to be poured into the engine. Your starting Landship is tough enough to be struck by a dragon’s claws, but not enough to survive its breath for long. It has a heavy cannon that can grievously injure even tough demons, but the single-shot nature of the shells and time to load mean it takes time. Finally, no amount of healing magic will work on the Landship - you have to manually repair it over the span of a period of rest in order to heal it. If your Landship is destroyed, you know how to reconstruct it…but it’ll be pricey. Finally, you are unable to use any other Job’s abilities in conjunction with the Landship."
90,,100,Wheels,Dresden Files,Magitek,"Not much to write home about, just your basic vehicle to move around in. This is any car of your choice, provided certain benefits. It never breaks down, never runs out of fuel, is entirely immune to the Hex and makes any device inside it similarly immune, and has a front bumper designed to run big, strong supernatural beings over. Useful in a lot of situations, especially that last feature. If this somehow gets trashed a new vehicle with all the same features shows up in your warehouse the next day."
91,,100,Chandler’s Keys,MtG - Homelands,Magitek,"The ruling Wizard Savant of the Floating Isle has placed a large bounty on Chandler's head for stealing this ring of keys. The keys themselves are magical tools, used for altering and changing the mechanisms of clockwork creatures. With these, an enterprising thief could quite easily steal a wealth of artifact creatures from their museums and homes, assuming they could actually get into the Floating City without attracting notice.

And now, this keyring has found its way into your hands. Hopefully you’ll use it responsibly, or at least grow rich off their use. Along with the actual keyring, this also comes with a utility belt of rope, picks and other thieves tools. None of it is actually magical or terribly unusual, but they would certainly help any thief who knows how to use them."
92,,100,Clockwork Gnomes ,MtG - Homelands,Magitek,"One of the first pieces of artifice the First Master taught the wizards of the floating isle was the creation of these enchanted clockwork servants. Each of these gnomes is about a foot tall, including the pointed hat that is part of its body. Despite their size and the occasional need to be oiled, they make for excellent servants and assistants.

They can walk, talk, teach, and generally communicate with those who speak with them, but they don't have a lot of personality or manners to them. You’ve come to own a dozen of these small clockwork creatures, who will happily work on whatever tasks you give them. Optionally, they can resemble you or your companions in small metal form."
93,,100,Beneath My Iron Skin(100CP),MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"With the many Futurist advancements that have spread throughout the world, one of the most common ones takes the form of mechanical assistance. Metal arms and legs, to replace ones lost to accident or battle, are but the tip of this iceberg. Entirely mechanical suits of armor, known as mechs, mecha, or mechsuits depending on who you ask, are their newest addition to the art of war. To that end, I would offer you one of these - perhaps you seek a High-Speed Hoverbike that would make most Reckoner gangs blush in envy, or the Mobilizer Mech that the Futurists use to control several suits at once. Of course, something more impressive could also be what you seek? 

For 100 cp, you may take one such mech that is worth one or two “lands” of mana, as the old magicians would measure it. The above mentioned examples would all fit into this category, as would the seed of potential that is the Mechtitan Core - although, without others to back it up, you may not find much use there."
94,,100,The Era Of Information,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"The Futurists have over the years, created a network of information that is readily available to all who would call themselves an artificer - simple designs for old machines, reports and studies on the interactions of various materials, even the occasional transcript of debates or conversations. The Reckoners have their own bastardized version, but this one is far better on account of being the original. You now possess a data pad that is heavily geared towards the construction of advanced machinery, one with an inbuilt design suite that allows you to draw out blueprints and circuits and test them via simulation software. …if you really prefer, I can instead give you a pile of books and a set of basic tools to work with, if you’d rather something more suited to one of the old fashioned factions. It would be a bit of a waste, but I would understand"
95,,100,Cybernetic Augment ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Though a philosopher would likely tell you that all are born equal, there are those who are born less equal. Birth defects such as a malformed limb, a weak mind, or poor vision, all these things may prevent a person from rising to the heights they would have otherwise been able to reach. Luckily, the Emperor is kind and her court is often generous to match. What has been given to you is a simple piece of Saiba technology, meant to counteract these flaws - perhaps one of your eyes is now a state of the art security camera, giving your once failing eye vision akin to that of an eagle or a wolf. Perhaps one of your limbs has been replaced entirely? Do keep in mind, these are a far cry from what the Saiba could really do, but it is more than enough to see you to overcome whatever weakness plagues your body. If you have no such weakness, you may instead opt to merely possess a ready to use version of one such replacement, in the event that it becomes necessary. "
96,,100,A Single Drop Of Perfection ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"I’m sure this is an incredibly strange thing to find on Kamigawa, and that more than a few people would be filled with pure terror and utter panic to see it here. But the fact remains, it is here. These vials of black ichor are the remnants of technology from a vastly superior civilization. The oil has a memory of sorts, guiding the growth and modifying the forms of anything and anyone who touches it into a superior shape. Studying it, placing it under a microscope and zooming in as far as you go, will reveal designs and blueprints for a thousand and one designs - and that’s merely one drop. You’ll probably have immense difficulty using any of these designs for yourself, and anyone who knows them would tell you that they’re out of date… but thankfully, the oils wants to take those shapes anyways, and with your help would be happy - if oil could be happy, at least - to perform some upgrades."
97,,100,A Soul Cast In Steel,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"As befitting an organization that houses itself inside a city of artists and that stands against the traditionalist and slow to upgrade Empire, Risona and her followers make excellent use of machinery in their righteous war. Not quite as much as the Futurists, but few among them are afraid or unwilling to turn to machinery to gain a boost or perhaps a sidekick of some kind. To that end, you have come into the possession of an artifact that, while intended as a weapon and certainly capable of being used as one, is also somewhat alive and thus capable of fighting alongside you. The aptly named rabbit battery, perhaps, whose internal generator raises your speed and strength by a small degree, or the twinned lizard blades, who will quite literally bend themselves into or out of the way of your opponents blows, for example? Well, there are more than just those within the ranks of the Uprising, but I leave deciding up to you."
98,,100,One Hell Of A Sweet Ride ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Thugs and brutes they may be, but the vast majority of the Nezumi within the ranks of the Reckoners have something that a surprising number of people would admire - a sense of style and fashion that’s honestly just plain cool. Leather coats with partially magical designs on them, an outfit to go with that coat, and best of all? A surprisingly high tech motorcycle, as durable as they are fast. Not exactly good for the environment, but what are you, a Jukai monk? No, you’re a Reckoner! Now, if you would prefer, we can swap out the cycle for a coat that’s been heavily enchanted via a similar method that Jukai uses for its Living Histories, one that can give you the power to grow a set of wings out of the back of the jacket. Not as cool or as fast, but just as stylish and arguably just as useful. "
99,,100,Folding Drone ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Where a traditionalist might pull out a calligraphy set with which to draw a message that was just as much a work of art as a message, and then use a spark of magic to call it off the paper and send it on it’s way, the Futurists are in no way shape or form traditional. What you have here is their answer to the need to send a message with minimal effort on their part - at first it seems like little more than a few thin sheets of metal, but when turned into an origami crane they may be sent off on wings of metal and magic to deliver your words. And, more importantly, they do so via a recording of your voice rather than anything as simple as ink. For those inclined to be slightly more physical, the ‘paper’ can be folded into a number of other shapes, such as a simple knife. Bracelets are also a popular shape for storing them."
100,,100,W F D,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Magitek,"Strange tools made by a strange madman. Reports say he had the head of a lion and ran off after these fell out of his pocket, screaming about the Presidents having secret missions for him. Best not think about it. 

But what do you have here? Three marvels of science which seem to have gone a bit beyond any of their kind. A camera that by looking through the lense, reveals things that are concealed by supernatural means, even allowing a normal person to see spirits. A pocket phonograph that when played, sounds out any noise that is concealed from the area around you, making those of unnatural stealth the loudest around. Finally, a light bulb that when flicked on, reveals all things within it’s range. Not only temporarily revealing concealed beings but also the true forms of any within range, the presence of the supernatural and even when someone is being controlled by another. 

Each tool is very sturdy, rarely breaking, yet seem quite difficult to figure out their mechanisms. It may take some time to do so. You may import similar tools into the similar objects here. A camera into a camera, an audio-playing device into the phonograph and a light producing tool into the lightbulb."
101,,100,So Is Magic Science or Magic? ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Magitek,"Sorcery occupies an essentially meaningless line between reality and nonsense. The core fundamentals of sorcery lie in science – the manipulation of atoms and matter, heat and reactions – but also includes things such as spirits, magic circles and raising the souls of the dead. Thankfully, there is a one-way transferable skill set, as any scientific knowledge you may possess can easily be used with sorcery and while magic is not terribly useful for pure science, a sorcerer's ability to perceive individual molecules is a great boon."
102,,100,Communicators ,Generic Magical Girl,Magitek,"Be able to discreetly contact your allies at any time with your magical communicators. They communicate on a secure magical channel, so they have essentially unlimited range and can't be intercepted or eavesdropped on unless someone's leaning over your shoulder. You get one for you, and one for every ally or companion you take.
"
103,,100,Energy​ ​Draining​ ​Devices​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"Your studies into the flow of energy has given you energy stealing technology. You can create small, energy stealing devices that can be passed off as regular mundane objects. To drain someone’s energy, they must use the item of their own volition. This can include conning them into using it. You can also implant weak brainwashing features into these items if it fits. So for example, it’s entirely possible to make a CD or music file that drains someone’s energy when they listen to it, that could also help turn someone to your side. You may gather energy from afar with these devices as long as you are on the same planet as the person using them.
"
104,,100,Smoke​ ​Bombs​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"These smoke bombs are perfect to help hide your escape--the smoke they make will be difficult to see through or for anyone to follow you through. These bombs will greatly muddle any supernatural or technical senses that try to track you through the smoke--you heat signature will seem cooler than what they are, your breathing, heartbeat, and steps will be muffled, any magical traces you leave will be too weak to sense. This doesn’t completely hide you--people can just blow it the smoke away with a gust of wind and the smoke will eventually dissipate, so make your exit as quick as possible!
"
105,,100,Smoke Bombs - Boosted,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"Any evidence you left behind in your exit, like footracks or blood trail, will be extremely difficult to find in the vicinity of the smoke, even after it’s gone. People will probably need professional tools and skill to find them. Any combat damage that happened will still exist--but as far as the evidence is concerned, you just disappeared where you stood. (CG Note: Requires base Smoke Bombs - Sailor Moon first.)
"
106,,100,Magical Ergonomics ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Okay, let’s be honest. Some Device designs that the nerds at R&D cook up aren’t exactly easy for human hands to wield. Weird trigger placement, too much weight on one part of the weapon, or even having the reloading chamber far away from where you actually hold the dang thing - it can be a mess. But you’re so used to this that it just doesn’t bother you. Terrible or impractically designed weapons or devices work just fine in your hands, and your performance doesn’t really suffer for it. This doesn’t work for security measures designed SPECIFICALLY to keep you from using it, however."
107,,100,Cartridge Kit ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Cartridges are a mainstay of the Ancient Belkan system, so it would be awfully silly if you didn’t know how to make your own, right? It’s a box of about sixty cartridges, along with everything you need to make more of your own. If you’re lazy or not much of a building type, it will restock on its own the following week.
"
108,,100,Sealing Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Most Devices are far from standardized, this feature is fairly ubiquitous among custom Devices made for use by TSAB mages. It is also somewhat unique among other Modes for being usable with other Modes, as the main body of the Device remains unchanged except for the Device deploying energy wings from somewhere near the ‘hilt’ of its body. The Device also gains a very limited capacity to store small objects within it’s main body, with a capacity equal to its actual size.

Sealing Mode does limit Device output a not insignificant amount, attacks made in this form, along with access to a ‘sealing’ spell allow the anomalous properties of objects and artifacts to be sealed, rendering them safe for handling. It also cancels out active effects of the object, for example separating someone from an artifact that’s possessing them. Once sealed, an artifact is even safe to handle and can be even used to a limited extent. Sealing does not last forever, however. An upkeep is required to keep the sealing in place, albeit at a very low intake. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
109,,100,Alternate Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"When it comes to magical combat, the truth is that there often isn’t a perfect weapon for every occasion, so many Devices compensate for this by including a transformation mechanism. This lets the operator overcome the limitations of their Devices form somewhat, allowing them to fight ranged with an otherwise melee-based weapon or vice versa. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)

These are not ‘true’ transformation mechanisms in the sense that they do not excessively alter the form of the Device, rather modifying what is already there. For example, the head of a halberd or bardiche may rotate to become the base for an energy scythe, or a sword might split apart into a whip. Some more exotic examples include a sword combining with it’s sheath to become a bow, or an enormous sword splitting into two smaller swords.
"
110,,100,Gigantic Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"With regular weapons, simply increasing the size has a maximum useful limit. With Devices, the increased size of the weapon can be counteracted with fields and spells to increase physical strength when it comes to melee weapons, and the increased power demands of ranged weapons can be offset by simply providing the required power. This allows your weapon to expand to an absolutely massive form, from ‘merely’ four times its normal size to a titanic version that can crush sand dragons like walnuts.

There aren’t many caveats to this mode, and while the scaling can be technically infinite relative to your magical power, said infinite scaling cannot be said for the Device itself, which may need careful reinforcement the bigger you try to go with it. Additionally, missing becomes much more costly in this mode, as the Mage essentially compresses their potential damage over time into a single swing. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
111,,100,Intelligent ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Expanded computational abilities, increased independence and an actual personality sometimes makes you doubt whether your Device is really as simple of a machine as it thinks it is sometimes. While it's personality may seem a bit... basic, it's undying loyalty to you and a somewhat quirky way of speaking is going to make it a lifelong partner. Now capable of partially interfering with your control process, it will help guide your projectiles and subtly correct your aim as best it can, although you do have an override, if you need it. The only drawback is the increased draw on you to power it's intelligence. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
112,,100,Gear Training ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"The Symphogear functions as an extension of you, but only as long as you remain in sync with it. Just like you control it, it controls you, in a way, granting you a higher synchronization rate, and an almost preternatural sense for where the scattered components of your weapons – swords, traps, discarded saw blades – are. This effect also extends to more than just Gears, anything that you 'synchronize' with is going to benefit from this perk.
"
113,,100,Geology' ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"It's not hard to just root around in Heretical ruins and pick out all the shiny bits, but the nature of heretical technology means that the most unassuming pieces of rock or scripture could actually be the real deal: Relics. Years of searching these ruins have given you a keen eye for finding Relics that might otherwise be masquerading as very plain looking objects, making you an extremely useful resource for salvaging them.
"
114,,100,BUSHIMO ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"A pagan artifact unearthed in Greece, BUSHIMO was the first vending machine, designed to dispense holy water in exchange for coins. In modern times, however, it seems to have taken on the reverse function, this unassuming pot gaining unearthly powers. BUSHIMO has gained the abilities of a web developer, and will tirelessly work to produce graphics and slideshow objects for whatever you could possibly need, depositing them onto computers near you when it’s convenient.

...If left alone for too long, however, BUSHIMO will begin malfunctioning, and end up programming an entire mobile gacha game based on you, releasing it onto the market and starting a massive racket to rapidly accumulate wealth.
"
115,,100,Fused Gear ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"...Still not satisfied? Well... alright. Here's an idea- I've got some special- no, it's not black pepper. Yes, I know it's in a salt shaker, let me explain. If you so desire to fuse two Gears together- whether imported or purchased below, I'd be willing to fuse the two together for a small surcharge. Just be warned, the effects can be... weird. They're not going to 'stack', per say, more override each other. Fusing, say... Prometheus and Longinus won't yield a Gear that generates spears and axes, it'll yield a Gear mostly based around chainsaw polearms, with an additional theme of holy fire. Sounds a bit silly, right?

Being unable to handle the mental stress of first activation or exceeding the safe activation time will cause the user to go berserk, attacking with reckless abandon until they are forced to deactivate.

117,,100,Alice Doll ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Magitek,"A masterwork doll skillfully crafted by Alice Margatroid, utilizing such advanced magitech that an artificial soul was able to be implanted into the doll in order to create a fully sentient, autonomous being. This doll is completely loyal to you, and is surprisingly adept at combat despite its size, but specialize in mundane housework above all. You can specify its personality and appearance."
118,,100,Aquapulvistics ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Where there is water, there is Dust. You know how to sift a sizable amount of Dust from any flowing water source. The larger the source, the more you can extract. Useless in Winter, but that's years away, right? Even after you leave Auriga, you still manage to find a little Dust in water across the multiverse. Nifty, huh?
"
119,,100,Tier Two Rings ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical ring that provides a bonus depending on the material used. Limit one ring per hand.

Titanium: Greatly increases the wearer's over all strength. If you could bench 50kg, you could bench 75kg.

Glassteel: Greatly increases the wearer's agility and reflexes. Go from juggling apples to chainsaws.

Dust: Fortifies the body even further with Dust, helping them absorb a tremendous amount of damage without perishing.
"
120,,100,Tier Two Talisman ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical necklace that provides bonus depending on the material used.

Titanium: Blocks the part of the brain that feels fear, and further reinforces the mind against control.

Glassteel: Helps the wearer predict flight paths and improves over all accuracy. Go from a fifty cent piece to a dime.

Dust: Hastens healing to unnatural levels. Bruises in seconds, cuts in minutes, broken bones in hours.
"
121,,100,Dust Refinery ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Able to infuse Dust with new life, the Refinery is the staple of Dust Enchantment. While Dust infused iron is common, it pales compared to the Dust enchantments this refinery allows. Allows for the crafting of Foci and magic rings, talismans, insignias, and tomes.

122,,100,Basic Runes ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"The Basic Runes add camera functionality to the Sheikah Slate, storing pictures in an album for later recollection, as well as the Compendium, which stores and logs useful information on anything you take a picture of - with a limit of one item logged per picture.

It’s a natural maxim used to ensure that historical sights are preserved, but memory is a fickle thing...a picture can say it a lot better. This simple camera is capable of printing out vivid photographs with no need or film or development, working on a set of simple runes taken from the Sheikah Slate. These photos can be hung up later as well! If you were to connect this to a Sheikah Slate, you could also easily use it as a ‘range booster’ for its camera function, allowing you to zoom in from far off onto wherever you wish.
"
124,,100,Lokomo Chair ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Has science gone too far? The Lokomo seem to specialize in trains, but they’ve taken that one step further and created what amounts to an electric wheelchair. I guess they’re too lazy to actually walk around? Well, that’s a bit unlikely. It’s probably got more to do with their ability to trade their life force to power the machines they’ve made, and possibly something about how scooting about in their fancy chair is more energy efficient than actually walking. Anyways, you now have one such chair. It’s oddly light and maneuverable for its size, and as mentioned runs off of your energies rather than any form of steam or electricity."
125,,100,"Lokomo Classic, ‘The Spirited’ ",Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"While the Lokomo may have leaked knowledge on the fine art of trains to their new neighbors, they are still the masters as this particular train shows. Instead of requiring coal and steam, or any other form of physical fuel, their special Spirit Train instead runs on magic. Specifically, it skims off the top of the energy inside the Spirit Tracks themselves. If that’s not an option, your personal reserves can power it for a time, as can any ambient magic such as ley lines.
"
126,,100,"Lokomo Basics, ‘The Sea Train’ ",Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Of course, an ancient magitech train just doesn’t have the same limitations as a normal one does. That’s why you can now drive your train underwater, or even across lava. While the how is ludicrously complicated, the effect is that the Spirit Train is functionally immune to being damaged by the environment. Dedicated weapons can still harm it, but the weather won’t. That said, driving over lava and driving through a volcano are two very different things.

137,,100,Dwarven Centurion ,The Elder Scrolls,Magitek,"One of the deadliest Dwemer Animunculi crafted, it is a brass behemoth that stands equal to Giants, and even more deadly. It's metallic hide repels most mundane weapons, it's axe can cleave through steel easily, and when it has to, it can unleash a blast of boiling steam towards an opponent. You also get a rod, allowing you to control it's actions directly as well as force it into standby mode."
138,,100,Electric Magic ,Undertale,Magitek,"Another discipline of magic that's less effective in battle than it is in practical use, Electric Magic has been adopted for use by those who work in electronics and robotics. The user can create electrical currents and signals with their magic, able to precisely modify the amperage or voltage as they please, up to the output of a car battery. The most useful technique, however, is the ability to run this magic through a circuit and be able to sense any errors or faulty wiring in the circuit. Like Fire Magic, Electric magic does not affect living beings like actual electricity would- You cannot actually electrocute someone with this magic."
139,,150,Cartridge System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"While considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era, the Cartridge System has nevertheless experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years, especially after it’s successful integration into more modern, non-Belkan Devices. The Cartridge System integrates a chambering mechanism not unlike those found on mass-based firearms into the Device’s body, usually somewhere behind what would be considered the ‘main body’ of the Device, which houses the core and most of its hardware. The chambering mechanism loads packets of compressed mana, also called cartridges – which take the form of bullet-like objects – into the Device, injecting more energy to be used by the system.

The cartridges are prepared before the battle, and are analogous to nitrous in their usage, increasing performance and power at the cost of putting much more strain on the Device and it’s user. Without the proper reinforcement, some Devices can suffer self-inflicted damage, and their users can suffer internal injury from the sheer power involved. Ordinarily, unless excessive amounts of cartridges are being used, this is not a concern, but when paired with high-output systems such as the Fulldrive, it can quickly become crippling to both the Device and the user without reinforcement. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
140,,150,Accelerated Charge System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Normally, energy wings are produced as the result of high energy spells or systems, such as sealing or bombardment magic, usually creating between two to four wings. The very fact that on it’s own, the ACS produces no less than six energy wings is an indicator of how high-energy a system it is. An ACS is built to aid in the breaching of strong defensive barriers by piercing them with a high energy charge, optionally followed by delivering a powerful spell through the breached barrier.

While the acceleration is very high, with a massive top-speed, the ACS is not a very useful mobility tool, due to the difficulty maneuvering at high speeds, along with it’s high energy consumption. Devices that don’t have a melee-weapon they can use as the piercing mechanism will be able to generate a thin energy blade called a Strike Flame to serve as a spear point.

Adamantium: This hammer-shaped talisman provides the wearer with an innate understanding of siegecraft, giving them knowledge on how to build simple siege equipment from scratch, undermine walls, and better notice weak points in structures.

Palladium: This eye shaped amulet is a vengeful thing. Whenever the wearer is injured, they feel a great rage grow inside of them, causing them to strike harder and harder with each cut, bruise and break.

143,,150,Tier 1 Tomes ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Tomes are some of the most powerful arcane relics on Auriga, costing a small fortune each to make. Within them exist powerful rituals that can reshape the land and people within. Each can affect roughly 50 miles, and project from the tome itself.

Titanium: This focuses the mind to a needle point, allowing for impossible feats of concentration and focus. The overall intelligence of those working under the Tome holder is increased by 50%. A must have in every Vaulter lab.

Glassteel: One of the most valuable tomes, this contains spells that rouse Dust from its slumber, kicking it up into Dust devils. Drawing Dust into a single place makes it far easier to harvest, and it seems to call Dust upon the wind, always bringing enough back to the lands to harvest. No true Broken Lord is without one.

Adamantium: This tome contains powerful geomancy, allowing the holder to call metal up from the depths of the earth. It takes time for the ore to rise to the surface, but it greatly increases mining output.

Palladium: Within this distressingly warm and... breathing... tome are spells that cause vegetation to explode into life, growing rapidly to suit the will of the holder. Farm output is doubled, and no matter where the holder goes, there is always enough native flora and fauna to support them and their troops.

Dust: Within this Dust infused scroll, you find hints of Endless Wisdom. Sadly, it is only about killing others. While under the effects of this Tome, warriors train harder and faster, rapidly turning into an expert fighting force in a matter of months, not years.

speed and precision of the user's fingers by several hundredfold, which, while not
directly useful in battle, makes it an excellent tool for doctors and alchemists, as it
can be used to to increase development within their research and experimentations
in different areas. It also allows them to perform surgeries quickly and flawlessly, with
the speed enhancement even allowing a skilled surgeon to basically heal any injury
on their patients short of death."
145,,200,Phantasmagoria: Gaea Foundation,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"As a Teigu in the form of a cosmetic

ability, when assuming an animal appearance, it grants them the ability to mimic this
specific animal's natural abilities, such as a bird’s flight and a lion’s sharp fangs for
example, however, mimicking a mundane bird and flying for several minutes is
extremely exhausting even for experienced users. Additionally, the Gaea Foundation
can also be used to transform the user into plants, such as disguising them as an
immobile tree to escape from pursuers."
146,,200,L'Arc Qui Ne Faut,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"This Teigu consists of a quiver, which is used to holster
arrows, and a bow, which can be used to even fire multiple arrows at once. But its
actual special ability is that, by calling out the target's name while firing, the arrows,
regardless of the direction they're fired, will seek out the target with remarkable
speed for an infinite amount of time, effectively sharing its unique abilities with the
Meihou of Mizuchi and Prometheus. These arrows can seek out their target as long as they stay within the Teigu’s range or until coming into direct contact with their
intended mark, but the projectiles can also be stopped if their trajectory is
intercepted. This Teigu essentially gives anyone the ability to act as a competent
sniper, making it become known as the bow which never fails or, at least, never fails
when its target isn’t Esdeath."
147,,200,Prometheus,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"These dual pistols have the ability to cause the trajectory of
its bullets to twist and turn according to the user’s will and are capable of an array of
different forms of firing, effectively sharing its unique abilities with the Meihou of
Mizuchi and the L'Arc Qui Ne Faut. However, unlike the Teigu, the Shingu possesses
a limitation, as, when used many times in a row, its accuracy declines considerably,
making the timing of its uses critical in combat."
148,,200,Military Music Dream: Scream,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"A flute Teigu made to support troops and
weaken enemy groups, being capable of freely manipulating the emotions of those
who hear it using hypnosis. Its emotional manipulation can be used in many ways,
like raising morale on the battlefield or decreasing willpower to make all people who
hear it lose energy, however, its effects can be countered by experiencing pain due
to it breaking the hypnosis. Even when using its music is out of option, its user won’t
be completely out of other options, as the Teigu can be used as a blunt weapon by
splitting it into two different parts.
Lastly, the trump card of Scream, the Advent of Fierce God, is a form of
self-induced hypnosis which serves to increase the user's muscle mass and
strength, as well as dramatically bolstering one's combat ability, by releasing a
melody from the Teigu. Its effects are comparable to the physical enhancement
granted by the Balzac, as both release the user’s physical limiters, however, this
ability is more exhausting and can’t be used too often."

eastern seas after the civil war, Shamshir is a curved-blade Teigu that is capable of
creating razor-sharp air currents with each swing of its blade via movement
pressure. These aerial blades can be very destructive and capable of ripping people
apart with ease at their peak of strength, however, their power is dependent on the
lunar cycle (and on the existence of at least one Moon-like natural satellite in other
worlds other than Earth), being at their strongest during the full moon and at their
weakest during the new moon."
150,,200,Double Bladed Axe: Belvaac,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"This double-edged axe Teigu contains a
tremendous amount of offensive power and that can only be wielded by someone
with a very high level of strength due to its weight. Furthermore, Belvaac can be
separated into two axes that can be thrown and, similarly to the L'Arc Qui Ne Faut’s
arrows, will pursue a chosen target until they hit or are intercepted. Additionally,
anyone can carry it without needing to worry about suffering any of the possible side
effects from incompatibility as long as they didn't use it as a weapon or Teigu."
151,,200,Blood Collection: Absordex,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"This accursed and particularly cruel Teigu,
Absordex, takes the shape of teeth or fangs that are fixed on the user’s mouth, which
can be used to bite enemies in order to drain their blood and consequently kill them.
The victims' bodies shrivel up, becoming mummified in the process, while the user's
strength and regenerative abilities will become enhanced after absorbing their blood.
However, keep in mind that these enhancements after consuming someone’s blood
won’t be too significant, as this Teigu's current user, Dorothea, has several body
modifications that further enhances Absordex’s effects. Lastly, a curiosity: the taste
of the blood drained by Absordex varies depending on the victims: with the blood of
someone at the peak of their health containing the highest amount of nutritional
value while a normal death row inmate's blood will possess a small amount of taste."
152,,200,Unnamed Teigu: Trap Teigu,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Normally wielded by the Imperial Palace’s
elite bodyguards, this unnamed Teigu in the form of a bracelet is pretty peculiar,
having the ability to create and arm traps on the floor/walls/ceiling, as well as
remotely activate them by pressing its panel buttons. Some of its traps release
multiple bouncy balls, multiple spears from the ground or even release multiple
arrows, which then release a poison gas. There might be more types of traps but it
needs experimentation to discover them. Furthermore, creating a trap takes time and
preparation, so the user can’t create and arm new traps in the middle of the combat,
needing to rely on the ones they previously prepared."
153,,200,Crushing King,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"This arm-brace/gauntlet Shingu have the property of
granting superhuman strength to its user, making even an average human capable
of crushing boulders and bending metal with ease, but, in addition to the immense
strain it puts on its users due to being a Shingu, it can also damage its own user if
used improperly, so caution is advised when wielding such a weapon."
154,,200,The Complete Book of the World: Rongo Rongo,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Knowledge is
a form of power and this specific form of power is exactly the basis for this Teigu.
The book-type Teigu, Rongo Rongo, contains the greatest collection of knowledge
regarding this world, possessing every single map in the world, with the information
about the Empire's territories being especially detailed and including every detail
about its mountains and lands, as well as also contains extensive information
regarding every continent and country, allowing someone to study and learn each
nation’s native culture and language using this information for example. It even
contains some information regarding the Teigu themselves, from their abilities to their
origins. Additionally, its “trump card” is located on its last page, where there is a
prediction of large scale natural disasters that will happen in the future years.
Furthermore, its pages can alter their content as needed, allowing the book to
expose a virtually unlimited amount of knowledge in a limited amount of pages. and,
as it’s still a Teigu despite being a book, it’s probably only readable for those that are
compatible with it. For 200 CP, you’ll receive a replica of the Rongo Rongo with these exact abilities
and wealth of knowledge, however, if you prefer, for 400 CP instead, you’ll receive
an enhanced version of the book, one that updates itself to add similar information
regarding each future world you visit."
155,,200,Broken Spear,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Magitek,"A spear head and a small shaft, modelled after the broken Spear of
Leonidas. When wielded, this artifact alters the users perception of time, allowing them to speed
up their perceptions to make the world seem like it is moving in slow-motion. They can also gain
a bit of precognition, gaining flashes of events that will be happening in the near future or
impressions about the actions someone is about to take. This weapon possesses a small pool
of energy that can be drawn on to enhance the user’s abilities and reactions, and it is possible
that one could figure out how to repair and improve this artifact, and could potentially unlock
greater powers."
156,,200,Amplify Charges,Worm CYOA v17,Magitek,"Any object you touch can be imbued with Charges. The amount of Charges they possess is dictated by the quality of the object. Amplified objects will take an entire day to recover all of their charges. A basic gun can possess a single charge, while a Tinker device can possess even more. A single charge doubles the quality and damage of the object and spending another charge will double it again. A single charge lasts 10 seconds but doubles every additional charge spent."
157,,200,Caja Negacion,Bleach,Magitek,"Negación, a technique able to be employed by Hollows when needing to protect and extract allies
from other dimensions. While appearing to be a barrier with a tractor beam effect, in actuality it is a
technique that isolates the target within another dimension, causing the external field to be
unbreakable. After analyzing the technique, Aizen Sosuke was able to construct the Caja Negación, small black cubes given to his Espada which simulate the technique. Caja Negación were intended as
punishment devices, allowing the Espada to banish their subordinates to a spontaneous prison
dimension forever after it as placed in their Hollow Hole. Anyone of significant spiritual energy or
strength will simply cause the dimension to erode, releasing them eventually. You are given three
Caja Negación, any expended coming back within several days. In future worlds, this will have similar
effects on anyone you can force the cube inside of. "
158,,200,Senren,Bakusatsu Taiho,Magitek,"Special weapon of the artificial soul Ururu Tsumugiya, and also known as the Thousand Soul-Killing
Cannon. It has a long, round appearance completely concealed by a heavy coating of cloth
wrappings, with one end open and revealing a dark interior. The weapon has eight barrels and
operates like a shoulder stabilized, rapid rate of fire rocket launcher that is able to kill minor hollows
in large numbers, and threaten enemies up to the level of seated Shinigami officers. In addition to its
rocket launcher function, it can also project its cloth wrapping as an extremely resilient binding. "
159,,200,Anti-Hierro Armor,Bleach,Magitek,"Hierro, an innate ability of Arrancar and other upper level Hollows, giving them incredible resilience. To combat this ability, Urahara developed a set of gauntlets and boots for use by those proficient in
Hakuda. The melee attacks of a Shinigami equipped with these will have penetrative properties, allowing them to far more easily break or otherwise punch through Hierro and other defensive
abilities. The armor is also incredibly resilient, and cushion’s the wearer’s limbs, allowing them to
more easily throw their full power into each strike. In an emergency, the Anti-Hierro Armor will act
as ablative armor, able to absorb an overwhelming attack that could shatter them while leaving the
limbs underneath practically untouched. "
160,,200,Space-Time Gate,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Magitek,"You receive a copy of the scientific ninja tool created by
Amado to serve as an instant transport between Kara’s bases scattered in numerous
locations on Earth, as well as the organization’s main hideout located on a separated
dimension. This scientific ninja tool is a network of around twenty gates that can
open portals to the other connected gates, even through different dimensions,
allowing even large objects to be transported through them. The gates require an
energy source to work, regardless if said source is chakra, electricity or both. In
addition to the gates being fiat-backed, you also receive the blueprints to build more
of these gates or modify them as your heart wishes to."
161,,200,Shinobi-Ware,Naruto,Magitek,"Otherwise known as Integrated Mechanical Ninja Tools, Shinobi-Ware are scientific ninja tools developed as prosthetics for civilians and Ninja alike. Currently, these types of tools are not even an idea which is why it’s so puzzling that you know how to make them, or to be more precise you know how to make microscopic tools that can modify a person's circulatory and nervous system. The tools you can make are revolutionary in that you can alter an organism down to the cellular level, turn people into living weapons, or completely restructure their bodily systems."
162,,200,Baby Behemoth ,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"A baby behemoth, about the size of an adolescent human boy. It’ll grow for sure...and that crest on its head really seems like a sharp knife. Well...hopefully you treat it right, and it grows up to be nice and friendly?"
163,,200,Antimatter Manipulation Principle,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"You understand the science at work behind Cocoon’s technology. You may not have the equipment to reproduce it, but you can manipulate gravity to a limited degree even without it – enough to save you from falls. 

With the suitable tools however, you could make all sorts of equipment and mechanical wonders, even up to graviton cores that can maintain giant aerial defence platforms."
164,,200,Defence Manadrive ,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"The higher ups gave you a manadrive, which you saw fit to attach with defensive spells. This manadrive allows you to attach up to intermediate level defensive spells – it will cast them autonomously freeing you up to do something else. 

It also has smart targeting that you can program into it. It won’t add effects the spell does not already have."
165,,200,Assault Manadrive,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"The higher ups gave you a manadrive, which you saw fit to attach with offensive spells. This manadrive allows you to attach up to intermediate level offensive spells – it will cast them autonomously freeing you up to do something else.

You can designate its targeting systems appropriate to the spell. It won’t add effects the spell does not already have."
166,,200,Doomstones ,Marvel Zombies,Magitek,"Even when the world as we know it comes to an end, there are still power grabs. These magitech necklaces, heavily resembling collars, are the work of Earth-11080’s Doctor Doom. If you need a reminder, that’s the Earth with the crazy cannibals. Well, long story short, Doctor Doom had a plan. He came to the remaining Avengers with what seemed to be a cure, a plan to create a sanctuary in New York by exterminating all the cannibals. These stones, a blend of alchemy and science, were meant to stabilize the infected and keep them from turning. Spoiler alert: Doom was lying. He was already infected, and the stones allowed the cannibals to keep their memories and intelligence. Doom could also remotely turn anyone wearing one into a cannibal and control them as his thralls. Go figure. You have a shipment of ten thousand Doomstones and the means to create more."
167,,200,Bishop ,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"An automated set of battle drones, which will repeat a single command you dictate to it. It cannot do things that are physically impossible for it; such as casting magick without some sort of magick core. 

You can have up to three out at once. If you took Gambit, Gambits can be applied to them. If you took Nethicite Synthesis, you’ll be able to make them cores to cast magic. You are naturally capable of installing technological upgrades to them. If destroyed, you’ll have to repair them.

If you find it a pain to keep repair them, you can build a massive army of these, but fielding them will still be limited to three at once. You may have the rest perform simple tasks, such as “Sweep the Floor” or “Move Between Point A and B”, but they are incapable of fighting."
168,,200,My Personal Airship,Final Fantasy XI,Magitek,"A large Airship of the kind typically found in Jeuno, and its all yours. This airship can take off and fly from any area with a lake or river of sufficient size (generally a football field size body of water is enough), This airship seem to run off of some form of magitech and is powered by elemental crystals, though you never need worry that the batteries will run out."
169,,200,"PROTOTYPE Β, THE AIRSHIP “DELISLE” ",Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"A prototype airship that’s been sitting in the drydock for goodness knows how long! It’s not as big as Cid’s next airship, the Celsius, but it’s got room to fit 8 people, and comes with a default autopilot mode. A bit lacking as far as weapons go though...it’s only got six missile pods...but you won’t have to worry about ammunition, the Al Bhed have figured out a way to create missiles out of energy! With this, you could call in an air strike whenever...but don’t go around destroying Spira yeah? Flies from Bevelle to Besaid in half a day."
170,,200,DRESS GRID [MP] VARIATION,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"A template garment grid, from another time, another age – it would seem that this was designed such that anyone could easily come to understand the workings of dress spheres. You could call it a “learner’s garment grid” – as it can teach the abilities of spheres placed inside to whoever wields it.

Naturally, you’ll have to find or craft the spheres by yourself – but it might be handy just to pass this around and help your companions grow their repertoire. That being said, it is quite slow...so it might be best to utilize this as training wheels than a full teaching program."
171,,200,GARMENT GRID [FF] VARIATION,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"A Garment Grid not intended for beginners – while the overall intention of the grid to facilitate and amplify the effect of dress spheres remains the same, this garment grid takes that idea to an extreme. The use of the grid itself allows anyone to use the single dress sphere slotted inside, but while active it locks out other abilities the bearer may possess. In return, the effects and capabilities of the dress sphere are enhanced threefold, stacking upon any existing effects the bearer may have.

An all or nothing mindset stands behind this garment grid; it will do you well to remember that should you choose to utilize this."
172,,200,A Legacy of Innovation,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"The Al Bhed have a long history – spanning back to a time when their name was not even Al Bhed to begin with, but all throughout, they have been on the forefront of development, out of necessity rather than convenience. If there’s a task to be done, you can adapt Machina to do it – not that it’ll be effective for the job or efficient, but at least you’ll get an extra pair of helping hands. That has to count for something right?

Ah, right, you do have to assemble it yourself, but no worries, you’ll get quicker at assembling Machina with all the practice you’ll get, of that I’m certain."
173,,200,Mechanical Mixtures,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Mixing potions is a pretty common feat; any kid can take two potions and pour them in the same container. But as an Al Bhed, you can mix machina together – though you might want to be careful what you decide to combine. Typically combining the same machines together will only add extra parts – and machines of different types won’t hybridize very well, it is best not to expect the result to have all the functions of both machines combined."
174,,200,Give it a Good Knock,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Machina are built to last – and they’re also built to function, so when they don’t, they’re effectively rendered useless. There’s no sense in keeping a broken piece of junk around, so why don’t you give it a hard whack and see if it’ll come to its senses? Even if a machine is out of juice and malfunction, with a forceful application of physical trauma or magic, you can restart it again – but this will cut the machine’s remaining operating time by a bit."
175,,200,All-Purpose Scroll,The Games We Play,Magitek,"This is pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. A marvel of technology, this is
perhaps one of the most advanced Scrolls in the world, if not the most advanced. To
begin with it does pretty much anything any other scroll in this world can do.
It also has a constant, unbreakable connection to the internet at all times, the ability
to display not just your Aura but all your powers in the same way, and pretty much
everything you would have a 21st-century smartphone to possess on top.
In future worlds you retain a connection to this world’s internet as well as those of all
worlds you go to, but all connections other than that to your current world’s internet
become read-only, with no capacity to post or upload anything."
176,,200,Watts Rings,RWBY,Magitek,"These 10 Rings were developed with much effort by the (supposedly deceased) Arthur Watts. They allow a brilliant mind to access and hack into any technology as well as use them remotely. They are also able to create hard light dust shields, which can be misused into making a trap of sorts which can completely destroy someones arm if they were to pull the trapped limb out."
177,,200,Bumblebee,RWBY,Magitek,"Perhaps not literally the same bike that is driven by a certain Brawler but it is still yours. You have a motorcycle to call your own, by your own designs and running on constantly replenishing supply of Dust. It will never need maintenance but doesn’t resist you working on it or any advancements made to it."
178,,200,Weapon Engineer,RWBY,Magitek,"This is a World where everyone seems to have a Weapon of some kind. I mean... a 15 year old with a Gun Scythe? Equal parts awesome and insane. In case you want to be able to do the same, this is the Perk for you. You are able to develop special weapons that run on RWBY logic, capable of transforming within a second into different forms. Everything from Shot Gun Gauntlets to Dust Rapiers or even something like a Skateboard that is ALSO A GUN can be made by you, alongside the knowhow to do maintenance on them. This also extends to things like Prosthetics."
179,,200,Genome Synthesis – Z,Final Fantasy IX,Magitek,"Genome Synthesis – presumably what created you, in hopes of creating a “Perfect Genome”. You don’t know how far you are away from that objective, but you are what you are – if the original Creator wants to comment, you figure he can do it directly in your face. You figure though...that with what notes you’ve found, you should continue the chain.

The Genomes you can create aren’t mature by any means. They seem to be children of various appearances and personalities. But they feel alive and sapient, though on the latter you can’t say for sure. They probably won’t be fighters anytime soon, but given their personalities, you can guess several of them could at least become excellent negotiators.

Beware, as the creation of these dummies requires an equivalent exchange physically speaking. You might find that without dedicated resources, it may well be hard to procure parts for a Genome."
180,,200,Genome Synthesis – K,Final Fantasy IX,Magitek,"The ancient skill of creating Genomes, of which the creator remains anonymous, presumably lost in the chaotic turbulence of time. Yet the records of the ancient technology remain, preserved by nameless adventurers and explorers alike.

The Genomes created with this method appear to be consistently male humans, physically mature yet mentally warped and wholly arrogant. They don’t seem to experience a very wide range of emotions, and they spend their days following vicious pursuits. They’re rather capable both physically and mentally – though they have a bad tendency to look down on those around them.

Beware, as the creation of these dummies requires an equivalent exchange physically speaking. You might find that without dedicated resources, it may well be hard to procure parts for a Genome."
181,,200,Mana Detector Machine,Solo Leveling,Magitek,"Made using the magic core of a high-ranking magical beast, this apparatus is typically used by the Hunter Associations to measure the power of individuals and gates. You now have in your possession one of the finest versions of these machines, the kind that only Hunter Associations and some governments have access to, and only having a few of them. It is capable of measuring mana signatures of any range of mana aura, even from a ‘safe’ distance of a couple of dozen meters. It’s hard to conceal oneself from one of these, but extremely powerful beings may be able to accomplish it."
182,,200,Magi Mari!,Fate/Grand Order,Magitek,"A cute little app with a very friendly anime girl named Mari serving as the avatar for the app. Usable on phone or computer, Mari’s always ready with a compliment, bit of advice or just a fun chat on the side. For a computer program, she’s awfully adaptable and able to carry on a conversation, along with being very supportive. There’s no way that she could actually be an old magician toying with you. Nu-uh. Just ignore the oddly prescient and useful bits of advice Mari sometimes gives you on your current situation, that just happen to point you towards what you need or what will help you in your current dilemma. Just a coincidence. "
183,,200,The Love of Lightning,Fate/Grand Order,Magitek,"Steam Power! Coal! Electricity! The Nuclear Age! All the greatest revolutionaries have brought new power with them, their obsessions letting them take great bounds over the opposition to advance all of humanity. You share that same potential with one form of technological power, greatly advancing your skill and potential when dealing with technology that uses it. It could be electricity powered tech, steam powered tech or even wind powered tech. Whatever you choose, you’ll be able to make them much stronger, much more efficient and much cheaper than you normally could. Not all energies are exactly equal however, so you may still find yourself needing more resources than normal, though you’d still get the increased power and efficiency. "
184,,200,Test Run,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Fixers can’t just go charging into their work without proper equipment, those who do are usually taught their lesson quickly and painfully. Thankfully, you aren’t as short-sighted and decided to invest in your future survival by paying a visit to a nearby Workshop(check Notes for known workshops, feel free to make up more) and get some shopping done. Either get a new weapon or another piece of equipment from a Workshop of your choice or import one to be upgraded with the Workshop’s specialty, the more you are willing to pay for a better product. 200CP gets you something suitable for about a grade 5 Fixer, but the more Ahn you throw at them and the more Workshops you convince to cooperate on it the better the product will be."
185,,200,Teleportation Device,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"W Corp’s singularity is teleportation, though not the current W Corp’s even though they use it constantly. Instead, the technology was pioneered by a previous version of the Wing, which brings its user through dimensions to travel massive distances in normal space, even working between extradimensional spaces. Yours doesn't work like that, these are the commercially available versions that aren’t putting the singularity to its full capabilities, so you are only capable of setting a point in space relative to an object of choice(the planet as default) and then sending you there at will. If the recorded point is currently occupied by something, then it will just do nothing, but you can override this safety feature and teleport you onto something, which will tear both of you apart at the atomic level so, try not to do that unless you definitely can survive that. The device also activates automatically when you are near death, either in combat or by some other way, regardless if teleporting would help or not. The only way to stop this feature is to turn it off completely."
186,,200,Ammo Supply,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Bullets are expensive, especially if you want to get anything fancy or higher calibers. So just make your own bullets right? Well, that would mean going through the expensive bureaucratic mire that the Workshops need to, then there’s the problem of actually making it. Thankfully you managed to get your hands on a supply of ammo, not just any bullets though, but some that were a part of a singularity experiment by the previous W Corp so now they come with small devices that when attached to a gun, teleport ammo into it directly from wherever the bullets are. Also included is a manual on how to make custom ammunition similar to what the Thumb makes, notably there are incendiary, cryogenic, and armor-piercing rounds but you can probably figure out how to make other types using similar methods."
187,,200,Samurai Automatons,Bibliomania,Magitek,"This is your own personal army of automatons that are designed to look similar to samurai’s though these things are a little more dangerous. You have 10,000 of these things that follow you every while flawlessly. Effectively all of these are an interconnected hive mind that can plan and work together flawlessly to achieve any goal of the user but that's not the only thing that makes this a powerful option. Each and every one of them is an excellent cook, cleaner, butler, repair man, mason, carpenter and craftsman to master levels and due to how the hivemind works multiple bodies can work on the same task enhancing efficiency many times higher than should be possible. Each and every one is as durable as steel even without the armor, always has a katana sheathed on them when not in use, a shocking level of dexterity, speed, agility and strength that each one could single handedly face off against an group of 5 exceptional samurai’s and slaughter them all. You can upgrade them and all you need to do is present any single body the tech you want to enhance them with and it will absorb it and integrate it with all their bodies without changing their looks. They will initially look like the samurai automatons from the book but you can ask them to change to any designs and the only stipulation is that no matter what they will still look like automatons. So if you want samurai Freedy Fazbear defending you you can."
188,,200,World of Robotics,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Magitek,"Shinra commands a world of metal and industry, all with the help of engineers like you. Whether your boss calls for a flying drone that can project his holographic face, or razor-covered murder ball to chase his enemies down the highway, you have the know-how to deliver the goods. You might need some help to build something as grand as the mighty Airbuster, but with the right resources you could create some incredible machines."
189,,200,Coin Launcher        ,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Magitek,"A special arcade machine, which allows you to acquire both Collectible Trophies and the special
Stickers found in this world. 

In order to use the machine, you must first insert currency. The machine will accept any form of currency, but note that any currency insert will be consumed and cannot be retrieved. Whenever currency is inserted, an equivalent amount of ‘coins’ will be added and the game can be played.

The game itself is a shooting game. You control a launcher at the bottom of the screen that fires coins. Collectible Trophies and various enemy types will appear. Collectible Trophies travel across the screen before disappearing. If they are shot two to four times they will also disappear, and the Collectible Trophy represented will be dispensed by the machine. Enemies appear in waves and will attempt to damage the player’s launcher. Destroying entire waves of enemies can award the player with additional coins, occasionally causes the machine to dispense some Stickers, and will increase the chance for rarer Collectible Trophies to appear for a short period of time. Additionally, destroying individual enemies will slowly fill a special meter. Filling the meter completely will cause the launcher to power up and fire at a faster rate for a short period of time. Getting hit by the enemies will cause the meter to decrease, and will also remove coins from your pool. You can stop playing at any time, and running out of coins will force your game to end.

During this jump, the machine will only dispense Collectible Trophies and Stickers that could be acquired in the Coin Launcher segment of Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Post-jump, any Collectible Trophy or Sticker that appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl can be found. Additionally, post-jump, the Coin Launcher will add a handful of new Collectible Trophies and Stickers for each new jump you visit, based on important characters from that setting. It will also retroactively do this for jumps you had visited prior to this one.

Should your Coin Launcher be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
190,,200,Robo-Daughter,Miraculous Ladybug,Magitek,"While sentient robots do exist in this world, nothing is quite to the technological prowess of Aeon, the android daughter of Majestia in New York City. You now have an android who is similarly grateful to you and looks up to you for guidance. This child of yours has any physical appearance you choose as long as it is humanoid. You can also choose some base values and one or two traits for them but most of their personality will be built based on how you treat them over time. They have the Android Perk (obviously) which can be optionally at either 500 or 600 CP level (at no extra cost). They get 1000 CP to spend in this Jump. However, they do not get an Origin, they cannot buy Items (besides Miraculous), they cannot get Companions (obviously), nor can they buy Superpowers or Kwami Form. Also Mundane Talents and Surprisingly Skilled Teenage Fighters are discounted for them (to 50 CP and 100 CP respectively)."
191,,200,Jumpermaru,Jujutsu Kaisen,Magitek,"A cursed corpse that takes the form of a mechanical humanoid made of brown-painted metal with green eyes, standing at roughly the height of an adult man. Strong and durable enough to take on a decently powerful cursed spirit on its own, it also happens to be outfitted with a number of weapons powered by its cursed energy. Retractable bladed claws in its hands which can be formed into a drill by rapidly rotating its arm, jet boosters in the back of the elbows for bursts of speed and short- term flight, palms that can emit beams of cursed energy, and even a cannon in its mouth that can shoot out a powerful blast.

All it would take to get it running in supplying it with some of your cursed energy, ensuring it will follow your every command for as long as its reserves don’t run out – which, despite its flashy attacks, are surprisingly efficient in their usage. If you’d prefer you could also control it more directly, sharing its senses and controlling its movements as if it were part of your own body, even out to a distance of hundreds of metres away."
192,,200,Cybernetics,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"Need a replacement arm? Maybe a bionic eye? No? Well, don’t matter, now you have spare parts in case you ever need it. Comes with a little cab that can place the cybernetics in place in case you’re not really sure how substituting a piece of a body works."
193,,200,Augment ,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"Never stop to improve! Every time you successfully improve any form of technology you possess, it also improves its offensive power, even if the upgrade wasn’t aimed to improve direct combat."
194,,200,Cosmo Maana        ,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"A top of the line starship! Your very own darling cruiser! It might look like ridiculous junk, like someone stapled a giant bow to a small junker, but it really is quite quick! Though your new ship needn’t look exactly like Space Ishtar’s Maana, you can be assured that it’ll probably be fairly silly to see. 

But that silly sight won’t change that you have a speedy thing on your hands. The ship can jet between worlds in a few hours most of the time or warp between systems with each use of the warp drive. Both engine and warp drive are powered by Artorium normally but any sort of magically charged object can be thrown in to provide fuel, particularly space gems. Especially potent materials can supercharge the ship for a time, greatly increasing thrust and shields. Even if you run out, the ship cannards allow sailing on the ether winds through the space sky. 

While the weaponry is basic and the armor is light, because armor makes ships not cute, the vessel has a few useful facilities on board. A large cargo hold with some nice smuggling spaces, space for a half dozen people to live comfortably, sleeping pods that let you control your own dreams and a built in AI known as Talkie who can explain not just all the functions of the ship but knows a surprising amount about the universe around you."
195,,200,Midwest Space Mechanic,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"It might look like some little lady’s first rocketship but underneath that bright paint is a real cosmic workhouse, courtesy of yourself. A junkyard ace able to tune up any space-age tech with some spare bolts and an afternoon, you’re a remarkable mechanic. While you have little experience with the sort of crude devices used in the 21st century, anything from the cosmic age you’re in now is pretty easy to maintain and repair. You’re a deft hand at making it work better too, if you have some good materials or tools, and you’re great at working without needing to take everything apart first. No need to dock your ships, you can do upgrades to pass the time on those long journeys. Even with some poorer components, like what misery young divinities might give to conserve their jewel treasury, you can make machines run far longer than they have any right to."
196,,200,Made In Space China,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"Now, just wait a second there. You don’t smell like a Servant at all. Way too much engine oil and WD40 going on here. It turns out, instead of being a Servant, you’re actually a machine. A fully artificial robot who somehow simulates every cool power and exciting bit of magic through pure technological means. While you do lose out on the benefits of being a Servant in some ways, like the benefits of being a physical soul, being a machine comes with it’s own perks. You’re fully aware of your own design and how to maintain yourself, including all the incredible things your technology can achieve. With enough resources, you might even build more like yourself. Maybe it’s that efficient programming but whenever you’re put in a teaching position, you also find quite the knack for it. Education comes naturally to robots it seems, especially if it’s heavily regimented and comes with lots and lots of homework."
197,,200,MANTIS Laboratory,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"This is the original laboratory used by Dr. MEI and Mobius to initiate Project Soldier. It contains all of their research notes, and all of the tools necessary in order to create MANTISes, including thousands of different vials containing samples of synthesized Emperor-Class Honkai Beast DNA with various hypothetical statements on what each vial would grant to the one infused with them. These statements are oddly accurate, in a twisted way, as all MANTISes created in this lab always gain one variation of what is written in the vial analysis, no matter what."
198,,200,Multifunctional Gauntlet,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"You have a personalized multitool-toolbox. A device that looks how you want, and can be kept on your person at all times. It’s somewhat bulky, so it is something you need to wear, rather than pocket – but in exchange, at the spur of the moment, it can do any job you need of it in terms of machinery – everything from a screwdriver, hammer, wrench, or even a blowtorch can be called upon with naught but a moment’s notice from within it."
199,,200,Recruit Logbook ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"As a captain, you’ll need to get your hands on all sorts of people to man things under you, engineers, strong fighters, pilots, the works. Even something as simple as maid service needs to be taken care of sometimes. To that end, you have a handy holotablet. You get a list of people in this world who would be willing to work for you and what skills they have, as well as their price. Sorted as you desire, of course. As for the price, sometimes it’s money, sometimes it’s favors, or protection. And sometimes, it’s these weird blue crystals. For the most part, you can trust their loyalty as long as you keep paying them, though you might want to keep an eye on that pink eyed maid who is always available..."
200,,200,Motorcycle,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"You're probably thinking this motorcycle sounds rather expensive, and you’d be right! It’s no Usagi Kinetic, but it certainly goes very fast. Not just that, but if you can infuse it with energy, it can even drive on water or up vertical surfaces. It also is not only self-repairing, but if you lose it, it will find its way back to you in less than a day, and if you somehow manage to irreparably destroy it, you’ll get a new one in the next week or so. You’ll also find it to be surprisingly durable, if you have the skills for Bike-Fu."
201,,200,Reverse-Engineering,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"Don’t get me wrong, when you’re doing things on your own, your own stuff seems awesome. But then you put them out in the field and then you realize your enemy has even more awesome stuff. That’s not exactly great on the ego, now, is it?

For you, though, you just sit back and watch, because you can at the very least figure out how some of your enemy’s tech works just by visual attention, perhaps allowing you to make a bootleg of your own. Where your talent really lies, though, is having an example of it or some blueprints right in your hands.

Then the ideas really start flowing off, and you can’t just seem to find an end to your groove like this. It might even be enough to downright improve on the designs in ways the original couldn’t or didn’t figure out yet."
202,,200,Claw Armour,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"The core armour used by the Executioners of the Claw. The armour encases the entire head and left arm of the body, with massive claws extending out from the hands as expected. Attached to the arm are three vials containing liquids of red, green or blue. These vials, when injected have varying effects: The green vial forces the body to quickly heal itself, the red amplifies strength and force, and the blue vial allows short leaps through space in order to teleport. Injecting all three at once not only combines their effects but multiplies them, enabling the user to outright cause dimensional tears as they teleport and slash to devastating effect. The vials refill themselves over time and the arm provides safe dosages."
203,,200,Church of Gears Chair ,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"This bronze chair looks like a cross between a dentist's chair and an electric chair. It has two processes it can apply to anyone sitting restrained to the seat. The first shreds the body and rearranges it to become a sentient gear. The second modifies the body so it becomes a compatible host for the sentient gears. Sentient gears assist their hosts with calculations, keen observation and advice, essentially leading to people with the strength of multiple minds in one body. The chair needs no power and is capable of repairing itself. If you're tech-savvy, you might be able to implement other processes like installing prosthetics."
204,,200,Magitek Armor,Final Fantasy VI,Magitek,"The Gestahlian Empire’s latest weapon of war is truly a sight to behold. An armored behemoth that stomps across a battlefield on two legs, its face a deadly maw concealing a magitek cannon. The cannon can produce beams of elemental energy capable of destroying entire squads of traditional troops in a single blast. This model even conceals several missile banks and a system that converts the destructive energy into healing in case the pilot becomes injured. Tough as it is, the Magitek Armors are not invincible. Should yours meet an untimely end you will be given a new unit two weeks later."
205,,200,Invention Collection,Final Fantasy VI,Magitek,"Sometimes even genius needs a kick in the pants as inspiration. So have a few to get you started. The Auto Crossbow is exactly what it sounds like, an auto-loading, box-fed crossbow capable of spewing out several dozen bolts in very short order. The Flash is a massive lightbulb attached to an equally massive battery pack that is capable of temporarily blinding anyone you point it at. Finally, the Noiseblaster emits a sound that screws with the minds of monsters and people alike, temporarily confusing them with just a short blast. Make sure to wear earplugs with that one."
206,,200,Airship,Final Fantasy V,Magitek,"Built by a previous civilization, nonetheless the Airship is mechanical marvel to behold. Exceedingly fast, albeit slightly small, it zips around most worlds very quickly, and can even be converted into a submarine for undersea travel and exploration as well."
207,,200,​​-Cannoneer-,Final Fantasy V,Magitek,"Part engineer and park siege weapon specialist, this job is quite unique. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Cannoneer’s abilities, while Mastery will allow you to instantly know the angles and power required to hit a distant target. You’ll be killer at golf, too.

209,,200,Purification Vessel ,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This is a medium class ship in the fleets of Shikoku Trastrium, and you are it’s captain. It does not require a crew, but works better when fully staffed. It is armed with purification beams and a Mantra collection halo. It requires Mantra Level 3 to fly and 4 to engage in combat operations. Mantra can be directed to it by Transmitters or someone with the Mantra Foci Perk."
210,,200,Combat Mandala Array,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have a set of ornately carved spheres­ drones that can project sturdy energy fields, fire concussive mantra bursts, or fly out and slam into foes in time with your own close combat attacks. If destroyed, a new set appears in the Warehouse. They require Mantra Level 1 to function."
211,,200,Divine Ride,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This vehicle takes the form of a motorcycle or similar two-­person transport device. It’s construction is sublime and it is incredibly maneuverable. It requires ambient Level 2 Mantra to run, and Level 3 Mantra to travel into space or orbit from the planet’s surface."
212,,200,Mantra Fields and Firearms,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have the a specialized set of weapons and armor associated with your background. You know how to maintain them, and the knowledge of how to make more. Such weapons include demigod­-binding spears, orb weapon platforms for heavy armaments, and so on."
213,,200,Civilian Grade Locks and Fairies,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"F Corp and J Corp are polar opposites in the clearest sense. J Corp creates better locks, while F Corp’s Fairies exist to pick locks. The highest grades of both stretch the act of ‘locking’ and ‘unlocking’ to more abstract degrees, but those available for civilian use are all you need to be concerned with at present, as civilian grade instances of both singularities are what you possess. Fairies are glimmering sparks that insert themselves into keyholes or door hinges, rapidly loosening their mechanisms to allow you entry. J Corp locks are simply that, locks. Albeit most are more resistant to conventional lockpicking or poorly used fairies when compared to their mundane brethren. However these locks can be placed on the brains and bodies of human beings to prevent disclosure of information or dissection. So long as the lock holds that is. Reinforce your security or breach that of others, just don’t limit yourself to only doing one. 

You get one of each each week."
214,,200,Dollar Store Firearms,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Firearms are both extraordinarily regulated and incredibly useful. Heavy taxes and inane regulations keep guns out of the hands of most, especially since highly skilled opponents can dodge around bullets with ease, but the convenience of being able to mow down groups of thugs in a street is alluring indeed. Some think that’s why the Head regulates them so much, since they hardly care about preserving life, but show a strange sort of ritualism towards the everyday act of taking it, in that killing shouldn’t be too trivial or insignificant. With that in mind, know how lucky you are to have not one but two guns. One is a high powered rifle easily suited to long distance sniping, while the other is a sleek concealable pistol of standard caliber. The bullets themselves are on the level of Atelier Logic, are able to drop lightly augmented and decently dressed foes in a single shot. Don’t be wasteful with your ammunition, as you only have three magazines worth of bullets for each firearm. But at least they refill at the end of the week."
215,,200,Geared Up,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"A great deal of people see the City as a shackle upon their lives, and they’re not all that wrong. Yet even before the City grew out of the rocks like a cancer no one could be considered free. In the end, we all will follow a massive current unheeding of our own wills, and the cult of the gears are simply there to show the flow. Even if you’re not as deterministic as Eileen, you acknowledge that some must function as gears for the sake of others, thus you are familiar with the process of turning whole individuals into gears that when grafted to one’s form boost their capabilities. The average chaff of the world are turned into Meat Gears that enhance the wielder’s raw combat potential using the experiences of the gear’s former life. Rarely, an individual holds the potential to become a Thought Gear which, when used, drastically heightens reflexes and predictive capabilities. So long as you have space, you may wield as many gears as you can produce, their effects magnified with every addition; enough Meat Gears and you could become a truly frightening aberration, while a few Thought Gears could allow you to whisper commands into comparatively primitive machinery and have them heard. Of course, the process - at least for now - kills the gear to be in a rather gory fashion. But surely this is an acceptable sacrifice, as these gears can rest easily with the knowledge that they finally have a clear purpose. "
216,,200,Augment: Urban Plague,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Now if you’re willing to pay a bit more for your augments, or have ties with those who might make them, we can get you something a bit more special. All of the effects of the prior tier are significantly improved, legs able to do great leaps, arms that never tire despite swinging swords the same size as yourself, and camera eyes that replicate the full function of human ones, along with seeing into UV, infrared, and so on. More than that, now your augments come with a distinct gimmick to them. Perhaps they create sheathes of fire around your weapons to burn away at your foes, have assorted modes they can cycle through as needed in order to improve your performance in numerous minor ways, actively build up power in their internal engines to spur you on to greater heights the longer the battle lasts, or disable key muscle groups of your foes with carefully placed electrical shocks."
217,,200,Tempest – The Waifumaker,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"Here. I know you want it, no need to be shy. Heh. Exactly, this is a gender-swapping raygun, and it does exactly what you think it does. Comes with a varied array of options and settings, from temporal swap, to permanent, to changing the perspective of the victim. It can even alter their own and other’s memories to make the change retroactive. Incredibly powerful, but it can’t obviously affect beings without a gender."
218,,200,Hotel Californication,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"Despite the name, this ain’t a hotel, but a car. A special sports car made by Azazel. It has many weapons installed in it such as the Satellite Downfall Cannon System, and Dragon Destroy Missile, an Invisibility Mode and so on. The weapons regenerate as well as the car itself if it takes any damage, an unlikely thing given how resilient it is. Using this car will slightly boost your charisma."
219,,200,Red Fixer Gear,Lobotomy Corporation,Magitek,Heavy robotic armour with a single glowing red eye. The heavy armour comes with a red photon blade and is capable of firing huge energy beams capable of penetrating walls. Such devastating attacks are extremely taxing and require a resting period. Extremely durable to physical attacks.
220,,200,Godwalker(Tier 1),Godbound,Magitek,"A relic of ancient theotechnical research, godwalkers are an offshoot of the arts that forged the Made Gods. Once, these great war machines of polished steel and glowing sigils laid waste to the battlefields of the Former Empires. Few now remain in any kind of good condition-and the machine you now wield is an exception among exceptions. Operating by drawing divine sympathies between their shape, their function and their pilots each Godwalker has two key components: A chakra engine, the locus of its divine fire and the interface between its artifices and the celestial forces that power it which determines what manner of and how many divine components can be attached to it. And a sacred armature, the basic chassis of the godwalker which can provide different advantages through the symbolic principles it reifies-including vast transport space, integral flight ability or simple sturdy construction. A godwalker shaped like a vehicle is peerless in transporting its writers and destroying those who impede it’s path, while some experimental varieties were even designed as thrones or libraries.

As for the armaments of the godwalkers, it is no exaggeration to say their component can mimic many lesser Gifts on a scale greater than mankind. While some components simply permit a godwalker to emulate any Gift related to perception, communication, movement, transformation, creation, alteration, defence and protection or attacking and certain forms of harm including the universal smitings of Godbound centred on the great machine itself more unique abilities of a similar scale have also been created. Some examples are provided below:
- Anchor of the Holy Gate: The godwalker acts as the destination node of a teleportation gateway. After 24 hours of ritual purification that must be free of all blasphemous behaviour, with a day’s commitment of divine effort a godwalker can let in up to a hundred infantrymen’s worth of mass at a time to a designation location.
- Devourer of Armies: Torrents of lethal sacred energy blast from the godwalker, scorching entire battalions to death.
- Banner of Zeal: The godwalker ignites an invincible defence against any mental effect that would stop the pilot from attacking enemies, and bolsters the valor of nearby allies
- Force Projection Jewel: The godwalker strikes down targets with pinpoint precision, up to a mile
- Halo of Wrath: The godwalker sears nearby enemies with a penumbra of coruscating divine energies.
- Advance of the Iron Tide: So long as the godwalker moves in a straight line, they have an invincible defence against all hostile effects and can phase harmlessly through solid barriers. This invincibility can be maintained as long as it does nothing but keep moving forward until, presumably, it’s enemies are destroyed.
- Clavis of Night: After ten minutes to “load”, the godwalker punches a hole into Uncreated Night. It is advisable to first scout out the theurgic coordinates of your desired destination through which you can use the godwalker to arrive at over a week’s journey in exchange for bypassing the usual obstacles, lest you risk eternally wandering within the void.
- Kinetic Sump Vortex: The godwalker halves the movement rate and dampens the initiative of all nearby foes, though powerful ones may be able to resist it for a short while.
- Noble Path Generator: The godwalker generates solid footing regardless of the substance or lack thereof beneath it. Oceans and empty pits alike are no obstacle to its passage.
- Pious Construction Array: The godwalker’s capacity for fixing or building mundane structures and goods is enhanced, permitting it to do the work of hundreds of skilled craftsmen.
- Rainbow Bridge Emitter: The godwalker uses divine effort to summon a thirty-foot wide bridge between any two points in sight within 1000 feet of each other that shares it’s durability. The bridge permits travel no matter how steep it is, and users cannot be knocked off while they are alive.
- Reactive Adaption Unit: The godwalker wields divine effort to make it immune to a specific Gift or other power for a scene.
- Stiletto Sutra Projector: The resonances of a ruinous sacred text open gaping holes of nonbeing into a living being within 2000 feet. While highly effective, it is too inefficient to wield against entire armies and is ineffective on unliving targets.
- The Awl of Shifting Space: The godwalker can teleport at a distance up to twice its normal movement rate, to anywhere it can see or has formerly occupied. This teleportation leaves behind physical bindings or restraints, but not magical ones-at least of this world.
- Transmutation Field: With time and sacred mudras, the godwalker can transform large amounts of non-magical matter into another non-magical, non precious substance of equal mass. This ability generally takes 12 hours or so of labour.
- Polymorphic Shaping Core: The godwalker can alter its shape within its general dimensions, gaining a faster travel rate by land or sea by sprouting wheels or propellers for example. It can also stretch out it’s matter to form long ranged manipulators, or form into a defensive tank-like shape. While this component is not sophisticated enough to permit flight, it can shrink the entire godwalker down into something the size of a horse.
- Volley Negation Shield: When attacked by multiple strikes in rapid succession, only the first can strike the godwalker-and even then, if a foe dedicates it’s full focus on the great machine. The others automatically miss.
- Trump of Judgement: The godwalker launches a building-flattening sonic barrage out at everything within 200 feet, crumbling any non-magical solid construction to powder and dealing severe harm to all nearby living beings.
- Wingcutter Malediction: A beam of congealed curses strikes down airborne enemies, whether they come in flocks or as individuals. For some reason this weapon cannot be evaded by mundane means, but cannot be targeted at terrestrial foes.
- Wingjet Propulsion Unit: The godwalker can fly at its normal movement rate, including the ability to hover in place if present. This ability is not powerful enough to be equipped on the larger godwalkers.

For 200 CP you may own a godwalker sufficient for keeping several villages in line, such as the Made God Mirrored Panther’s Unblinking Jade Eye which boasts around 3- 4 components of unique purpose.

Last but not least, while normally godwalkers require a sophisticated theotechnical facility and a team of extremely well-trained engineers or a Godbound with the word Artifice to be properly maintained, through your investment here some mysterious benefactor has installed a Godwalker Repair Bay on any you buy here, fully functional without impacting other systems in defiance of conventional construction procedures. This set of tools permits the godwalker to perform a daily maintenance cycle on itself or another godwalker over the course of 6 hours of downtime-and in a pinch fully overhaul another godwalker or itself in a week, with no additional personnel or resources.

221,,200,The Guidance of Wards,Godbound,Magitek,"You have the blueprints to creating both Mundus and Empyrean Wards, theotechnological devices with which to stymie magic and divine energies. Mundus wards protect a region from the supernatural influence of Made Gods and other divinely-connected entities, including Godbound. They subtly drain away the celestial forces used by these entities, making it much more difficult to create long-term or large-scale changes in the area. Empyrean wards are a more powerful, restricted form of ward reserved for ancient strongholds and high-security buildings.

These wards actually negate the divine energies of a Wordbound creature, suppressing miracles and gifts and making it impossible for weaker Godbound to trigger their abilities. Every ward is built around a physical focus. In some cases this is a single specific object kept in some heavily-guarded place. It might be a sacred idol, a holy mandala, or an enigmatic machine churning away without visible effect. In other cases, the physical focus is more dispersed, taking the form of sanctified obelisks in the area, carvings embedded in local buildings, or buried anchors of sacred symbols at geomantically-important points. So long as this physical focus remains largely intact and inside the area covered by the ward, the ward will stay up. A ward's focus can handle a certain amount of damage and defacement before it starts to degrade"
222,,200,Reverse Magic Engineering,Gummi Bears,Magitek,"You can reverse engineer both magic and technological devices, especially things which blend the two together. It only takes a few minutes of study to figure out how a spell or a thing is built and how you can build it yourself."
223,,200,Atlantean Speeder ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"Purchasing this will give you the choice between two vehicles; the first is the Ketak, a fast Atlantean aircraft that might be considered the equivalent of a flying motorcycle, shaped like a fish, that can comfortably seat two people and fly faster than any other aerial vehicle available in this section. The second option is the Aktirak, shaped like a Hammerhead shark; if the Ketak is the equivalent of a motorcycle, then the Aktirak is more like a car. It’s not as fast as a result, but it can seat three or maybe even four people at once, assuming that they’re comfortable with sitting close to each other. "
224,,200,Automaton and Notes        ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Magitek,"You gain a timing cylinder that when wound will construct a single automation of your own design that is capable of following commands and will never be subverted or turned against you. This can look human in shape but still must be obviously made of metal, the timing cylinder is its weak point and as long as it is not destroyed it can rebuild itself when damaged."
225,,200,I However Am Real ,Marvel 2099,Magitek,"When most beings enter cyberspace it is only as a virtual reality avatar, their mind is there but they are not actually real. You, however, are different. You may enter cyberspace, VR, or simulated realities as yourself, forcing them to bend around the full nature and capabilities of your true self, able to use your powers and abilities even if they were not programmed into the simulation."
226,,200,Bionic and Mystic Perfection ,Marvel Cosmic,Magitek,"Why be stuck with your baseline body? All true rulers should tower over their soon to be subjects in form and mind. Much like the Mad Titan you have been massively enhanced on every level. Mystical protections, spells, and bindings, as well as cybernetic enhancements and genetic manipulation has turned you into the pinnacle of perfection. Your body is superior in every way to others of your species and even many other species through the cosmos."
227,,200,The Mystic and the Machine        ,Marvel Cosmic,Magitek,"The argument between mystics and technology is a faulty one. There is no need to choose one as they enhance and complement one another. Like a certain Mad Titan you have unlocked mastery of combining these two pathways to power. You can always find ways to combine any mystical knowledge you have with any scientific or technical knowledge. This differs from Fine line in that it is all about creating magitech. It also allows you to make a technological version of any magic you know, or a magical version of any technology you can build. All power sources between the two become cross compatible as well. Only fools choose one when they can have both."
228,,200,Badass Bike,Fate/Zero,Magitek,"The wide open road calls to you, whether in the pursuit of work as a gun for hire or just a simple desire for freedom, and you need a proper steed to travel along it. Provided for you will be a motorcycle, of any model and make available prior to 2004. It’ll never run out of fuel, or electricity if you’re the type to make it that way, nothing short of a tsunami or hurricane will make it slip or lose stability and any crashes that happen whilst riding it will never deal more than moderate injuries to you at worst. Your trusty companion will always be just out of sight too, in case you have need of it for a quick escape or chase. This can be imported into."
229,,200,"Work, Sweet Work",Arcane,Magitek,"What’s a scientist without a place to work? With this, you own a laboratory and workshop well-equipped for whatever crafts and sciences you know how to perform. If you’re a hextechnician you’ve got all the tools you need to build your inventions, and if you’re skilled in chemtech it’ll have all the beakers, bunsen burners and distillation towers you could want. This laboratory is also well-stocked with common materials and reagents for your (e.g. metals, basic chemicals etc), but rarer things will need to be found elsewhere."
230,,200,Magelock Load-out,Super Dragon Sword,Magitek,"You have access to a pair of Magelocks, enchanted pistols with customized bullets capable of mimicking any Element you can come across…though each individual shot is much weaker than any given Tier 1 elemental attack spell. Still, they’re worth utilizing, especially in combination with your Gadget Array."
231,,200,Queen,Super Dragon Sword,Magitek,"There are times where you simply must pull out all the stops. This is that time. You get access to a number of high power explosives capable of mimicking the Fire 2 spell in potency, as well as Tranquilizer rounds alongside grenades with the ability to inflict the Sleep and Slow status effects. You’re trained how to use these properly, including satchel charges and rocket launchers."
232,,200,Thaumic Overhaul,Super Dragon Sword,Magitek,"While Landships are powerful weapons, they have difficulty overcoming the defenses of entities such as gods, or resisting the attacks of the same. No more. You have enchanted every aspect of the Landship, allowing it to easily stay toe to toe with magical opponents. You even can produce elemental shells!

Requires Landship Engineer(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
233,,200,Barrage Training,Super Dragon Sword,Magitek,"That’s enough messing around with slow mortars. You’ve got work to do! You’ve not only learnt how to attach a rapid-fire turret as a sidearm for the Landship to use between loading shells, but you now know how to create “cluster” munitions that give a series of strikes against a group of enemies, rather than the singular blasts of the main cannon.

234,,200,Rider Machine,Super Dragon Sword,Magitek,"An iron steed of your own design, this motorcycle is capable of carrying you faster than any living creature and only slightly slower than an airship at full stern. It is durable, and you can reconstruct it if it is destroyed."
235,,200,Setup Wizard,Harry Potter,Magitek,You have a natural knack of melding technology and magic. You can easily jury-rig technology to work at Hogwarts. Your inventions could do considerable good for the magical world if they weren’t all such luddites.
236,,200,Bottle Gnomes,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"What are these cute little things doing here? These three small, bottle-shaped metal gnomes are filled with a deep blue liquid, capable of healing the non-critical wounds of the imbiber. Once drunk, the Bottle Gnomes seem to lose their animation, though they return 12 hours later, filled with drink- and energy- once more. They’re also rather durable."
237,,200,Mindcrank,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"A horrible needle-like instrument, which can be embedded into the head of a victim and slowly, painfully turned by its inbuilt motor, burning away the victim’s memories until their past is a complete blank, and leaving them in a highly suggestible state."
238,,200,Infect the Body,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"Glistening Oil, also known as Phyrexian oil or Ichor, the substance that corrupted the Father of Machines and gave birth to the glorious New Phyrexia, infecting its inhabitants and giving them the desire to compleat themselves- to replace the imperfections in their body with machines, and which you may now generate from your body in small amounts. The one you’ve picked up is not quite as insidious- at least not without you meddling with it- but it retains its ability to better enable the fusion of machinery and flesh when the patient is submerged in it. Make them perfect, Jumper. Note: Basically, submerging people in it makes it easier for their body to adapt to the merging or replacing of their body parts with machinery. It would take about a month to produce enough to submerge the average adult male."
239,,200,Golem Splicer,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"Not all the Phyrexians were made from compleated Mirrans- and not all in Phyrexia merits its own mind. You have picked up the art and science of creating robotic golems- though you start able to make simple, but durable, helpers, your knowledge is enough that you can begin to do your own research into improving them."
240,,200,Beneath My Iron Skin(200CP),MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"With the many Futurist advancements that have spread throughout the world, one of the most common ones takes the form of mechanical assistance. Metal arms and legs, to replace ones lost to accident or battle, are but the tip of this iceberg. Entirely mechanical suits of armor, known as mechs, mecha, or mechsuits depending on who you ask, are their newest addition to the art of war. To that end, I would offer you one of these - perhaps you seek a High-Speed Hoverbike that would make most Reckoner gangs blush in envy, or the Mobilizer Mech that the Futurists use to control several suits at once. Of course, something more impressive could also be what you seek?

For 200 cp, you may take something worth three to five mana, such as the Dragonfly Suit that has become a major part of the Imperials arial brigade, or the Brute Suits that certain Ninja clans make use of when they no longer wish to be subtle. A machine on par with the Genesis Engine is also possible, but would lack the bells and whistles buying it as an ordinary item would grant. "
241,,200,Mechanical Aide,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"In a civilization that is firmly split between constantly pushing for bigger and better technology and having none at all - and, specifically, as one of those pushing for more, it can be hard to fit your hands into all the tight spaces. Kami knows ordinary vehicles can be bad, can you imagine what trying to work on a mecha looks like? Luckily, you don’t have to, on account of someone having already invented a way around that particular problem. That’s why you now have a set of Circuit Menders, small insectoid constructs that are small enough to crawl around inside the tight spaces where hands don’t fit and do the maintenance for you. Remarkable little buggers, they can even run repairs on certain mechs mid-flight or mid-fight, though that does risk them getting crushed by all the moving parts. But hey, they’re a lot more replaceable than a full mecha is. "
242,,200,Armed And Rearmed ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"No small portion of the Asari is made up of former Imperial samurai - those who flunked out, were thrown out, threw themselves out, or were deemed unable to serve. The loss of a limb is a surprisingly common source of that last one, and there are many who wish they could have continued to serve even without it. They know better now, of course. In an attempt to solve that issue, the craftsmen of Sokenzanshi have created mechanical limbs, some of them meant to outright replace a missing arm or leg, and some of them grafted onto - or perhaps into? - a person in order to effectively grant them three arms. More than a few musicians have gone for something similar, making music with an additional pair of simple but dextrous arms to make twice as much noise as ever before. This may appeal to you more, if you don’t wish to be missing an arm for one reason or another. "
243,,200,Disassembled Mechsuits,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"The Dragonfly Suit is the cutting edge of Imperial technology, the latest and greatest that they can stand to have in their sights. This small collection of parts could, in theory, be assembled into one if you wished to do so. Or it could be assembled into something else entirely. Rather than a supply of materials, this item takes the form of a number of abandoned parts, limbs, hardware and software components, taken from a dozen different projects and supplied to you on a regular basis. It’s very much the chaff of what could be given to you, but even broken down the parts here are still far more advanced than the Imperials would be comfortable with. Especially the ones that came from the good stuff, not just a student's failed project. All you really need to do is match tab q to slot z and try to make a masterpiece. If you fail, well, it was already garbage. If you succeed? Then you’ll likely have a frame that surpasses anything the Imperial Army has. "
244,,200,Filigree Cybernetics ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Magitek,"This is a prosthetic made of the magical alloy Etherium. Etherium has the unique functionality of being able to replace the physical functions of the body through a series of complex enchantments. On Esper it was seen as a necessary part of one’s life to replace parts of their body with Etherium thus enhancing their durability and mana capacity. This is either an arm or a leg weighing in at ten rods of etherium which is much more than the average Etherium Prosthetic. Depending on whether it is an arm or a leg it will grant you either enhanced dexterity or agility respectively. As it is effectively an artifact it should be easier to manipulate and enchant further with magic than the body. Not only that but it has some innate technological feature such as fingers that can be fired off like bullets that return to the prosthetic or mana propelled rockets. Lastly, such a prosthetic is especially easy to modify technologically and is extremely accepting of upgrades such that you might be able to add a completely unrelated artifact’s power to it. If you wish post-jump instead of a prosthetic it can be made into an exoskeleton to be placed over a limb. Alternatively this can be a torso but aside from enhanced durability and a unique technological feature it does not boost your ability to move. This can be purchased multiple times, you can import into this."
245,,200,Artificer ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Magitek,"Mechanical wonders and magical items of grandeur! Artifacts are powerful tools for people, wizards and Planeswalkers alike and you have a very potent knack for them. Creating artifacts comes naturally for you making you both an excellent craftsman and an intuitive inventor. It would not be difficult should you spend some time to start making artifice creatures of decent power. Within a scant few years you would even be able to devise inventions worth showing at Kaladesh’s technology fair, assuming you have been studious. In addition to this, you also become more capable of making personalised artifacts that are imbued with your powers."
246,,200,Presidential Suit,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Magitek,"Future proofed and fit for the top man of the nation, this fantastical armour is a sight to see for any red blooded American. Clad in red, white and blue, this full body suit of high tech armour does more than just make you strong enough to throw a truck with one hand and tough enough to take that same truck to the face. It also produces large amounts of electricity in the lightbulbs mounted on each shoulder, letting you fire off blasts from your hands or even charge up an especially powerful beam from your chest cannon. Which you have now. It’s made of pure gold. Anyone tries to deny you funding, just melt down their entire mansion with one shot from this baby. The suit can also do some unimportant stuff about greatly improving the efficiency and concentration/power of any energy channeled within the suit or your body, providing half again the effectiveness in each category, but who cares about that when you can punch out an ox, fry it with your lightning fingers and eat it for breakfast. Also comes with a animating lion helmet. 

You may import a set of armour or clothing into this. "

The Moon Cell has decided to make you one of the system maintenance workers, Servants in charge of caring for the virtual reality within the computer structure. Superhuman skill with computers and most technology is yours now, mostly focused on repairing and maintaining it. Even alien technology, like that of Velber, is relatively easy for you to get in working order and keep it that way. You’re not able to alter much, the Moon Cell keeps that knowledge out of your hands with just this, but making new stuff isn’t too hard. You don’t know how to create the highly complex systems that form the core of the Moon Cell but pretty much anything on Earth till the year 2030 is easy to construct. Those lunar databases are good for something. "

You have created Daimon eggs, and within lies the untouched embryo of a monster. Curiously, they require a physical host to fully reach maturity as the being inside them also needs a basic template to grow into, determined by the host. Thus, any Damion egg that merges with its host will create a Daimon based on the host. You may let these eggs lay dormant in the host until you wish to trigger their awakening. Purchasing this perk once will let you choose between having Daimon eggs make a host from mundane objects (Active magic flowing in the object appears to kill the infant Daimon inside) or sentient beings. You may purchase this perk yet again to buy the other choice. You may improve upon your Daimon with research with time, if you wish.

These enhancements are seamlessly integrated into your body, letting you channel mana through your limbs or machine parts within your body. They even continue to function and grow along with you, letting you age and change without fear of the working parts rejecting it or becoming nonfunctional. Your skin and flesh still remains mostly the same and functional, as well. As a bonus, if you choose a background in this world, you may choose to be related or adopted into the Nakajima family by the time the jump starts...or perhaps a rogue cyborg of Jail’s? That choice is up to you."
257,,200,Standalone Flight Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"There are times when a Mage has to use equipment other than their standard Device, such as device-like equipment, a vehicle, or just a regular firearm. This can be problematic, as the Mage only has so many hands they can use, and juggling their Device can be problematic. This mode was developed for those situations, separating the Device’s main body to act as an independent, flight-capable drone, which frees the Mage’s hands for other uses, while the Device either acts on it’s own or according to it’s user’s instructions.

This may seem mostly innocuous, but it involves an almost complete overhaul of the link between Mage and Device. Generally, Mages need to be physically holding their Device in order to link properly with it, to the point that disarming is a very serious concern to combat Mages. With this upgrade, these limitations are expanded to three or four city blocks, to the point where a Mage could potentially activate their Device and begin casting while they are in different rooms.

Simply as a passive effect, this also makes a Device much more resistant to de-linking, making it harder to affect it with anti-magic as the bond between it and it’s user is strengthened. It also comes with the understandable caveat of increasing power consumption. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

"
259,,200,Heretical Adaptation ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"Symphogears are, in essence, a Relic adapted into a combat system for its ability to generate massive amounts of energy that can be formatted into a certain kind of matter through a generic mass-energy converter. However, they also have the ability to 'evolve' overtime, gaining additional armor and improvements to features such as onboard thrusters. With a bit of study, it might be possible to apply this adaptive behavior to other materials, encouraging them to improve themselves over time.
"
260,,200,Mundane Applications ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"Killing Noise isn't all there is to heretical technology. The same technology that is used to create a Symphogear and it's weapons from energy can also be used to manipulate other forms of energy. Through this it becomes possible to bend light to cloak objects or to keep an object cool in a raging inferno. Aside from the obvious military applications, this makes it possible to convert mundane things like coffee makers or fireplaces to run on the passive Phonic energy that is generated by people."
261,,200,Basic Relic,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"You have two Relics appropriate to your Origin that you may choose one of and use at its basic level. In addition to the armament all Relics give off a field that immunizes their user and their immediate surroundings against the carbonizing touch of the Noise as well as allowing them to ignore the immaterial nature of the Noise, striking them as if they were material. As a last resort measure you may sing your Swan Song, performing a ridiculously powerful technique in exchange for heavy damage to your own body, generally enough to leave you out of action for a few days of intensive medical care. Better singing improves sync ratio, allowing faster recovery.

You may choose any Relic outside your origin for an extra 100cp, Gear Candidates still pay this price. You may purchase additional relics with the same pricing scheme after your first.

Note: Symphogears have a few common features, the most important of which being the barrier coating that allows them to ignore the carbonizing effect of the Noise, and their ability to 'tune' Noise into our dimension to destroy them. Symphogears also have maneuvering rockets mounted on them and are sealed against vacuum and high pressures.

Argo, the ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed on. The user is draped in sails, allowing them to drift effortlessly in the air. It can summon forth pieces of the original ship, casting great rods and nets of rigging at it's targets. Argo is mostly defense focused, being able to summon hulls as defensive shields and laying traps of rigging and rope. Further experience with Argo's creation allows the creation of small boats and jet skis.

The Argo does not possess an Armed Gear that can be wielded like a weapon in the normal sense, excepting the components of the ship, but it is capable of creating Argonauts; small spherical drones with an attached beam of energy. These drone are relatively fragile, but can overwhelm targets with sheer numbers. Specialized drones can be created with greater experience with the Gear.

Argo's Swan Song revives the original Argo, a flying heretical ship controlled by the will of the user. The Argo appears to turn and accelerate with no regards to propulsion or cornering, and can release swarms of the Argonauts. In addition to the swarms of loyal drones and it's extreme speed, the Argo's very presence creates a great typhoon that it and it's wielder are completely unaffected by.

Prometheus, the first flame. By calling forth embers of the original flame, a raging dimensional inferno can be started, burning both human and Noise alike. The flames spread and intensity can be limited by the wielder, and can be extinguished with a single thought, but left unchecked they burn incredibly violently. The wielder is protected from this raging heat by their Symphogear, and other Gears should have little trouble with the heat unless it is actively brought against them.

The chains wrapped around the wielders arms can be used like whips at their most basic level, heating to strike at foes, but Prometheus' true Armed Gear is the projection of these chains into disposable axes of all kinds, with its truest form being that of an ashen chainsaw. These weapons bear superheated blades and chains, being able to burn through even the toughest Noise's defenses if they can get in range.

Prometheus' Swan Song calls forth the full might of the stolen flame, engulfing all within a massive radius in an inferno that sears the flesh of enemies from bone while rejuvenating allies, bringing them back from the brink of death. Be warned however, fire is indiscriminate, and any targets that fail to be designated as allies will suffer the same fate as enemies.

Kibisis, the sack that contained the Medusa’s severed head. The concept of ‘sack’ is a slight misnomer, however. The user is given an elaborate combination of robes, cloak and hood that would be quite modest if the bodysuit wasn’t so skimpy. While unassuming, the fabric that makes up Kibisis is actually a portal to an enormous self-contained pocket dimension, with the user able to manipulate the fabric to make openings into and out of it.

This is as versatile and deadly as it sounds, as Kibisis is able to not only store objects, but also use the fabric to effectively ‘flash step’ by traveling along a thin corridor of silk, or create a razor thin portal along it’s edge to slice objects in half. Kibisis’ Swan Song generates a massive dimensional disturbance, manipulating space-time to instantly stretch and destroy huge areas, while also disrupting similar dimensional shenanigans.

Kaladanda, staff of the god of death. As intimidating as it sounds, Kaladanda’s Armed Gear is actually a metal pipe. In fact, Kaladanda may as well be the tool of a plumber, as it may plant and grow all manner of water works and plumbing from itself, naturally lending itself towards creating steam-powered mechanisms, such as gigantic steam hammers and saws. What makes these pipes unique, however, is the crimson water that flows freely from them, which carries a unique anti-life property that causes it to shred through all physical and philosophical protections, completing erasing it’s target from reality in a manner reminiscent of a certain mirror.

Kaladanda’s Swan Song calls forth the source of it’s deathly water – a colossal steam boiler which flashes a massive amount of it’s deadly contents into supercritical steam, which it forces into a tight, high-power beam to bore through even the toughest defenses. Be careful of friendly fire, although an attentive user can selectively halt the eroding effects of the steam on allies.

Thunderbird, caller of storms. The wielder appears to be cloaked in a stormy haze, obscuring them from view unless they choose to disperse it. Thunderbird is capable of recalling the original bird's talons, incredible sight and agility to the user.

Thunderbird's true power lies in its ability to generate 'feathers', razor-sharp shards that extend in whip-like wings from the wielder's body. They can generate electrical charge and control their own magnetism, allowing the wielder to levitate through repulsion and discharge anti-Noise lightning strikes with some buildup. It is also possible to use the wings as a conduit for a magnetic cannon.

Thunderbird's Swan Song causes the feathers to disperse, floating freely around the wielder as the haze expands into a storm cloud, from which the wielder can direct massive lightning strikes. Anything coming into the storm cloud will find themselves suffering from the lethal discharges within it unless the wielder directs it away from them itself.

The Holy Grail, the cup sought by King Arthur. Upon activation, one might notice that the Gear appears to be completely unarmed or protected aside from a standard (albeit slightly more armored) bodysuit provided by a Symphogear system, with the addition of what appears to be a cooking pot worn jauntily as a helmet. The Holy Grail is capable of generating cooking paraphernalia in all forms to serve in it's purpose of providing unlimited food and happiness to people. Cooking utensils that can, however, be easily used as lethal weapons. The Grail is semi-unique in that it's user can control it's implements remotely, starting with one or two implements at first, and growing to a few dozen with time.

The Holy Grail's Swan Song summons a massive stadium around the wielder, enclosing all in a several hundred meter radius inside a massive oven that heats to extremely high temperatures. Within, the wielder can control as many objects as they can manage, regardless of whether they came from her own Gear. The biggest risk comes from the massive size of the oven, carrying the risk of capturing innocent bystanders in the radius.

Enkidu, clay servitor. Instead of any sort of Armed Gear, Enkidu’s wielder is accompanied by a large, formless mass of technological ‘clay’ that emanates from fissures in the bodysuit armor. While limited in amount, the clay can be manipulated to take on different shapes and properties- provided it doesn’t stray too far from it’s wielder. One moment, it can be a rigid shield, then transform itself into a lethal explosive. Clay may be destroyed, but more is very slowly generated within the bodysuit.

Enkidu’s Swan Song temporarily re-enables the clay’s ability to self-replicate, allowing it to consume vast amounts of material to create a huge swarm of clay. For the duration of the Swan Song, the clay may be used as normal, explosively detonating or collapsing into dust once it ends.

Moly, the miracle herb grown from the blood of a giant. Mossy plants overtake the wearer’s hair, sprouting flowers and other sprouts in its place and down their arms- plants that the wielder can coincidentally fire and control like fine wires. Beyond the obvious application of monofilament cutters, these plants are capable of taking root in living things and draining their life force for energy, so long as a conduit exists back to the wielder. Stranger applications, such as plant-based exoskeletons or constructs, are also entirely possible.

The Swan Song of Moly causes all plants connected to Moly to begin flowering, releasing clouds of corrosive spores which eat into enemy armor, creating chinks for more plants to grow into, allowing them to rapidly drain them of life force. Exponential plant overgrow allows the collapsing of massive structures and even more points to dig into enemies from.

The Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the ten commandments of God. Draped in papers displaying the ten commandments of God, the Ark displays the remarkable ability to boost or dampen phonic gain. Other wielders who sing alongside the Ark notice their power being boosted, with rising sync coefficients, while enemy wielders notice their synchronization ratio's plummeting. Against the Noise, the effect that disables their Phase Contrast Barrier is broadcast in a wide radius, effectively forcing all Noise around them into reality where mundane weapons will affect them.

The Ark of the Covenant's Armed Gear is actually the papers hanging from the wielder's body. They can extend and fold themselves, taking the shape of weapons or shields, anything that is possible with folded sheets of paper. While they can swing with great force, it's important to remember that it's still essentially paper, albeit far more durable than normal, but still paper. The strength, durability and length the paper can extend to increases with experience.

As another Relic made in the image of God, the Ark's Swan Song is capable of exerting similar forces to the Ruin's of Balal. By spreading the pages out like a dish, and holding themselves in a cross position, the wielder can rip away massive amounts of Phonic Gain from other wielders or people, gathering it to themselves and redistributing it to others. Unlike other Swan Songs, this has no practical combat capability on it's own, as it effectively immobilizes the wielder while it is in use and requires another wielder to direct Phonic Gain to. However, if the wielder can gather enough Phonic Gain, they may be able to activate X-Drive once the Swan Song ends...

The Left Hand of Christ, no, not a euphemism. His actual hand. The wearer is bestowed a much more heavily armored suit than most Symphogears, complete with a helmet and rectangular shield. Unlike most Symphogears, the Hand's Armed Gear cannot be duplicated endlessly, with only one or two available at anygiven moment, the tradeoff being that Hand's lance is extraordinarily powerful, doubling as a high energy laser cannon. The Hand’s shield can expand and reshape as needed, additionally being able to project an energy shield capable of protecting against Noise. The size and shape the energy shield can take begins as a simple single direction square barrier, but can be manipulated more with practice.

The Hand's Swan Song channels and amplifies the destructive power of the spear's laser cannon, sending a massive cross-shaped beam of energy in the direction of every thrust for the duration of the Swan Song. Striking the ground with the spear will produce a similar cross-shaped blast around the wielder. In addition to this, while the Swan Song is active, the defenses provided by the Gear have their power drastically increased.

Gleipnir, the chain that bound the great wolf. Gleipnir’s bodysuit appears to be of a different material than standard, with a leathery appearance and fur-trimming along it’s edge, and appears bound to the wearer by chains. Lengths of chains may be unshackled to beat and ensnare enemies, draining Phonic Gain by contact and potentially immobilizing other Relic users with enough contact.

The Relic’s Swan Song reveals that it is not just Gleipnir, but also the wolf the chain bound – Fenrir. All of the Gear’s chains fall away, and the wielder is surrounded by a recreation of the original wolf. While larger than the wielder and strong, this is not the full extent of the Swan Song. Fenrir reverses the direction of control, being able to take it’s chain and leash another Relic for temporary control over it, against any relevant user’s will for the duration of the Swan Song. If the chain is not used in this way, taking the form of Fenrir bears very little cost to the user, despite being a Swan Song.

The Axe of Perun, weapon of the lightning god. Perun’s bodysuit is studded with numerous contacts and power lines, which can be used to generate extreme voltages, short lightning strikes and manipulate circuitry in the manner one might expect. Instead of simply being able to generate voltage though, Perun is able to condense large amounts of its power into a physical form- that or axes, polearms and other axe-headed instruments, in addition to the lightning ‘arrows’ one might expect. The downside to this is that Perun requires far more energy per weapon created, making it’s use substantially heavier and deliberate versus the frenzy of other Gears.

Perun’s Swan Song calls all available energy in the surrounding atmosphere to the user, often causing the formation of a massive storm cell around it from the massive drop in pressure. The wielder is then able to create a massive axe, formed by both the storm and their own charge, which fully discharges into the location they strike as a titanic lightning strike.

Draupnir, the ring of Odin. It uses its ability of self multiplication to create disk shaped drones that are equipped with sensors and projectors capable of producing energy blasts or holograms. A largely utility focused Relic, Draupnir's defense is somewhat poor and mostly consists of using the drones to intercept attacks or form force fields. Further sync and experience with Daupnir allows the creation of specialized drones and use of formations or combinations of the drones to perform various other tasks of means of attack.

Draupnir's Swan Song causes the drones to multiply exponentially before surrounding the target in a dome and discharging all their energy in a single attack focused on the center of the dome. Draupnir's Swan Song is especially risky as it removes all drones from defense for a single Swan strike and the Symphogear takes a bit to reactivate the discharged drones, should the wielder survive.

Brahmastra, the bow of Brahma. Unlike its counterpart Ichival, Brahmastra's attacks are slower, more accurate and far more powerful, with it's Armed Gear taking the form of a heavy bow by default, although it can also take the form of a battle rifle or revolver. Built into Brahmastra's headset is a visor that provides targeting data and alternate vision modes to the wielder. While the weapons can be fired as fast as the wielder can manage or pull the trigger, the power of these attacks make friendly fire a serious concern.

The Swan Song of Brahmastra brings forth the full might of a weapon said to never miss and which completely annihilates it's target without fail. Summoning it's bow form again, Brahmastra unleashes a massive lance of energy at a specific target, traveling instantly and through all structures in it's way to annihilate that single target with force similar to a nuclear weapon.

A Will-o’-the-Wisp, an otherworldly beacon. On top of a tattered hood, the wielder is given an Armed Gear that takes the form of a small, handheld lantern. Will-o’-the-Wisp’s purview is that of lighting- lanterns, braziers, lamps, floodlights and in a more combat oriented-fashion, lasers. On top of direct fighting applications, the wielder may cause lights to fizzle out and produce small ‘wisps’ of energy, which they may redirect into other lights (or even other Relics) to boost their power or use directly as energy bullets.

Primarily, Will-o’-the-Wisp focuses on producing massive banks of lamps which it harvests for wisps to use in massive lasers, all of which leads into its Swan Song. Upon activation, Will-o’-the-Wisp becomes a miniature sun, glowing with an intense light and releasing untold amounts of wisps that can turn even household light bulbs into deadly area denial weapons.

Xiuhcoatl, weapon of the sun god. The wielder of Xiuhcoatl is accompanied by their own personal Noise- that takes the shape of a burning serpent protectively surrounding them. It also bears slight resemblance to corn, for some reason. By consuming other Noise, or fragments of Relics, Xiuhcoatl grows larger and stronger, although it can shed ‘accumulated’ size for speed, and a greater size is more taxing on the user to maintain. Like other Noise, Xiuhcoatl can phase in and out of reality unless ‘tuned’ by something like a Symphogear, and also possesses the Noise ability to instantly reduce organic life to ash on contact, although it may withhold at the discretion of it’s handler.

Instead of simply swelling Xiuhcoatl to a massive size – as it already does so – the Relic’s Swan Song allows Xiuhcoatl to subdivide into two snakes of a slightly reduced size, repeating as many times as wished for either a swarm of standard sized snakes or several titanic ones. This means that Xiuhcoatl’s Swan Song is generally most effective once it has swelled to a sufficient size, providing the most metaphorical ‘material’ to create additional minions from.

The Nemean Hide, trophy of Heracles. The Nemean Hide is an unusual relic, for it grants it's user some of the properties of Noise as it's primary ability. In addition to being an exceptionally resilient Symphogear the Nemean Hide allows its user to utilize the dimensional phasing ability of Noise, moving partially out of reality in order to ignore mundane assaults in exchange for a loss of movement speed and perception. The pelt is especially fearsome in that it can ignore the assaults of Symphogear users with significantly lesser Symphonic Gain than the wielder of the Hide, while utilizing the enemy's Barrier Coating to interact with them as if the user was fully material, although significantly stronger assaults can pierce this defense.

The Nemean Hide's Armed Gear consists of bracers with five claws situated on all four extremities of the user. The claws are versatile as weapons, having the offensive properties of Noise, allowing them to expend themselves to carbonize a normal human on contact or create a fairly potent explosion, the claws replenish fairly quickly and may be fired as ranged weapons. Finally, a claw may be inserted into a Noise to temporarily usurp control of it, although the claw won't regenerate so long as the Noise remains alive and controlled. Higher sync and experience with the Nemean Hide may allow manifestation of other parts of the Lion such as the fangs or tail, or manipulation of the claws, causing them to grow or otherwise shift to the user's will.

The Swan Song of the Nemean Hide is terrific in both senses of the word. The Hide uses the excess energy generated by the song to fully reform the invincible Lion Noise it was made from around the user. The Nemean ion is nigh indestructible to most assaults barring another Swan Song or attack of similar caliber and can control large swathes of nearby Noise to do it's will. The Lion is somewhat indiscriminate in it's rampage, only partially controlled by the wearer of the Hide and the Swan Song usually only lasts about a minute at most, meaning the best way to deal with the Lion is usually to simply run until it's exhausted.

Enlil, Lord of the Wind. While ordinarily the color scheme of a Symphogear seems to depend on the user, Enlil has yellow and black warning patterns included regardless of the user, along with a mining helmet. Enlil generates mining equipment of all kinds, pickaxes, drills, shovels, even industrial mining lasers. While the intended function is obvious, they still work as anti-Noise weapons, and most tools can be fired as projectiles using rockets. The size and complexity of summoned tools increases with experience with the Gear. The mining helmet's light also functions as an X-ray device, which feeds back to a visor that drops down from the helmet.

Upon triggering it's Swan Song, Enlil explodes into a massive mining train made from a mishmash of industrial machinery and mining equipment. While plowing straight through the enemy at three hundred miles an hour is quite effective, it can also make use of it's crane arms to throw pieces of the scenery at opponents or fire the massive mining laser mounted to it's hull.

The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities.

Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at its core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear.

The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into its mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon.

Pandora’s Box, which unfortunately is just a box after it was opened. Thankfully, the box itself is still useful, which the wielder can attest to with their built-in bandanna with tracking code. The box can take forms from cardboard boxes to steel shipping containers to box up and ship enemies to oblivion, or box cutters, nail guns and other shipping paraphernalia. Duct tape, warehouse drones and a very large boxcutter can help make sure death is delivered to enemies, and the constructs only get worse from there.

Once the Swan Song is triggered, enemies within range are drawn backwards into a tiny box, like all the world’s evils, and then pulled into a massive shipping mechanism. Once processed, they are fired through a shipping accelerator against a hard surface, crushing the contents instantly and dealing massive damage. A minor property of Pandora’s Box is that it’s user exhibits a slight stealth effect, becoming extremely hard to notice. Moreso, if they hide within the Box.

Bajiaoshan, once thought to be a mighty wind fan. Instead, upon activation the wielder finds themselves holding a pair of handles which can sprout dozens of individual knives, holding them in the shape of fans. On the users command, the handle can explosively fire the knives at a high firing rate, essentially making them fully automatic ballistic knives.

The blades generated can be of several different types, including armor piercing, explosive and incendiary blades with any number of imaginative shapes and sizes. When the fight gets close to Bajiaoshan, the handles can project two superheated knives that are much more durable than the fragile projectiles and are fully capable of melting through most defenses.

It's Swan Song let's Bajiaoshan project a single, invisible knife that carries with it the force of a gale, and with a single thrust, can tear through a single point with incredible force, penetrating all enemies but leaving allies untouched.

Quetzalcoatl is a fragment of the feathered serpent that runs through the user’s body, causing many red-hot feathers to erupt from their bodysuit and merge into an armored coat to protect them. It also extends a superheated tail of molten metal from their spine, which can change shape and warp as they wish. Users of Quetzalcoatl should be cautious of these properties, as it, like the Nehushtan Armor, begins to merge with the user over time, although instead of growing into their wounds, Quetzalcoatl instead chooses to reside beneath the skin. A symbiotic relationship, as opposed to parasitic.

There is no true Armed Gear to Quetzalcoatl, with its user instead calling upon its tail and raw command over the power of the sun. Raw material fissures forth from within Quetzalcoatl, superheated metals and plasmatic gasses which it can launch in streams and use as whips or in other creative ways against its foes. It can also control light in a minor way, either blinding it’s enemies or concentrating it’s light against its foes like the sun against ants.

The Swan Song of Quetzalcoatl harnesses the power of nuclear fusion, generating a small sun roughly the size of one’s fist and launching it. Without the Gear to keep it under control, it quickly expands into a massive conflagration of fire, gas and light, destroying anything in its path.

Tonbokiri, the dragonfly cutter, is one of a few Gears that is capable of native flight thanks to the set of insectoid wings that sprout from the back of the wielder’s bodysuit. All kinds of spears may be created by the Relic, although unlike more typical examples of spears produced by Symphogears, Tobokiri’s are more designed for cutting than thrusting. On top of that, the bodysuit possesses an ambulatory ‘tail’ that may grasp it’s spears and act as a crude sting for the user, and can sprout additional insectoid features if they wish.

Tonbokiri belongs to the group of ‘living’ Gears that actively seek symbiosis with their wielders, regardless of implantation status, which is reflected in it’s Swan Song. The user sprouts chitinous armor, and temporarily the restored spear emerges from their sting, sharp enough that it emits heat from simple contact with the air.

Strangely enough, Tonbokiri’s style and movements seem... a bit ridiculous at times. Flash stepping, running on water and other feats that’d seem more beelievable if they were in some anime.

Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn’s spear. While only one of the original barbs remains, it still carries the traits of the original spear, with the short, bone-like protrusions the Gear is capable of producing still coursing through the body of enemies it pierces into and tearing them apart. By snapping off a bone growth and burying it in water or the ground, a massive ‘swordfish’ drone spawns – really an extended bone outcropping held inside a ring drone, with the same properties as a normal spine. Combat relies then on a balance between falling back to spawn additional drones and taking the offensive when drones are in surplus.

The spear’s Swan Song revives the original sea monster – a massive, bone-y serpent named Coinchenn – but not as a pet to be controlled or commanded. Instead, Coinchenn allows itself to be used as a massive version of the spear it was eventually made into, flying with unnatural speed and precision for something so large, with the curse spreading through everything present at the location it strikes.

263,,200,Shout of the Earth ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"Then again, I might've missed something with the above, right? Here's a thought- name any artifact or creature from legend and... we'll dig it up for you, alright? Granted, we'll probably only be able to get a sliver of the original Pagan Artifact for you, but remember that's more than enough to cause some serious damage. I'll leave the discovery of it's exact powers up to you, just... don't go too crazy, alright?"
264,,200,Faust Robe ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"Instead of powering a ‘projector’ (read: pretentious term for Symphogear) with a Relic and phonic gain, the power source of the Relic can be gutted and replaced with an object called a Philosopher Stone. By providing all the power the Gear needs and more, the user no longer has to sing, and the Gear gains Anti-Ignite properties, being able to shut them down and in fact reflect all of it’s damage back on the user. The pendant of the Gear will become slightly bigger as a result, with an optional alternative form as a different crystalline accessory, such an as a gun. There is one catch, though. Due to alchemical properties of the Philosopher Stone, a Faust Robe can only be worn by women, as- and I quote, “proper dick placement” is required to activate it. As in, a complete lack of one.

265,,200,Philosophical Weapon ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"A type of weapon created by Alchemists, this utilizes the extracted legend of a Relic as fixated in the minds of the people through deeds in order to awaken it’s innate properties. For example, the weapon Gungnir was – in the past – known as Longinus, the spear that pierced Jesus Christ on the Cross, and thus awakened a philosophical anti-god property. The only caveat to this option is that it must be a property which is relevant in this universe, such as anti-god, anti-structure or anti-immortal.

Multiple CDs can be put together at once to create a mashup between the two songs. Even exotic mediums can be inserted as long as they have music aboard, and music that is inherently magical can be loaded this way as well.

272,,200,Deadly Upgrades ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Though it’s not a skill frequently displayed, the engineers of Clan Skryre are a source of non-organic augmentation within skavendom. Warp-lightning prosthetics and mechanical enhancements are one of the more detail-oriented forges, practiced by those skaven that for one reason or another choose to leave their impact in little ways. Instead of creating explosions and structures that would shake the world, they enhance the musculature of stormvermin with circuitry and steel. 

You’re one of these detail-oriented rat-men, able to get flesh and metal to work together when ordinarily the victim subject would be either weakened or killed. As well, the skaven field of ‘bionics’ can increase both physical strength and, in a Warlock-Engineer’s case, the strength of their spellcraft. Ikit Claw’s body and armor are but a testament to what an augmented skaven can attain in strength and spellcraft.

You have your own madrat’s weapon in this regard - a skaven-tech halberd, wreathed in wires, smoking runes, random chunks of green warpstone, and hissing motors. The bladed head is constantly arcing warp-lightning as the engine rumbles, the tainted electricity zapping and roasting all that gets zapped nearby while giving you a mere tingly feeling at most. As a tool of melee combat, this halberd is potent; But not only does the bladed head have a warp-lightning projector installed in the top, but for those of a magical persuasion it serves as a very effective focus for working the Lores. Any other magics that use the Halberd as a focus will find the warp-energy condenser infuses the tainted, degenerative energies of Chaos deep within.

Hyperium: ​You. are. Immortal. You do not age, you will not succumb to disease, plague, or virus. The only way to kill the wearer of this ring is to kill them by force.

Adamantium​: Your skin becomes like Adamantium! Only your skin, not the rest of you. Still, you will be able to take an epic beating without concern or care.

Mithrite​: Something about this amulet scares you. In the pit of your stomach, you feel an unnerving sense of dread radiating from it. Luckily for you, it likes you. It doesn't like the people attacking you. Anyone fighting you directly finds their courage rapidly drained from them, as you become more and more horrifying to them until they turn tail and run. The more experienced the foe, the longer it takes, but eventually, everyone finds something about you to be scared of.

Hyperium: ​Bend time enough, and you will outrun light itself. While wearing this amulet, you are almost invisible. Only sudden movements will reveal you, and even then, your image is distorted and wobbly, leading enemies to strike at your shadow.

Adamantium​: This ornate hammer amulet wants nothing more than to destroy anything in its path, and you will aid it. You can see, clear as day, any structural weaknesses that oppose you. Need to take down a wall? Hit it. Right there. Real hard, and it will all crumble down. Have to break someone's weapon? Right there. This fast. Snap at the hilt. Done.

Palladium:​This fist sized metallic head snaps and gnashes as blood splatters on it, your's or your foes'.

287,,200,Spirit Flute ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Believe it or not, while the Spirit Flute is a Lokomo artifact, it lacks the weight and pomp that the divine instruments of past eras have had. It does not hold together a dream, it does not allow the user to bend time, it does even wake the wind at your command. On the other hand, it does act as a key to most of the Lokomo’s technology, allowing those without their innate understanding of magitech to use it without too much difficulty. On the flipside, you still need a Lokomo - read as, authorized user or possibly one of the designers - to play a duet with, but if you have that then whatever magitechnology you’re trying to use will come to life, ready to be used.
"
288,,200,"Lokomo Royal, ‘The Phantom’ ",Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Phantoms, while not a Lokomo creation, do seem to be allied with them, much like how the various races of the past have had lesser guardian deities such as the Great Deku Tree or Valoo. It makes sense then, that if the Lokomo needed a great warrior or guardian, they would pattern it after a Phantom. That’s why the Spirit Train can now transform into a suit of armor in the approximate shape of one, albeit much larger. Be careful with your magic reserves however, since this will drain them like nothing else.
"
289,,200,Ancient Technology ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Magitek,"The ancient Oocca have left behind many artifacts in the land of Hyrule, some of which were enshrined in various temples. You have three such artifacts; the Dominion Rod, the Spinner, and the Clawshot. The Dominion Rod has few real uses; it can be used as a bludgeon, or to control certain statues. In addition to the rod itself you will get a few different statues that can be controlled by the rod, some of them large in size and capable of wielding weapons. The Spinner is a sort of gear-like mechanism that one can ride on. It’s best used on special grooves that it can use to move at high speeds, but it can also be ridden normally and can cross quicksand and patches of ice easily. It can also soften one’s fall if they happen to be riding it when they go over a cliff or something. Finally, the Clawshot is essentially a grappling-hook that allows one to attach to various objects pulling them closer to you (or you closer to them, if they weight more than you do). It fires with enough force to kill small enemies, but against larger ones it may only stun, if it does anything at all.
"
290,,200,Enchanted Appliance ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Magitek,"Choose any one common appliance. Anything from a cell phone to a truck. You gain an enchanted variant of it. It will never need maintenance, refueling, or recharging. Furthermore, even if it looks outdated, it will outperform the most cutting edge mundane equivalent. In fact, it will probably outperform anything from our real world, if only just."
291,,200,Tonal Architect ,The Elder Scrolls,Magitek,"You are knowledgeable in the Dwemer art of Tonal Architecture. They used this subset of Tonal Magic to build long-lasting structures, as a mining tool, for medical purposes, or to synchronize it with the mind. I'm sure you'll find more than a few uses for this."
292,,250,Blaster System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Coming from the same roots as the Fulldrive mode on some Devices, the Blaster System is designed to increase the power available to a Mage in combat. However, unlike the Fulldrive mode, the Blaster System does not only disengage the performance limiters on the Device, it also directly sacrifices the user’s life for power. When a Blaster System is in use, the Mage receives direct, physical damage to themselves relative to whichever one of the three Blaster levels they are using, along with backlash damage to the Device itself. It is analogous to overclocking the Device with power, rather than simply letting it perform at its maximum specifications, as with Fulldrive.

Blaster One and Two are both relatively safe if only used in short bursts, being able to instantly charge nearly any spell, or push its power to the class above it. The tradeoff is the immediate overheating of the Device, along with burns, cuts and ruptured blood vessels on any flesh in contact with the Device during operation. Blaster Three, on the other hand, causes immediate damage and warping to the Device, along with potentially breaking the operator’s bones and causing the same damage from Blaster One and Two all over their body. In exchange, the power of spells are massively multiplied, completely bypassing even the most potent Anti-Magic Fields and still coming out with extra power. 

It should be noted that in some cases, the damage caused by a Blaster System can in fact be preferable to the damage potentially caused by Fulldrive. The simple truth of the matter is that it’s faster and easier to treat blunt trauma such a broken bones and cuts compared to the internal damage caused by Fulldrive, which has a tendency to ‘add up’ before it’s noticed. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. )"
293,,250,Bits System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"In its original design, the Blaster System included a subsystem called Blaster Bits. At Blasters Two and Three, the system would generate two and four sets of ‘bits’, respectively. These bits bear some resemblance to the Standalone Flight Mode, being independent, flight-capable drones that can cast magic on their own, but they do not possess any of the intelligence or independence that would be found with the Standalone mode. Each bit acts as a vector from which spells can be cast, essentially giving the caster more directions to attack from, as well as potentially acting as force multipliers.

Like the Standalone Flight Mode, bits possess limitations on range, becoming proportionally less efficient the greater the distance between them and the user, in a way that is fundamentally similar to how Familiars share their master’s mana reserves. Their range is also smaller, between one or two city blocks.

The first purchase of this system grants the control system, along with two bits, with additional bits being purchasable for 50DP per bit. If the Device also has the Blaster System installed, then each of the bits are upgraded into Blaster Bits. In Blaster Two or above, the limitations on range and efficiency are temporarily released, and the bits begin acting as perfect force multipliers, duplicating any spell cast by the main Device at no additional cost, but only so long as Blaster Mode is engaged. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
294,,300,Omnipotent Five Sights: Spectator,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"The Spectator is a Support-type
Teigu in the form of a headpiece with a large eye attached to it, which grants to its
wearer five different abilities related to sight. These five abilities are:
● Insight: It can be used to read an opponent's mind and thereby predict their
next move, greatly increasing the user's combat prowess. Despite this, the
user must be in peak physical condition to fully make use of this advantage,
as a physically superior opponent can still overwhelm and defeat them.
● Farsight: This ability was used to search for things and seems to allow the
user to have long-ranged vision, as well as making them able to see things
clearly no matter the conditions
● Clearsight: It also gives the user the ability to look through solid but thin
objects. While this doesn't allow the user to see through dense walls, this
ability is usually used to look through clothing, being useful to see if there are
any hidden weapons or if the user is a pervert.
● Foresight: The Spectator’s vision isn’t limited to the present, but it can also
see the future. Well, sort of, as, by seeing the smallest muscle movements of
their target, the user can see what will be their next moves and predict their
attacks.
● Illusion Sight: The Teigu can cast an illusion that causes the target to see
their most precious person before their eyes. For the one trapped in it, the
illusion is absolute, even more it needs some time for them to actually realize
that they aren’t seeing the reality, and can't be broken without some external
psychic interference unless they actually attack the one they love most within
the illusion."
295,,300,Cutter of Creation: Extase,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"One of the most curious weapons that can be
found in this world, literally taking the shape of a giant pair of scissors with a panda
bear sticker on one of its handles. Despite looking weird, Extase is extremely sharp
and is said to be able to cut through any material, including the armor Teigu Incursio,
which was supposed to be unbreakable, with materials that offer resistance against
being cut being harder to cut through them. It’s also very sturdy, having the greatest
durability among all of the Teigu, allowing its wielder to use it for defense as a shield
capable of withstanding powerful blows from mighty Teigu like Hekatonkheires and
maybe not even the Supreme Teigu could destroy it. Despite its offensive and
defensive power, its trump card, which apparently is also named Extase, is a more
support focused ability as it emits a bright flash of light for a short period of time that
blinds opponents without obscuring the user's vision. This ability, while lacking direct
combat usage, is still very useful for distraction."
296,,300,Infinite Uses: Cross Tail,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Being arguably one of the most, if not the most,
versatile among all of the Teigu, Cross Tail is a Teigu that takes the form of gloves
with metallic fingertips with wire threads running through them. The Cross Tail’s
threads were created from the body hair of a Super-Class, dragon-like Danger Beast
that lived in the Eastern region's mountains, high among the clouds and they can be
used in various ways to attack, defend against, or immobilize opponents, being most
effectively used by someone with a lot of creativity. Beyond merely wrapping targets
and opponents, the wires can be used in several different ways, such as creating a
perimeter used to detect enemies who crossed through them, to arm traps, to form
into melee weapons such as spears, to wrap around the user's body as armor, to be
controlled inside of an enemy’s body to target their internal organs or even to literally
re-attach the limbs of someone capable of regenerating them such as the Lionelle’s
user. Additionally, Cross Tail’s trump, Realm-Cutting Thread, card isn’t an actual
special ability but a different, stronger type of thread, originated from the stronger
parts of the original Danger Beast's body and thus superior to its regular wires, being
incredibly sharp and durable/strong enough to even restrain a Grand Chariot’s user
for a small amount of time. Unfortunately, the threads aren’t infinite, however, the
replica you receive by purchasing it will start with enough material to be used for an
millennia before running out of thread and its wires will be replenished at the
beginning of every jump/decade."
297,,300,Purgatory's Invitation: Rubicante,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"An Elemental-type Teigu and one of
the few of them capable of creating its respective element, taking the form of a
flamethrower with the ability to create a stream of flames whenever activated,
gaining its power from the integrated large cylinder which acts like a jet engine
turbine by aerial suction and heating the air. Its flames are so intense that they could
not be extinguished by normal means in a manner similar to napalm, even if
submerging oneself in water, burning until the target was killed by them or until there
is no more fuel for them to consume. In addition to usually working as an average
flamethrower by spraying flames at a small to medium range, Rubicante’s trump
card, Magma Drive, allows it to fire individual blasts of concentrated fire at the
target, giving the Teigu longer range capabilities than usual. Finally, as a last resort,
the cylinder on it can be set to explode by pressing a button, causing a huge
explosion, but also destroying the Teigu and also the user if they don’t manage to
escape or protect themself in time."
298,,300,The King of Beasts Transformation: Lionel,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"The Secret Arts used by the
Gravekeepers’ ancestors, which gives them the capacity to change and morph parts
of their physical bodies into those of a specific animal, were adapted and used by the
ancient alchemists of old to create Teigu, more specifically the belt Teigu Lionel (or
also called Lionelle). When worn by a compatible user, Lionel can transform them
into a lion beast/human hybrid, greatly increasing one's regeneration, physical
strength and speed to animalistic levels, as well as greatly amplifying their five
senses, specially their sense of smell, to enable scouting and grant the ability to
locate specific individuals over a long distance. Furthermore, some personality traits
can be affected as well while wearing it, even when Lionelle isn’t active.
Additionally, Lionel’s trump card is Regenerator, which grants its user high-speed
regeneration. The exact limits of this regeneration are unknown, but it’s capable of
fully healing a removed eye while missing limbs need to be reattached in order to be
healed.
Last but not least, during very specific circumstances, such as the Teigu being
destroyed or after decades of mastery over it for an average user, Lionelle can fuse
with its current wielder instead of merely transforming them, turning them into a more
animalistic hybrid with greater strength, however, at the cost of them losing their
regeneration and thus preventing previous wounds from being healed.
This transformation, when controlled, can be undone at will without them needing to
worry about dying due to its consuming all of their lifeforce or about being possessed
by the Teigu."
299,,300,Chaos Throw: Big Leaguer,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Another versatile Teigu, this time with power
over the elements. The Big Leaguer is constituted of six baseball-sized orbs that
usually stay floating around the user, but, when thrown, they’re activated once they
hit something, releasing the element they’re imbued with. Each one of the six orbs
that compose the Teigu is imbued with a different element, with them being the
following: the Storm Orb (creates a large whirlwind), the Explosion Orb (causes a
massive explosion), the Flame Orb (incinerates the victim on contact), the Ice Orb
(freezes any opponent it touches), the Lightning Orb (stuns opponent with an electric
jolt) and, last but not least, the Rot Orb (capable of eroding away whatever it hits).
Each effect can be incredibly powerful if used correctly, but keep in mind that the
speed and accuracy of each orb basically depends on how skilled the user is at
being a baseball pitcher. Once the orbs are thrown and their abilities are used, they’ll
then return floating to the wielder's hand."
300,,300,Unnamed Teigu: Vibration Control Teigu,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"This scary staff with a
human-looking skull on its tip is one of the lesser known Teigu in possession of the
Revolutionary Army. This unnamed Teigu has the ability to vibrate at very high
frequencies and manipulate the generated vibrations, allowing it to release
destructive shockwaves capable of even cracking the ice generated by Esdeath and
to enhance the staff and other weapons’ offensive power, as well as possibly being
able to cause vibration resonance by vibrating in the natural frequency of its target in
order to damage it and make it more susceptible to its physical strikes."
301,,300,Rare Suit,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Taking the form of a suit of armor, the Rare Suit's main ability is
soil/earth manipulation as it was possibly made from an Earth Dragon. In the same
way as other elemental-type Teigu, the Rare Suit is unable to create soil/earth out of
nothing, but it’s able to manipulate the preexisting soil around it. Some of the feats
possible for this Shingu are creating constructs out of earth, such as statues and
walls, and burrowing underground as if it was a liquid, which can be used for
movement, to search for rare minerals underground and to even surprise attack foes
unaware. Additionally, when underground, it also grants a certain degree of seismic
sense, allowing the user to locate themselves. Lastly, using its abilities puts a great
strain on the user's body and can cause damage on them if overused."
302,,300,Water-Dragon Sword,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Six centuries after the creation of the belt Lionel,
the Gravekeepers’ Secret Arts were once again utilized by the Empire to create a
new weapon, this time a Shingu, the Water-Dragon Sword. In addition to the Shingu
being a high quality broadsword, when activated, its special ability allows the user to
become extremely powerful for three minutes by giving them Water Dragon’s
characteristics, like causing their hair to grow much longer and their eyes to become
slitted, as well as enhancing their physical condition on a level considerably above
that of Lionel’s transformation ability. Unfortunately, such a power comes with a cost,
as the user will become extremely fatigued after that time limit is expired and using it
multiple times a day may cause irreversible damage to them."
303,,300,Power Surging: Balzac,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"It’s a pretty known fact that there are several
limiters on the human brain and body that prevent them from being used at full
capacity in order to avoid damage, however, the Oarburgh clan developed a special
technique/training method that allows its members to remove the human brain's
natural limiters on their bodies, giving them peak human physical attributes, but even
this technique doesn’t bring out their full power. However, this mask Teigu goes even
beyond the effects of the Oarburgh clan’s technique and affects both the body and
the mind. When worn, Balzac can tap into the wearer's body and mind in order to
unlock their potential by 100%, giving the wearer super speed, super strength,
enhanced endurance, lightning-quick agility and other above peak human physical
attributes, as well as unparalleled intelligence. However, as you may think, the
mask’s enhancements are based on the wearer's current power and limits, as it
doesn’t actually make its user more powerful, just allow them to use their power to
the fullest."
304,,300,Great Tremor: Heavy Pressure,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Some Teigu have special requirements
they seek on their users, but one of the most peculiar ones in this category is the
Heavy Pressure, a microphone-type Teigu that seems to have a preference for users
with an energetic, quirky personality and a penchant for bunny ears. The Teigu is
able to amplify the user's voice and turn it into ultrasonic waves of different strength
depending on the output level chosen by the user, being capable of pulverizing
enemies by shattering their bones at its full power output. Additionally, Heavy
Pressure's trump card is known as Nasty Voice, which alters its voice amplification
to cause realistic hallucinations to whoever it is used on with a wave of sound."
305,,300,YPA-GB49 “Corona“ ,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"The Shopkeeper leads you out into the hangar behind the shop. A medium sized airship is sitting there. It looks sleek, and could probably fit 10 people rather nicely. You notice the paint job on it seems rather fresh. The Shopkeeper nods approvingly. “That there is the Corona, one of the YPA guild’s reject models. We built her and gave her a little touch up.”

“Her sister, the Strahl, has a passive invisibility field, but we felt this lass needed a personal touch. So we put in a magicite focusing array in front. Just turn it on, and not only will this pretty lady be able to block any frontal assault – she’ll also be able to ram people head on.”

“Of course, you could just use her to fly around – without the ramming.”"
306,,300,GARMENT GRID [JC] VARIATION,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"An otherworldly garment grid – perhaps a lingering sentiment from the farplane...or perhaps a relic from even further beyond, at first glance it seems to have all the standard functions of a garment grid, but there’s something amiss with the way it is set up. It’s as though the grid was made to be capable of change, capable of growth. Though the number of slots for dress spheres remains at five, as you access different spheres along the grid the nature of this garment grid will become apparent to you.

As you change from one sphere to another, one of the grid’s passive effects will activate – one for each unique change you make. The maximum amount of passive effects is always at (n-1), n being the amount of spheres slotted in the grid itself.

Therefore, in order to access the highest tier abilities, you’ll have to change through every single dress sphere.

When you take this item, you may decide what skills you choose, but the choice is permanent – so choose carefully. In order to pick a second tier effect, you must have first picked a first tier effect, a third tier effect requires having picked a second tier effect – and so forth. However, once a tier is unlocked, you may pick it multiple times. Remember, you may pick up to (n-1) effects, n being the total amount of sphere slots available to you – which is initially 5.

In general, abilities activate whenever you change between dress spheres – effectively a “jump” between spheres. However, unless you take specific modifications – a jump between two spheres is only counted once (so you can’t just jump back and forth between two spheres). Can’t really visualize it? Here’s what the grid itself looks like. Each connection in between is a “jump”.

Jump from 1 sphere to another, and you’ll activate the first tier of effects – and so forth, until you’ve expended every single connection. When this happens, the entire process resets and upon another jump, you’ll lose temporary effects from the grid to start over fresh. With the grid above it would go as follows:

First Connection: Activate 1st Effect
Second Connection: Activate 2nd Effect
Third Connection: Activate 3rd Effect 
Fourth Connection: Activate 4th Effect
All Connections Expended – “Fifth”: Connection All effects disappear, Activates 1st Effect again.

Curious to see what options are available? Well, I’ve compiled a list if you’re curious. This may be purchased multiple times.

307,,300,"PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” ",Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Truly the pinnacle of experimental Machina technology – it’s probably for the best if you don’t let the Yevon clergy know that you possess this. For one thing, they have a very tight grip on machina technology, and it’s not something they care to relinquish to anyone, even if you happen to be within the clergy itself. Machina use needs to be strictly controlled after all.

A tank like machina capable of sending out small flying units to act as reconnaissance drones – these drones serve two purposes, the collection of combat data as well as acting as the machina’s primary form of long ranged detection and observation. Initially, it comes with nine drones, definitely enough to be sent in all of the cardinal directions even while leaving one around for close range surveillance.

Its primary armament is a giant magic cannon, the properties of which can change, depending on the data received from the drones. Observing enough fire elemental attacks will cause the cannon to adopt fire properties, and so forth. Unfortunately, machina is still machina at the end of the day, so its replicated capabilities aren’t as amazing as you would probably hope – essentially lesser replicas of whatever it sees. Like all machina, you can definitely

That being said, its flexibility doesn’t lie with the surveillance drones...but with the modifications which can be made to it."
308,,300,Rings of Power,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A small set of rings with differently coloured gems. Although pretty in their own right, they are imbued with miniature singularities, granting the wearer with incredible power. These rings work from their own self-contained power which slowly regenerates when not in use. Strong uses of a ring (say, using telekinesis to leave a wide crater) may take minutes to recharge. If the wearer contains their own energy pool, they may fuel these rings simply through touch."
309,,300,Will of the City,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A giant golden pendulum with unbreakable rope. Dig a spacious room underneath a village or city and hang this up, and the next day the pendulum will be surrounded by multitudes of spinning wheels and looms. Like a seismograph by feeling the vibrations of the city, the pendulum will swing, the wheels will turn and the Weavers will interpret them. This all works together to give you an encoded but detailed census of the city. Or if you have specific questions, this will provide answers, right down to knowing an individual person's feelings on a matter. It is unknown if this an actual sentient being or will of the city or is simply natural motions that come from the city itself. Either way, no secrets will escape you from within this city's limits."
310,,300,Singularity Database,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"Singularities are technologies designed to defy the laws of physics, pulling off feats one could describe as magical. Each Wing desperately protects the secrets of their singularity, and any kind of leak could lead to disastrous results. Meanwhile, you have a database which contains every singularity developed in this realm and software needed to access it. If you somehow also lack a tool to use the software, a laptop is provided. With this information, a crafty person could develop their own variations of these singularities. The database will include a guide describing how to convert or replicate these technologies when you move to a realm with possibly differing physics."
311,,300,Emergency Teleport,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A small round device that latches onto a person or their clothing. This device watches the lifesigns of the one wearing it, activating when it detects an incoming blow that would put them in critical condition. Upon activation, it creates a quick protective shield around the wearer before teleporting them to a designated safe spot. If the wearer is somehow in a different dimension or plane to the safe spot when it activates, it will teleport to the same dimension as the safe spot, but in a random location. Once it successfully performs its task, the device breaks down. A replacement will appear in your storage after a month."
312,,300,Black Silence Gloves ,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"Supernatural gloves used by the legendary Black Silence. Sync these gloves with any number of weapons, and they will gain the ability to temporarily summon them in hand. A weapon only materialises for a second, enough to get a good hit in, and then that weapon will need a few seconds of cooldown afterwards. If the wearer manages to summon every weapon at least once, they will have access to perform the Furioso. The Furioso can be best described as a continual stream of attacks using every weapon one after another, giving opponents no reprieve. Once the Furioso has been performed, every weapon will need to be summoned at least once again."
313,,300,City-Regulated Firearm,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A customisable assault rifle that can be modified to become as powerful and indiscriminate as a blunderbuss or have the precision and reach of a sniper. It starts each day with several clips of various ammunition available (e.g. incendiary or frost bolts). Performing tricks or using the gun as a melee weapon will refill the magazine, with more ammunition for trickier stunts and/or more damage."
314,,300,Purification Vessel ,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This is a medium class ship in the fleets of Shikoku Trastrium, and you are it’s captain. It does not require a crew, but works better when fully staffed. It is armed with purification beams and a Mantra collection halo. It requires Mantra Level 3 to fly and 4 to engage in combat operations. Mantra can be directed to it by Transmitters or someone with the Mantra Foci Perk."
315,,300,Divine Weapon,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have a legendary weapon forged by the smiths of heaven or found in the hot blood of the earth. In either case, it is nigh-­unbreakable and has a unique quality or power.

As an example Wailing Dark, Argus’s sword, can extend to an outlandish length and with sufficient mantra, cut through a moon. Moon­cutting feats require Mantra Level 5 at minimum."
316,,300,Mechanical Genius,Final Fantasy IV,Magitek,"Your ability to understand machinery is on a different level entirely. Working with a metal you’ve never touched to brace a machine? Cakewalk. New attachments on a precariously balanced airship? Might take a day, less with an assistant. You know machines, and exactly how to calibrate them to your exact specifications inherently without needing to actually run the numbers. It just works."
317,,300,Godwalker(Tier 2),Godbound,Magitek,"A relic of ancient theotechnical research, godwalkers are an offshoot of the arts that forged the Made Gods. Once, these great war machines of polished steel and glowing sigils laid waste to the battlefields of the Former Empires. Few now remain in any kind of good condition-and the machine you now wield is an exception among exceptions. Operating by drawing divine sympathies between their shape, their function and their pilots each Godwalker has two key components: A chakra engine, the locus of its divine fire and the interface between its artifices and the celestial forces that power it which determines what manner of and how many divine components can be attached to it. And a sacred armature, the basic chassis of the godwalker which can provide different advantages through the symbolic principles it reifies-including vast transport space, integral flight ability or simple sturdy construction. A godwalker shaped like a vehicle is peerless in transporting its writers and destroying those who impede it’s path, while some experimental varieties were even designed as thrones or libraries.

As for the armaments of the godwalkers, it is no exaggeration to say their component can mimic many lesser Gifts on a scale greater than mankind. While some components simply permit a godwalker to emulate any Gift related to perception, communication, movement, transformation, creation, alteration, defence and protection or attacking and certain forms of harm including the universal smitings of Godbound centred on the great machine itself more unique abilities of a similar scale have also been created. Some examples are provided below:
- Anchor of the Holy Gate: The godwalker acts as the destination node of a teleportation gateway. After 24 hours of ritual purification that must be free of all blasphemous behaviour, with a day’s commitment of divine effort a godwalker can let in up to a hundred infantrymen’s worth of mass at a time to a designation location.
- Devourer of Armies: Torrents of lethal sacred energy blast from the godwalker, scorching entire battalions to death.
- Banner of Zeal: The godwalker ignites an invincible defence against any mental effect that would stop the pilot from attacking enemies, and bolsters the valor of nearby allies
- Force Projection Jewel: The godwalker strikes down targets with pinpoint precision, up to a mile
- Halo of Wrath: The godwalker sears nearby enemies with a penumbra of coruscating divine energies.
- Advance of the Iron Tide: So long as the godwalker moves in a straight line, they have an invincible defence against all hostile effects and can phase harmlessly through solid barriers. This invincibility can be maintained as long as it does nothing but keep moving forward until, presumably, it’s enemies are destroyed.
- Clavis of Night: After ten minutes to “load”, the godwalker punches a hole into Uncreated Night. It is advisable to first scout out the theurgic coordinates of your desired destination through which you can use the godwalker to arrive at over a week’s journey in exchange for bypassing the usual obstacles, lest you risk eternally wandering within the void.
- Kinetic Sump Vortex: The godwalker halves the movement rate and dampens the initiative of all nearby foes, though powerful ones may be able to resist it for a short while.
- Noble Path Generator: The godwalker generates solid footing regardless of the substance or lack thereof beneath it. Oceans and empty pits alike are no obstacle to its passage.
- Pious Construction Array: The godwalker’s capacity for fixing or building mundane structures and goods is enhanced, permitting it to do the work of hundreds of skilled craftsmen.
- Rainbow Bridge Emitter: The godwalker uses divine effort to summon a thirty-foot wide bridge between any two points in sight within 1000 feet of each other that shares it’s durability. The bridge permits travel no matter how steep it is, and users cannot be knocked off while they are alive.
- Reactive Adaption Unit: The godwalker wields divine effort to make it immune to a specific Gift or other power for a scene.
- Stiletto Sutra Projector: The resonances of a ruinous sacred text open gaping holes of nonbeing into a living being within 2000 feet. While highly effective, it is too inefficient to wield against entire armies and is ineffective on unliving targets.
- The Awl of Shifting Space: The godwalker can teleport at a distance up to twice its normal movement rate, to anywhere it can see or has formerly occupied. This teleportation leaves behind physical bindings or restraints, but not magical ones-at least of this world.
- Transmutation Field: With time and sacred mudras, the godwalker can transform large amounts of non-magical matter into another non-magical, non precious substance of equal mass. This ability generally takes 12 hours or so of labour.
- Polymorphic Shaping Core: The godwalker can alter its shape within its general dimensions, gaining a faster travel rate by land or sea by sprouting wheels or propellers for example. It can also stretch out it’s matter to form long ranged manipulators, or form into a defensive tank-like shape. While this component is not sophisticated enough to permit flight, it can shrink the entire godwalker down into something the size of a horse.
- Volley Negation Shield: When attacked by multiple strikes in rapid succession, only the first can strike the godwalker-and even then, if a foe dedicates it’s full focus on the great machine. The others automatically miss.
- Trump of Judgement: The godwalker launches a building-flattening sonic barrage out at everything within 200 feet, crumbling any non-magical solid construction to powder and dealing severe harm to all nearby living beings.
- Wingcutter Malediction: A beam of congealed curses strikes down airborne enemies, whether they come in flocks or as individuals. For some reason this weapon cannot be evaded by mundane means, but cannot be targeted at terrestrial foes.
- Wingjet Propulsion Unit: The godwalker can fly at its normal movement rate, including the ability to hover in place if present. This ability is not powerful enough to be equipped on the larger godwalkers.

For 300 CP your godwalker may be akin to Without Repining, an ancient Ren invasion weapon that once overwhelmed Khamite armies or Gentleman Who Holds the Whip which serves better as a transport vehicle. Such vehicles have 6 components sorted into two or so broad categories of general purpose such as offence, mobility or defence. 

Last but not least, while normally godwalkers require a sophisticated theotechnical facility and a team of extremely well-trained engineers or a Godbound with the word Artifice to be properly maintained, through your investment here some mysterious benefactor has installed a Godwalker Repair Bay on any you buy here, fully functional without impacting other systems in defiance of conventional construction procedures. This set of tools permits the godwalker to perform a daily maintenance cycle on itself or another godwalker over the course of 6 hours of downtime-and in a pinch fully overhaul another godwalker or itself in a week, with no additional personnel or resources.

318,,300,Solarian robot and sword,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Magitek,"Because who wouldn’t want their own, slightly rusty and barnacle-crusted, giant magic robot? The she sword already looks like it’s made of fire and lightning, and is especially effective on ‘monsters’, with the wounds it inflicts on them only getting worse if untreated. Maybe, in future jumps, you can re-tune it to whatever the local monsters are, or get a companion to do so for you."
319,,300,Bazillions ,Bayonetta,Magitek,"The future is now, my friends, and the light ironically comes from a shroud of darkness. Four guns created by an unknown civilization, these laser guns work by shooting the target with an energy that has a high chance of locking the target in place. Naturally the more powerful a target is the less likely it will lock them, but the tendency to rip apart the molecular bonds keeping the target together upon death makes for a flashy demise."
320,,300,‘Futuristic’ Armory,Ragna Crimson,Magitek,"A pocket dimension that you can access at any time by sticking a special magical key in any door’s key hole that you find around. It’s always full of guns, similar to those that you would find in the early 21th century, except these ones have been all infused with a silver aura. But besides that, they really don’t have any special traits. In future jumps these weapons will still be as effective as they are to dragons with other creatures of magic."

As a result, it counters the magical effects of all songs when it is active. You can also adjust the frequency so that it only hurts magical beings such as mermaids, while the user and regular humans are immune to the effects."
323,,300,Fulldrive ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Performance limiters are used in mass-based technologies such as fighter craft and guns to prevent their users from killing themselves, due to either excessive G-forces, or injury from intense recoil, essentially preventing the user from passing a certain range where injury is potentially lethal. When it comes to magic, however, acceleration damage and recoil are often mitigated concerns, usually factored out during the design of the spell. The performance limiters in place are to prevent internal injury to a mage from overexertion on their Linker Core, which can damage it.

Fulldrive throws these limiters out the window, massively increasing power intake to run at the peak of what the Device is capable of, rather than it’s operator. Due to magic’s nature, this isn’t as immediately lethal as it is with mass-based technology, but the trade off for the massively increased power, speed and durability is a much higher chance for self-injury. Additionally, Fulldrive is a unique mode all it’s own, combining the benefits of all of the Device’s modes at once in a way that simply wouldn’t be possible under normal performance limitations. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
324,,300,Lunarian Defense Corps Armory ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Magitek,"A collection of standard issue weapons given to troops of the LDC, enough to keep a small army well-armed and supplied. Extraordinarily powerful examples, such as Toyohime’s fan, will not be available unless extensive research is done in the subject of Lunarian magitech, and created by the Jumper themselves.

Swirling in plumes and clouds, the brilliant golden Dust is pulled to you, gathering around and on you. While it may sound messy, are you really going to complain about being powdered in the most precious substance on the planet? Every mile you travel, you find roughly one Dust coin. Staying in one place gives you about 10 a day. This requires Dust to be present of course. It prefers dry, hot places, although it goes congeal around anomalies and buried in stone fields.

326,,300,Timeshift Orbs ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Magitek,"The Ancient Robots used this strange material to somehow generate the electricity they need to live. A deep blue crystal that when struck, opens a sliver of a portal into the past - or perhaps drags the past forward would be a better way to phrase it? Either way, these particularly shiny rocks are the basis for pretty much every bit of tech in this day and age. If only they hadn’t over-mined them to the point they ran out. Luckily for you, the thousand years or so they’ve been out of use for is more than enough time for them to regenerate, leaving you with a nice supply of them to experiment with.

"
327,,400,Demon God Manifestation: Demon's Extract,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"The
Demon’s Extract is a special type of Teigu above all others with the exception of the
Supreme Teigu itself, having been created by extracting the lifeblood of a Super
Class Danger Beast that lived in the Northern parts of the Empire and with the
capacity of granting the beast’s elemental power to the those that consume it as long
as they’re compatible with it. This Teigu grants its users the ability to almost instantly
freeze anything by reducing the kinetic energy of atoms, effectively making things
colder, as well as making them able to generate and manipulate ice out of nothing.
However, the hatred of the beast is still burning hot inside the extract, so, those that
consume it will need to have a mind strong enough to resist the destructive urges
that the Teigu brought with its power if they don’t want to lose their sanity.
For 400 CP, you receive a golden chalice containing enough of the blood to grant
the ice powers to a single person, giving them enough raw elemental power to match
the level of the Black Marlin. With this level of power, its user would be powerful
enough to quickly freeze an entire house, but they wouldn’t be able to evolve their
abilities in the same way as Esdeath did, so more complex constructs like the Ice
Cavalry and advanced abilities of higher order like Mahāpadma are far away from
their capacity.
For 800 CP, you receive an urn filled with the blood, equal to that Esdeath
consumed to acquire her own abilities. While you can use this amount of the
Demon’s Extract to give the powers to a dozen people, you can also use this to give
it to a single person, as apparently the amount of blood that the user drank
determines their level of raw power. At this level, they would be a match to Esdeath’s
raw power even without having the same reserve of spiritual energy, allowing them
to freeze an entire lake in seconds and giving them the potential to eventually
develop the extract’s more complex abilities.

Lastly, for 1000 CP, you receive the entire Demon’s Extract within a golden barrel.
There were an unknown number of people who drank the blood of the Demon's
Extract that could never be recovered, meaning that not even Esdeath gained
access to her Teigu’s full power. If a single person were to consume a barrel's worth
of Demon's Extract, their full power would be enough to freeze around 25% to 50%
of the Empire instantly or use the Ice Commander in Chief technique on a larger
scale before having to rest for a bit. Such a power essentially is more than enough to
mark the Demon’s Extract as a second Supreme Teigu, one that even surpasses the
raw power and utility of Shikoutazer. If you aren’t planning to acquire this power
yourself, I advise you to be cautious with who you give this power as, if they’re
unable to resist the insanity induced by it, you’ll need to deal with an insane and
uncontrollable walking disaster that can eventually freeze the entire world if left
loose."
328,,400,Unnamed Teigu: Divination Teigu,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Despite having little to no utility in the
middle of combat, this wand is definitely still a fearsome Teigu, possessing the ability
to predict/detect the direction of “bad luck”, “calamity energy” or whatever negative
force is behind misfortune itself, effectively letting its user to make predictions of the
future when it comes to disasters, enemy attacks, diseases and other similarly
negative events. Despite being limited to predicting misfortune instead of precise
events, or maybe specifically due to this limitation, its predictions are incredibly
accurate, even surpassing the Lord of the Path of Peace’s prophetic visions when it
comes to accuracy. In theory, a fighter wielding this Teigu could use it in battle to
detect their enemies’ bad luck in order to find openings and opportunities to attack
them, as well as predicting their misfortune to discover when they must flee."
329,,400,Water Dragon Possession: Black Marlin,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"This ring, created using a body
part of a dangerous aquatic beast that had the ability to control water, is capable of
granting its user the ability to control any water and water-based liquid around
themselves, including blood and poisons diluted on water/blood, by doing simple
hand gestures. It can manipulate huge amounts of water to form even gigantic
constructs, however, it only functions in the presence of exposed water or any other
form of liquid around, being unable to actually create water out of nothing and to
control it within closed containers, such as enemies’ bodies for example. Lastly, the
Black Marlin’s trump card, Blade of Blood, allows the user to manipulate their own
blood once they bled through an injury, making them able to harden and shape their
own blood in the form of spikes, needles or more commonly blades to cut the
opponent, with these blades being strong enough to clash with a Teigu."
330,,400,Magical Beast Transformation: Hekatonkheires,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Don’t judge a living
weapon by its initial cute appearance, as this biological, autonomous Teigu, which
might initially resemble a small cute dog, is able to assume a monstrous form when
ordered by its user, growing to a much larger size, greatly increasing its strength and
durability, as well as having the ability to also grow large, muscular arms to furiously
unleash a volley of destructive punches. Furthermore, like any other biological Teigu,
Hekatonkheires is able to regenerate if damaged, unless its core, an orb located
within its head, is destroyed.
It’s also able to sustain itself and its abilities by consuming large quantities of food
and even has its own trump card, Berserk, which would evolve the Teigu into a more
bestial form, further enhancing its physical abilities. In this form, Hekatonkheires’ roar
alone becomes powerful enough to stun opponents. Unfortunately, in addition to the
strain caused by this form, if overused, the Teigu may overheat and even become
unusable for a few days.
Finally, while it isn’t an innate property of Teigu but result of Stylish’s modifications,
your replica of Hekatonkheires will also possess an personal storage within its body,
allowing it to store even large weapons such as Judgment of the Ten Heavenly
Kings, that can then be retrieved back from its mouth."
331,,400,Thousand-Mile Flight: Mastema,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"This Teigu takes the form of a pair of
floating discs that sprout feathery wings which give the user the ability to fly for a
limited amount of time, capable of flying with high maneuverability and at high
speeds to the point that the user will be able to easily catch up to an Air Manta, as
well as giving them the ability to hover. To attack, the Teigu also enables its user to
shoot its feathers or launch one of the wings toward enemies, both easily capable of
piercing through flesh, but, due to its attack method, Mastema is only effective when
attacking at a long distance and is at a disadvantage in close range, however, to
counteract this weakness at close range, there is its trump card, God's Wings,
which alter the wings to be formed out of an ethereal substances rather than its
usual feathers, giving them the ability to reflect an opponent's attacks and to act as a
protective shield. It’s unknown the exact limits of this ability, as attacks powerful
enough probably can’t be reflected by it. Lastly, it’s also possible to use a single disc
and wing at once instead of necessarily needing to use both, as shown by the
governor of Joyou."
332,,400,Roman Artillery: Pumpkin,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"The only known Teigu to be technically
customizable, Pumpkin takes the form of a highly technological rifle that comes
together with a case that contains different parts in it, which could be detached and
attached to modify the Teigu. No kind of ammo is needed to load the rifle, as it uses
the user’s own spiritual energy as its ammunition and fires it in a concentrated
shockwave and, as their spiritual energy will increase according to their emotions,
one of the weapon’s main properties is that its power and range will also increase
proportionally to the level of danger its user is in.
Additionally, inside its case, there are multiple interchangeable parts that can be
used to modify its current mode and power (such as a long barrel for power, a sniper
barrel for distance and a machine gun barrel for multi-shot). It also comes with a few
other support devices like a scope for sniping and a detachable, high-tech scouter in
a compartment that fits around the user's eye.
Furthermore, Pumpkin’s trump card, High Output Blast Blade, is a blasting beam
so overwhelming that it can be used by the user as a giant blade, capable of cutting
almost anything in its path, but that only in long barrel mode can be used to its
maximum capabilities. This destructive power is unleashed according to how
passionate the emotions of its user were, but it overheats Pumpkin quickly, rendering
it unusable for a while if the Teigu isn’t receiving proper maintenance.
However, such a powerful weapon technically has a design flaw, as, due to not
having any safety limiters, if the user keep using it without caring about its energy
consumption, Pumpkin will keep draining the user’s spiritual energy until consuming
each remaining bit of energy and, while it won’t be lethal, it’ll still make the user fall
on a coma for an undetermined period of time, which may last from weeks to years.
So, if you aren’t going to be this Teigu’s user, warn whoever they are to be cautious
with this weapon’s maximum power."
333,,400,Absolute Limitation: Erastone,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"The Teigu surely have an incredible
power, but even the First Emperor knew that it wouldn't be wise to create such
weapons without a safeguard in the case of them being used against the throne.
This safeguard is the Anti-Teigu Erastone, a crown with a special jewel hidden inside
its center that, when activated, is exposed and shines a light upon the opponent
within range of it. Any Teigu exposed to this light will be destroyed (or at least left
unusable for a long time in the case of a Teigu like Demon’s Extract that lacks an
actual separate structure outside the user) together with the jewel crystal itself, after
which it shatters upon use. However, unlike the affected Teigu, the crystal can
regenerate over time, giving it a weekly usage. Post-jump, Erastone’s power will be
enhanced, allowing it to also counter other magical artifacts rather than being limited
to only Teigu, but only temporarily render useless instead of destroying them. Lastly,
while it isn’t mentioned, it’s very probable that a Supreme Teigu would be completely
unaffected by Erastone’s power."
334,,400,Kiriichimonji,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Arguably the most dangerous Shingu of all with a power
that can make some unaware people to easily mistake it for an actual Teigu, as this
fearsome katana, while it isn’t necessarily an one cut killer, still possess an ability
worthy of an assassin like Akame. Any wounds inflicted using Kiriichimonji will never
heal, regardless if the victims uses medicines, bandages or special ointments to try
to mend and close the wounds, with the cuts and injuries inflicted by it continuing to
bleed until the victim dies. Not even a natural regenerative factor can bypass this
effect, but, in theory, a Teigu with healing abilities, a regeneration powered by some
supernatural force and other forms of healing magic might be able to heal these
wounds, but it’ll still be far harder to heal than regular injuries. Otherwise, the katana
has no other abilities, but, in the right hands, it’s more than enough to be one of the
deadliest weapons in this world."
335,,400,Coffins,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Magitek,"You have a mobile console that controls three of Hishigata’s
“coffin” mecha, which are a strange combination between science, magic, and esper. They’re
large and bulky, but besides being a three story robot, each one has access to a Level 5 esper
power, which puts it on par with a battle cruiser, and they can become even more effective by
networking with one another. Oh, and they can copy people’s memories. These Coffins retain
upgrades, and come preinstalled with whatever three powers you want them to, though you may
swap the bodies out later if you think better of one."
336,,400,Sword of Damocles,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Magitek,"One of the powerful Swords of Eden, identical to the one wielded
by Deimos. It grants a large boost to leadership and charisma when wielded, and also allows for
a few forms of energy manipulation, allowing the user to fire energy blasts, as well as create
energy barriers. Finally, it provides a large boost to the physical attributes of the wielder."
337,,400,Pyramid,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Magitek,"A device used for computing possible futures and observing memories of the
past. When a future is calculated by the relic, it provides information about the steps that need
to be taken and the events that need to happen for the future to be realized. Lesser minds can
end up overwhelmed by the information provided from this. The various triangles that make up
its surface can be removed and held by individuals. With this version, the memories of those
holding or in close contact with a triangle can be read by someone using the ‘base’ of the
pyramid, even from a great distance, and future calculations can still be performed, even when
a triangle is missing, though the more triangles are missing, the less precise the calculated
future is. All triangles can be summoned back to the base instantly if desired."
338,,400,Olympos Project Orb,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Magitek,"The Olympos Project was a project by the Isu to transform
humans into hybrid beasts with energy based abilities. These orbs were the mechanism by
which the transformation occurred, fusing with the target’s body and altering their shape. There
are six different potential forms, which can be freely activated and deactivated by the user, and won’t leave the user
trapped in a monstrous form.
- Cyclops: This transformation turns the user into a massive humanoid, with the orb
replacing the user’s eyes and taking the form of a large singular eye on their face. The
user gains a massive increase to both strength and toughness, and their eye allows
them to ‘scan’ the structure of objects or buildings and identify weakpoints.
- Minotaur: This transformation turns the user into a large human-bull hybrid, with the orb
itself forming into one of the two horns on top of the user’s head. This form comes with a
tremendous increase in strength, as well as the ability to generate powerful shockwaves
while charging or stomping on the ground.
- Gorgon: This transformation increases the users size and turns their hair into a nest of
snakes, concealing the orb within the snakes. It grants the ability to project a beam of
petrifying light from the user’s eyes, which will turn targets to stone. Petrified targets can
be remotely controlled by the user when nearby.
- Sphinx: This transformation turns the user into a hybrid created by mixing parts of a
human, eagle, lion, and snake. It also greatly boosts their intelligence and their ability to
interface with various ancient artifacts.
- Cerberus: This transformation turns the user into a three-headed dog, and grants them
the ability to breath flames. Despite having three heads, the user is ability to still perfectly
coordinate their thoughts and actions between the heads.
- Hekatonchires: This transformation turns the user into a multi-armed giant, giving them
a large bonus to body coordination to allow them to use all of their limbs effectively."
339,,400,Lantern Ring,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Magitek,"The Lantern Corps are a set of organizations known for their ability to harness the
Emotional Spectrum. The most famous of which is the Green Lantern Ring Corp who
harness the light of Willpower. Aside from them there are a number of other Lantern
Corps. These include the Sinestro Corps (Fear), Blue Lantern (Hope), the Red Lanterns
(Anger), the Star Sapphires (Love), the Orange Lanterns (Greed), Black Lanterns
(Death), and the Indigo Lanterns (Compassion). By purchasing this you can claim one of
the various Lantern Corps rings for yourself. You will receive both the ring itself and a
power battery allowing you to charge it. The lantern ring lets you generate energy
constructs, fly through space, greatly increases your durability, and provides a few other
advantages. Lastly, you may purchase this multiple times to acquire multiple rings. After
all, legends say that by gathering seven rings from the standard groups you can unlock
the power of a hidden far more powerful lantern corp. Maybe you could find out if that
legend is true."
340,,400,Tenshintai,Bleach,Magitek,"Normally, the process of attaining Bankai, the second and final release of a Shinigami’s Zanpaktou, is
a long and arduous process. It is said to take a minimum of ten years in order for even the most
prodigious to unlock, and a hundred years to master. Some people don’t have time for that. The
Tenshintai is a flat, but elaborate doll that is vaguely the height and shape of a man. This device
developed by Urahara Kisuke, is used to potentially attain Bankai within three days. A hopeful
shinigami must stab the doll with their Zanpaktou, causing it to forcibly manifest their Zanpaktou’s
Spirit, which in itself would ordinarily be a difficult task. This manifestation is able to last for three
days, during which the Zanpaktou will rigorously test their wielder in a manner befitting the spirit’s
character. Should the wielder pass the test, they will attain Bankai, but should they fail to succeed in
three days then the Tenshintai will return back to its original shape as the spirit once again goes
dormant. It is advised not to attempt the test twice, as there are “dangerous consequences.” This Tenshintai has expanded functionality beyond Zanpaktou training; allowing for an extreme
three day test that can potentially allow the user to awaken other dormant releases or
transformations they have the potential for. As with attempts to attain Bankai however, there’s
danger to one’s life during the testing period, and potentially lethal consequences to pushing
beyond three days of testing. "
341,,400,7th Ark,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"An ancient defence platform, kept afloat by a graviton core. There’s nothing inside except the core keeping it afloat, life support systems and sensors to show the surroundings. With the right knowledge you might be able to get it to move, but there’s nothing it has for defences except...oh...

A metallic cactuar rests in a dark corner of the Ark. It appears the 7th Ark was a battle platform, designed to mass manufacture and air drop Cactuars onto a specified location. If you had the energy for it, it could create 10 – 15 cactuars per hour, and store a total of 500 cactuars in its docking bays."
342,,400,Beacon of Counterattack,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"You have a spare beacon that you can deploy, and all allies in the vicinity are immediately placed under the effect of a short lasting inertial barrier. The barrier is weak, but for a short time it absorbs damage and heals the ally. 

Might just be what it takes to turn the tide."
343,,400,Strike Team,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"If it was not enough to just send you, your commanding office just airdropped three drones onto the field. The three drones have excellent formation combat tactics (equivalent to a full offensive paradigm shift), use SMGs and grenades – but they’ll adapt to your orders accordingly.

They won’t do anything too sophisticated though, so you can’t order them to pillage corpses or something hideous."
344,,400,Cannon Construct,Cradle V1,Magitek,"You gain one of Madame Geisha’s personal constructs, a cannon that uses 8 different bindings to fire the first giant cluster grenade cradle has ever seen. Reloads once a jump."
345,,400,Architect of Death,Dies Irae,Magitek,"The dead need not remain such. Not entirely. You may not have the power of the Gold but you can make a cruel facsimile of life, provided you have the right materials available. You have the ability to re-animate the dead with science, with just their bodies or by placing a spare soul into that body. The bodies will possess the abilities they did in life and the souls emplaced into a dead body will also transfer their abilities over, though if all you desire is mindlessly loyal soldiers you should avoid mucking with souls. It’s possible to use this process to combine multiply bodies and even multiple souls into a single form, combining their power and abilities and create a hive mind of sorts, though only one soul can be in command at a time. "
346,,400,The Science of the Soul,The Games We Play,Magitek,"The human soul is the oldest and most mysterious subject discussed by man. In this
world, its existence is a proven fact, and anything that exists can be subjected to the
pitiless processes of science. Like the Angels of ancient Babel, you are greatly skilled
in the study and understanding of the soul, be it humans, animals or stranger.
Just as someone would test and interact with chemicals or bodies or metals or
whatever, you find yourself capable of designing devices and methods that can
interact with souls, and things like them on the same level. You can measure them,
diagnose them, operate on them... and do pretty much anything else you can imagine
to them.

With time and some research, you might even be able to construct your own custom
made souls from free Sephirot like the Angels once did, perhaps even custom
designing it’s abilities in the far future."
347,,400,Dust Bomb,RWBY,Magitek,"This cylindrical shaped Bomb was developed by top Atlesian Scientists. It has distinct similarities with the ones used by the White Fang but is much bigger and MUCH more destructive. Its interface is made of Hard-Light Dust, similar to that of a Scroll, in which the bomb could be set for release, but can also be detonated remotely. It has a large and devastating blast radius, being capable of destroying all of Mantle in one go. You get one Bomb and after being used, you gain a new one in the next Jump."
348,,400,Dust Working,RWBY,Magitek,"Dust isn’t just to be used to fight and combat the darkness of the World. It has so much more potential than that. It is able to power machines, yes entire Kingdoms by itself and can have so much more utility outside even that. And you know how to do that. You know how to work with Dust in optimal ways. This includes imbuing it into machines and using it for other technological advancements. However should the situation call for it, you can also imbue weapons with it and even weave it into clothing. It is still pretty useful for blowing stuff up after all. Post-Jump this translates to any other sort of fantastical energy source or magical material."
349,,400,P.E.N.N.Y.,RWBY,Magitek,"Oh? Well this is curious. You are neither Human, nor Faunus, nor Grimm. You are an Android. Created by a Mastermind of an Atlesian Scientist, you are a machine with the sentience of a human and even the soul of one, allowing you to use Aura. This has given you many gifts. First of, your strength and durability matches and even exceeds that of seasoned Huntsman, being capable of even pushing Amity Tower. You can fly with a set of Rocket Thrusters on your feet, have night and infrared vision and can survive injuries as severe as dismemberment and even decapitation, so long as your cores storing your personality and memory remain intact. Should you do die however, you may be resurrected by your Creator, a process which drains their Aura however so its unlikely you will be able to come back more than once. Your body can keep on being upgraded, potentially making you even more powerful with a bright mind to help you. As a Weapon you can wield a set of 10 small Swords, linked to you by thin cables and allowing you to manipulate them in combat, even making it possible to channel a beam of energy powerful enough to pulverize many kinds of Grimm. Lastly you possess a self destruct mode... perhaps you will find some use for it someday? Lets hope not. There are some downsides to this however. Being an Android you are susceptible to being hacked by outside forces. Amplifying your Aura and an extraordinary amount of willpower would help keep these hacking attempts at bay but the risk is there. You might want to amp up your firewalls. As a Drop-In this will surely make you stand out but should you opt to have a history in this World, you will be the sibling of one Penny Polendina, the only other of your kind. Like Grimm and Faunus, this body becomes an Alt Form."
350,,400,Silhouette Gear,Knight’s and Magic,Magitek,"A powered-suit that is fitting for a person as it amplifies the user's strength and speed while wearing it. It allows the user to carry items that weighs several tonnes and run at subsonic speeds. It is also equipped with weapons suitable for sieging fortified fortress and thrusters which allows it to jump from ground to the roof of a several floor building. Unlike the original, it has its own built-in internal engine allowing the user to use it without wasting their own mana reserves."
351,,400,Junction System,Final Fantasy VIII,Magitek,"Invented by the legendary scientist Dr. Odine, the Junction System is a method by which a normal human draws special energy from draw points or monsters to gain a magic like force called para-magic. Para-magic can be cast as spells, but each draw only grants a limited amount of casts per spell, per monster. These spells run the full range of what you'd expect from combat magic, including healing, attacking, status inflicting, and buffing spells of various kinds and strengths, along with a few more exotic spells. Para-magic can be stored indefinitely. A more advanced application is the Junctioning itself, in which a person attaches a Guardian Force (GF), a kind of elemental spirit, to themselves and uses their power to Junction specific para-magic stocks to their individual 'stats', using the magic to greatly boost their attributes or apply special effects like poison or sleep to their attacks, all of which can be swapped around or removed at will.

The increase is tied directly to how many casts of a particular spell are stored, up to a total of 100, which are not consumed or otherwise diminished while Junctioned. However, what stats can be boosted are determined by the experience and strength of the GF, which must be increased through frequent summoning and training, and which are restricted to the limited stats supported by the Junction System. Unfortunately, the GFs take up residence inside of the user's mind in the portion where they store their memories, slowly eroding the details of their history until it has induced total amnesia of events predating five years or so in the past. There have even been cases where the user forgot they had a GF Junctioned at all. This drawback has made Junctioning controversial and unpopular outside of SeeD. On the bright side, you get 2 GFs of your own with this purchase. See the companion section for details."
352,,400,Mana Detector Satellite,Solo Leveling,Magitek,"A marvelous piece of magitech developed by the Japanese government. This machine allows for real time reading of the mana levels in any location throughout the world. This is very useful in a world where walking natural disasters and two-legged weapons of mass-destruction emit very distinctive quantities of mana, allowing not only to point their location at all times, but also to measure their level of power.

This satellite will be deployed in any future worlds you visit, and you can access and direct it through any computer or phone you have, by an already preinstalled application. Additionally, in future worlds, the satellite will tune to detect any kind of super-natural energies and entities, functioning in the same way as it treats mana in this world."
353,,400,Singular Purpose,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Now, this is dangerous, you somehow managed to get your hands on not just a Singularity of a Wing, past or present, but also its full specifications in intricate detail. Whether this is something like F Corp’s “Fairies”, R Corp’s Hatchery design, or however the hell T Corp’s singularity works, the Singularity is fully revealed to you with the Wing and Beholders currently none the wiser but if you reveal that you know about it then chances are the Beholders will find out, and you really don’t want the Head to know you have this if it’s from an existing Wing. Regardless if they do find out then get ready to either run to the Outskirts or be constantly hounded by Arbiters, Claws, and legions of corporate security and Fixers. Though if you pick a fallen Wing’s singularity then you probably won’t be in as much danger, the Head still wants you to pay up for the right to have that, but you aren’t worth sending Arbiters or Claws immediately.

There’s a list of Singularities in the Notes, each purchase lets you choose one of them, and you cannot pick any of the Head’s Singularities(A, B, and C Corp)."
354,,400,Ironclad Brother ,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Bionics are just as important to the Workshops as making weapons and armor, for Fixers and syndicates using them accelerates or skips the process of getting used to a weapon or learning how to best use it. Remember though, the City can’t run on only Fixers and Syndicates, so really anybody who can afford new organs or limbs can get one tailored specifically for their line of work. Your models are pretty high-end, at least internally, from an outside perspective they look completely normal, perhaps too much like from a medical textbook. But when you need to do so these organs can perform their function at about ten times the effectiveness or efficiency of their natural counterparts. You get six organs/limbs with the first purchase and four each later purchase, for each you can pick whether it gets more effective or efficient.

355,,400,Scientific Complex,Bibliomania,Magitek,"This is a massive sub dimension containing a massive multistore scientific complex which updates every jump to contain more scientific resources, advanced tech to work with and has several ways things can be stored. The complex is the size of New York City with the height and width but is much more complex, containing automaton assistants and a loyal AI to assist with any experiments and construction. Just with the base automation of this complex you can have the place build massive tanker ships by the dozen every 3 months. The resources in this complex are infinite and updated with any and all scientific resources and tech in the worlds you jump into, though nothing that is unique to the point only 1 or 2 of them exist, though 3 or more of any tech is automatically added to the archives and can be built rapidly. The AI automatically makes use of any new tech to enhance the complex fully and within 2 weeks teh whole place will be as advanced as they can be and will always be more efficient. The complex also has a 10 to 1 time dilation making 10 hours in the complex only 1 out of it. There are various garages, hangars and mech/spaceship shelter complexes within the complex allowing you to take out anything you build up to the size of 300 meters in radius. The place always has power and has various rest rooms, break rooms and sleeping quarters. It also enhances scientific curiosity and learning rate for scientific endevors. While it will update any time a new scientific or mundane material is made/discovers in the jumps you are in, magical and mythical materials have to be manually added but once added they gain an infinite supply like all other materials(effectively if you add a gram of Vibranium, you’d effectively have more than all of Wakanda.)"

This custom-designed motorcycle is durable enough to shrug off small-arms fire, fast enough to outrun killer robots, and maneuverable enough to turn on a dime. You may control this cycle like an extension of your own body, and combat undertaken while riding this magnificent bike will not hinder you in the slightest. It’s powerful engine is fueled by a mako fuel cell, ensuring you’ll never run out of gas. Your balance, perception, and reaction time will all be in sync with this motorcycle, no matter what your enemies throw at you. Ride hard!"
357,,400,Guard Dog,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Magitek,"Shinra has decided to protect their investment...by giving you one of their advanced attack robots! You can model your mechanical minion after any of Shinra’s creations, such as the Scorpion Sentinel, the high-speed MotorBall, or even the titanic Airbuster. All robots are formidable weapons platforms, but you can choose to trade heavy armor for enhanced mobility and visa-versa. Perfect for protecting one of Shinra’s top assets; you!

Alternatively, you might want a more organic guardian. Maybe Rufus bred two war hounds, or perhaps Dr. Hojo cooked up something else for you. Either way, your new animal friend has been enhanced by either cybernetics, magic, or both. Whether you want a Darkstar with a Materia collar, a rocket-powered Chocobo, or something else entirely, your loyal companion will serve as a potent protector."
358,,400,Getting With The Times,High School DxD,Magitek,"The whole ‘brimstone and fire’ thing is great and all, but the sad fact is that humans have changed much over the centuries, and so it falls onto the supernatural world to change with them. You’re something of a pioneer, able to combine both technology and magic together seamlessly to create unique inventions of superscience...things like a hatred-powered robot, or blueprints for something based off of the Evil Piece system. With a little time and ingenuity, who knows what you’ll put together?"
359,,400,Drone Hub,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"Interesting choice. Are you familiar with Cait Sith, Jumper? The little cat riding on the back of a fat Moogle that claims to be a fortune teller? He's actually one of the leads of Shrina mentally controlling a robotic double. Taking from his example, this item consists of two portions. First, it's a psychically-linked mental interface you attach to yourself, letting you mentally control and direct a robot linked to the device. The second thing is the robot in question, which can be any sort of appearance or design matching the choices of the Unusual Biology perk. This robot will behave with a personality mirroring yours when left on automatic, but will otherwise follow mental commands and directions as though they were an extension of your body. In addition, they share all of your combat skills and abilities, though obviously they can only use equipment on their person. I hope you have the multitasking needed to make good use of this. "

Why not add future worlds to that grim total? You receive a special copy of Mako Reactor blueprints, detailing their construction and how to apply their principles to any planet with life on it. Even without the Lifestream existing in future worlds, you know how to make these reactors draw Mako out of worlds they are built on, slowly killing said world as you gain a convenient energy source. Build enough at a high enough output and the world will not be able to recover, eventually dying completely. These can also be adapted to instead produce energy from specific resources, although it tends to generate much less efficient results. You care about your bottom line, don't you?"
361,,400,Spirit Origin Enhancement Device,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"A relic stolen away by one of the worst rogues in Saber history. The Spirit Origin Enhancement Device is a portable chamber, small enough to fit in a ship’s lounge, that is powered by large amounts of Artorium. With enough fuel, it can create an exact copy of any Spirit Origin placed within, allowing it to create full clones of any Servant or other spiritual being. What? It doesn’t work on anyone but a Saber? That doesn’t seem like much of an issue. Who would want to make a clone of anything but another Saber? Especially when copies are able to combine to increase the power of the original, as clones can be programmed to lack wills of their own. Allowing such power in the hands of a dirty lancer is just unthinkable."

It might look kinda junky but this ship can cross the galaxy in just weeks without warping and it’s warp drive is really top of the line! It only crashes now and then, usually into some alternate timeline or strange situation. You lost the instructions but it’s entirely possible the warp drive actually does work for time travel, if you can figure out what all the buttons do. 

The ship also comes with cooking and laundry facilities but they don’t really live up to what you hoped for in such a cutting edge rocketship. The weapons sure do though, powerful auto-cannons and missile launchers that can obliterate most servants on a direct hit. There’s even a wrist-bound remote targeter for you to call in artillery from the ship. "
363,,400,Dread Captain Nikola,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"Technology has gotten a little eclectic, given that it almost always comes from the deranged minds of the various Casters across the galaxy. You might cross one sector and go from seeing shining space-age metropoli on one world to a steampunk space empire on another. You’ve a mind to keep up with the various genii found across the stars, with a general understanding of most common cosmic-age technology. You do have the usual specialty though, a field in which you can produce all kinds of wonders. 

An outdated electrical studies major who somehow took the inferior to Artorium energy and created technology to terrorise half the galaxy, raining down lightning as if like Zeus himself. A steam obsessed scientist who revived the ancient art to create a star empire of steam powered robots and ships. Even a Servant scientist who studies the Saint Graphs themselves, to learn to modify and manipulate such things. There’s not much a smart man can’t accomplish in this galaxy and age, not with enough time and resources.

Instead of just granting you a tech-base of only the Past Era of Humanity in this world, I have decided to give you a much greater boon. This is a complete, self-updating archive of all technology to ever exist in the past, present, and future in this universe.

Except for a cup holder. The suit is extensive enough to warrant bare minimum a month of training in its use, one can be expected to take a year even. Fortunately for you, this suit comes with its own training.

The battlesuit comes with all the latest post-modern functionality, integrated comms, energy readings, signal hijacking, holo displays for information and video calls, the works. Additionally, this suit provides flight and substantial physical increases on top of energy regeneration. It comes with two functions unique to this battlesuit: The first of which is a skin layer barrier at all times preventing a slip in attention from breaking through your guard. The second of which is an ‘ultimate attack’.

After you have reached your peak, you can push past it and drive into an even further ultimate state. While the state is unique to you and enhances every aspect of your powers, this is a high-risk high-reward activation. It rapidly drains the battlesuit’s power, giving you limited time to put this state to use, after which it will be no more effective than a normal battlesuit until it has had time to recharge. Furthermore, this battlesuit puts a very heavy strain on the users body and can rapidly drain the unprepared of their energy and cause them to collapse until they are used to it."

If you agree, then good, because if you pick this, then you get a huge army of clones (10,000). They respawn automatically in the next jump if killed somehow. Additionally, if your main body dies, your consciousness automatically goes to one of these clones, and converts said clone into an exact copy of your original body, down to the conceptual level. These clones can also convert themselves into an exact copy of any person they touch, down to the genetic and behavioral data.

Note: This doesn’t affect their loyalty or synchronicity with you, only how they act while they are transformed. And if said person that the clones are imitating dies while the clone is imitating them, their consciousness will transfer over to the clone body instead.

Note #2: I don’t know how, but the Soulium Clones can fool genetic tests, as they seem to have the exact genetic data you have, but do not even have truly flesh-and-blood bodies, as their bodies are composed of Soulium."
369,,400,Moon Ring,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"How did you- you know what, never mind, there’s enough shenanigans going on as is. Anyways, this is a prototype that won’t be conceived until a few years in the future, based on the Selene; a band that can be worn either on the arm or wrist that converts excess Honkai energy into regular electric energy.

While it can serve as a glorified battery or alleviate a Honkai infection long enough for medical attention, its primary combat purpose is to enhance the wearer’s capabilities via one of its four cores, which are charged by said conversion, then being able to be manually triggered before having to recharge again. Think of this White Heat as a “super mode” of sorts, though they can’t be switched between in the midst of combat as the systems need a bit of time to readjust to the new configuration.
- The Basic ATK core simply empowers your basic strikes, letting you hit much harder and faster and possibly expand your moveset as well. It’s simple but effective.
- The Ultimate core instead charges up high-power moves and techniques, sometimes adding additional effects (somehow) and otherwise letting those high-commitment moves hit well above their weight class.
- The QTE core is variable, based on your equipment; the better and more advanced it is, the bigger the boost it does. As for what it does, generally speaking it’ll let you interfere with and enter fights better, though how it manifests tends to be different based on the loadout.
- The Evasion core rounds out the Moon Ring, and boosts your evasive and counterattack skills. Rather simple, I know...

But these boosts, even on their own, are massive, especially for a Valkyrie, can easily overwhelm even one of the Sky People, and if you aren’t satisfied it also comes with slots for custom chips that give passive effects (a set of which is included) to give some variety to each core.

Your Moon Ring is further upgraded on top of that; it doesn’t just allow a Honkai-afflicted person to fight as per normal, but can outright stop any further corruption and degradation while it’s on. The anonymous genius who did it even made it so that you could even have all four cores active at once in White Heat alongside a vastly more efficient battery (bordering on downright infinite for all but the most prolonged of conflicts) eventually with some of your own tinkering, but you can’t exactly be wily-nily with sharing; once someone wears a Moon Ring, it locks onto their genetics and does not allow anyone else to use it.

They seem to have accounted for this and have hooked you up with a once-in-a-lifetime deal of one new Moon Ring each month."

Fork out the cash and you can replace whole body parts, even your own head, with robotics. If metal isn't your thing, how about attaching bionic equipment? This perk ensures that modifications made to your body safely come across with a 100% success rate. No matter what changes are made to you, you will not suffer body dimorphism and can operate as if you've always been this way. This goes both ways: You'll also have advanced knowledge on the human body and the sciences behind this kind of modification, so this perk comes into effect on the people you work on."

Further, you can enhance or upgrade items from other jumps to use this same power source. If you take Cyborg Hindu Godbody, you may construct Demigod cybernetics for other people. After the jump concludes, you may also build Mantra Reactors.

Demigod Atelier allows you to create any mantra-­powered or integrated device, up to and including the vast fleets of Shinkoku Tratstrium, the heavenly vessels of the divine armies, and even the anti­Gohma platform Brahmastra.

Well, no more! This train themed treasure trove is here for your temporal troubles. This box is constantly being fed TimeTrack’s end product: collected time. For each real-time second that passes, it gains a second of time to be spent in enclosed and treated spaces. At least, a second proportional to a modest room. It can be compressed into smaller spaces for rushing artistry, or spread thinly across larger ones for more industrial purposes. As a bonus, there are a few smaller scale blueprints included to use your reserves. The first is forsomething resembling a stun gun, which injects copious time into those on the receiving end's mind. This is poor for mental health, barring non- human mentalities which can process however many years of isolation compressed into an instant properly. The second is more civilian: boxes within which to age whatever needs aging, like wines or cheeses. They’re self sanitizing, and keep interior conditions consistent. "
381,,400,Augmentation: Star of the City,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"This is the point where the cybernetics find themselves less limited due to availability, and more due to the fact that if they were to be implanted in a normal person they’d be torn to pieces. Though these also tend to be masterpieces, single works of art unlikely to be replicated. At this point you probably have at least some bits of a singularity involved, as your attacks sweep the entire battlefield into a sea of flame under your control, or your gloves hold a near endless array of the finest weapons from numerous workshops and can be overclocked to deliver a truly stupendous barrage of attacks upon a single foe from all the weapons contained within.

With enough DNA samples (can be yours or from anyone), you can make a clone or a hundred, they will inherit all the basic powers and talents from the original. The machinery allows for preventive modifications, in case you want them to start with certain knowledge, rapidly grow up to their prime age, change their original sex, or just make them more submissive to your authority.

You see, it can be used to ‘free’ whatever soul or spirit is being trapped in some item, like a Sacred Gear, for example. However, this can also be used in living beings with their permission, at which point it would transform and ‘trap’ them into some item to augment others, like a wolf familiar becoming a collar that makes the user into a werewolf, or a phoenix bird could become a ring that gives the wearer fire magic and night-eternal regeneration powers."

389,,400,The Blessings of Technology,Fate/Strange Fake,Magitek,"These are modern times, and while the enemies of the faith have adapted to them, it is only to be expected that the Lord’s devotees do the same. And thus, you were born to be the Lord’s iron fists.

Around seventy percent of your body has been replaced with a mix of near-futuristic technology hybridized with a vast collection of mystic codes. This makes you superhumanly strong, even more so than your average experienced executor, enough to tear through walls with ease, you can catch all the bullets from a machine gun fired at you with just a hand, and your arms can extend for a few meters, and you even have blessed rocket launchers and Black Key-like blades hidden inside of your extremities. One of your eyes has been replaced with an artificial eye that allows you to perfectly see from hundreds of meters of distance. What’s more, since this artificial Mystic Eye is powered by both technology and magic, you may only use the functionalities of the technological side to avoid being detected by magical senses when observing. This applies to all of your modifications: as they are both of technology and magic, it seems that you can hide them from all but the most powerful senses of both, until you reveal the true might of your blessed steel reinforced body. 

You are truly powerful even when facing humans, but when it comes to facing the enemies of mankind, specially those that fall under the bloodsucker category, your blows could be as devastating as a nuclear weapon would be to non mystical creatures, as one would expect from the origin of your body.

This blend of technology and sacred rites also confers you a special privilege: Befitting of an executor of the Lord’s will, you also have the knowledge of how every gadget on your body works, how to replicate the process in others, and even how to repair and improve your own body, integrating whatever new magics o technology you happen to know.

These enigmatic devices maintain the natural laws of the realms and preserve them against the constant hunger of Uncreated Night. Once they were tended by the angelic Host, legion upon legion of celestial beings to preserve their perfect function and mystic order. Now they run down in slowing cycles, those that have not been broken, scavenged, or sabotaged by Heaven's bitter exiles.

Each engine maintains a particular natural law or geographic structure for a particular realm. There may be an engine for a particular mountain, or for the natural progression of seasons, or for the happiness that wells in a mother's heart at her newborn infant's smile. Engines can stand responsible for vast concepts such as ""gravity"" or tiny details such as the color of sunlight on gold. This is such an engine, fully functioning. Though if you wish, it may be a minor one, for say the sound of the Letter J on your ears.

You could possibly study it, or perhaps salvage it for spare parts if you’re really so desperate. And while the divine energy the engine constantly outputs cannot be channelled into Dominion, perhaps in time you may find other uses for it like recreating a safer form of the power parasite gods obtain or enhancing existing artifacts.

You may purchase additional engines.

391,,400,Godwalker(Tier 3),Godbound,Magitek,"A relic of ancient theotechnical research, godwalkers are an offshoot of the arts that forged the Made Gods. Once, these great war machines of polished steel and glowing sigils laid waste to the battlefields of the Former Empires. Few now remain in any kind of good condition-and the machine you now wield is an exception among exceptions. Operating by drawing divine sympathies between their shape, their function and their pilots each Godwalker has two key components: A chakra engine, the locus of its divine fire and the interface between its artifices and the celestial forces that power it which determines what manner of and how many divine components can be attached to it. And a sacred armature, the basic chassis of the godwalker which can provide different advantages through the symbolic principles it reifies-including vast transport space, integral flight ability or simple sturdy construction. A godwalker shaped like a vehicle is peerless in transporting its writers and destroying those who impede it’s path, while some experimental varieties were even designed as thrones or libraries.

As for the armaments of the godwalkers, it is no exaggeration to say their component can mimic many lesser Gifts on a scale greater than mankind. While some components simply permit a godwalker to emulate any Gift related to perception, communication, movement, transformation, creation, alteration, defence and protection or attacking and certain forms of harm including the universal smitings of Godbound centred on the great machine itself more unique abilities of a similar scale have also been created. Some examples are provided below:
- Anchor of the Holy Gate: The godwalker acts as the destination node of a teleportation gateway. After 24 hours of ritual purification that must be free of all blasphemous behaviour, with a day’s commitment of divine effort a godwalker can let in up to a hundred infantrymen’s worth of mass at a time to a designation location.
- Devourer of Armies: Torrents of lethal sacred energy blast from the godwalker, scorching entire battalions to death.
- Banner of Zeal: The godwalker ignites an invincible defence against any mental effect that would stop the pilot from attacking enemies, and bolsters the valor of nearby allies
- Force Projection Jewel: The godwalker strikes down targets with pinpoint precision, up to a mile
- Halo of Wrath: The godwalker sears nearby enemies with a penumbra of coruscating divine energies.
- Advance of the Iron Tide: So long as the godwalker moves in a straight line, they have an invincible defence against all hostile effects and can phase harmlessly through solid barriers. This invincibility can be maintained as long as it does nothing but keep moving forward until, presumably, it’s enemies are destroyed.
- Clavis of Night: After ten minutes to “load”, the godwalker punches a hole into Uncreated Night. It is advisable to first scout out the theurgic coordinates of your desired destination through which you can use the godwalker to arrive at over a week’s journey in exchange for bypassing the usual obstacles, lest you risk eternally wandering within the void.
- Kinetic Sump Vortex: The godwalker halves the movement rate and dampens the initiative of all nearby foes, though powerful ones may be able to resist it for a short while.
- Noble Path Generator: The godwalker generates solid footing regardless of the substance or lack thereof beneath it. Oceans and empty pits alike are no obstacle to its passage.
- Pious Construction Array: The godwalker’s capacity for fixing or building mundane structures and goods is enhanced, permitting it to do the work of hundreds of skilled craftsmen.
- Rainbow Bridge Emitter: The godwalker uses divine effort to summon a thirty-foot wide bridge between any two points in sight within 1000 feet of each other that shares it’s durability. The bridge permits travel no matter how steep it is, and users cannot be knocked off while they are alive.
- Reactive Adaption Unit: The godwalker wields divine effort to make it immune to a specific Gift or other power for a scene.
- Stiletto Sutra Projector: The resonances of a ruinous sacred text open gaping holes of nonbeing into a living being within 2000 feet. While highly effective, it is too inefficient to wield against entire armies and is ineffective on unliving targets.
- The Awl of Shifting Space: The godwalker can teleport at a distance up to twice its normal movement rate, to anywhere it can see or has formerly occupied. This teleportation leaves behind physical bindings or restraints, but not magical ones-at least of this world.
- Transmutation Field: With time and sacred mudras, the godwalker can transform large amounts of non-magical matter into another non-magical, non precious substance of equal mass. This ability generally takes 12 hours or so of labour.
- Polymorphic Shaping Core: The godwalker can alter its shape within its general dimensions, gaining a faster travel rate by land or sea by sprouting wheels or propellers for example. It can also stretch out it’s matter to form long ranged manipulators, or form into a defensive tank-like shape. While this component is not sophisticated enough to permit flight, it can shrink the entire godwalker down into something the size of a horse.
- Volley Negation Shield: When attacked by multiple strikes in rapid succession, only the first can strike the godwalker-and even then, if a foe dedicates it’s full focus on the great machine. The others automatically miss.
- Trump of Judgement: The godwalker launches a building-flattening sonic barrage out at everything within 200 feet, crumbling any non-magical solid construction to powder and dealing severe harm to all nearby living beings.
- Wingcutter Malediction: A beam of congealed curses strikes down airborne enemies, whether they come in flocks or as individuals. For some reason this weapon cannot be evaded by mundane means, but cannot be targeted at terrestrial foes.
- Wingjet Propulsion Unit: The godwalker can fly at its normal movement rate, including the ability to hover in place if present. This ability is not powerful enough to be equipped on the larger godwalkers.

And for 400 CP your godwalker is at least as powerful as The Gatekeeper, the vehicle of an undying guardian created by a Made God who uses it to protect his trove of celestial shards. Built to repel armies led by mortal heroes or theurges, such a being’s powerful engine can have it move fast enough to strike thrice where most men can strike once and boast 8 divine components that can be of any variety. While nigh-insurmountable to the foes the Made God predicted would assail it, against multiple Godbound even such a machine would require assistance from nearby automatons to hold its own. And of course, you may repurchase this item if you wish to own multiple godwalkers. A few special considerations should be noted here. Damage inflicted on a godwalker inflicts a kind of backlash onto its pilot. Godwalkers were also never intended to be piloted by divine beings such as Godbound and while piloting one they find themselves unable to use divine powers from this world which require a conscious divine effort (though constant effects remain active, and affect the godwalker as well.

Last but not least, while normally godwalkers require a sophisticated theotechnical facility and a team of extremely well-trained engineers or a Godbound with the word Artifice to be properly maintained, through your investment here some mysterious benefactor has installed a Godwalker Repair Bay on any you buy here, fully functional without impacting other systems in defiance of conventional construction procedures. This set of tools permits the godwalker to perform a daily maintenance cycle on itself or another godwalker over the course of 6 hours of downtime-and in a pinch fully overhaul another godwalker or itself in a week, with no additional personnel or resources.

392,,400,Man of Steel ,Godbound,Magitek,"There are only two major powers in Arcem that can offer cybernetic augmentations to the rich and influential. One is the Bright Republic, whose miniaturised cybernetic marvels cost greatly to “harden” enough to function away from the island’s etheric power nodes. The other is Vissio, through its clockwork maestros capable of producing often beautiful and baroque prosthetics that work as well as the Bright Republic’s implants without needing a power source. And if you hail from neither country, you yourself are the third. You’re an extremely skilled artificer, capable of devising cybernetics or mechanical prosthetics of such high calibre they can match a lesser gift’s effects for short periods, under specific circumstances or at a substantial cost to the user’s vitality or Effort to overcharge them.

What you do blurs the line between magic and hard science. It’s within your talent to recreate the Iron Tzar’s Autocossacks: Wherein a man’s lower body is removed and replaced with a four-legged mechanical platform that moves faster than any mortal horse and can take on entire bands of mortal men. But your talents also lend themselves to more ethereal ends, like implanting an eidolon that can keep a man on the brink of death’s body functional for a few minutes-long enough potentially to bring him back through first aid, a killing glare that can leave foes as dried corpses or even short ranged telekinetic force capable of forming shields and manipulating objects as if by hand. Among mortal men, your designs already push the boundary of what’s possible for the current line of cybernetics and with a bit of work you could easily improve on existing designs or innovate new ones.

If you also have an existing occupation as an artificer or somesuch as a Man of the Trades, your skill has advanced to the point where you’re one of the rare few capable of performing the arduous, exhausting maintenance needed to keep a godwalker in shape. While this alone does not grant the sorcerous arts incorporated into the godwalkers’ functionality, your mechanical expertise and theoretical knowledge of the armaments, engines and other components that make up these divine sympathy-empowered giant robots is second to none. With any degree of Eldritch Sorcerer in your grasp as well as the relevant Man of the Trades vocation and this perk, your insights glean even deeper secrets. It would be within your skill to modify a godwalker to harmonise with a Godbound or other divine being, lessening the strain of interface and permitting them to channel their divine powers through those machines of war. Even more tantalisingly is your deepest secret: Some knowledge on how to create a Made God. Whether through divine artifacts, reifying a symbol into a physical entity or augmentation of a living being the resource costs are likely phenomenal-but the results potentially world-changing."

Why not use both?

Making Muggle devices work within magic-rich environments such as Hogwarts and the like will be child’s play for you. With just a little bit of practice, you could make it so that your own gadgets and machinery can run on magic. And you can even do the same in reverse, using technology so that your magical enchantments and potions can be made as if they were made in an automated factory. Maybe one day, you’ll eventually create your own magical nuke! Eventually. After a long, LONG time of research, experimentation... and explosions!

As a final bonus, you now find yourself with a rather nifty talent when it comes to making up acronyms and other such abbreviations. Why not look up one Hermion Granger when you arrive? It seems like you’ll have a few things in common."

It can, however, interfere with the operation of any clock in a 5m radius around it, allowing it to stop, rewind, or fast-forward the operation of any timekeeping devices around it. This ability is capable of affecting anything that might remotely resemble a clock, no matter how eldritch or advanced it might be. Its ability, which is triggered by winding-up the statuette, lasts for exactly five minutes, and can be used to selectively target any timepiece in its area of effect. Word to the wise - you can only use it once per day, so it’s probably best if you save it for emergencies."

Powered by a miniature fusion reactor in addition to being able to draw on magical energy for power, this armor is equipped with a number of tools and weapons including standard energy blasts, flight, personal shields, and a teleportation system. The armor also serves to increase the strength and durability of the wearer, allowing them to throw cars and shrug off even large-sized explosives. But perhaps the most interesting feature is in its ability to record spells cast near the wearer, allowing them to replicate the features and incantations to cast the spells immediately – though likely with less effectiveness than someone trained in their use.

If you wish then you may import a suit of armor you possess, be it traditional or power armor, to gain these qualities."
403,,400,Mechamage’s Armor        ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Magitek,"This suit of powered armor doesn’t provide superhuman strength, though it will provide roughly peak human strength, and isn’t going to make you tougher than a tank. What it does have is sorcerous circuitry which makes it an excellent conduit for spells capable of acting as a magical focus similar to a wand, sensors for identifying magical energies and spells, and an onboard dumb AI which assists you in combat. This AI serves multiple functions. It has threat assessment programming, able to be programmed to recognize certain threats, including accessing the sensors for magical energies to identify spells and suggest proper countermeasures. It is capable of going a step further, and automatically casting magical spells, using your magical energy. It is probably best for you to have it stick to simpler spells, as it is still ultimately a dumb AI and anything that requires focus or active control would be beyond its ability to perform."
404,,400,Sword of Might ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Magitek,"Perhaps Brian Braddock and his Meggan gave you a choice, perhaps you got it from Roma or even Merlyn, though when they ran things choosing the sword was an instant failure, maybe you’re not related to Avalon in any way. However it happened, you possess a copy of the Sword of Might.

This sword is magically indestructible, and magically sharp. It is able to cut through up to a foot of steel with ease, at least with the strength the accompanying costume grants you. The sword allows you to summon the costume of the Captain Britain Corps (and you may import another costume into this one). This magitech suit uses mystical circuitry to channel magical energy. This magical energy reinforces your body, granting you super strength on the level of Warbird, the ability to fly, and the ability to project this magical energy as offensive blasts or a fairly powerful force field. Just remember this is a normal Captain Britain suit, it won’t be matching Brian Braddock’s feats, and isn’t powered by your confidence; the need to be close to Britain is long gone, though."
405,,400,Fine line between Reality and Illusion,Marvel Cosmic,Magitek,The separation of reality from illusion is only so many words. Your scientific research has unlocked the mysteries and secrets of both. You can create technology that interfaces with both reality and illusion and can easily turn illusions into real objects and make real objects illusory. You can create fully realistic illusions that might as well be reality. You can create machines that simply wave away any mystic’s illusions no matter how skilled they might be. Reality is what you and your machines say it is. The limits to this ability is your technological prowess and understanding of a particular setting’s illusory magics/psionics/what have you. This perk gives you a very high baseline for manipulation. You also have a deep innate sense for what is reality and what is illusion and can always tell the difference.
406,,400,The Level Upper,Toaruverse,Magitek,"An audio file stored inside a portable music player when one listens to it, it can turn a level zero into a level one within a week for one hour of listening per day. The abilities the user gains tends to be the abilities that they want one way or another. Unlike the original this version of the Level Upper has no nasty-side effects and traps and the only downside is it takes time for one to increase their level once they become a level one. Once someone becomes a level one it would take ten years to reach level five with one hour of listening per day as additional hours would have no effect and you can also spread the audio file if you want. Post-jump you can use this to give a normal person with Esper ability that they want and they would only need to listen for an hour to become a level one but the time needed to reach the level five is still the same."
407,,400,Umbran Armor,Bayonetta,Magitek,"Why is there a mech here? What is it even here for? Oh forget it, it's awesome. It's armed with Miniguns on the arms, shotguns on the legs, capable of channeling your magic and it's piloted like a motorcycle. To make things even better you can channel your magic through it, turning the mech into a veritable force of destruction... though if you want, you can have its aesthetics changed to a Lumen Sage variant! Go nuts with it."

When the trigger is pulled, instead of firing a bullet the Gunblade fires bolts of lightning, damaging foes and slowing them. In addition, the Hextech gunblade will heal the user for 15% of all the damage they deal, whether magical or physical."
409,,400,Hextechnician,Arcane,Magitek,"Hextech is a bold new field of scientific endeavour, utilising power drawn from magical gemstones to put magic - once the domain only of those born to the power, or having somehow earned it - in the hands of the common man. At least, the common man wealthy enough to pay for it. Its potential is nearly-limitless, from delivering powerful strikes with Atlas Gauntlets to cutting through stone with beams of light to even warping space and time to propel airships far across Runeterra.

You have been extensively-trained in hextech engineering, and are capable both of building all common hextech devices in Piltover-Zaun, and of innovating upon them based on your knowledge of hextech and its principles. True, radical innovations like the Hexcore are somewhat beyond you, but you could approach such creations with a long-enough development scale and enough staff to help you - and ‘conventional’ hextech is nothing to sneeze at.

Moreover, you know how to use existing hex-crystals to produce new ones, albeit not as potent as the original, natural hex-crystals. Thus, you need not worry about your creations running out of power in new worlds."

You’re able to jury-rig and fix magitech as advanced as the airships of Thalassocracy, though not quite proficient enough to develop entirely new ones or build them from scratch. Perhaps as you grow, you may learn to even match the Serannians in their expertise…enough to develop an intelligent self-sufficient race such as the Machina."

413,,400,That’s Just Asking For Trouble,Ben 10,Magitek,"When you make advanced technology far beyond what the locals are used to, it tends to make waves. Maybe your little DNA database is actually one of the greatest weapons ever created or an attempt to prove you can harness the fundamental forces of the universe ends up destroying a planet. The good news is you’re not stupid – it’s the Genius tree, not the Drooling Idiot tree! You have excellent insight into the moral implications and long-term effects of your inventions if they were used by others or made commonly available, especially when it would be a purely bad idea. Also, just to make sure nobody steals or misuses it, any sort of failsafe you make to keep it from being abused is unable to be hacked or bypassed...if you made a device that works only for a certain person, no amount of hacking or DNA swapping will make someone else pass off as that person. If you need two keys to unlock a certain feature, you bet only those two keys will work. This goes both ways – all your devices will come with a backdoor for you to take back control if someone does misuse it, and it will always succeed.

You have gained insight into the functions of the Black Oil, becoming able to create it even without materials by secreting it from your body, and are immune to negative side effects from it- being covered in it making you remarkably stronger. You even have gained a more... “heretical” ability, being able to change the oil so it doesn't corrupt those it touches.

415,,400,Beneath My Iron Skin(400CP) ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"With the many Futurist advancements that have spread throughout the world, one of the most common ones takes the form of mechanical assistance. Metal arms and legs, to replace ones lost to accident or battle, are but the tip of this iceberg. Entirely mechanical suits of armor, known as mechs, mecha, or mechsuits depending on who you ask, are their newest addition to the art of war. To that end, I would offer you one of these - perhaps you seek a High-Speed Hoverbike that would make most Reckoner gangs blush in envy, or the Mobilizer Mech that the Futurists use to control several suits at once. Of course, something more impressive could also be what you seek?

For 400 cp, you may take something worth six mana or more, a category that consists solely of the Thundersteel Colossus and the completed Mechtitan. Both are mildly impractical to actually get onto the battlefield, but no one can understate the sheer power they represent."
416,,400,Fog Of Despair,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"The Myojin of Night’s Reach is as famous as she is feared, as powerful as she is hated. It was her blessing that allowed Toshiro Umezawa, the hero of the Kami War, to emerge triumphant and it was her wrath at misusing those blessings that haunted him for the rest of his days. What you have here is one of Kamigawa’s first biological weapons, an airborne curse designed to mimic her powers. Held inside a series of metal canisters that are also time bombs, the mists it spews out are extremely damaging - not only are they slightly acidic in nature to the point where it can chew through entire people in but a moment if they’re fool enough to be caught inside it, but it also actively degrades any magical effects within it’s range. Like the ones a Samurai would use to empower themselves, for example. I suggest being far, far away from it when it’s set to release, as the black fog cannot be controlled or countered bar sufficient dispersion. Anyone who can’t run away will know suffering. "
417,,400,Compleat Mastery Of Machines,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"If there is one flaw in the Futurists' constant rush for bigger, better, and more advanced technologies that have yet to be discovered, it is that they don’t take the time needed to truly understand those things, to eke out every last drop of inspiration or perfection from them. And you? You have done just that. You rapidly adjust to new forms of technology, learning their ins and outs in days where others would need weeks, making minor modifications to them that allows you to pull 110% out of them. Older, more reliable technology is even better, with you quickly becoming able to rebuild it from the ground up to run at 200% after taking it apart a few times. Worst of all, at least for your foes, is that this understanding allows you to interface with technological artifacts from range, inserting a virus into a Samurai’s mech suit mid fight, or turning a Ninja’s fancy gadgets into glorified paperweights when they suddenly become glitchy. With enough knowledge, perhaps a device you created personally and know the precise measurements of every last bolt and soder? You could take complete control of it. "
418,,400,Sacred Art Of Fuck That Shit ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Though the Order of Jukai are by far the least willing to have anything to do with technology, and are some of the few who still actively worship the Kami, that is not to say they forsake it entirely. In fact, they have their own special brand of technology that not even the Saiba have been able to replicate - one wonders how they could have made it, but that’s a lesson for another day. You have been entrusted with the knowledge of how to make disruptors, small devices that emit a field of pure nope that shuts down almost all technology with their range, and more than a small amount of magic as well. The range on these devices is not terribly large, but thankfully they aren’t terribly complicated to make for someone affiliated with the many many Kami that reside within the forests of Jukai. That may be why the Futurists have yet to replicate them, they insist on looking upwards when the answer lies behind them. You could, if you wished, mass produce enough of these devices to shut down all technology within a city block inside a day or two… And to explode normally as well. If you wanted. "
419,,400,Ark of the Stars,Fate/Extella,Magitek,"One of the ships used by the Anti-Cells sent out by Velber or at least a fragment of such. Six hundred meters wide and shaped like an almond, the cockpit is a dimensional pocket within the structure that automatically draws you in if you are nearby and wish to enter. It’s a fairly small space inside, enough for a group of humans to fit comfortably, but the ship automatically regulates the conditions inside and has no need for controls or seats. Instead, it operates according to your thoughts, able to rapidly travel extremely long distances, even between stars in short time periods. The Ark contains a useful treasure however, a disconnected piece of Velber’s code and power. Acknowledging you as the new controller, it is an extremely potent virus that can rapidly infect even large sections of the Moon Cell. Your fragment won’t be able to take over the entire virtual world but it is enough to forcibly brainwash most virtual beings you encounter, one on one. You’re even able to remove it if you need to insert the Velber corruption into a different target.

If you have bought the Zero Dark Sleeping Room as well, you can replace the cockpit of the Ark with that cavern. "
420,,400,Technological World,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Magitek,"Straight from the pages of a pulp sci-fi story, this marvel of science is a weapon of surpassing power. A set of armor, within which is contained a constantly manifested Reality Marble linked to a certain
technological field, which influences the armor’s appearance and capabilities. The armor can manifest around your body with but a thought, called forth from your belief in the science it
represents.

Depending on your desired theme, the armor will differ quite extensively. A believer in steam power
technology could receive a hulking tank of a machine, powered by gouts of boiling steam. The armor
could easily destroy even modern day armored vehicles and gives the user enough raw physical
power to smash a battleship into pieces in short order. The steam could be used for short ranged
attacks of boiling heat or overload the armor to gain enormously increased speed and striking power. Miscellaneous gadgets and devices linked to steam power may also be present, such as high speed
wheels on the armor’s boots that emulate a steam train. Alternatively, one might look into electricity
or firearms or evolution as a variety of sciences that the reality marble can be set to manifest, resulting in different forms, weaponry and abilities for the armor. 

Whatever the choice, the armor is able to produce smaller and weaker versions of itself over time, each powered by a rudimentary artificial intelligence that can take simple orders from you. Guarding
locations from all but specific intruders, attacking enemies, manual labor and so on. No import. "
421,,400,System Keuranos,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Magitek ,"The lightning stolen from the gods’ own hands has come to rest in your own. Through scientific

that you can manipulate, even magical energy. While your capacity for this is small for now, it will
grow with use, and lets you turn what would be attacks against you by these stagnant magi into
brutal strikes back on them in the form of your bolts of lightning."
422,,400,Implanted Relic ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"Somehow, perhaps through an accident, a relic has become embedded in a part of your body. While this doesn't prevent you from using other relics you will find that your synchronization coefficient with that Relic has increased tenfold, making the blowback from Swan Songs and other exhaustive features far less severe, with Swan Songs only tiring you immensely. This Relic seems to be reacting differently than seen with Human-Relic Fusion Specimen no. 1, Hibiki Tachibana and Gungnir. It seems to be merging with your body far better than Gungnir ever did, not threatening your life and eventually resolving into something similar to what was achieved by Finé herself with the Nehushtan Armor. The Relic that has been implanted is one of the ones associated with your Origin, but once again you may pay 100cp to change it to a different one.

Argo, the ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed on. The user is draped in sails, allowing them to drift effortlessly in the air. It can summon forth pieces of the original ship, casting great rods and nets of rigging at it's targets. Argo is mostly defense focused, being able to summon hulls as defensive shields and laying traps of rigging and rope. Further experience with Argo's creation allows the creation of small boats and jet skis.

The Argo does not possess an Armed Gear that can be wielded like a weapon in the normal sense, excepting the components of the ship, but it is capable of creating Argonauts; small spherical drones with an attached beam of energy. These drone are relatively fragile, but can overwhelm targets with sheer numbers. Specialized drones can be created with greater experience with the Gear.

Argo's Swan Song revives the original Argo, a flying heretical ship controlled by the will of the user. The Argo appears to turn and accelerate with no regards to propulsion or cornering, and can release swarms of the Argonauts. In addition to the swarms of loyal drones and it's extreme speed, the Argo's very presence creates a great typhoon that it and it's wielder are completely unaffected by.

Prometheus, the first flame. By calling forth embers of the original flame, a raging dimensional inferno can be started, burning both human and Noise alike. The flames spread and intensity can be limited by the wielder, and can be extinguished with a single thought, but left unchecked they burn incredibly violently. The wielder is protected from this raging heat by their Symphogear, and other Gears should have little trouble with the heat unless it is actively brought against them.

The chains wrapped around the wielders arms can be used like whips at their most basic level, heating to strike at foes, but Prometheus' true Armed Gear is the projection of these chains into disposable axes of all kinds, with its truest form being that of an ashen chainsaw. These weapons bear superheated blades and chains, being able to burn through even the toughest Noise's defenses if they can get in range.

Prometheus' Swan Song calls forth the full might of the stolen flame, engulfing all within a massive radius in an inferno that sears the flesh of enemies from bone while rejuvenating allies, bringing them back from the brink of death. Be warned however, fire is indiscriminate, and any targets that fail to be designated as allies will suffer the same fate as enemies.

Kibisis, the sack that contained the Medusa’s severed head. The concept of ‘sack’ is a slight misnomer, however. The user is given an elaborate combination of robes, cloak and hood that would be quite modest if the bodysuit wasn’t so skimpy. While unassuming, the fabric that makes up Kibisis is actually a portal to an enormous self-contained pocket dimension, with the user able to manipulate the fabric to make openings into and out of it.

This is as versatile and deadly as it sounds, as Kibisis is able to not only store objects, but also use the fabric to effectively ‘flash step’ by traveling along a thin corridor of silk, or create a razor thin portal along it’s edge to slice objects in half. Kibisis’ Swan Song generates a massive dimensional disturbance, manipulating space-time to instantly stretch and destroy huge areas, while also disrupting similar dimensional shenanigans.

Kaladanda, staff of the god of death. As intimidating as it sounds, Kaladanda’s Armed Gear is actually a metal pipe. In fact, Kaladanda may as well be the tool of a plumber, as it may plant and grow all manner of water works and plumbing from itself, naturally lending itself towards creating steam-powered mechanisms, such as gigantic steam hammers and saws. What makes these pipes unique, however, is the crimson water that flows freely from them, which carries a unique anti-life property that causes it to shred through all physical and philosophical protections, completing erasing it’s target from reality in a manner reminiscent of a certain mirror.

Kaladanda’s Swan Song calls forth the source of it’s deathly water – a colossal steam boiler which flashes a massive amount of it’s deadly contents into supercritical steam, which it forces into a tight, high-power beam to bore through even the toughest defenses. Be careful of friendly fire, although an attentive user can selectively halt the eroding effects of the steam on allies.

Thunderbird, caller of storms. The wielder appears to be cloaked in a stormy haze, obscuring them from view unless they choose to disperse it. Thunderbird is capable of recalling the original bird's talons, incredible sight and agility to the user.

Thunderbird's true power lies in its ability to generate 'feathers', razor-sharp shards that extend in whip-like wings from the wielder's body. They can generate electrical charge and control their own magnetism, allowing the wielder to levitate through repulsion and discharge anti-Noise lightning strikes with some buildup. It is also possible to use the wings as a conduit for a magnetic cannon.

Thunderbird's Swan Song causes the feathers to disperse, floating freely around the wielder as the haze expands into a storm cloud, from which the wielder can direct massive lightning strikes. Anything coming into the storm cloud will find themselves suffering from the lethal discharges within it unless the wielder directs it away from them itself.

The Holy Grail, the cup sought by King Arthur. Upon activation, one might notice that the Gear appears to be completely unarmed or protected aside from a standard (albeit slightly more armored) bodysuit provided by a Symphogear system, with the addition of what appears to be a cooking pot worn jauntily as a helmet. The Holy Grail is capable of generating cooking paraphernalia in all forms to serve in it's purpose of providing unlimited food and happiness to people. Cooking utensils that can, however, be easily used as lethal weapons. The Grail is semi-unique in that it's user can control it's implements remotely, starting with one or two implements at first, and growing to a few dozen with time.

The Holy Grail's Swan Song summons a massive stadium around the wielder, enclosing all in a several hundred meter radius inside a massive oven that heats to extremely high temperatures. Within, the wielder can control as many objects as they can manage, regardless of whether they came from her own Gear. The biggest risk comes from the massive size of the oven, carrying the risk of capturing innocent bystanders in the radius.

Enkidu, clay servitor. Instead of any sort of Armed Gear, Enkidu’s wielder is accompanied by a large, formless mass of technological ‘clay’ that emanates from fissures in the bodysuit armor. While limited in amount, the clay can be manipulated to take on different shapes and properties- provided it doesn’t stray too far from it’s wielder. One moment, it can be a rigid shield, then transform itself into a lethal explosive. Clay may be destroyed, but more is very slowly generated within the bodysuit.

Enkidu’s Swan Song temporarily re-enables the clay’s ability to self-replicate, allowing it to consume vast amounts of material to create a huge swarm of clay. For the duration of the Swan Song, the clay may be used as normal, explosively detonating or collapsing into dust once it ends.

Moly, the miracle herb grown from the blood of a giant. Mossy plants overtake the wearer’s hair, sprouting flowers and other sprouts in its place and down their arms- plants that the wielder can coincidentally fire and control like fine wires. Beyond the obvious application of monofilament cutters, these plants are capable of taking root in living things and draining their life force for energy, so long as a conduit exists back to the wielder. Stranger applications, such as plant-based exoskeletons or constructs, are also entirely possible.

The Swan Song of Moly causes all plants connected to Moly to begin flowering, releasing clouds of corrosive spores which eat into enemy armor, creating chinks for more plants to grow into, allowing them to rapidly drain them of life force. Exponential plant overgrow allows the collapsing of massive structures and even more points to dig into enemies from.

The Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the ten commandments of God. Draped in papers displaying the ten commandments of God, the Ark displays the remarkable ability to boost or dampen phonic gain. Other wielders who sing alongside the Ark notice their power being boosted, with rising sync coefficients, while enemy wielders notice their synchronization ratio's plummeting. Against the Noise, the effect that disables their Phase Contrast Barrier is broadcast in a wide radius, effectively forcing all Noise around them into reality where mundane weapons will affect them.

The Ark of the Covenant's Armed Gear is actually the papers hanging from the wielder's body. They can extend and fold themselves, taking the shape of weapons or shields, anything that is possible with folded sheets of paper. While they can swing with great force, it's important to remember that it's still essentially paper, albeit far more durable than normal, but still paper. The strength, durability and length the paper can extend to increases with experience.

As another Relic made in the image of God, the Ark's Swan Song is capable of exerting similar forces to the Ruin's of Balal. By spreading the pages out like a dish, and holding themselves in a cross position, the wielder can rip away massive amounts of Phonic Gain from other wielders or people, gathering it to themselves and redistributing it to others. Unlike other Swan Songs, this has no practical combat capability on it's own, as it effectively immobilizes the wielder while it is in use and requires another wielder to direct Phonic Gain to. However, if the wielder can gather enough Phonic Gain, they may be able to activate X-Drive once the Swan Song ends...

The Left Hand of Christ, no, not a euphemism. His actual hand. The wearer is bestowed a much more heavily armored suit than most Symphogears, complete with a helmet and rectangular shield. Unlike most Symphogears, the Hand's Armed Gear cannot be duplicated endlessly, with only one or two available at anygiven moment, the tradeoff being that Hand's lance is extraordinarily powerful, doubling as a high energy laser cannon. The Hand’s shield can expand and reshape as needed, additionally being able to project an energy shield capable of protecting against Noise. The size and shape the energy shield can take begins as a simple single direction square barrier, but can be manipulated more with practice.

The Hand's Swan Song channels and amplifies the destructive power of the spear's laser cannon, sending a massive cross-shaped beam of energy in the direction of every thrust for the duration of the Swan Song. Striking the ground with the spear will produce a similar cross-shaped blast around the wielder. In addition to this, while the Swan Song is active, the defenses provided by the Gear have their power drastically increased.

Gleipnir, the chain that bound the great wolf. Gleipnir’s bodysuit appears to be of a different material than standard, with a leathery appearance and fur-trimming along it’s edge, and appears bound to the wearer by chains. Lengths of chains may be unshackled to beat and ensnare enemies, draining Phonic Gain by contact and potentially immobilizing other Relic users with enough contact.

The Relic’s Swan Song reveals that it is not just Gleipnir, but also the wolf the chain bound – Fenrir. All of the Gear’s chains fall away, and the wielder is surrounded by a recreation of the original wolf. While larger than the wielder and strong, this is not the full extent of the Swan Song. Fenrir reverses the direction of control, being able to take it’s chain and leash another Relic for temporary control over it, against any relevant user’s will for the duration of the Swan Song. If the chain is not used in this way, taking the form of Fenrir bears very little cost to the user, despite being a Swan Song.

The Axe of Perun, weapon of the lightning god. Perun’s bodysuit is studded with numerous contacts and power lines, which can be used to generate extreme voltages, short lightning strikes and manipulate circuitry in the manner one might expect. Instead of simply being able to generate voltage though, Perun is able to condense large amounts of its power into a physical form- that or axes, polearms and other axe-headed instruments, in addition to the lightning ‘arrows’ one might expect. The downside to this is that Perun requires far more energy per weapon created, making it’s use substantially heavier and deliberate versus the frenzy of other Gears.

Perun’s Swan Song calls all available energy in the surrounding atmosphere to the user, often causing the formation of a massive storm cell around it from the massive drop in pressure. The wielder is then able to create a massive axe, formed by both the storm and their own charge, which fully discharges into the location they strike as a titanic lightning strike.

Draupnir, the ring of Odin. It uses its ability of self multiplication to create disk shaped drones that are equipped with sensors and projectors capable of producing energy blasts or holograms. A largely utility focused Relic, Draupnir's defense is somewhat poor and mostly consists of using the drones to intercept attacks or form force fields. Further sync and experience with Daupnir allows the creation of specialized drones and use of formations or combinations of the drones to perform various other tasks of means of attack.

Draupnir's Swan Song causes the drones to multiply exponentially before surrounding the target in a dome and discharging all their energy in a single attack focused on the center of the dome. Draupnir's Swan Song is especially risky as it removes all drones from defense for a single Swan strike and the Symphogear takes a bit to reactivate the discharged drones, should the wielder survive.

Brahmastra, the bow of Brahma. Unlike its counterpart Ichival, Brahmastra's attacks are slower, more accurate and far more powerful, with it's Armed Gear taking the form of a heavy bow by default, although it can also take the form of a battle rifle or revolver. Built into Brahmastra's headset is a visor that provides targeting data and alternate vision modes to the wielder. While the weapons can be fired as fast as the wielder can manage or pull the trigger, the power of these attacks make friendly fire a serious concern.

The Swan Song of Brahmastra brings forth the full might of a weapon said to never miss and which completely annihilates it's target without fail. Summoning it's bow form again, Brahmastra unleashes a massive lance of energy at a specific target, traveling instantly and through all structures in it's way to annihilate that single target with force similar to a nuclear weapon.

A Will-o’-the-Wisp, an otherworldly beacon. On top of a tattered hood, the wielder is given an Armed Gear that takes the form of a small, handheld lantern. Will-o’-the-Wisp’s purview is that of lighting- lanterns, braziers, lamps, floodlights and in a more combat oriented-fashion, lasers. On top of direct fighting applications, the wielder may cause lights to fizzle out and produce small ‘wisps’ of energy, which they may redirect into other lights (or even other Relics) to boost their power or use directly as energy bullets.

Primarily, Will-o’-the-Wisp focuses on producing massive banks of lamps which it harvests for wisps to use in massive lasers, all of which leads into its Swan Song. Upon activation, Will-o’-the-Wisp becomes a miniature sun, glowing with an intense light and releasing untold amounts of wisps that can turn even household light bulbs into deadly area denial weapons.

Xiuhcoatl, weapon of the sun god. The wielder of Xiuhcoatl is accompanied by their own personal Noise- that takes the shape of a burning serpent protectively surrounding them. It also bears slight resemblance to corn, for some reason. By consuming other Noise, or fragments of Relics, Xiuhcoatl grows larger and stronger, although it can shed ‘accumulated’ size for speed, and a greater size is more taxing on the user to maintain. Like other Noise, Xiuhcoatl can phase in and out of reality unless ‘tuned’ by something like a Symphogear, and also possesses the Noise ability to instantly reduce organic life to ash on contact, although it may withhold at the discretion of it’s handler.

Instead of simply swelling Xiuhcoatl to a massive size – as it already does so – the Relic’s Swan Song allows Xiuhcoatl to subdivide into two snakes of a slightly reduced size, repeating as many times as wished for either a swarm of standard sized snakes or several titanic ones. This means that Xiuhcoatl’s Swan Song is generally most effective once it has swelled to a sufficient size, providing the most metaphorical ‘material’ to create additional minions from.

The Nemean Hide, trophy of Heracles. The Nemean Hide is an unusual relic, for it grants it's user some of the properties of Noise as it's primary ability. In addition to being an exceptionally resilient Symphogear the Nemean Hide allows its user to utilize the dimensional phasing ability of Noise, moving partially out of reality in order to ignore mundane assaults in exchange for a loss of movement speed and perception. The pelt is especially fearsome in that it can ignore the assaults of Symphogear users with significantly lesser Symphonic Gain than the wielder of the Hide, while utilizing the enemy's Barrier Coating to interact with them as if the user was fully material, although significantly stronger assaults can pierce this defense.

The Nemean Hide's Armed Gear consists of bracers with five claws situated on all four extremities of the user. The claws are versatile as weapons, having the offensive properties of Noise, allowing them to expend themselves to carbonize a normal human on contact or create a fairly potent explosion, the claws replenish fairly quickly and may be fired as ranged weapons. Finally, a claw may be inserted into a Noise to temporarily usurp control of it, although the claw won't regenerate so long as the Noise remains alive and controlled. Higher sync and experience with the Nemean Hide may allow manifestation of other parts of the Lion such as the fangs or tail, or manipulation of the claws, causing them to grow or otherwise shift to the user's will.

The Swan Song of the Nemean Hide is terrific in both senses of the word. The Hide uses the excess energy generated by the song to fully reform the invincible Lion Noise it was made from around the user. The Nemean ion is nigh indestructible to most assaults barring another Swan Song or attack of similar caliber and can control large swathes of nearby Noise to do it's will. The Lion is somewhat indiscriminate in it's rampage, only partially controlled by the wearer of the Hide and the Swan Song usually only lasts about a minute at most, meaning the best way to deal with the Lion is usually to simply run until it's exhausted.

Enlil, Lord of the Wind. While ordinarily the color scheme of a Symphogear seems to depend on the user, Enlil has yellow and black warning patterns included regardless of the user, along with a mining helmet. Enlil generates mining equipment of all kinds, pickaxes, drills, shovels, even industrial mining lasers. While the intended function is obvious, they still work as anti-Noise weapons, and most tools can be fired as projectiles using rockets. The size and complexity of summoned tools increases with experience with the Gear. The mining helmet's light also functions as an X-ray device, which feeds back to a visor that drops down from the helmet.

Upon triggering it's Swan Song, Enlil explodes into a massive mining train made from a mishmash of industrial machinery and mining equipment. While plowing straight through the enemy at three hundred miles an hour is quite effective, it can also make use of it's crane arms to throw pieces of the scenery at opponents or fire the massive mining laser mounted to it's hull.

The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities.

Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at its core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear.
        
The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into its mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon.

Pandora’s Box, which unfortunately is just a box after it was opened. Thankfully, the box itself is still useful, which the wielder can attest to with their built-in bandanna with tracking code. The box can take forms from cardboard boxes to steel shipping containers to box up and ship enemies to oblivion, or box cutters, nail guns and other shipping paraphernalia. Duct tape, warehouse drones and a very large boxcutter can help make sure death is delivered to enemies, and the constructs only get worse from there.

Once the Swan Song is triggered, enemies within range are drawn backwards into a tiny box, like all the world’s evils, and then pulled into a massive shipping mechanism. Once processed, they are fired through a shipping accelerator against a hard surface, crushing the contents instantly and dealing massive damage. A minor property of Pandora’s Box is that it’s user exhibits a slight stealth effect, becoming extremely hard to notice. Moreso, if they hide within the Box.

Bajiaoshan, once thought to be a mighty wind fan. Instead, upon activation the wielder finds themselves holding a pair of handles which can sprout dozens of individual knives, holding them in the shape of fans. On the users command, the handle can explosively fire the knives at a high firing rate, essentially making them fully automatic ballistic knives.

The blades generated can be of several different types, including armor piercing, explosive and incendiary blades with any number of imaginative shapes and sizes. When the fight gets close to Bajiaoshan, the handles can project two superheated knives that are much more durable than the fragile projectiles and are fully capable of melting through most defenses.

It's Swan Song let's Bajiaoshan project a single, invisible knife that carries with it the force of a gale, and with a single thrust, can tear through a single point with incredible force, penetrating all enemies but leaving allies untouched.

Quetzalcoatl is a fragment of the feathered serpent that runs through the user’s body, causing many red-hot feathers to erupt from their bodysuit and merge into an armored coat to protect them. It also extends a superheated tail of molten metal from their spine, which can change shape and warp as they wish. Users of Quetzalcoatl should be cautious of these properties, as it, like the Nehushtan Armor, begins to merge with the user over time, although instead of growing into their wounds, Quetzalcoatl instead chooses to reside beneath the skin. A symbiotic relationship, as opposed to parasitic.

There is no true Armed Gear to Quetzalcoatl, with its user instead calling upon its tail and raw command over the power of the sun. Raw material fissures forth from within Quetzalcoatl, superheated metals and plasmatic gasses which it can launch in streams and use as whips or in other creative ways against its foes. It can also control light in a minor way, either blinding it’s enemies or concentrating it’s light against its foes like the sun against ants.

The Swan Song of Quetzalcoatl harnesses the power of nuclear fusion, generating a small sun roughly the size of one’s fist and launching it. Without the Gear to keep it under control, it quickly expands into a massive conflagration of fire, gas and light, destroying anything in its path.

Tonbokiri, the dragonfly cutter, is one of a few Gears that is capable of native flight thanks to the set of insectoid wings that sprout from the back of the wielder’s bodysuit. All kinds of spears may be created by the Relic, although unlike more typical examples of spears produced by Symphogears, Tobokiri’s are more designed for cutting than thrusting. On top of that, the bodysuit possesses an ambulatory ‘tail’ that may grasp it’s spears and act as a crude sting for the user, and can sprout additional insectoid features if they wish.

Tonbokiri belongs to the group of ‘living’ Gears that actively seek symbiosis with their wielders, regardless of implantation status, which is reflected in it’s Swan Song. The user sprouts chitinous armor, and temporarily the restored spear emerges from their sting, sharp enough that it emits heat from simple contact with the air.

Strangely enough, Tonbokiri’s style and movements seem... a bit ridiculous at times. Flash stepping, running on water and other feats that’d seem more beelievable if they were in some anime.

Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn’s spear. While only one of the original barbs remains, it still carries the traits of the original spear, with the short, bone-like protrusions the Gear is capable of producing still coursing through the body of enemies it pierces into and tearing them apart. By snapping off a bone growth and burying it in water or the ground, a massive ‘swordfish’ drone spawns – really an extended bone outcropping held inside a ring drone, with the same properties as a normal spine. Combat relies then on a balance between falling back to spawn additional drones and taking the offensive when drones are in surplus.

The spear’s Swan Song revives the original sea monster – a massive, bone-y serpent named Coinchenn – but not as a pet to be controlled or commanded. Instead, Coinchenn allows itself to be used as a massive version of the spear it was eventually made into, flying with unnatural speed and precision for something so large, with the curse spreading through everything present at the location it strikes.

This also affects the following 600cp perks as follows:

The Power of Holding Hands – Now it becomes possible for you to take upon the backlash effects from multiple people, but on top of that, the backlash is reduced even further based upon the strength of your personal relationship with them, granting no benefit for random bystanders, but reducing a potentially lethal backlash to a minor tickle with true friendship, and all but negating the strain with a bond of love.

Superb Song – You know, just having people who believe in you can give you enough faith to survive the challenges thrown at you. Personal connections you have with other people now feed you a tiny bit of Phonic Gain based on the level of that friendship, providing a slight power boost.

Pagan Science – Looking through some of the notes made by Finé's reincarnation, you manage to glean the mechanism behind the energy-mass converter used to create the armor of a Symphogear. While you would still need a Relic to make a proper Symphogear, you can use this to store armor and weapons in the form of a small necklace, simply requiring that the user be able to sing the activation song to use.

Legends Reborn – Across time and space, some legends hold true in the hearts and minds of people, much like how Gungnir retained it’s properties as Longinus, despite becoming Gungnir later in life. When you have the original, real thing – an artifact with a strong legend known across entire populations for many decades – you may extract it’s legend and turn the artifact into a philosophical weapon, giving it properties from it’s associated legends, such as anti-god properties for a weapon used to slay a god in legend.

423,,400,Adaptation Specialization ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Magitek,"Through understanding, you’ve learnt to adapt....Adapting what you have to work with what you’ve got. You can now make mundane 21st century technology run on cosmic or ambient energies with ease, starting with your ability to set up Cosmic Switches as power sources or add-ons for minor devices of your design. While another genius crafted his devices to resemble fast food, you’re not limited to those kinds of designs. You also can take a step ahead and extend this adaptation to other energies you encounter, though you only know how to apply it to early 21st century tech at the moment...still, that gives you a wide array of things to improve.

424,,400,The Scientist ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Magitek,"They say Science supplanted Magic in this world, but you know better. You know that it simply hides between the lines, where the laws of man can never reach. But you...you can reach it. You have ways of studying and analyzing the energy of emotions, able to measure the difference and weight of emotions as if they were temperature or electricity. You can use these principles in whatever you build, able to create despair detectors or a machine that is able to store ambient hope...You may not be a true Wizard with this knowledge, but you can at least understand the principles of hope and despair.

425,,400,Super​ ​Vizor​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"This computer manifests as a vizor that appears at will over the user's face, as well as recording someone. You can also take out a USB drive from the side of the Vizor. This can scan for someone’s strengths and weaknesses through observation by scanning the target’s actions. It will also suggest possible actions one can take to help take down the person or solve the situation, however the Vizor does not account for the user’s own capabilities and neither does it seem to be able to predict what will happen next if you do take those suggestions. Also comes with a very smart AI."
426,,400,Luna​ ​Ball​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"You now have a Luna Ball! Which is like a magical swiss army knife, but on steroids. This can hypnotize people and get them to believe anything within reason (Such as you being a married couple’s niece or nephew who has come over to stay for an indefinite amount of time, letting you mooch off them), can turn into a (nonlethal) gun that looks like an actual gun indistinguishable from the real deal, a parasol, and other assorted items.
"
427,,400,Magus​ ​Gun​ ,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"You hold a marvel of magic. This magic gun is extraordinarily useful. This gun is shaped wide enough and tough enough to act as a shield, and it uses magic as it’s bullets. However, one does not need to charge it during a battle. For it absorbs most magic and uses it to power it’s batteries. But due to a design flaw, it can be overloaded with a strong enough magic attack and explode. Don’t worry, though. You’ll find a replacement in the warehouse the next day.
"
428,,400,Airship ,Drakengard and Nier,Magitek,"This mid-sized airship isn’t too impressive compared to some of the beastly battleships the Empire and the Intoner cult can produce, but it’s no dingy either. Designed for a crew of ten people, but capable of being run by as few as five, your new airship comes with a private captain’s cabin for you, crew quarters, a decent cargo hold for loot and of course, eight magitek cannons for you to rain hell upon the plebeians below unlucky enough to not own an airship. Or defend yourself from air-pirates. And if those defenses fail and you wind up getting shot from the sky, the Airship will repair itself, becoming good as new after a week."
429,,400,Similar Principles ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"It’s strange how similar concepts can be between dimensions, no? The line between magic and technology just doesn’t seem as thin as it otherwise should be, especially in your hands. The TSAB system combines both, and while this doesn’t let you start building Devices from the ground up, you understand the principle enough that you can combine magic systems from other worlds with technology. Guns that fire beams of mana, helmets that create a telepathy-based chat network, wristbands that let you form an outfit from thin air...spells can be made into technology much more easily, and the technologies play a bit more nicely with magic in your hands, even if a particular system of magic isn’t fond of being ‘simplified’ by science. How about that?
"
430,,400,Ancient Knowledge ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"The legacy of the Belkan Empire exists not merely within ruins or Lost Logia, but in the blood of its people. You have inherited a bloodline of note, and while it may or may not be one of the canonical or major bloodlines, a piece of it has followed you in your very DNA, subconsciously nudging at your memory. While this creates no stress or strain on your personality, the connection is diluted enough that you can’t consciously access this memory...but when you come into contact with Lost Logia, you will rapidly gain insight into how it functions and possibly ways to engineer it once again. You will need actual technical skills to pull this off, but with a little bit of time, perhaps you can restore what is lost? Post-jump, this same insight applies to ‘lost’ or ‘forgotten’ technology, though you will likely need other sources of knowledge and abilities to truly restore it, depending on its complexity.

May or may not come with brief instances of acting and speaking like a resident of the Belkan Empire at random intervals.
"
431,,400,Dimensional Warship ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Ohohoho, what do we have here? It’s a fully functional warship fresh from the docks of the Bureau, and its ready for its maiden voyage. It can be any model of TSAB ship that isn’t a MacGuffin or an experimental prototype, and has the ability to cross dimensions on its own, along with basic FTL travel. The downsides being that you can only cross dimensions in this particular world, or what passes for a ‘local multiverse’ in future jumps - which it may not always be able to do if one doesn’t exist. Post-Spark, this ship can visit past jumps and entirely new worlds as well. This requires a crew to fly - you’ll have to gather one or find a way to fly it on your own. I recommend picking a smaller vessel class if this is a problem.
"
432,,400,LiNKER Synthesis ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"You know the formula for the LiNKER drug, both Anti and Normal varieties. The drug allows someone with little or no compatibility with Relics to force their link coefficient high enough to activate a Symphogear. However, the drug is toxic to the human body, and is only viable for use by a flushing mechanism developed by American biochemist John Ver. Maybe if you have enough time and funding, you'd be able to mitigate the side effects and develop a non-toxic alternative...
"
433,,400,Very Advanced Science ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"When it comes to ‘re-engineering’ heretical technology, the Americans have mastered doing it in ways that leave others astounded. Recycling Relics into other forms of technology is nothing new. In fact, it’s the same technique that is used to create Symphogears, but this is on a completely different level. You can alter Relics so that they have completely different functions than what was intended, such as turning an aggressive heretical weapon into a berserker module, or a reflector into a giant laser beam."
434,,400,Backyard Nuclear Fusion ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Magitek,"Gensokyo is home to many things that have since died in the Outside World, including scientific theories. You can take advantage of this to treat any discredited scientific theory as true, but only for producing technology of your own. For instance, should you wish to revive a dead and disproved theory to create a nuclear fusion reactor, you will somehow manage to get it working even when it goes against established modern-day science.
"
435,,400,DOOOOOOOOMWHEEEEEEEEEEEL ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Skryre has made many deranged, demented, horrific machines of war and destruction; One would say their minds are wired specifically for such chaos. No machine so accurately displays this madness than the dreaded DOOMWHEEL, for it is at once so simple of a design yet so deceptively complex that only the skaven could have devised it. And now the brain-spawn of Ikit Claw is rapidly becoming a tide-turner in the war against the surface-world.

You’ve gained the ownership of one of these dreaded DOOMWHEELS, specially made for your seating. The massive, iron-enforced wheel is powered by two things: Along its inside, on a specially-made track, runs a swarm of drugged-up rats driven mad by the arcing warp-lightning and constant noise. At the center of the massive chassis, where the pilot’s seat is, is a warpstone generator that ensures the machine both keeps a steady pace (enough to run over and smash even armored dwarves and humans) and occasionally fires off the warp-lightning cannon that is attached to the front of the steel rims. Very few creatures are capable of stopping the DOOMWHEEL in its tracks, and for you there will likely be none: As its pilot, your magic also serves to charge the warpstone engine and warp-lightning cannon, allowing it to reach speeds only dreamed of by skaven brains and letting the warp-lightning cannon fire off the spells you cast as warp-lightning tainted explosions.
"
436,,400,Warp Booster ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Any Warlock-Engineer or Master is always searching for more power, be it of personal might or political prowess. But magical power is a type that all creatures respect, and so the engineers of Skavenblight have created a quick way to swiftly increase one’s magi-technological might. Warpstone-bronze pylons, installed along the spinal column, shoulders, and skull, that constantly tap into the power of Chaos and the Horned Rat’s realm of ruin. Any spell or ritual cast by a warlock with these pylons grafted into his flesh and bone sees significant enhancement, turning a simple bolt of warp-lightning into a cascading storm with the snap of clawed fingers.
"
437,,400,Technomancy ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Magitek,"Fusing technology with magic is not a new practice, especially since technology has existed since man first made fire, or tied a stone to a stick and called it a spear. While there are many other mages who purport to merge technology and magic, you do so with such seamless efficiency that it is nearly impossible to tell where technology ends and magic begins. You could tie the triggering of a spell to a computer program, having it take effect when someone tries to open it. Or perhaps you could use your magic to improve the quality of machines, increasing their speed, effectiveness and overall power. Perhaps you could even write out a grimoire, a repository of magical knowledge into a simple graphing calculator. Whatever you do, it will likely be creative and never seen before as the disparate disciplines are masterfully merged under your guidance.
"
438,,400,It Is Written ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"The use of mystical runes for enchanted effects is well known by those with a passing interest in the magical arts, but...the Sheikah were unique. They were able to create a “language” from runes, that had conditional statements and effects. In short - the Sheikah could program with runes, thus allowing for “programs” to become “spells.” You have knowledge of this art as well - You are able to use Runes to code “programs” such as those used by the Sheikah Slate to perform its functions. This combined with “Sparking Innovation” would give you the groundwork to create your own variant of the Sheikah Slate with your own round of Runes...though magic doesn’t make something simple - you’ll need to create the code for these Slates yourself.
"
439,,400,Servant of the Spirits of Good ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"I’m not actually 100% sure what the Lokomo are, but they seem to be either directly created by, or perhaps simply empowered by, the Spirits of Good. Not sure what those are either. Anyways, the primary difference between the Lokomo and the Sheikah seems to be that the Lokomo lean even more towards spirituality. Which is why you have the ability to empower and re-energize ancient artifacts and weapons simply by being around them. This isn’t a free effect, but the various issues and reasons why you shouldn’t be able to do so just don’t seem to apply. As long as you have energy to spare, you can fix them."
440,,400,Ancient Oocca Technology ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Magitek,"The ancient Oocca built many strange technologies, leaving them around Hyrule before they absconded to their new home in the sky. Somehow- either by learning from the artifacts they left behind, or perhaps by learning from one of their inventors yourself- you have learned a great deal about magic and technology, like the greatest of them, allowing you to make similar wonders. The clawshots and Dominion Rod are just two examples of what you can make; with enough resources, you could make something like the Sky Cannon, or even your own City in the Sky!"
441,,400,Dimensional Device ,Undertale,Magitek,"As useful as it is to upgrade technology, sometimes versatility in a gadget is what you need. But how does one fit a jetpack, two storage boxes, a wireless hotspot, a SOUL resonator, a keychain, and a working cellphone all into one? Why, Magic, of course! You know how to make dimensional spaces that allow technology to fold in on itself at about a 3:1 cubic ratio- You could take an average-sized car and fold it into a large piece of luggage you can wheel behind you, for example. You can also make Dimensional Boxes for storage that have 5 cubic feet of storage space and fit in your pocket, though you can't put living things in there."
442,,400,Technomancy ​,World Seed,Magitek,"Often hailed as the most innovative magic, users of Technomancy are capable of creating, controlling, scanning, and even assimilating technology with magic. And now you are one of them. But not just a normal one, oh no. Your talent with Technomancy can rightfully said to be quite monstrous. Whether it is commanding machines to do your bidding with just a thought, probing devices with your magic to discover their functions and any possible flaws, or disassembling and reassembling them, you can do it all with contemptuous ease. If you trained a bit, you could of course also create your own technology to use, entirely through magic, as long as you have any necessary materials before you. Another interesting ability of Technomancy is its function to let you interface with technology and use yourself as a medium for information to be displayed. So if you, for example, wrote a program to let something pass through your Aura, such as the hologram function of your companion bracelet, you could simply use Technomancy to establish a connection with the bracelet and yourself.But your biggest talent lies in the replication of implants and other technological marvels within yourself and others. You could for example quite easily copy the aura of a camera and adapt your eye to mirror it, or do the same to the auras of memory banks and computers to enhance your brain. With your skill, you don’t even have to worry about overloading your puny biological body by using technology that is too advanced. Beyond that, what you can do is up to you. After all, the potential of magic is only limited by its users ability, creativity, and skill. Though I’m sure that with your potential, you’ll manage to go quite far in the rat race of life. Concerning technology at least, social skills are not included in this package."
443,,400,Vain Practices ,Konosuba,Magitek,"This world’s been stuck in a bit of a rut, progressing very little compared to the speed that your original home world did. It’s not for lack of intelligence in the people here, just a curious lack of motivation. One you apparently don’t share. You have an incredible ability for both reverse engineering, capable of remaking normal or magical devices as the other with an appropriate amount of work to match their power or level of advancement, and also for mass production, allowing you to get things made thrice as fast as any other, even on a large scale so long as you’ve personally created the systems with which they are made."
444,,500,Blade of the Shadow Woman,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Unlike all the other options in this section,
the Blade of the Shadow Woman, originally owned by the king of Tenrou, isn’t a
Teigu neither a Shingu, but a Meihou instead, being arguably the most powerful and
notable of them. Being as durable and sharp as any other sword-type Teigu, this
sword has the special ability of projecting invisible slash attacks with each swing of
its blade in a way to Shamshir, however, unlike that Teigu that do it by simply
creating razor-sharp air currents via movement pressure, its slash attacks are made
out of an actual invisible force that was referred by the king of Tenrou as the
“Shadow Woman”. These slash attacks are incredibly dangerous, powerful enough
to even cause damage on armors like the Grand Chariot and Incursio as well as fast
enough that, even if someone manages to detect the attacks, it would take someone
at least as fast as a member of the Elite Seven to comfortably dodge a single attack.
However, due to not being a Teigu, the Blade of the Shadow Woman doesn't have a
special ability that can be classified as its trump card."
445,,500,Dimensional Formation: Shambhala,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"One of the team of engineers hired
by the First Emperor to create the Teigu managed to obtain and learn techniques to
manipulate and control space from the mystics of a now-lost nation, with such an art
being mainly to create this support-type Teigu, Shambhala, that takes the form of a
hand-sized pendant. Shambhala grants its user the ability to manipulate space,
allowing them to teleport people and objects over large distances as long as they
had been to that location, or at least a few meters close to it, before.
Unfortunately, teleporting requires a lot of energy, so most users will be unable to
teleport immediately after using the ability only once, requiring a period of rest before
it can be used again. However, someone with very good reserves of energy will be
able to teleport objects and themself in rapid succession as long as they still have
enough energy. It can also be used to mark locations, allowing the user to open
portals between marks remotely, but it’s probably more energy draining than the
regular teleportation. Lastly, consuming even more energy than before, its trump
card is the ability to open door-sized portals to a weird alternate space that no one is
able to come back to without having access to their own spatial manipulation, with
this space being located ... somewhere."
446,,500,Carnage Incarnate: Grand Chariot,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"After the Empire’s forces finally
managed to hunt the Tyrant, its still living flesh was used to forge one of the most
notable Teigu, Incursio, however, it was meant to serve as a prototype due to lacking
proper limiters to the beast’s life force and adaptation, so, after perfecting the
methods and techniques used on its creation, the completed Teigu, Grand Chariot,
was forged. This armor-type Teigu usually takes the form of a black short sword with
a handguard and a chain link tassel on the hilt that works as its key while in its
sealed form, but, by stabbing the key into the ground will release it from its container,
making the user to be enveloped in full-body armor.
This armor grants its user greatly increased physical strength and speed, even
above the initial physical enhancement granted by Incursio’s armor, turning the user
into a physical powerhouse capable of ripping through a shield of thread made by
Cross Tail and withstand a blast from Pumpkin with basically no damage other than
the knockback caused by it. It also has some very limited flight capacity, basically
being only useful for it to jump high into the air to perform a drop-kick on the target
that causes high damage. In the same way as Incursio, Grand Chariot possesses a
spear capable of cutting through Danger Beasts with ease as its auxiliary equipment.
However, as the advanced model of Incursio, Grand Chariot is always in a state of
equilibrium, having no explosive power and being unable to forcibly evolve like
Incursio can, which, while it makes the finished version weaker than the prototype in
a way, might still be considered a blessing due to how dangerous Incursio becomes
if it forcibly evolves too much. Grand Chariot also lacks Incursio’s invisibility and
doesn't have an actual trump card of its own, so, because of its lack of special
abilities, many would consider it inferior to its prototype but others may consider it a
Teigu more trustable and easier to wield than Incursio."
447,,500,The Speed of Lightning: Susano'o,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"The biological Susanoo is a Teigu
originally created for escorting important people that, exactly like other similar
organism-type Teigu, capable of regenerating injuries as long as his core was intact
and being immune to poisons and toxins that would kill ordinary warriors. However,
differently from other biological Teigu like Hekatonkheires, Susanoo not only has a
mostly human appearance, but also a fully developed personality, even if acting as a
servant to its user as well as depending on having an user to be able to move.
In addition to innately being an extremely skilled warrior, Susanoo also has access to
three different auxiliary armaments, but only the first one is available at all times,
while the other two can only be used while his trump card is activated. These three
weapons are: the Wolf Fang Mace (a regular stave-like weapon with blades
protruding from it), Yata no Kagami (a floating disk that usually stays on his back but
that can be used to create a mirror capable of reflecting basically any kind of
projectiles) and Ame no Murakumo (a very long, transparent sword from the energy
stored in his core, having an immense power to the point of being capable of cutting
Esdeath's multiple-layered ice wall with ease).
Finally, Susanoo’s trump card is known as Magatama Manifestation and it’s one of
the most powerful abilities available for all the Teigu, but with a price that matches its
power. When activating his trump card, Susanoo absorbs his user's life energy into
the magatama on his chest in order to access a more powerful, armored form. While
under the effects of the Magatama Manifestation, his hair whitens, his horns turn
black, and Yata no Kagami appears on his back. As his user needs to give him some
of their life force in order to fuel his trump card, each usage of it might reduce their
lifespan and they’ll surely die if they command him to use it three times.
Furthermore, along with his battle ability, he's fully-equipped with the ability to do
various household chores with legendary skill so he can be of use around the clock.
Any household chores, be it cleaning, laundry, sewing, cooking, whatever it may be.
When it comes to cooking, the repertoire of food he can cook numbers in the
thousands.
Curiously, as this Susanoo isn’t the original, he won’t automatically be a neat freak
unless you want him to be, as the original Susanoo apparently became one overtime
in his long “life”. Optionally, instead of a man, you can also choose this replica of
Susanoo to instead take the form of a woman or of a genderless puppet, with this
having no differences on the Teigu’s power and skills."
448,,500,Thunder God's Rage: Adramelech,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Another elemental Teigu with the rare
ability to create their own element, Adramelech takes the form of a pair of gauntlets
with the ability to create, shape and manipulate electricity, allowing the user to use
lightning as a weapon in both offense and defense, like creating a large, electric orb
that could be shot as a projectile or fire beams of pure electricity. Adramelech can
also be used to float in midair and fly by charging himself with electricity, as well as
being able to manipulate the weather itself, being capable of generating a literal
thunderstorm and calling forth lightning to strike down anyone the user wants, with
each charged lightning from it having enough power to kill a Danger Beast easily.
Additionally, Adramelech is also fitted with a charge meter, that measures how much
remaining electricity it has to use on its attacks as the Teigu generates and
accumulate power overtime, and a scope to use together with its trump card, Solid
Shooter, a black-colored powerful electric beam containing huge amounts of pure
electrical energy."
449,,500,March of the Dead: Yatsufusa,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Being arguably the most morally warped
Teigu, complete with its own ominous aura, and perfect for an user with an equally
warped mind, this fearsome katana holds the accursed power to reanimate and
control up to eight corpses as mindless (and maybe soulless) puppets, as long as
they were killed by the Teigu’s blade. The reanimated puppets will still possess all
the skills and abilities they had in life, with reanimated Teigu users even being still
able to use their former Teigu, as well as retaining pale fragments of their habits,
desires and traces of personality.
The user can reanimate any living being, regardless if they’re monsters, animals or
humans, however, the dead can’t progress and evolve, so the puppets' condition will
remain the same as it was upon their death no matter how much time passes and
thus they can’t learn new things nor improve their physical capabilities beyond those
achieved during their life. The Teigu can control the puppets as long as they’re
mostly intact, with beheading them or greatly damaging their brain being enough to
kill them again. Additionally, the user won’t need to walk carrying the corpses, as
Yatsufusa’s puppets will technically remain “stored” within it, being able to be
summoned from the ground/shadows whenever they’re needed and coming back to
the ground when dismissed.
Furthermore, this accursed power also has a price, as, for each puppet the user
actively controls, they become weaker, with stronger puppets requiring even more
strength from the user to be controlled, but if a puppet is destroyed or temporarily
unsummoned, it causes the user to regain some of their strength back."
450,,500,Motherbox,DC Comics,Magitek,"Created by New Genesis scientist Himon using the mysterious Element X, Mother Boxes are
generally small, box-shaped supercomputers-although their true design is but an echo of the
divine labours that built them . They possess wondrous powers and abilities not understood
even by their users, the New Gods. Most famously able to open portals called Boom Tubes into
almost anywhere in the universe as well as most other realms of existence, they can also shape
matter and energy to an astonishingly precise degree: Healing wounds, providing disguises,
changing the gravitational constant of an area, controlling emotional state of nearby sentients,
taking over and improving nonsentient machinery, stabilise an environment as hostile as space
for mortals to survive in and even bonding with a human to elevate them into a New God have
all been demonstrated. The only real limit to their capability is a short range of effect, as well as
a relative lack of raw power-but the virtually inexhaustible knowledge they hold from their
connection to the Source makes these divine tools endlessly useful.
You own one such box, and as usual with it’s rightful owner on top of everything else it offers
unconditional love and support. You could be cast into the Omega Sanction with it, and it would
do everything in it’s power to save you."
451,,500,Sufficiently Advanced Technology and Sufficiently Analyzed Magic,DC Comics,Magitek,"You’ve cracked the trick that the Post-Crisis era wouldn’t see spread publicly until far into the
future of its modern society: The seamless and efficient fusion of technology and magic. Given
time and study, any magical process can be replicated with technological systems that any oik
with an engineering degree but not a drop of magic in their blood could put together-or a
soulless AI for that matter. Likewise, any technological effect can be recreated by a spell of your
devising. It should go without saying that the more complex the effect you’re trying to emulate,
the more elaborate your preparations will be; have fun rigging up that particle accelerator you’ll
want to perform an actual world-changing miracle with, or using up the power of an entire
country’s leylines to power an interstellar high energy cannon. But the real trick comes from
being able to integrate the two systems together, letting you do things like trick demons into
chasing your astrally projected soul to the borders of Heaven through the internet as a medium
or uploading your brain to the body of a lobotomized demon lord. The sky’s the limit with this
newfound paradigm reconciling the seemingly disconnected forces, and in time you may change
the face of how war is waged in the cosmos forever with the forces you can bring to bear."
452,,500,The Phoenix ,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"There’s a tag, but you see no item. The Shopkeeper gestures for you to follow him, and you enter through a door in the back into the hangar once again. Except it’s not the Corona there – it’s a much bigger ship probably three times as long and twice as wide. You don’t see any weapons on the exterior.

The Shopkeeper beams. “The Cruiser class, but I call her the Phoenix. We retrofitted this little lady after she crashed and the crew bailed. The crash did her weapons systems in, but we took care of that by adding in automatic drones. She’ll start with four drones, and she can repair them too – but maybe you’ll be able to build a couple more?”

You want to inquire about other weapons, but the Shopkeeper beats you to the punch. “Before you ask, we couldn’t get the cannons up and running again, not after we installed the automatic piloting and the drones system – the little lady just didn’t have enough juice to support more than that. I figure you’ll need more power for the reactor before you can make any modifications. Maybe a new magicite reactor altogether would be best.”

The Phoenix comes with four combat drones, which she will automatically reconstruct if they are destroyed. With time and resources, she can autonomously operate twelve drones at once. However, the Phoenix will always seek to engage at her maximum range of 250 miles as she lacks weapon systems. Even if weapon systems are installed, she will still use her drones preferentially.

Besides the standard features of an airship, living quarters, a mess hall and a recreational deck – the Phoenix also has a massive maintenance bay which would make most Moogle engineers more than ecstatic. In order to support it all however, you would need to harvest a massive amount of magicite to form a stable core reactor. Or perhaps something else of equivalent power would suffice – the power once implanted cannot be removed."
453,,500,Cybershamanism,Marvel 2099,Magitek,"You are a practitioner of the spiritual-mystical art of cybershamanism. Combining modern technology, with shamanism understood through an anthropology by way of Hollywood lens, you possess the ability to disrupt electrical systems and technology. This ability is limited to your direct presence on your own, but it will scale to the transmission systems available to you; a major Hollywood system for global broadcast of holo entertainment could give you the ability to disrupt all electronics in a major city (like Hollywood) or possibly across California if you really tried.

These arts also allow you to summon forth spirits from cyberspace - or other similar computer information networks such as the internet in future jumps - crafting them from the mass subconscious by way of electrical data created and exchanged. To do so will require spiritual or mystical energy, either gathered yourself, or drawn from the faith and belief of your followers, and the amount of energy available will determine the number and strength of cyber spirits that you can summon."
454,,500,Hextech Notebook,League of Legends,Magitek,"This thick, ornate book is a tome containing the research of some of the world's leading minds in the field of Hextech. From Heimerdinger's slick, efficient turrets to Ziggs' bombastic hexplosives to Rumble's ramshackle mech-suit, this book contains extensive notes on the magical theory and thaumatic construction behind many of the most famous hextech creations on Runeterra, up to and including Viktor's notes on the creation of the steam golem Blitzcrank. Learn what you will from these notes, just don't let anyone else know you have them- Most of these inventor-types guard their secrets jealously."
455,,500,Beast In A Bottle,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Magitek,"Do you recall those weapons that Nine made, using a second Black Beast as a power source? The power source wasn’t actually made by her, but by Eight and Seven of the Ten Sages. It involved killing her sister, so you can imagine her reaction. Regardless, after taking it for herself she split in half, and the second half in eight. Each one of these fragments was used in the creation of the nine Arch Enemy Event Weapons. But apparently we have a tenth, because I’ve one for you if you want it. And trust me, it’ll give you a massive upgrade. A cutting enhancement now cuts through damn near anything. A flame enchantment creates a firestorm. A gun enchanted to split it’s bullets in half suddenly shoots dozens of bullets from a single round of ammunition."
456,,500,Elemental Affinity ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Some Mages possess a trait called a mana conversion affinity, which allows them to easily convert mana into a certain type of energy, common ones including lightning, ice and fire. Due to the fact that it’s relatively rare, along with the overwhelming preference for pure mana-based techniques, it is very uncommon to see them truly used in combat outside of sports or certain magical traditions. Taking this will allow you to add a channel to the Device’s casting processes that strictly favors a certain elemental affinity, including but not exclusive to the examples listed above. This will make spells within the affinity far, far easier to cast, with a much greater kick to them, but carries the downside of making elements not included in the affinity suffer from reduced power and efficiency as they have to go through the regular, non-streamlined channel. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
457,,500,Perfume Package ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This is... an incredibly strange system, to say the least. Four ‘globes’ are added to the main body of your device, or alternatively, two to the back of each of your hands. While not inherently magical themselves, they are based on magic hardware and- it’s a very strange system, again. Each of the globes contains perfume-like chemicals that... are actually explosives. That’s right, mass-based explosives. Completely non-magical and somehow legal. The system is capable of mixing the chemicals in the globes without them reacting in a negative way - i.e. exploding – and somehow produces various effects with this, such as producing remotely-triggered mines, smoke screens or simple explosive projectiles.

Even more strangely, your Device now seems to possess chemical batteries, now. Not magical batteries, these are fuel cells that provide electrical power. It doesn’t seem to contribute to the casting of any spells, but it powers the mixing and projecting system, along with erecting some manner of defensive field for you, as long as it possesses power, which supplements your Barrier Jacket. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
458,,500,Rite of Consumption ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know a terrible secret. A forbidden kind of magic. You know how to turn a living soul into Dust, and bind it to armor. Everything about that soul carries over to the new body, so it will remember everything before it happens. This allows you to turn anyone into a Broken Lord. It takes a substantial amount of Dust to make a suit of armor, and the ritual takes a day to perform. Did I mention some people consider Broken Lords monsters? Undergoing this Rite does not kill you, so you may freely become a Broken Lord without fear of losing the jump.

They create huge, mile wide fields of influence, their effects changing depending on the Arcana you have selected. May be taken as many times as you take Arcana of (Index) The amount of focus and endurance it takes to power these stones is enough to totally immolate lesser beings. Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Authority: You gain access to mind affecting magic, able to compel others to listen to you and implant thoughts not their own into their minds. With a pillar, you could brainwash entire districts and demoralize armies without lifting a hand. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Authority first.)"

Renewal: How do you think the Ardent's survive being strapped to pillars and burned? Because the same power they call upon to destroy can be used to heal. A Pillar becomes a bastion of good health, where the sick travel from all around to bask in the healing glow. It’s a giant floating regeneration beacon. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Renewal first.)"

463,,600,Unnamed Teigu: Danger Beast Controlling Teigu #1 or #2,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"There are
two different Teigu created with the ability to control Danger Beasts, with the first
staying in possession of the Empire while the second staff-like Teigu ended up falling
into the hands of the Revolutionary Army. The full capacity of these two Teigu and if
there are any differences between them other than cosmetic ones are unknown, but
you can now acquire your own replica of one of these Danger Beast Controlling
Teigu, be it the Empire’s Teigu or the Rebels’ Teigu. Regardless of your choice, your
replica will have the ability to directly control the minds of beasts and other similarly
irrational creatures, allowing the user to issue them commands and forcing them to
obey their will. Even Super Class Danger Beasts can be controlled by this Teigu, but
any creature needs to be weakened and subjugated before becoming controllable.
There are possible limits for how many beasts can be directly controlled at once
based on how energy the user has, but the Empire’s Teigu user is able to maintain
constant control over a swarm of Flying Deaths while the Rebels’ Teigu user is able
to control a small horde of colossal beasts at once."
464,,600,One Cut Killer: Murasame,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Another terrifying Teigu known for its ominous
aura, this fearsome katana can be considered a “sibling” of Yatsufusa as both wield
a similarly accursed power, with Murasame holding the power of killing a person with
a single cut, even if it’s just the smallest scratch.
Once the blade pierces the victim’s skin, whoever the victim is, a poisonous curse
will spread through their body appearing as black markings that originate from the
wound, killing them within seconds by stopping their heart. The curse’s markings
vanishes once the person had died, while only remaining permanently on the victim's
heart, serving as a sign that life was reaped by Murasame that can be detected by
anyone that does an autopsy on the corpse.
However, this cursed ability has some limitations. First, the curse only works on
living, organic beings that have a heart (or another similar organ), rendering it
ineffective against Armor and Biological-type Teigu as well as machines and
Yatsufusa's corpse dolls for example. Second, due to its nature as a poison, it’s
possible to survive the curse by cutting off the affected body part before it could
spread to the rest of the body. And, third limitation and last, due to its mystic nature,
a flaw of the curse is that, if there are two or more souls (or life forces) inhabiting one
body, only one soul can be killed at a time, however, you’ll be able to choose which
soul to kill with each cut.
Murasame also has its own trump card, Little War Horn, which acts as a
performance enhancer that greatly strengthens its user with the power of its
poisonous curse that is activated by the user cutting themself with the blade while
accepting to discard their humanity to embrace their inner demons and responsibility
for all the lives they had taken using this cursed katana, causing their scleras to turn
black with red markings appearing all over their body as well as a dark aura
enveloping their body. However, this cursed power has a price, as, in addition to it
causing strain in the user’s body, once they return to normal, the red markings will
vanish but leaving permanent scars on their body and will keep causing severe pain,
as well as making their body feel heavier and weaker for the rest of their life. This
trump card can be used multiple times, but each time will only worsen its side
effects. Supposedly, there is a cure for the trump card’s curse but this is a secret
hidden somewhere in Wakoku.
Last but not least, I advise you to use gloves when you clean Murasame, as I don’t
think you’ll want to cut yourself while cleaning its blade."
465,,600,Friends In High and Low Places,A Mage of Sorothustra,Magitek,"You may well have the Sorothustran equivalent of
blue blood for the way you naturally get along with royalty, rulers, and politicos of all sorts. You
have a mystic Rolodex filled with contact information for all sorts of influential rulers and their
aides and allies, as well as a secret Rolodex filled with information, including contact
information, on various subversive and dark figures, just in case you need to do a bit of darker
diplomacy."
466,,600,Staff of Hermes Trismegistus,Assassin's Creed: Odyssey,Magitek,"An extremely powerful artifact that grants numerous
benefits. First, the one accepted as the ‘wielder’ of the Staff, whether carrying it or not, gains
biological immortality, ceasing to age and becoming immune to almost all diseases or other
biological requirements. It also allows the wielder to manipulate energy on a very fine level,
which can include general energy blasts or barriers, and also manipulations of other people to
allow for effects like healing. The user can also teleport themself short distances, and the staff
can function as a form of computer, aiding the user’s mental capacity and processing. Finally,
the shape of the staff itself can be changed into other objects, such as spears, lanterns, rings,
etc. As an important note, this Staff lacks the corrupting properties of the canon staff,"
467,,600,Technomage ,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Magitek,"​Making machines that run on magic, or just magical equivalents of Muggle
technology, or something as simple as just making muggle devices work in magical environments
is all child’s play for you. You can translate flawlessly between technology and magic, meaning
that you can make technological equivalents to all magic you know and magical equivalents to all
technology you can make without losing so much as an iota of the effectiveness. But while being good at merging magic and technology is pretty good, being able to merge wildly futuristic technology with highly advanced magic is better. Not only are you highly skilled at magic, but you’re now just as good at the technology side of it, being a
certifiable genius among geniuses. Your merged devices now run far superior to either the magic
or the tech would run alone, providing dramatically higher effectiveness and utility. In addition,
your skills with the more ‘technical’ branches of magic, such as Arithmancy and such cross all
imagined levels. Finally, you can achieve even things normally believed impossible through combining spells and
technology. You can dispense with the more symbolic and ritualistic components of any and all magic you do, making it entirely as reproducible as technology. Automated spells, potion-making through machines... it’s all possible now."
468,,600,Flesh vs Machine,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Magitek,"Many have sought to create life be it to have a child or in their own attempt at godhood.
The greatest of these beings are effectively gods in their own right. Despite this they still
require a builder, which you can fill the role of. You are a master of robotics, cybernetics,
and a variety of other fields allowing you to craft these marvelous machines. Beings
such as A.M.A.Z.O., Brainiac, Ultron, and even the more exotic constructs like the
Endbringers are all within your purview. You simply need access to some proper
materials and a decent lab in which to forge your creations. Of course when you create
these robotics revolutionaries you also can determine their minds. You could let them
naturally develop like children, create mindless workers, or construct a personality built
to your desires. At the very least all of your creations will be loyal to you so that you
don't get killed by brand new wonder."
469,,600,Rapid Response Unit - Cavalry -,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"When it is time to make sure nothing survives the sweep – there’s always the Cavalry to call upon.

Three cruiser class airships emerge, raining laser fire over the battlefield in a fifty metre area which you designate by a nifty lighter device that also functions as a laser. It appears that the cruisers are constructs though, because they don’t ever interact with you besides to destroy your target.

Sheesh, Sanctum technology has gone a ways for sure. The constructs weaken however, if you repeatedly use them in succession in the day. Perhaps you need to give the constructs a bit of time to recharge?"

You could tell the AI to go away, but then it actually seems to sound sad when you do so..."
471,,600,Overload,Final Fantasy XI,Magitek,"Sometimes the power of your automaton is just not enough to finish the job, when the time comes for you to do or die you have an answer. You can cause your automaton or really any machine you control to temporarily gain a massive power boost making its abilities skyrocket twice to even three times as much as the would bormally be for a short period of time. For a few moments, from minutes to an hour depending on how much of an increase the automaton recieves, your automaton will be able to accomplish things that would normally be impossible for it. Of course such a skill must come with a downside, your machine will overheat after use and be unable to use this skill again for at least a day though it will still be able to work as normal during this cool down period."
472,,600,"PROTOTYPE Ω, “THE ANCIENT COUNTERMEASURE”         ",Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Not much is known about this machina to be honest. From what we do know of it, it may be a sufficient counter to beasts of massive size – and seems to be designed specifically to counter monsters of significant magical prowess and size. You’ll note that these are only blueprints – making the actual machine is going to be a challenge you’ll have to tackle yourself.

Not unlike the Panzer unit, its main armament is a cannon, though its control scheme is...very strange to say the least. All we can really gather is that the ancients considered musical instruments as valid control devices. The machine itself is massive however – so it can easily serve as a mobile attack and defence platform. If you would consider the Panzer to be a tank sized machina, this monstrosity is essentially a flying battle cruiser. At least with all of its autonomous defence lasers you won’t have to worry at all about its safety!

Be wary of one thing – the destruction guarantee only applies to a single unit built from this blueprint – and the whole “identify friend/foe malfunction” that plagued it? Well, you’re probably going to want to attach an IFF system onboard. There are still plenty of secrets to be discovered with this monster...so good luck."
473,,600,Garment Grid Reformatting,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Don’t care about adding additional sphere slots, and you simply want to have more connections? While this doesn’t have a substantial effect on the other garment grids, with the [JC] variation this has a very substantial effect of doubling the amount of connections – and also doubling the number of effects that you can choose by changing the garment grid configuration from its default configuration to the following configuration:

This shifts the number of connections/jumps from 4 to 8, and also allows you to select up to 8 effects rather than the basic choice of 4. You still have to actually make each jump between the dress spheres to activate the effects of course.

474,,600,1000 Years After...,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"There are those who have come to understand the potential that rests within the Farplane – and so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that there are those who have chosen to initiate research into this energy. The timing isn’t quite right, the research is still under wraps, but there will be development...it’s not in human nature to leave such things undisturbed.

Considering all the energy that rests within the Farplane, within that stream of energy you could see as Life itself, sooner or later someone will consider harvesting it. The equipment for such practices will be largely experimental – but you’ll be able to put it together with sufficient time and effort...allowing to pull life energy out of the world around you. Perhaps...enough energy to even put down a creature like Sin, provided you had a way to channel it."
475,,600,Metatron's Cube,The Games We Play,Magitek,"A strange glass cube with mind boggling shapes and dimensions contained within, it
glows a faint, piercing blue. This is a terrifying tool you have here. It’s a technique
contained within an item, and you can use it by breaking it on someone.
What’s the technique?
Well, Metatron’s Cube of course, the higher-dimensional prison currently containing
Malkuth. When used on a target, it creates a prison of ever-ascending dimensions that
eventually culminate above physical reality, in a ‘place’ where time, space, and other
such physical constants matter little.
Escaping from the Cube would be a tremendous task for even an Archangel, and
escaping is definitely necessary, as the lack of physical reality erodes the mind and
personality of those dependent on a physical form. You have no inherent mastery or
knowledge of the Cube, so you have no way of shutting it down. Hope you didn’t use
it on the wrong person. If used, you’ll get a new one at the start of your next jump."
476,,600,Aura Transfer Machine,RWBY,Magitek,"Ah now this is an interesting piece of technology. These chambers are able to drain Aura from one being and store it or transfer it to another. Maybe ethically questionable but Pietro did manage to create Penny with this kind of procedure. Not to mention that it would have been able to transfer the Maiden Powers of the Fall Maiden to Pyrrha. You get two of these chambers one to drain one to receive.

478,,600,Amity Arena,RWBY,Magitek,"Amity Colosseum is a marvel of technology, flying proudly as a symbol of the 4 Kingdoms unity and created to hold the battles for the Vytal Festival. Crafted with resources from all of Remnant, it is a humongous Arena, capable of holding hundreds of spectators with ease.

The fighting itself takes place in a large octagonal which is capable of changing its environment into several different ""biomes"", including grasslands, forest, fire and ice, geyser fields, stormy mountains, desert, an ocean and beach with a wooden ship, and a few others. The arena also has artificial weather effects, such as thunderstorms and an artificial sun, as well as being able to raise platforms with gravity dust functions. The central part remains the same regardless of the biome. Any spectators are protected by a force field of hard light dust from stray shots (or visiting Nevermores). You gain your own version of this Arena, to train and perhaps hold your own Festivals. Any training you do in this Arena will be more effective than it otherwise would be and you can even launch ‘simulations’ of opponents you encountered in your Journey to practice against. Dying won't be an issue either as long as no party actually wants the other to die, or it's only against a simulation."
479,,600,Atlesian Genius,RWBY,Magitek,"With Dust truly marvels of technology are possible but it would all be pointless junk if no one ever came up with the idea on what to do. Now you are one of the individuals in Remnant, gifted with an incredibly intellect like Arthur Watts and Pietro Polendina. You could hack yourself into advanced Kingdoms, create prosthetics that seamlessly function and work with their wielder without dampening their capabilities, come up with machines of War like the Paladins or perhaps even the process of transferring Aura to humanoid robots and give them such developed AI they are impossible to tell apart from a normal person.

With this and the example of the renowned Dr. Odine (he sure is prolific), you've made an astonishing breakthrough. With just a little application of science, you're capable of building a device that can harness almost any kind of energy using wearable devices to produce your own brand of para-magic. Want to cast spells using friction, explosions, or nuclear power? All are possible, and you're even capable of storing the spells made from this energy for later use. Of course, the strength of the magic depends entirely on how much energy you can produce, and it takes more than just a thought and a wish to harness energy into magic. You'll have to put in some good, honest work and study to figure out how it works, and how it can be used to create your own system of magic. The resulting spells you can create depend on the energy harvested too, for good or for ill. Expect explosion magic to tend towards large explosions of force, and magic created from water power to manipulate that element or the energy of waves, for example. It can be a boon or a curse, though creativity could be used to utilize this aspect to its full potential and power or mitigate the drawbacks of it. It's a long and difficult road full of countless hours in books and labs, but what kind of scientist would have it any other way?"
482,,600,A Doll: Refitted Sword        ,Avesta of Black and White,Magitek,"An android, almost indistinguishable from a regular human besides some of her interior parts. Similar to Quinn, this is another creation of the Forge of Ruin made in the image of Ahura Mazda, the Divine Blade. But while Quinn didn't know of her original capabilities, this android is fully aware of her true nature, and this one seems to have been prepared more for combat than for connecting with others.

She is capable of freely switching between her existence as an android that doesn't really require any of the attentions of a human, and a replica of the Divine Blade, a holy weapon that carries the trait of immutability, making it basically indestructible. Not only that, but she also increases her wilder’s power and their skill with the blade immensely.

This blade is however special from its other versions. It seems that she has been designed specially with you in mind. Not only she herself seems to be completely devoted to you, albeit her personality is still being developed, but her prayer collecting capabilities have been switched to gathering strength from the number of your followers. The more people that follow and believe in you, regardless of their alignment or intentions, the stronger you become while wielding the blade, increasing even further the previous boost in power.

Even if the blade or her human avatar was somehow destroyed, you could always get a new vessel for it by just grabbing another sword of high craftsmanship. At that point, it would gain all the capabilities of the Divine Blade, for her true essence rests inside you. As such, she doesn’t count as a companion even in her human form and can be taken with you as a follower, albeit if you wish you may import her as a companion, changing that."

He had taken the divine and made it mundane for the sake of humanity and that act gave him genuine, immense power. While some may point how the ridiculousness of his science becoming supernatural, one can’t ignore the power that technology gained, especially against the supernatural. You are a true creator in the same vein as Tesla himself now. The technology you create is supernaturally empowered, becoming more and more so the wider spread your technology is in the world you are in and the more your technology advances that world. If you created and spread around the world the secret of electricity, which revolutionised the entire world, you would then be able to create electrical devices that allowed you to do battle with even some of the mightiest Servants in history. Your technology is also imbued with even greater power than normal when used against Divine opponents, as the Gods seem to have an innate aversion to the progress you bring.

Boosted: Your inventions and the changes they brought to the world are unforgettable. Why should being away from your great efforts cut you off from their benefit? The impressions you leave behind are so great that your technology boost from the base perk is no longer limited to the current world and time that you are in. Even being in a different world or a time before you made your inventions doesn’t remove your boost, as it is now judged from the total weight of the changes you have made over your lifetime rather than that of the world you are in.

He was killed by the Black Silence during his rampage, but the scientist’s work lives on, both through his daughter picking up from where he left, and you with the fruits of his labor. This is a chair, perhaps reminiscent of one you can see in a hair salon with a device on an arm going on top of someone’s head, though this doesn’t dry your hair of course, it’s the City after all. Instead, the person sitting in the chair will be killed and converted into a gear, which can be surgically attached to another person to empower them, with the chair being able to perform the process. Most people become meat gears that enhance physical strength in the user or an ally, while more intelligent people become thought gears that grant better intellect, reaction times, and psychic abilities in larger quantities. Gears can be individually removed and attached to different people, though they can also be destroyed by physical methods and break quickly if attacked."

You might or might not be among the ranks of the Head’s executioners, but you have the equipment of one regardless, and thankfully without the Head knowing, most obviously is the massive clawed arm that can tear through even Singularity based armors and the mask which nullifies a single powerful strike before needing to recharge, more importantly, the augments within you are of a quality to which even colors will have trouble keeping up with your might and speed. A pack of three injectors though is probably the greatest weapon in your arsenal; the orange injector, Serum R, gives you a massive burst of speed and adrenaline; the green injector, Serum K, heals you to a point where using one on the brink of death will have you at about halfway to peak condition; and the blue one, Serum W, will give you the ability to break through dimensional spaces and teleport for a short while, catching any targets off guard and forcefully pulling them through spatial rifts if they survive. Injecting all three Serums at once creates a cocktail with the effects of all three, healing you while giving a massive burst of energy and dimension tearing power, but injections can be interrupted by taking too much damage while using one, and being stopped will leave you vulnerable for a few seconds, the serums recharge in a few minutes of being used and each vial can store enough for about 5 doses each."

Some of the singularities they have access to are:

F Corp’s Fairy which makes slashes in the air and works as a skeleton key while also attaching onto people to cause more damage,

J Corp’s Lock which works on people’s minds or conceptual ideas, as well as making chains, pillars, and massive shockwaves, don’t feel limited by these singularities, there is a list of them in the notes. You get access to 5 singularities with each purchase, note that these are only weaponized versions of the singularities so it’s impossible to reverse engineer them or apply them in less damaging ways.

Beholders on the other hand are B Corp’s surveillance specialists, who are capable of remotely viewing and otherwise sensing places across the City, they are also used to remove Impurities by relocating them into the Outskirts with capabilities of teleporting massive structures across multiple districts. You can pick either the abilities of an Arbiter or Beholder and another purchase gives you the other one or an extra 5 singularities if you already picked an Arbiter’s power.

490,,600,Neon Genesis Mechamaru,Jujutsu Kaisen,Magitek,"A giant, mechanical cursed corpse, coated in thick metal armour and standing dozens of metres tall. This one functions a bit differently from most, though: instead of acting autonomously or controlled from a distance, the user pilots this cursed energy-powered mecha from a cockpit inside of its head. It’s incredibly easy to use, too: just through your intent and pulling a few levers, you can manoeuvre as if it were an extension of yourself.

Its physical abilities are incredible, as could be expected of a construct of its size. Its strong enough to shatter dams of solid stone and leave great craters in the wake of its every punch, tough enough to tank several blows of that same level of strength before its armour starts breaking, and fast enough to bound and sprint across the land with surprising speed, all without any expenditure of energy. When one does begin to use cursed energy, though? It becomes capable of feats far beyond this, most often in the form of beams of concentrated cursed energy. At its absolute greatest, its able to fire off multiple blasts of energy at once that home in on their target, each of which has the power to completely obliterate vast swathes of land wherever they hit, and are on par with a special grade sorcerer’s output.

Of course, this consumes enormous amounts of cursed energy, enough that your average sorcerer wouldn’t even be able to fire one without a good year or more of preparation. Fortunately, even if you don’t have ridiculous levels of cursed energy to power it, this mecha’s reserves have already been topped up with huge amounts of the stuff, enough to fire off over a dozen blasts before running out. This energy recharges to full at the end of each year.

It does have one extra feature on top of this: four tubes that can be manually loaded from the cockpit, then fired from the mecha’s hand like shells. These tubes are charges imbued with a cursed technique, which activates as soon as it makes contact with something. By default, these are loaded with Simple Domain, allowing them to injure the very soul of those they strike, though you may imbue them with a technique of your own, or that of one of your allies. These charges likewise replenish after a year, though you can make more if you wish."
491,,600,Under a Microscope,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"The source of most of this world's grief lies with, you guessed it, Shinra. It was Shinra who discovered the Planet's very own life force could be harnessed into an easily accessible and potent power source, long-term consequences be damned. You have taken a page from this playbook, able to harness 'natural' and magical energies from the world and even the souls of other living beings into a usable energy source, several times more potent than regular-old electricity generators. This can also include genetic modification by using a dead creature as a template, or modifying living beings through this same energy.

Even if you have no interest in discovering your own variant, you also know how to extract Mako from a living planet, bleeding the world itself just to power your own sciences...or your coffee machines. However, if you're willing to go the extra mile, you can learn to make 'safe' substitutes for these energies by increasing its efficiency through experimentation, making it so comparatively small doses of Mako could power as much as a standard Reactor...or you could double down and work to bleed the world dry within a single generation. The possibilities are truly endless."
492,,600,The Machine,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"You know how to build the robots. Really, that's the core of what this offers. You were likely an employed scientist or engineer for Shinra, knowing how to build their computer technology, weapons, and their automated robots and assembly lines. They can function with a fairly simple AI, though they often lack sentience or complex problem-solving skills. With time, you can eventually make things like brainscans of living individuals to preserve their knowledge and personality, or construct weapons on the same scope as the Junon Cannon.

The best part? There’s no Will of the Pseudo-Honkai Energy, so you don’t have to worry about Pseudo-Herrschers popping up, and neither do you have to worry about Honkai Beasts with this generator.

Similar, yet different, from the ‘keys’ that Herrscher inherently possess themselves at times. Somehow, you’ve found one of these legendary relics.

Creator of the Divine Keys, the ICHOR augmentation system, Stigmatas, and... Frankly, quite a lot of things even Schicksal’s best minds can’t so much as decipher. Dr. MEI’s genius was, and still is, unrivaled to this very day. It may not have been enough to save her era, nor herself, but it was enough to ensure that there even was a tomorrow for humanity, and that they had warriors that could stand up to even a Herrscher, even for a short while.

Well, maybe that ‘unrivaled’ part is untrue.

Whether by random luck, or a secret preservation project, you have inherited the ingenuity and brilliance of Fire Moth’s greatest mind. Only one man comes even remotely close, and that man already has to juggle running a massive international organization alongside his own sinister plans. As for someone like you, you have a clarity that can revolutionize the technology of today, and perhaps even reclaim some of humanity’s lost progress. Do not mistake this for a perfect mind, however. There are still some projects even she couldn’t complete, nor even stomach.

Boosted: Now we’re talking! You’re an even greater genius scientist than Dr. MEI, being able to complete projects that she can’t even comprehend with effortless ease. Even the Divine Keys look as simplistic as what an unskilled amateur would make, and you can create replicas of them out of literal scrap (okay, maybe not quite as extreme as churning out an advanced armored mech-suit while in a cave with a box of scraps) in a matter of hours, instead of requiring a Herrscher Core and months of work just to create a single Key.

However, the Steamwork Castle harbors a secret that few would believe. With a flick of a switch, the side wings of the castle pull themselves against the main building. A second switch then causes the entire castle to dive below the ground. It is highly suggested you ensure everyone you want to stay alive to take shelter inside. Once underground, the mechanisms allow you to move the entire castle as if it were some sort of clockwork mole. It’s not the fastest traveller and it moves most easily through loose soil, but it can remain underground for days at a time before the oxygen starts to run out.

508,,600,Playing with Syringes        ,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"And just as concerning to find you playing with, the toys of the Claw. Did they fall off the truck which brought you here, or did you steal them? Either way, you have the somewhat weaker, if more versatile, signature gear of the feared Claw Corporation: A set of full body, high grade armor of woodesque material (seemingly of a new make which does not need integration into the body), and a gauntlet that reaches down your dominant arm before ending in the titular claw, able to extend an energy blade similar to those used by R-Corp. All of this is, as the work of a Claw demands, of the finest make of any weapon in the city barring the truly great, such as weaponized Singularities or the stronger results of the E.G.O phenomenon. 

However, with a thought you can inject one of three singularity derived serums mounted on the armor and benefit from their effects, which certainly make up for any comparative deficiencies in material science. However, one without (purchase included) specialized augmentations uses these serums, they will rapidly degrade internally due to the concentration and singular nature, and burn from the inside out, dying shortly without significant medical intervention;

The Blue serum, or Serum W, is the most directly damaging, drawing on the Singularity of W corp to tear repeated portals through space before looping back to your origin. Dragging an opponent through these rapid tears inflicts incredible damage, as their body is warped internally by the rapid fluctuations in space and time process, and shredded by the edges of broken reality. Despite its weakness of being quite one use, a singular burst of short range teleportation is also possible once the main effect has passed, though this isn’t capable of much offense, only affecting you. 

The Orange Serum, or Serum R, is less directly offensive, but has greater staying power, granting a vicious and longer lasting strength through causing the rapid division of cells, pushing your body into a burst of short term survival of the fittest combined with the serum replacing what’s overexerted, until burning out in a few minutes. 

The last given with this is the Green serum, Serum K, a cocktail of healing nanomachines injected into the body to repair the user's physiological trauma rapidly enough to heal enough damage to kill a man without the Cities countless augments thrice over. 

After all three have been used a Tri-Serum cocktail can be formed within the body, allowing a flurry of devastating strikes using the last dregs in your system... 

With this purchase, you have enough of a replenishing supply to use these once a day each week. However, if this seems insufficient for your tastes, you seem to have something very important, and perhaps dangerous to own: The C-Corp Singularity based means to produce these vials from other Singularities, and the byproducts of similarly physics-violating, perhaps even maddening technology. Be careful who you let see you use these. As you well know by now, the Head’s very touchy about these things."
509,,600,Singular Weapons,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"...there’s no question as to what this is, the black-and-gold trim of an Arbiter is nothing if not memorable. The material alone eclipses the protective qualities of even Nuovo fabric, and while somewhat weakened in comparison to the real thing, this gear allows for the creation of energy projectiles that range from the weighty pillars of Binah to the lithe, thorny lines of Zena. Either type give seasoned colors pause, even if only through the sheer shock each strike I nflicts on the body and its faculties. 

But that alone could never be why the sight of an Arbiter is as good as a death knell. That shared honor falls down to the fact that these patterns mark you as someone who wields the might of dual Singularities in battle; a might you can partake in. Since an Arbiter is more akin to an assassin than a soldier, the Singularities they hold may very well change from mission to mission depending on the expected opposition, so you may choose to take any two Singularities from Wings past or present to use for the entirety of the jump, so long as the result is weaponizable and makes sense. 

To use a pertinent example of how an Arbiter would use their Singularities, Binah’s foray into L Corp led to her using Fairies and J Corp Locks in order to instigate a mass breakout of abnormalities (though other circumstances would waive this requirement) and lock down the facility to prevent employees escaping. In addition, the combat applications of unlocking skin to cause hemorrhages with movement, and locking down muscles to prevent movement were especially effective against the explosive combat style of the Red Mist. 

Another configuration could utilize G Corp’s Singularity alongside that of the L Corp that started the Smoke Wars should you be facing a crowd, as the force of gravity and caustic fumes are indiscriminate in their predations. Should you be facing one big, strong opponent - a Beast perhaps - you could use the Singularities of K Corp and P Corp, using the normally medicinal nanomachines to turn their flesh poisoned and cancerous while keeping yourself protected through the same methods that keep the Shelter from the 27th of March so impregnable. 

The Singularities given for use are heavily blackboxed, as is to be expected. The Head would be loath to let them be used for anything other than their intended purpose. But it would be a shame if these prizes were to lose their lustre, thus in future jumps the power of the Singularities will scale to match that of the highest quality weapons in the setting produced by humans as long as the seal hasn’t been tampered with. At least as long as their nature is nominally scientific rather than magical or psychological. You may also change which two Singularities are in use at the start of each year, in order to target a different foe. Unless, again, the black box is opened. Just be careful with this, it would be a rare few who wouldn’t take notice of someone dressed like an Arbiter."

Of course both sorts go to different types of workshops, as while there are countless smaller establishments ready and willing to cater to the masses, there are far fewer ready to cater to a more demanding and well paying type of clientele. Those of the highest calibre may even limit their buyers through memberships, letting a mere few peruse their wares. 

Only the richest and most influential can find membership in the best workshops, you might not necessarily fit this category but in your hands is a formal looking sheaf of papers that denotes your membership to an Atelier no one else has heard of entirely staffed by animated teddy bears - all legally distinct from a similar Atelier in District 14 - who take orders from you as their sole client. 

Assuming nothing untoward occurs, the bears will produce eleven pieces of gear per week. This might not seem like much, but not only are the bears and their assembly lines uncannily efficient with the barest scraps of material, what they produce is invariably of the highest quality anything unassisted by EGO or a Singularity can achieve; family members could and do kill each other over such masterworks. 

The quantity produced rarely slows down either, so with enough time you could equip an army with exosuits with enough strength to punch through tanks, or lances that repeatedly detonate explosive payloads in opponents without compromising their own construction. Your workshop is even one of those lucky few with a firearms licence, so recreating and improving on the armor piercing, burning and freezing ammunition types of the Thumb is not out of the question. 

The bears also double as security for the workshop facility itself, as these teddy bears lack vital organs and sport enough strength to crush skulls in their fuzzy paws. Your workshop will follow you to future worlds, updating its designs and documentation to keep up with local weaponry and the regulations that allow their production. Even in locales with harsh controls on armaments they always seem to find a way."
511,,600,EGO Machine        ,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"A perfected version of the research of a former associate of Lobotomy Corporation, this machine draws in the volatile forms of Light emanating from those progressing towards distortion, and concentrates them. This has the effect of reducing the impact of their fears and traumas upon their thought process, but more importantly it refines and concentrates the Light, creating armor and weapons themed after the polluted mindsets it takes in. These items are more akin to the EGO of Lobotomy Corporation, allowing one to wield them with no prior training, so long as their mental fortitude is great enough to overcome the embodied trauma. These weapons lack the potential for growth of a personal EGO, shorn as they are of context and stripped from their originator. Still, with enough trauma and loss, one could even make EGOs equivalent to those of Lobotomy Corporation’s Alephs. 

As a side note, whereas the original machines were less than healthy for those they were used on, these ones do have safeties to ensure that those used as fuel for the device will remain fully cognizant. Of course, if those safeties were to be disengaged, the process would be somewhat more efficient."
512,,600,There is Always One,Final Fantasy III,Magitek,"If there wasn’t already one here, the name would fall to you: Cid. You have a brilliant mind, one with a knack for engineering and is highly inventive. You already know how to construct a vast array of advanced technologies, such as airships or perpetual motion engines, and can easily come up with new and novel technologies as well. Combined with something like Out of Their League you have gained a measure of insight into the creations of the ancients, able to construct massive air warships the size of a village like the Invincible."
513,,600,Sanat Kumara,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Magitek,"Yours to command is a flying object of unknown origin. Or as modern times may call it a UFO. Where did you get it? Where is it from? That seems to be an eternal mystery, even others trying to study it simply clueless, its composition different from anything found on Earth. But what you can be sure of is the use of this silver saucer. You yourself are perfectly comfortable inside of it, even as it rains down destructive flames, powerful enough to incinerate an army. It can also take the form of a Silver Torus and be used akin to a bike if that is more your style, still able to summon down the barrage of light beams."
514,,600,A Forge of Great Renown,Godbound,Magitek,"This iron bulb can expand into a mighty, citadel- sized forge that draws raw materials from the depths of the earth. At will the entire complex can be folded up back into the seed by its rightful owner, even safely coiling around any living beings within. It contains a great many lost forms of artifice and engineering from the Former Empires, including the facilities necessary to design and craft godwalkers: Large theotechnological war machines piloted by a mortal. These machines allow mortals to even match godbound and divine monsters, though they require being ‘recharged’ with the unique chakra generated at this Forge depending on how intensively they’re used, how large their battery capacity is and how well designed their chakra engines are. Less glamorous conveyer belts also provide excellent facilities for producing theotechnological cybernetics or clockworks, though the greatest prize lies in the most securely locked vaults found within: The blueprints for several different makes of Made Gods. Needless to say the sorcery, components and test subjects needed for these procedures are all precious by this world’s current standard but there are also many volumes of the theory for such complex constructs’ theotechnological basis."
515,,600,Fundamentals,The Owl House,Magitek,"While most of the Boiling Isles’ inhabitants practice magic the traditional way, a few have found a newer, more powerful method. The basis of this knowledge can be seen in the Potion Coven’s alchemy, which blends magic and chemistry to create stable, reproducible magical effects. But Emperor Belos hoards other secrets that provide even greater power. Both the harvesting of magic directly from local fauna and the strange technology that defends Belos’ castle show that much can be accomplished by combining modern cunning with ancient arcane knowledge.

Now, you too can blend science with sorcery. Whether you are brewing alchemical concoctions, harvesting biological material from magical creatures, or merging magic with your own technology, you’ll accomplish far more than any single discipline would allow. This WILL get the attention of the Emperor if you’re not careful, so try to keep your head down. In future worlds, you’ll find similar ways of melding new magic systems with your existing understanding of science."
516,,600,Dear Doctor,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Magitek,"What kind of sick, twisted community college gave you your degree? Careful study and copious amounts of experimentation has turned you into a genius when it comes to modifying existing biology. Whether you’re building cybernetic kill-switches into your minions, grafting unholy abilities onto your foot soldiers, or pushing the limits of what can be accomplished by blending technology and the occult, few can match your intellect. Unfortunately, we’re going on Naruto rules here, so there is a bit of a trade-off when it comes to quality and quantity. Want to outfit your entire army with the powers of the damned? You’ll need to water those powers down first. Want to turn your boss into an immortal biomechanical statement on transhumanism? You’ll probably only manage the operation once or twice."
517,,600,Doktor Jumper ,Hellsing,Magitek,"No longer an assistant, you’re a peer to the good Doktor in his greatest achievements. A genius, of course, but it is the science of the supernatural that allowed the Doktor to guide Millennium into the undead force it is tonight. The fields of supernatural biology and unnatural physics are your darlings, where advancing science and humanity as a whole becomes ever so easy. Using traces of a true vampire’s blood to create an army of enhanced artificial vampires might take a few years of experimentation but it remains more than possible. Immortality, mutated creations, even the use of unnatural plagues and biological weapons like the ghouls. 

These secrets unveil to your gleaming eyes, particularly so when you have a subject from which to attempt to directly understand and remake many supernatural traits or abilities. The work may often be messy and require much in the way of human resources but for the sake of humanity, it is worth it. Additionally, it appears that such extensive study of the life sciences taught you to be quite the good cook, especially when it comes to meat. Practicing your steak searing must’ve been quite the strange way to pass the time in the laboratory."
518,,600,Holy Warrior,Hellsing,Magitek,"Though their faith remains strong, the Vatican is well aware of the need to keep up with the changing times. At least, when it comes to the destruction of heathens, heretics and monsters. Both holy blessings and the miracles of science have gone into enhancing your form, turning you into a crusader against even the foulest demons of this world. 

Your body has been greatly empowered, such that only a werewolf would have greater strength and speed than you, while also gaining natural regenerative abilities. A bullet through the head heals in moments without trouble, even losing a limb or chunks of your skull take seconds before being fully restored. The process has left you almost tireless, able to fight without rest for days with ease, and your aging has slowed enough that even fifty years passing shows no signs of getting older. The same blessings that empower your body directly also transfer to your blows and the weapons you wield. As if soaked in water blessed by the Pope himself, you burn and smite unholy creatures with righteous power, even more than what your incredible physical strength might indicate. 

As a crusader like Anderson, you also have a similar level of experience in the field. While you are not a soldier skilled in a hundred different specialisations or an eastern warrior with superhuman martial arts, you can still brawl and throwdown well enough to take on almost any equal foe. Your honed instincts, combat experience and talent for beating things to death with your bare hands and anything tough enough to swing around leaves you a deadly foe even for a ancient vampire or elder werewolf."
519,,600,Time Machine,Wizards of Waverly Place,Magitek,"A time travel mechanism that allows Wizards to travel back or forward in time. You will need to set the date you want to travel to, and then pull the cord, just be mindful, changes to the timeline could be unpredictable, and you might end up causing drastic changes, such as renaming high five to Max, or less important changes like forgetting your best friend in the past."
520,,600,The Praying Gargoyle ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"Well, this is a bit different- I’m not even really sure if you should be allowed to have this, but I suppose an exception can be made. This is a relic known as the Stone Gargoyle, a relic allegedly made from the skin of an actual Gargoyle- or Gorlois, as the Atlanteans call them- with an Atlantean crystal at its core. The sorcery imbued in the statue during its creation has given it the ability to animate stone gargoyles- as in, the statues, not the species- as mindless servants, wholly obedient to their masters, in much the same way that the Heart of Atlantis animates its stone guardians to defend the city. Allegedly, the Praying Gargoyle can work its magic over an entire city the size of Paris- which, if you consider the number of gargoyles on Notre Dame alone that will be converted into nigh-indestructible stone juggernauts, this could be quite useful in the right or wrong hands."
521,,600,Sorcerer/Scientist ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"The art of creating, or even using, much of the technology that Atlanteans once took for granted in the past has been lost to the ages- a byproduct of the sudden shift from technologically advanced conquerors, to survivors huddling in the ruins of their former empire. The great upheaval, leading to the deaths of many by flood waters- and in the period of starvation that ensued- along with the king sealing away the Heart of Atlantis has led to the inescapable loss of the Atlantean written language. But not everyone forgets so easily. Although Kida was too young to have much of an understanding of Atlantean technology at her age, you have the knowledge that she lacks. Primitive looking and yet sophisticated on the inside, Atlantean technology is hewn from stone, metal, and crystal. The ability to fly at speeds that would put a bi-plane to shame are the least of what you can expect; beams of disintegrating energy and vast mechanical monsters that are best measured in miles may be created by you; the only issue is the matter of how you will power such things in large numbers… Although the Crystal Necklaces that Atlanteans possess will still work in future worlds, an alternative source of energy will likely be required for any sort of mass production."
522,,600,Genius Intellect ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Magitek,Your intellect is expanded into the top percentile allowing you to learn new methodologies and principles at an astonishing rate and to adapt magic and scientific principles from one to the other or merge them when necessary for even greater creations. You could potentially perform feats of creation like building portals to other dimensions like Demanitus did to trap Zhan Tiri to imprison her within a netherworld-like dimension called the Lost Realm.
523,,600,The Mad Doctor,Disney Villains Victorious,Magitek,"They called you mad, and they were right - but they can’t call you stupid, no sir. Especially not when it works. You’re able to “fuse” physical objects and living creatures through mad science and near-mystical procedures, using a lot of ingenuity and engineering to make these hybrids work, even when they shouldn’t otherwise."
524,,600,Pentagram Tesseract,Marvel Britain,Magitek,"A techno-magical marvel, this is a cage that can hold anything. No matter the strength, physical, mystical or otherwise. If you can trick or force something into this pentagram that exists as a tesseract across multiple dimensions it will be trapped until you choose to release it. This prison has contained things like a Lord of Hell without strain, and could contain anything as long as it enters the prison."
525,,600,Last Action Hero ,Symphogear,Magitek,"So you want to be the Last Action Hero? Like Dr. Ver, one of your arms has now been injected with the Nephilim’s cell, granting you the that special arm and all its power. However, rather than just reprogramming heretical technology, you’re able to innately control just about any sufficiently advanced or supernatural technology, even if you don’t understand how it works. With this, you can become the worst kind of hero."
526,,600,Science and Sorcery,Marvel Magic,Magitek,"Ordinarily magic and science are anathema to one another. Magic is not so simple or subservient that it can be mapped out with laws and hypotheses and will often take offense to attempts to do so, spitefully refusing to cooperate just as you think you're beginning to understand. For you, however, this is an entirely different story. Not only do you find it easy to mimic the effects of technology with magic or vice-versa, but you are talented at melding the two together into something more than the sum of its parts."
527,,600,Raised By Witches,Marvel: What If...?,Magitek,"An upbringing among Frigga’s coven has left you with insight and power like no other. Whether you’re manipulating dark matter to transmute creatures or crafting illusions and communications, others would be forgiven for calling you a witch. Of course, you also have a grasp of the more mundane aspects of Asgardian “magic.” Hyper-advanced technology, such as the Bifrost and the Soul Forge, are well within your capabilities to construct, so long as you have the resources. Will you guard these ancient secrets greedily, or will you share them with all who would learn?"
528,,600,Occult Sciences,Marvel Noir,Magitek,"There are forces that science has not named, or tamed. But that won’t stop you, nor does that mean there is not power in these forces. You will let others play their occult games, though, after all true power comes from combining the occult with the scientific. And you are dangerously skilled at that.

You understand how to incorporate occult objects into your technology, and how to use technology to interface with them. This isn’t a perfect science, and can be rather dangerous, but you could build machines which interface with magical objects; being powered by them, weaponizing their energies, or even forcing them to function in ways that they were never intended to be used such as forcing a spider totem which normally bestows spider powers on those the spider god finds worthy to bestow bee powers to someone you designate. Just be careful as this can have side effects; Madame Swarm was physically and visibly mutated to be half bee instead of merely obtaining the powers of bees when she tried it. And this will require you to do the legwork, to research the object, and scientific methods to interact with it; this isn’t instant understanding, but the power to force magical objects to interface with science in ways they otherwise would not."
529,,600,The Bone Machine,Marvel 2099,Magitek,"This is a room sized occultech machine into which skulls can be plugged into as input, with an output that generally goes into someone’s head. This can be used to communicate with the spirits of the attached skulls, or even use them as an external source of magical energy.

The machine comes with a collection of sorcerer skulls dating back up to 3000 years willing to give you advice and share their knowledge in exchange for you carrying on their work. By default their work was fighting evil sorcerers, but if you’d prefer another mission for them you can select one. You can add more skulls to this collection, though getting them to work with you is up to you."
530,,600,As Much Sorcerer as Scientist ,Heroes Reborn,Magitek,"You are an expert at blending science and magic. You know how to combine the two in the form of magitech, and to use this sorcerous technology to perform feats that many fools would call impossible. This will even allow you to combine forms of magic with technology which normally would not play nicely with technological advancement.

You will also find that understanding one makes it easier for you to understand and learn the other; the greater your knowledge of science the more easily you will find it is to learn sorcery and the greater your knowledge of sorcery the more easily you will learn scientific and engineering skills. Coupled with the mind of a super scientist and you could show the world its place at your feet. This does not give you any ability to use sorcery on its own, though, merely to create magitech and to learn magic more quickly and easily; if a setting’s magic can only be learned by those who fulfill certain prerequisites and you do not fulfill them, then this alone won’t let you learn it, though you would pick up the theory more quickly."
531,,600,THE SIN MACHINE,Helltaker,Magitek,"You have a magitech machine of enormous proportions. Just like the puzzles, in-jump this is just an actual location in Hell, but post-jump you can consciously make the decision to send anyone you tap to this place. If you have “Chains Of Sin 2: Electric Boogaloo” then you can activate the SIN MACHINE through them. Inside, there’s a constant onslaught of attacks somehow related to your perks. There’s four phases, each harder than the last; if the target manages to survive all four phases then you can’t bring them back in until a year later. The attacks are guaranteed to be the most deadly they can and your perks will work together to great effect. Bonus Points if you activate it while yelling IGNITE THE SIN MACHINE! SUFFERING MUST BE MADE!"
532,,600,Technovore,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Magitek,"Techies beware; you can absorb technology, mimicking its functionalities within your body to improve yourself. This process is slow, and can only be done with technology that is around the same size or smaller than your body; in addition, if a piece of technology has protections that prevent tampering with it you will need to find a way to work around them, and if it has non- technological components (including things like magitech and biological components) you will not be able to copy those aspects. You can choose how this technology “manifests”; for example, upon absorbing a laser pistol, you may shoot lasers from your hands, eyes, or mouth, or have your hand take on the appearance of the pistol; how it manifests is up to you, so long as it manifests as part of your body. Using abilities absorbed from technology tires you out equivalent to the power of the technology, and can cause you to be incapacitated for a while if you use too much power in one go."
533,,600,Solar Cannon,Ragna Crimson,Magitek,"A marvel of magitech and remotely controlled by a ring that you now own, this weapon allows you to call down artillery strikes that function by concentrating solar energy into one point to create a deadly laser. 

It’s highly stationary, but its power can even damage or even kill the Seija and it has a considerable range, at least a few dozen kilometers. It’s just that it’s pretty slow in its charging, so you better have some way to restrain those powerful enemies if you want to use it in a fight."
534,,600,A Relic of the Past ,Ragna Crimson,Magitek,"This world wasn’t always so ‘primitive’. Many years ago, during a time that only persists in the memories of the oldest beings, civilization flourished and science progressed to the point of making what nowadays would be considered magical wonders.

Whether you were present at that as one of those ancients, or that knowledge was passed onto you, the genius mind that you have been blessed with will surely be able to make great use of those technologies.

You are not only a master of all those ancient technologies, ranging from biotechnology to cybernetics and all fields of engineering, but you are adept at blending magic and science, allowing you to create even more impressive creations.

And with time you may even recreate the feats of magic through technological means, such as harnessing the space magic to create artificial pocket dimensions, or studying the time magic to create full time machines. Be warned that such a thing is likely to be a time consuming and expensive endeavor."
535,,600,Man of Progress,Arcane,Magitek,"For thousands of years, magic was thought to be the domain of the few privileged to be born with the talent, or willing to mortgage their souls to demons or celestial beings. Now, thanks to Jayce Talis, that power has been democratised - somewhat, at least. You share the same kind of innovative ability of Jayce and Viktor, able to make scientific leaps and bounds while others creep along at a steady pace behind you. Whatever fields of research you involve yourself in, you’ll find yourself making intuitive leaps, putting together disparate facts and seeing patterns where others only see noise. Besides your personal innovative abilities, you also have a knack for producing designs which can be adapted for mass production with relative ease and whose principles can be easily taught to others, so that you can uplift not only yourself, but those around you as well. Piltover is called the City of Progress, after all.

Your scientific prowess is at its height when you’re working based on some form of inspiration; perhaps trying to imitate some process seen in nature, or replicate spells and magic. Your inventions might not quite work the same as the original, but if you work long and hard enough, almost anything that can be done by natural or supernatural means can be measured, harnessed and controlled through the power of your scientific method."
536,,600,Extended Warranty ,Ben 10,Magitek,"Let’s get real for a second: You are a scientist, not a repair monkey. You shouldn’t have to teleport all the way from your home planet to fix something one of your assistants managed to break in the time you took your eyes off of them. As a result, your technology is now durable and long-lasting...you can go years without seeing a prototype of your creation before it actually needs you to fix it directly, even the most idiotic and primitive species being able to guesswork how to fix it even if they don’t know how it works. Also when I say durable, I mean the universe could collapse into nothingness and that device of yours would still be floating in the empty void that used to be said universe. Point being, technology you create is both insanely durable and is easily maintained. Now maybe you don’t have to handle everything yourself."
537,,600,Birthing Pod,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"This monstrous bio-metallic flower, when fed with well-preserved or preferably fresh corpses, will swallow and store them deep within its body as it gestates, turning the once uncorrupted body into a Phyrexian abomination, all around stronger and hardier, not losing their biological abilities-though the resulting beasts might not be able to use the more complex techniques or magic. However, it only seems to create mostly mindless, if loyal monsters, and you have almost no control over the final result. It is, however, a way to produce cheap and strong forces, perhaps enough to build an army, given sufficient time…"
538,,600,An Engine For A New Era ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Deep in the halls of Otawara lies a blasphemy most foul, something the Empire and Order would seek to utterly erase not only it but all who had helped build it. Possibly even those who had laid eyes upon it. In the hopes of creating a mech that possessed more power, acted faster, was easier to use, one scientist bound a Kami into the frame of his machines. You have come into the possession of this machine, or perhaps a prototype or second model of it. Though bound, the mech is very much alive thanks to the unknown Kami of water within it. It truly does act and react as fast as the pilot can think… when it’s in tune with its pilot at least, something that may be hard to accomplish for someone who merely thinks of it as a machine. Still, if you open your heart and mind to it, then you will find that there is no machine on this plane that can stand up to your combined might. In addition to this machine itself, you may choose to trade it in at the end of each jump, gaining an equally powerful and heretical machine to wield in battle or dissect at your leisure."
539,,600,More Real Than Reality,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Phyrexia’s ability to conquer other worlds has always been held in check by the sheer difficulty inherent to traveling through the Blind Eternities. Without a planeswalker of their own, and unable to Compleat one without damaging their Spark somehow, their options have been limited. A Spark is not something you can touch, something you can modify. It is more of an idea. But what if there was a world where ideas could be touched, where beings made concepts and thoughts walked among us? And that is why the Phyexians have come to Kamigawa. And lucky you, having managed to get your hands on Jin-Gitaxias’s personal notes on the strange and unusual relationship this plane has between the spiritual and the physical. And, perhaps more importantly, the device Jin and Tezzeret created to allow them to interact with the Spark. Everything you would need to Compleat a Planeswalker, all in one neat little package. Isn’t it wonderful?"
540,,600,Architecting And Animating Reality ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"The greatest flaw in any machine, any artifact, any vehicle, is the user. If they don’t know how to use it, if they can’t power it, if they simply can’t react fast enough - or, arguably worse, if they’re faster and it can’t react fast enough. This is a focus of study that has consumed scientists for generations, and luckily enough, I think they’ve had a breakthrough. For that matter, so have you. You’ve learned how to incorporate science into your magic and magic into your science, using one to smooth out the flaws of the other. This provides you with a level of insight into supposedly impossible tasks and allows you to turn them into something that’s merely absurdly difficult. A compatriot of yours uses this same philosophy to turn the mechs he produces into something he can interact with telepathically, trying to push the mech’s reactions up to as fast as their pilots can think - though, his real claim to fame these days is being able to personally field a small army of them by himself. Given a few weeks of study, perhaps a day or two with a sample of his work, I'm sure you could copy that method for yourself, perhaps even make a few improvements on it. Be wary however - the golden goose of this train of thought would be to work a Kami into your art, and that is something the Empire would never allow."
541,,600,Skyship Jumperlight ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Magitek,"But perhaps instead of new methods to travel between the planes, you maybe wish instead to go old school. The Jumperlight is your own personal version of the Skyship Weatherlight! It is basically a magical skyship 300 feet in length with a crew of forty men, though it could easily fit one hundred people. It has three decks, plenty of cargo room. It can fly at 110 mph when moving forward, 40 mph in reverse and has a forcefield and an engine powered by mana. It has a skeleton of Thran Metal and a Powerstone for a core. The best part of all if it wasn’t obvious, is that unlike the Planar Bridge this can carry living beings. Or rather it could before the Mending ruined its capability to Planar Travel, but this version doesn’t have that problem. This artifact is limited to the local multiverse until you ignite your Jumper Spark. It retains all modifications."
542,,600,Planar Bridge,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Magitek,"An immensely powerful artifact created purely by accident. This is the first artifact created since the mending that can be used to travel between the Planes. It also can transport much more than even the fantastic devices before the mending. Put simply, it can create a massive portal to another plane that could let through four giants at once and columns of men for as long as it is open. However, there is a catch, this wondrous gateway can only transfer nonliving, inorganic matter which is a true shame. If one could figure out a way to bring an army through this gate then they would have an enormous beachhead on another plane from which to resupply and reinforce. This artifact is limited to the local multiverse until you ignite your Jumper Spark. It retains all modifications."
543,,600,Scholar ,Warbreaker,Magitek,"You may not be one of the Five Scholars, but you’ve certainly taken inspiration from their example. You know that absolutely everything, even mysteries of Adonalsium, eventually yields to scientific inquiry, and you are very, very good at science. You can figure out the underlying mechanics of everything from magic to totally unknown technology, and in record time. You never chase blind alleys, and always find some practical use for your insights."
544,,600,The Accelerator ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Magitek,"This is a machine created by Dr. Rote which can boost the power of other mages to incredible new heights. The Accelerator draws its power from the Source of all magic. In the hands of ordinary mages, it could power them up to the level where they could destroy dozens of their fellows with ease, but in the hands of someone like Darquesse, the result is unthinkable. You now possess your own copy of this machine, located in your Warehouse or in a property you own. Before you get too excited, the boost the Accelerator provides is only temporary; after a while, that boost will start to slowly fade away, gradually returning the mage to their normal power level. Ordinarily, the Accelerator becomes a time bomb after being turned on, continuing to draw on magic until it explodes. The resulting explosion would deliver magic to every living being on the planet, including Mortals. Your version of the Accelerator will not explode, unless you want it to for some reason. Furthermore, unlike the original, yours will not require a willingly donated soul to be deactivated. If you decide to blow up your Accelerator, you will receive a new one at the start of the next Jump."
545,,600,Dungeon Master,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Magitek,"During his adventures into the Dungeons, Lord Barbarossa came across many strange and horrifying monster with power far in excess of any creature in this world outside of the furthest reaches of the Dark Continent. Instead of recoiling in fear like most men, though, he saw an opportunity – by combining man and monster, he could create superhuman soldiers the likes of which the world had never seen. And through the aid of the shadowy cabal of Magicians known as Al-Thamen, he made his ideas reality.

Somehow, you have gained an exceptional understanding of this perverse science, allowing you to, with the right specimens and enough time, combine ordinary humans with supernatural beasts to create powerful hybrid monsters. You have enough skill to fine-tune the results, too, creating anything from mindless yet loyal soldiers with only the slightest semblance of their former humanity to people that are almost indistinguishable from their former selves yet possess incredible powers. Here, humans modified in this way gained powers ranging from incredible regeneration to blinding speed to gills and other aquatic adaptations, though what abilities can be awakened from fusing men with the monsters of other settings is for you to discover."
546,,600,Cauldron,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Magitek,"A fun little story for you. In the future, the cities of the world will all be built on top of Cauldrons. The Magic City Ishana is built on one. Every base of the Void Bureau is or will be built on one. People just can’t seem to get enough of them. Well, I suppose they are useful. What exactly is a Cauldron? Well, it’s a portal into the Boundary. It leaks small amounts of magic, so you can use them as a power source. It’s also useful - but not required, under the right circumstances - to Smelt something, such as Nine’s Arch Enemy Event Weapons. If you’re really clever or really lucky, it can also be used to travel through time. Though, a warning. The Boundary is NOT welcoming to most life forms. Using it as a method of travel is just asking to have your soul torn apart. ...Well, moving on. Much like the Void Bureau and the cities of the future, you now have a Cauldron. Specifically, one under every major property you own. Please mad science responsibly."
547,,600,Susanoo Unit,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Magitek,"The Susanoo Unit is the ‘sword’ that defends the Amaterasu Unit. That said, that information won’t be relevant for almost 90 years. More to the point, the Susanoo is technically a robot, and a quite powerful one. As of right now, it is without a pilot - a soul. Normally you’d have to sacrifice your body to get inside, but I’ve modified it to eat both and spit them back out when you’re done. The body has what amounts to near limitless amount of stamina, and enough physical power to stand on par with a Beastman. However, it’s true power is the ability to cut time. Ending any form of time manipulation, or even decreasing an opponent's lifespan with every swing - or cutting it away all at once to kill even an immortal being. Lastly, and once again time related, the Susanoo can cut through time to reach alternate timelines. Oh, and it’s completely immune to any form of paradox, as it can simply cut those to ribbons."
548,,600,Hack the World,Fate/Extella,Magitek,"The right position and enough time taught you far more than the Moon Cell may have intended for you to gain access to. The Moon Cell is nothing more than a hyper-complex computer system when you get to the very basics, a system you’ve become able to manipulate. A form of wizardry far and away beyond modern magus code casts, you’ve learned to hack into the reality around you. While large scale operations are time consuming, and difficult in a time when the Moon Cell isn’t being distracted from correcting your changes, you are very skilled in altering reality on the local scale. Replicating most magical effects is easy, even high level spells such as dimensional shields that can protect against anything short of a powerful Phantasm release. Changing how the laws of physics are working, directly upgrading or altering a Servant’s spiritual core and more. It only takes a bit of time to apply your newfound abilities to the reality outside of the Moon Cell. A benefit to how faithful the Moon Cell is to reality."
549,,600,Monolith,Fate/Extella,Magitek,"An alien relic, of unknown origin and purpose, though the benefits it grants you become clear quite quickly. The tall pillar, covered in strange sigils, is able to generate vast amounts of energy when needed, of almost any kind. Both magical and more technological sorts. Enough that if you had a way to channel it, you could cast spells across whole cities or even multiple at once. The pillar acts as a clear line of connection to any alien being that you know the rough identity of, connecting you directly to their closest means of communication when you lay hands on the monolith and wish it. It is also possible, with extensive study and interaction towards the relic, to use it to unlock astounding new knowledge or abilities in yourself. It takes time and rarely will this happen more than once or twice, but the databases of alien worlds or the ability to override the spiritual cores of other beings are examples of what could be gained. In future worlds, a new monolith will be present, based on an alien race that does or could exist in that new world."
550,,600,Murder Doll,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Magitek,"The unification of black magic and advanced technology makes it possible to create homunculi of
truly superb quality. You are the result of the same process that created the Katou Danzou puppet, fully freed of any creator and able to enjoy this immortal frame. Your body becomes that of a
techno-magical puppet, allowing you to translate any powers you have into a technological form
within your body now and in the future if desired. It only fits, as your body is already equipped with
a variety of impressive devices. Hidden blades of varying kinds, magically imbued wooden missile
launchers, ranged attacks from kunai to crossbows, even technology and mystic codes that can
create powerful vacuums or deliver dangerous curses. At the core, your physical body is also greatly
enhanced in parameters. While your senses and mind remain the same, you are strong enough to
contend with relatively powerful Oni and fast enough that even legendary swordsmen like Musashi
Miyamoto can struggle to keep pace with you. 

This is all supported by great skill with Genjutsu, the arts of illusion. Rather than actual magecraft, these are varieties of mundane techniques and skill at misdirection that let you disguise things as not
what they really are. The primary use of this is hiding the magi-tech devices and abilities you have as
mundane effects or concealing their presence at all. A magus will struggle to recognise the true
source of your vacuum attack that allows for ranged annihilation of foes, seeing it as just ‘erasing the
enemy form’ and becoming confused as to the true mechanism. Hiding the exact nature, functions
and mechanisms of your abilities becomes simple with these skills.
 
While you do not know how to create more of your kind, you are able to relatively easily repair your
body should it become damaged, even with fairly common materials. It appears your form has
several functions that aid this, instead of requiring your creators be present."
551,,600,Living Lightning,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Magitek ,"Maybe the position of Doctor isn’t the one you’re after. Were you a prototype of Frankenstein’s
design, miraculously gaining life despite being considered a failure? The results of another scientist
or magus of the age? No matter your source, your design is similar to Frankenstein’s own creation, albeit the methods and make may differ. An artificial lifeform, likely made of electrically re-animated
flesh, who has the immortal constitution only the non-living can possess. Your body is physically
strong enough to easily shatter solid stone or metal, fast enough to outrace most vehicles without
strain and tough enough to withstand your own blows. Enhanced by the ‘undead’ nature, your body
is largely unharmed even when damaged. Being cut in half only requires you to sew yourself
together again, the only organs of importance are your heart or core and your brain, which you rely
on to survive barring influence of other abilities. Most environments, poisons and chemicals lose
their effectiveness against such a body.

While clearly a very capable warrior, the science or magic that created you endowed much more
interesting abilities. A particular association with energy and electricity is present in you, taking form
as the Galvanism ability. You are able to absorb electricity on touch and convert magical energy
without material form, such as magical wind or fire or energy attacks, into more energy for
absorption. This energy can be used to replenish any biological needs, reinforce your physical body, significantly increasing all physical abilities, or rapidly regenerate any damaged portion of your form.
It can also be returned, unleashed powerful electrical blasts that can tear apart large stone golems in
a single blast. Unleashing this energy in overly large amounts can be dangerous however, potentially
burning out your core if you go too far beyond what your body can handle. Galvanism is not
unlimited and enormous amounts of energy might risk burning yourself out to absorb, while your
body can only be reinforced so far.

The electricity that hums in your core, animating your body, also contains your will with this ability
taken. So long as your will holds strong and this powerful spark within is not extinguished, you can survive even total bodily destruction. The potential to travel to a new body or even a machine and
live on exists, though those without intense willpower will unlikely be able to takeover their new
host."
552,,600,Wardenclyffe Warmachine,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Magitek,"The culmination of Tesla’s life work, which would never have appeared in normal history. Yet here it stands, the Wardenclyffe Warmachine. A tool of science, progress and war. A large building is the form it takes, a mostly blocky and sturdy construction that serves as the base and generator for the large tower that sits atop the building. This tower has two purposes, each terrifying in their scale. It is capable of projecting electricity through the air over a great enough distance that were it placed on one coast of America, it could reach the other coast easily. This projected energy allows machines to be powered without plug or power source, as the energy is directed directly into the machine, and the amount of energy is so much that even an entire modern day city could be powered at once solely through Wardenclyffe’s output. The facility also has tools to turn this transmitted electricity into information. Less useful in this time but with more stations or in an era with some sort of information network across the world, startlingly powerful. 

But what will make every cower in fear is not the power this station can generate. It is the weapon that exists in this tower. A true Death Ray of sorts, called Teleforce, is what he made and while the exact mechanics are as yet a mystery that must be unlocked, the results cannot be missed. Instantaneous destruction of anything within 200 miles. An energy attack that can be made so fine and accurate as to slice the eyelashes off a man or so powerful as to reduce a city to ash or turn half a mountain into molten slag in seconds. The Teleforce draws heavily on Wardenclyffe’s generators to function and will inhibit power projection elsewhere while firing but the station appears to rapidly generate power without any apparent source. There are notes in the building, apparently left by Tesla himself, that detail a force known as the ionosphere but they are incomplete and appear to delve far more into the occult then was thought of the man. So much power and yet even more potential awaits the canny mind that finds this place. 

You may import a property into this."
553,,600,White Science ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Magitek,"Any sufficiently studied magic becomes an art as science. Your studies into the occult have allowed you to harness the powers of Hope and Despair. For one, you are able to create a Mage’s Belt, a weakened WizardDriver that is capable of channeling a person’s inner Mana through Wizard Rings to allow them to transform into a Kamen Rider Mage, as well as create the WizarSwordGun able to channel the power of the Wizard Rings through them for powerful attacks. These would both be fine, but you are able to utilize a few more pieces of forbidden science...including the creation of Artificial Phantoms. These Phantoms aren’t as powerful as a ‘natural’ phantom(only twice as troublesome as a Ghoul) but with sufficient ‘stored’ despair and the proper rituals on hand you will be able to make them, both a useful source of Mana and an excellent minion. As a gift, you may take a Mage Wizard Ring, a Driver On Wizard Ring, and a Connect wizard ring to use with one of these Drivers although you’ll need to provide your own Mana to activate them.

554,,600,Hologram Summer ,Tsukihime,Magitek,"All of these familiar places, familiar faces...ah, sorry, I was a little nostalgic. This is a space hidden away in either your Warehouse or a Property that you own. This room stores records of any person you’ve encountered, any experience you’ve had, and any battle you’ve fought. Everything down to the last cell of the moments you’ve had on this chain can be recreated in this room, as a sort of artificial ‘what-if’ machine...or a holodeck, if you’re a nerd. Whatever is in here cannot be taken out, as it is just a record of what was - still, if you have a particular battle or moment of your life you’d like to re-experience, you may do so, and even adjust the parameters to change the experience in a certain way to see how different choices might have played out."
555,,600,Mad Science Jumper,Tsukihime,Magitek,"...wait, what? Huh?! How does any of this have to do with being a maid?! I guess the robots could look like them or something, but...anyways, against all logic, you are an engineering genius who could put certain inventors to shame, able to construct fighting androids with comically effective artificial intelligence that will be completely loyal to you unless mistreated. These robots, with enough time and resources invested in them, could individually lay low Dead Apostles or other creatures with some effort, and are able to hold the armory of a small tank in a humanoid body, or otherwise putting a large amount of weaponry compared to the size of the robot within its arsenal. Given enough time and privacy to work, you could even make a self-sustaining factory that churns out an army of these robotic avengers...you ARE doing this for maid work, right?"
556,,600,Mind of God ,Tsukihime,Magitek,"The primary interest of Atlas is information and the manipulation thereof. This goes beyond simple precognition of day-to-day events or giving yourself an edge in combat - it is the manipulation of the progress of humankind as a whole,and prevention (or creation) of their extinction. A single human body cannot handle such information by itself - so instead, you made tools capable of accessing and storing the collective knowledge of humanity. You are capable of constructing devices that could create or manipulate pseudo-Spiritions, or virtual projections of the soul, and transmit that into a virtual space of your own designs as well. These devices are equal in magnitude and processing speed to a highly advanced Quantum Computer, and let you store or project a human consciousness,soul and all, into these spaces. With time and resources, you could recreate almost the entirety of planet Earth and the records of all its history, and store the whole of mankind within it...though doing such a strenuous, time-consuming process would take a lifetime by yourself.Recreating something such as a certain Moon-based digital space with this alone is a daunting,perhaps impossible prospect.

However, the ability to create such highly-advanced devices has come with a neat additional perk - namely, with the information it can calculate, it is possible to ‘observe’ the entirety of aworld’s history and several probable futures, along with the conditions needed to make those futures happen or even prevent them entirely. It could even provide instructions or probabilities of success with new advances or superweapons not yet within the world on aiding these potential futures, creating Mystic Codes or wonders few could even dream of beforehand. With resources and time, perhaps you could make a device that can make those probabilities real by command alone, though that requires energy and conditions that a lone human being can’t generate.  Finally, everything is here - the records of humanity can be preserved and made whole.

Given Enough time tinkering with this repository of knowledge you could replicate the technological feats that the Moon Kingdom used such as terraforming inhospitable planets, faster than light technology, create items power by emotional energy, and even scan a person's mind to create an AI that can guide the actions of those who use your technology. Some would say this technology is indistinguishable from magic, however you’ll find that magical things were also created during the Silver Millennium and you have access to that information as well. The creation of magical weaponry, the magical methods of creating something like the Sailor Cannon, and more are evidenced within this database beside the technological marvels. Whilst you can’t create something on the level of the Silver Crystal of Queen Serenity you do have access to the massive bulk of information that could help in the rebirth of a New Silver Millennium.

558,,600,The Books of Magic,Justice League Dark,Magitek,"Long rumored to be artifacts of immense power and quote possibly the source of magic itself. These legendary artifacts have been coveted for millenia by everyone from two-bit sorcerers yearning for more power to the greatest mages of all time, such as Merlin himself. Split into four volumes – Order, Chaos, Life, and Death – it is said that possessing these books would give the wielder near absolute power over those concepts and over magic itself.

However, contrary to their name and the rumors long spread about them, the Books of Magic are actually more science than magic. Forged long by a powerful mage known as the Hunter, he researched methods of fusing magic and technology in an attempt to escape the persecution of his people. The Books, in addition to serving as a gateway to Epoch, the Hunter's home world, also contain all of his research.

Armed with this knowledge, you would be able to become the world's foremost expert on fusing magic and technology.

560,,600,Praesi Engineering ​,A Practical Guide to Evil,Magitek,"If there is one thing that every Praesi Emperor has in common, it’s the ability to take insane and ridiculous ideas and turn them into reality. Flying cathedrals that rain death upon their foes? Sentient tigers? Man eating tapirs? Giant cliffs to throw the hero down? WHY THE HELL NOT! You are capable of taking even the stupid and most insane engineering designs and throwing large amounts of magic at them until they work. Sure, this might require sacrificing a few towns worth of peasants, but that’s the sort of thing that peasants are for.

Heavier and more durable than most modern cars but with all their speed ­ and then some. Its windshield is enchanted to remain perpetually clear and grant nightvision to the passengers, as well as act as a two­-way video call to whomever you are magically connected to. Its traction is good enough that it could be taken out snowmobiling on a frozen lake. Its anti-theft mechanisms are legion ­ ensuring it will never be taken without your say so. With its ability to transform into a boat, submarine, motorcycle and flying saucer, the oil slick, hidden machine guns and caltrops all just seem a little overkill.

563,,600,Magitech wizard ,Dog Days,Magitek,"You are able to easily combine magic and technology, letting you make things like radio antennae and signal boosters that rely on magic. Maybe you could replace ammunition with bolts of magic. With this you can replicate the effects of technology with magic, and it will likely be less complex too. This isn’t a one way process however, you may also replicate the effects of magic with technology. This will be much more complex than the alternative however.

You have a complete knowledge of how to build and maintain Devices, along with how to program AI for said Devices to use. While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn’t included here - you’ll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of ‘Similar Principles’ to streamline the process...it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough.

Whether or not you aspire to be a ruler yourself, you will find that there are ways to preserve your best traits, particularly within your own body or those of your descendants. You have learned the art of infusing mana into DNA, letting you create hereditary and unique magical abilities that are passed down from generation to generation, or specific individuals if you can’t be bothered to wait that long. Traits like a specific hair color, eye color, or body type is child’s play to you - and while complicated or powerful abilities may not always descend down the family tree, you could preserve the appearance and base talents of your bloodline for millennia to come. An affinity for a particular element, a talent for a set of skills, or even a unique magical ability tied specifically to the DNA of the user are valid examples for this. Whether you merely wish to experiment with magical DNA or begin a great dynasty, you will find that with the right motivation, your legacy could last forever.

You can repair and install new functions into Symphogears, that manipulate existing features, like forcing a berserk state or tuning it to raise synchronization coefficients. What's more, your glimpses into Sakurai theory indicate some possibilities of inducing Human-Relic fusion, but to complete the theory you'll need an existing test subject...

568,,600,The Inspiration of Madness ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Insanity is not something maligned amidst skaven society, as it is amidst the man-thing villages. Skryre’s Warlock-Engineers are, one and all to a member, the most addle-brained and unstable of the rat-men to date - yet it was their madness that led to the creation of so many technological marvels. The warp-lightning rails that connect the great under-cities, such as Under-Altdorf and Hell Pit. The Doomwheels. The Skitter-Gates. Ratling mini-guns and poison wind and augmentation chemicals and all the myriad of spells that make the Warlock-Engineers a minor apocalypse upon the field. All born from diseased minds.

You count yourself as “inspired” as these demented predecessors of yours - a madness coming over your brain-meats. While this madness may be debilitating in any day-to-day interaction, it shines when you set to work. The magics you use and the technologies you set to experiment with and create will seem to branch, weave, intersect, and spark in ways that would never occur to a healthier mind. In short, through your mad eyes and addled brain, you can create and discover new spells, machinery, scientific theories, and interactions between the three that would never occur naturally even through rigorous years of study and experimentation. Creations that mock the very idea of common sense and decency, and violate every sense and sensibility.

You may now use the information you have acquired through normal scientific study to magecraft. This in turn makes your spells more powerful as their effects become stronger and produce more tangible results. For example, a strong understanding of physics may better allow you to increase the strength of matter or force spells. Knowledge of biology could increase the ease with which you use life spells or alter the cognitions and impulses of organisms through mind spells. The stronger your base knowledge in a scientific discipline, the more powerful and effective your spells will become.

You have unlocked knowledge of the greatest force multiplier the Sheikah were ever able to field - Large, walking, warmachines. You have a basic knowledge of the Sheikah’s art of automation and robotics, with this alone giving you the knowledge to craft the small Guardians utilized by Shrines in combat tests, with the right materials. However, with enough resources and development time...you could create constructs that could even rival the 4 great Divine Beasts. This is the pure expression of Power...just remember that Power must be tempered with Wisdom, and wielded with Courage. Power without restraint is the domain of Calamity Ganon, after all.

It can’t be subverted by Ganon like many of the others...because it’s hollow. You can utilize this Hollow Guardian as a vehicle, controlling it from within its hardy shell. Not only does it have all the power of its brothers, however, it can shift between “turret” mode by embedding itself into the ground, “walker mode” that is much like the ordinary Guardians in the wild, and “flying” guardians like the sentries that float around Ganon’s most important places of influence.

A “Power” type Divine Beast is the size of a Manor House, shaped like a mundane creature you decide and can move similarly to that creature in locomotion, having much the same processes and powers as its larger Divine Beast cousins-even the beam of destroying light! A “Speed” type Divine Beast is in many respects the sister to Master Cycle Zero, being an extremely fast, powerful and capable “steed” that can be fueled on any form of materials fed into its engine.

573,,600,Ancient Technology,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Magitek,"But, skill at design aside, you do actually need to know how this stuff works do you not? It’s not as though there’s anybody left in this day and age to do the building for you. Or perhaps it might be better to say that all the ancient technology, the robots of Lanayru and the mining facility, need a source. You. Or whoever taught you this stuff, because it’s been fading away for the last two thousand years. Anyways, you have the scientific skills to create the Ancient Robots, all the way from the lowly mining robots to the mighty Koloktos. And of course, to work with the Timeshift stones that power them. Time, as a solid object, makes for a great building material. Unless a certain stimulus is triggered, something built out of them would literally last forever. It’s really quite useful when designing dungeons meant to last a thousand years or more.

SOULs are fragile things, particularly monster SOULs, but you know how to work with them. Making a robot with a SOUL is a good example of what you're capable of. You're also knowledgeable about the element of the human soul dubbed DETERMINATION, and can extract it from human SOULs and inject it into other things using a machine that you know how to make. Just... Be careful. Nobody wants to see anyone melt."
575,,600,Technological Upgrade ,World Seed,Magitek,"Spaceship captains, rulers of both kingdoms and planets alike, and people similarly reigning over the masses or in possession of a vast amount of land have access to a special kind of system in Neolife. A sort of management menu, it allows people to upgrade their territories in two kinds of ways: the first is a technology upgrade, which a ruler could use to add irrigation to a field, or to increase the defence of a city. If there is a design provided, it will be instantly built once the upgrade finishes in around a week.

The second is a production speed upgrade. For example, after setting an order to increase agriculture, a burst of mana would sink into the ground and the growth of nearby fields and trees would instantly hasten, fruits and vegetables being grown overnight, and continuing to do so for several days. The mana to power both kinds of upgrades is drawn from both the people and the environment in the land affected by the upgrade, with the time needed for the upgrade increasing the more difficult and complex the upgrade is, due to it needing more mana. In your case, even if you might not be ruling over an area, your affinity with technology has granted you a similar ability.

You may spend mana to add new functions to technological devices and machinery, or improve already existing functions. The more complex or expansive the change is, and the larger o advanced the target object is, the more mana is required. Like with the management menu, you can also affect things that haven’t incorporated any technology in their function yet, such as the aforementioned irrigation added to a field.

This could be used to turn a mage staff entirely made out of natural material into magitech, or into a technological equivalent. Similarly, you may affect extremely large areas like cities or even planets after you become powerful enough, and may also order for the required mana to be drawn from the environment or any living beings in it. Beyond that, you also have a knack for upgrading things the old fashioned way with your own two hands."
576,,600,Magitech Master ,World Seed,Magitek,"If you looked at Neolife’s technology for only a bit, you’d be surprised to see that it is not technology at all. Well, not pure technology at least. Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you’ve taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset.

First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it’s something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it. The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you’d be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection.

But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there’s no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create."
577,,700,Demon Armor: Incursio,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"After the Empire’s forces finally managed to
hunt the Tyrant, its still living flesh was used to forge one of the most notable Teigu,
Incursio. In the same way as its advanced version, this armor-type Teigu usually
takes the form of a short sword with a chain link tassel that works as its key while in
its sealed form, but, by stabbing the key into the ground will release it from its
container, making the user to be enveloped in full-body armor.
When activated, the armor greatly increases the user’s physical attributes, such as
speed, strength, and agility to a degree slightly inferior to Grand Chariot’s physical
abilities, as well as, due to being a body armor, Incursio has a near-indestructible
defense with the only thing able to pierce it being other Teigu or something of
equivalent. Additionally, the users of Incursio are also eventually able to summon
and wield the Teigu’s auxiliary equipment, a long spear or halberd-like weapon called
Neuntote, which is capable of cutting through Danger Beasts with ease.
Furthermore, the armor's unnamed trump card is its ability to turn the user invisible
for a certain amount of time, depending on the skill of the user. This ability was
inherited from the Tyrant, which developed it to elude the First Emperor’s forces, but,
this trump card’s weakness is that, while it can mask the user visually from the naked
eye, it doesn't hide their presence, so skilled opponents can sense the user despite
them being invisible.
Despite all this, due to Tyrant's power being so great that its flesh is still alive within
it, the main feature that Incursio possesses is the ability to grow, adapt and evolve in
response to threats and to the user’s emotions, allowing it to grow stronger and to
even develop new abilities. This adaptation is usually slow, but Incursio can be
forced to evolve through the user’s strong emotions or through extreme conditions.
However, there is a risk as, once Incursio evolves too much, it may attempt to fuse
with the user in order to possess them and make them a vessel for the Tyrant’s
rebirth, making the Teigu a threat for its own user if it grows too powerful."
578,,700,Magitek Engineer ,Drakengard and Nier,Magitek,"You know, for a supposedly medieval society, the Empire has some pretty advanced toys, huh. And now, so do you. Or at least, you will once you build them. You now know how to build the magitek machines used by the Empire. Provided you have the materials and the time, you can build anything from man-portable weapons to battleships. Or airships even. You can’t reach anything past a generally World War One level of technology, but thanks to the magic side of things, they'll generally outperform their real world equivalents. Magic cannon beats normal cannon, that’s all I’m saying.

It is around 50 meters long and 10 meters wide with a cargo capacity of 17 tons. It has protection
against all elements of both space and void and has an infinite air supply with its own gravity.
Normally it is manned by 10 to 15 illithids but that is not the case for you. You can issue
commands to it telepathically and it is more than capable of defending and piloting itself. Oh,
it is semi-sentient alright, being more of a living being than a ship.
Its shell-like carapace is impervious to all but the mightiest attacks. It even boasts a
strong magical resistance. If the hull armor wasn’t enough already, this thing can put up psychic
shields to defend itself against all external attacks, and boy it can take a lot of punishment before
needing to recharge for a brief moment. It can also psychically cloak itself to avoid any sensors
and detection attempts, when not in active combat.
You have multiple offensive options. Four great tentacles that extend dozens of meters
are attached to the ship’s hull. They can be used for teleporting living beings (no large than an
auroch) they touch into stasis chambers of the ship and immediately incapacitate them.
Tentacles themselves are also devastating bludgeoning weapons that can knock down large
towers. A dozen heavyweight psychic cannons decorate the deck and are capable of raining
magical devastation that can knock out adult dragons from the sky.
Inside of the ship is filled with illithid bio-tech. You have stasis pods, bio-computers,
incubation chambers for tadpoles (currently empty), a brine pool for an elder brain (also empty),
ceremorphosis accelerators, mind domination and thrall making devices, operation units for
intellect devourer creation, restoration apparatus and relief chambers. The ship also has a
transponder within the helm that can be used for planar travel within your local multiverse.
Post-jump this encompasses all of creation.
The ship repairs itself over time and is self-maintaining. It doesn’t need any fuel to
move, and it can continue voyaging endlessly. If destroyed completely, it appears back in your
care in the next jump you go to.
When you don’t need it, the ship docks itself within a harmless pocket plane. You can
mentally summon the ship to the sky with a gigantic portal created by the transponder."
580,,800,Imperial Guardian: Shikoutazer,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"Finally, the greatest crown jewel of the
Empire and a weapon worthy of being classified as the Supreme Teigu. Meant to be
used by the royal family of the Empire as a last line of defense if the Capital was
ever to be placed under imminent threat and destabilized, this “armor”-type Teigu is
actually a massive, five hundred meter tall mecha, being the very first Teigu to be
built by the First Emperor and passed throughout generations to the each Emperor.
The mecha is heavily armored, protecting its user from nearly any attack directed
towards them, with even multiple hits from both Grand Chariot and Incursio not even
leaving a scratch on its armor, as well as being able to deliver devastating blows
despite having a very limited mobility due to its massive size.
To complete the Teigu’s arsenal, in addition to its physical strength, it’s able to fire a
massive ray of energy from its chest-plate, discharge mortars from its shoulder pads,
launch explosive cores from a mouthpiece and multiple homing missiles from
cannons across its back and lower torso. It can also project an energy barrier from a
distance in order to protect its user once activated, as well as having the ability to
gather energy and expel a large amount of shock waves throughout various parts of
its body, however, this places a huge amount of strain on the user, eventually
weakening its main defense, primarily in its abdominal region, being arguably one of
its main design flaws.

The Teigu's core looks like an interactive cockpit which is controlled through the
motions and actions of the host inside. It sports its own HUD system to ascertain its
surroundings as well as the opposition's offensive power and numbers. To make
things better, the information of how to control, drive and steer the Teigu will flow
directly into the user's mind the moment it first touches its controls.
Originally, to prevent it from being used by the Empire's enemies, Shikoutazer is
designed so that it could only be wielded by those of the royal bloodline, but your
replica won’t have this feature and can be piloted by anyone.
However, despite Shikoutazer’s terrifying power as the origin and pinnacle of all
Teigu, it initially didn’t had a trump card, but, eventually, Dorothea will enhance the
original mecha, granting it a new trump card, Purge Mode, which transforms it into
the perfect synthesis of alchemy and Teigu.
When this mode is activated, Shikoutazer will shed its armor to reveal monstrous
flesh, essentially turning it into a true monstrosity that combines alchemic beasts with
the mecha, while the user will be corrupted by alchemic Danger Beasts and become
violently insane or at least more violent if their will is strong enough to resist. In
addition to correcting a few of its design flaws, the Teigu's abilities will be improved
dramatically, granting it several new abilities such as control over alchemical energy
by concentrating it around its chest cavity to create and fire a dark singularity bomb,
production of small clumps from its mouth which will then unfurl into a horde of small,
wasp-like Danger Beasts and the ability to project a retractable, organic steel blade
from its hands capable of reaching up to incredible lengths. Other abilities it will also
gain includes augmented toughness and resilience and a final armament which is
the ability to fire multiple wave motion blasts from the various eyes on its body armor.
Your replica of the Shuikoutazer will already have these alchemical modifications and
will be initially stored in a new attachment of any property you have. Enjoy the power
of this world’s ultimate weapon, capable of reducing cities and armies to ashes with
ease, being only matched by Esdeath and the reborn Tyrant themselves."
581,,800,Hellbat,DC Comics,Magitek,"You must’ve had some seriously impressive friends to get this power armor, for both it’s
capabilities and costs are literally godlike. Forged in the sun with astounding strength, reinforced
with the power of electromagnetically augmented will, energized in the Speed Force, upgraded
with cutting edge technology, smelted again in the forges of the gods and done...something to
in the crushing pressure of the ocean floor involving an octopus and some undersea thermal
vents, the result is a shifting composition of nanomachines that can shed and readorn itself on
your person on command vis voice-activated AI. From built-in cloaking features to flight-capable
wings and shapeshifting fast enough to react and adapt in combat, the sheer strength and
energy blasts the armour provides is powerful enough to crush entire armies of the New Gods’
emanations in battle-though it would take some extremely unique circumstances and the
redirection of far greater sources of energy than the armour provides to even briefly knock down
the greatest of them.
It comes at a dire cost. The sheer might, the raw power the armour provides is fueled by the
vitality of its wearer. A human in peak condition might invade one of the weaker emanations of
Apokolips and return, yes, but wracked in agony and with a very real risk of dying. Though who
can say how long a demigod or Kryptonian could hold out..."
582,,800,Celestial Masterpiece,Godbound,Magitek,"Empires fall, mountains crumble, stars are snuffed out and yet the Celestial Engines turn ever-onward. You know this better than most, because by some caprice of the One’s designs you have somehow become metaphysically merged with a Celestial Engine-it’s divine mechanisms transmuted into principles and concepts manifested from your words, flesh and deeds. Sometimes briefly manifesting as a halo of starlight gears or contrails of radiant mechanisms when your divine power flares.

With significant divine effort, these semi-solid emanations of your Word can be manifested into tangible constructs-though this is greatly dependent on your existing might. A mortal would be lucky to conjure a single gear-shield, while a Godbound could boast unerringly accurate throwing disks or augment their normal weapons and armour with celestial gadgets-and a parasite god could even conjure localised environmental hazards, or a hovering wall of orbital shields that unerringly deflect incoming attacks. With greater divine power and experience with these facets of your being, comes even grander and more miraculous expressions of your mechanistic shadow-self. Perhaps in time, you’ll grind mountain ranges to fine power with your gears or sear the seas with the combustion engine in your soul.

You are bound to a Word more intrinsically than even a Godbound in many ways, developing miracles, Gifts, theurgic invocations and even a True Strife from it as instinctively as an animal hones it’s instincts-and having reflexive awareness and understanding of everywhere it touches. But your true power lies in the celestial mechanisms you can deploy. By reinforcing and fine-tuning the turning of the gears you may strengthen and reinforce reality, sealing Night Roads or quelling the efforts of enemy Godbound even more than the Cold Breath of the Uncreated. By improving your own divine power and wellbeing, you better the concept incorporated in your very being and destine it for greater things in the world. A Made God repairing itself could make Wind blow so powerfully it sheers mountaintops flat, form constant vortexes leading to the bottom of the sea and even form underground storms-yet craft exquisite palaces out of clouds that catch precious treasures from Heaven for example. It may even be possible for you to figure out how to repurpose your systems to generate Celestial Shards repeatedly, though the modifications you would require are far more complex and less straightforward than those needed for Chosen By The One to achieve mass production.

Your mechanisms affect the world on a level more fundamental than mere Gifts; not only can you attempt to block normally unblockable or instant death-inducing divine wrath with ablative shields of yourself but the energy released from your valves pierces through the normally invincible defences of relevant Words and nearly all other defences. And should you catch another between the invincible teeth of your gears, you may attempt to shear their divine powers from them-stealing miracles, Gifts and with enough mighty and cruelty perhaps entire Words from your merciless grip. With experimentation and attempts to channel your nature through True Strifes, existing Gifts theurgy, Word-based self-modification or other experiments you will discover new ways to weave and re-weave creation. In short, you are quite literally fated to be the axiom around which all worlds turn."
583,,800,Hextech,League of Legends ,Magitek,"You're an expert in the field of magical technology. By blending the two fields into one, Hextech accomplishes what neither field alone could. Using liquefied magic as fuel, Hextech can be used to create powerful death-lasers, transforming hammers, impossibly light weapons and aircraft, strength-augmenting bodysuits, the list goes on... Using this new, unlimited (and probably very volatile) power source, you can do just about anything so long as you build your devices sturdy enough to contain all that energy. Or don't, and watch it all explode in grandiose fashion. Whatever works!"
584,,900,YoRHa Design Specs ,Drakengard and Nier,Magitek,"You know what’s better than being a high-spec magitek android badass? Having your own army of high-spec magitex android badasses. Now you can build one. You know, provided you have the time and resources and the… Anyway, the point is that you’ve got the blueprints for every resource YoRHA has downloaded into your central processor/brain. This means that not only can you build each class of YoRHa android, including outdated models like the Attacker type, but also pods, the various YoRHa weapons, flight units and even the Bunker itself. With enough practice and creativity, you can even design your own android types, like an Infiltration-Type with a built in cloaking device or a Mage-Type capable of using magic without the aid of a pod. 

Of course, the hardest piece to produce are the Black Boxes required for Androids to run. Machine Cores are only available in Nier Universe after the aliens arrive and the Machine Wars begin, however you can substitute those for other materials. Obviously high-tech electronics would be best, but there are other options. You just need something capable of a human level of intelligence and emotional depth…

While we’re on that subject, or at least close by, YoRHa androids count as alive when it comes to magic and whether or not they have souls. If it walks like a human, talks like a human, feels despair like a human and goes insane like a human, it’s a human, at least as far as magic is concerned. They might be mechanical lifeforms but YoRHA androids are still alive.

585,,1000,Unknown Dictator,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"This one is a big mystery. It holds the abilities to manipulate iron, as well as control and create electronic devices of the modern era, and take the form of different types of electronic devices, created by the wielder. Not much is known about it, except that its power doesn’t fall behind when compared to the other ones in this list."
586,,1000,Leviathan,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"An Atlantean war machine that is well over 3,000 feet long and features destructive beams of energy that can shoot straight through the steel hulls of any ship or submarine on or under the sea, the Leviathan guards the trench leading into Atlantis from any and all who dare to sail its waters. Although only one may remain today, at one point in time Atlantis built their fleets around these massive, lobster- shaped machines... and it seems like you’ve somehow gotten your mitts on the Leviathan’s twin. Now, it is an instrument of your will- programmed to follow your instructions, with even the safeties preventing it from attacking those bearing Atlantean crystals turned off, should you wish it. You can feel free to determine your own parameters for how this Leviathan’s automated systems will operate, and direct it to attack or guard anything you wish. In this day and age, there’s no military force capable of really fighting this thing... and to think, it’s not even the weapon that sank Atlantis in the first place."
587,,1000,Atlantean Spear,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"Referred to as both Gungnir and the Spear of Destiny, this Atlantean relic may look like nothing special compared to the things you’ve seen earlier in this section aside from being an Atlantean weapon of carved stone, but appearances can be deceiving as the spear is tipped with a massive crystal- small compared to the Heart of Atlantis, but far larger than the the fragments that went into making the crystal necklaces. This has given it an even deeper connection to the Heart of Atlantis, allowing one to wield a fraction of the great crystal’s power at will. This gives it several abilities of note, including the ability to force large structures and their foundations, like a castle, to float in the air- as well as telekinesis on a lesser level that allows one to strip away tile flooring with ease to reveal a perilous drop. It can fire blasts of energy powerful enough to send a person flying, and can instantly melt ice- even preserving whatever was frozen inside of it in its original state before being frozen, allowing for the unfreezing of living beings. It can change sizes to better suit its bearer, as well; going from an ordinary spear to something as large as a tower when wielded by a giant. Speaking of- the last, most notable ability that the Atlantean Spear possesses is the ability to create vast giants out of certain materials. In his quest for Ragnarock, Erik Hellstrom created the powerful ice and fire giants he dubbed Ymir and Surtr, respectively, charging them with the destruction of the world. However, there’s one problem- these giants are capable of thought, and while they’re loyal to the one holding the spear, the spear... is a spear, and is thus something that might be taken away. Should no one possess it, it is highly likely that the giants will rebel, or even try to take the spear for themselves- which would obviously be pretty bad. Should it be reunited with the Heart of Atlantis, the spear would also give the Heart of Atlantis the power surge it needs to raise the city back from the bottom of the ocean. "
588,,1200,Egg of the World,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Singularities, that which make the existence of the City possible. Miracles beyond the limits of science, upon which countless citizens are sacrificed upon altars to maintain. You have obtained the understanding of certain sciences and reality bending theorems to manufacture one of your own. The technology you glean from this will start simple, perhaps as a method to create containers that are bigger on the inside. And yet, it is eager, almost alive (or possibly even literally so, like that of the L Corp before Lobotomy), With research seeing it expand and grow, happy to integrate new technology and exotic stimuli. Perhaps your expansion of space might develop into swords that can cut nearly anything,by simply creating space along the edge of the blade. Regardless of what precisely you make, it can be readily and relatively simply mass produced, or at least the end results can. 

However, the basic expansion and extreme eagerness to integrate technology of this strange and miraculous technology you’ve found pales in comparison to its thirst for blood and suffering. For the Wings of the World throw countless bodies into their everyday research, and it appears that your nature as a Jumper has crystallized that into a law for your own Singularity. Cruelty excites your insight into the strange mix of magic and technology you’ve found yourself the master of, causing it to grow entire new branches to follow down. Perhaps by unsafe experiments with unstable fields, you can make spaces where physical laws are altered. Or begin to expand time as well as space, inserting moments into the course of events. The greater the depravity, the more potent the end results, and if carried out on someone possessing their own supernatural powers, your singularity may grow its own mockeries of them, a blood fiend may see your fields become self sustaining by consuming the vitality of those within it, or that bring those within them under your thrall. Perhaps, with enough time and lives sacrificed on the altar, you might be able to create something that truly changes the face of the City, akin to Lobotomy Corporation’s Seed of Light plan. 

Finally, it appears that your origin title is no longer quite accurate. You’re no longer a mere employee of a Wing, instead being the head of one, other than A, B or C Corp. Countless employees are now yours to command, all dedicated to ensuring that your Singularity derived inventions are produced and distributed across the City. Truly desperate to keep the high standards of living in a Wing for them and their families, they’ll do practically anything for you,"
